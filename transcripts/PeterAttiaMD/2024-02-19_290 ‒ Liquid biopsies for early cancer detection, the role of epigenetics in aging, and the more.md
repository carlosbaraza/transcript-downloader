Alex Aravanis is a leader in research and development of technologies and clinical tests utilizing the latest tools in DNA analysis and data science. In this episode, Alex delves into two interconnected topics: liquid biopsies and epigenetics. He begins by tracing the trajectory of genome sequencing and tumor sequencing, setting the stage for a detailed exploration of liquid biopsies as an early cancer detection method. The discussion encompasses key concepts such as cell-free DNA, DNA methylation, sensitivity, specificity, and the predictive values associated with liquid biopsies. Transitioning to epigenetics, Alex examines the intricate interplay of DNA methylation and aging biology and explores the possibility of using cellular reprogramming to reverse epigenetic changes that occur with aging.

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA hey Alex great to be sitting down with you here today I kind of wish we were doing this in person it's uh guess we haven't seen each other in person in a few months and even that was sort of a chance meeting so um I guess by way of background you know you and I go back over 20 years now I guess it's 25 years that we both started med school together it's hard to believe it's been that long huh yeah yeah know seems like a million years ago but but also seems like yesterday uh yeah those were good times

[00:00:40] Alex you know I one of the things I remember when we first met was that we pretty much clicked over the fact that we were both Engineers coming in and and we had a good group of friends that I remember in medical school and the one thing we had in common is not one of us was a Premed we were all kind of you know whatever the term was they Ed to describe as non-traditional path to medical school um so let's talk a little bit about just you know briefly your your background you know you so you you came in as an electrical engineer and then you did a

[00:01:08] PhD in in a in a in a lab of a very prominent Scientist by the name of Dick Chen um maybe tell folks a little bit about what you did in that work and what it was that got you you know excited enough about science to to deviate off the the traditional MD path yeah so uh so as you said um uh my PhD was in electrical engineering um and Stanford you know has a cool configuration on the campus where the engineering school is literally across the street from the medical school and so over time I became more and more interested in uh applying you know signal processing techniques circuit design Imaging AI things like that but the problems in medicine that were more interesting to me than uh some of the you know traditional engineering products and things like that and uh um met a world famous neuroscientist name as you mentioned uh dip Chen uh who's very interested in fundamental questions about the quantum unit of communication in the brain which which is the individual synaptic vesicle and there was a question of just you know what did it look like and how did it operate and um it was the beginning for me of just applying these engineering tools to really important questions in biology and helping answer them that first story was a was a great um article in nature where we you know definitively answered the question of how that Quantum is uh is transmitted between cells um and then went on to do several other projects like that can you say a little bit about that how is that information transmitted it was really fun to come with these problems with an engineering and

[00:02:43] Communications background um but you know like if you look at a central neuron on the brain um and you look at the rate at which uh you know information is transferred uh it seemed to be much faster than the number of synaptic vesicles in the terminal right so there was this well there's only 30 synaptics vesicles in the terminal by like an electron microscope yet you know you're seeing you know hundreds of

[00:03:09] Transmissions you know over a few seconds so how is that possible um and there were various theories um there was an individual vesicle that was fusing and stain fused and pumping neurotransmitter through it without collapsing and that's how you could get these you know so much more rapid Puffs and and we we came up with a cute term which was called kissing run to to explain phenomenon and it again helped answer this fundamental question of how did the brain gets so many small neurons yet able to transmit so much uh information per per individual connection so Alex if you think about all the things that you learned during your PhD um I mean I guess one of the benefits of doing it where you did it in the lab you did it in was you overlapped with some other really thoughtful folks including a previous guest on the podcast Carl desero um what do you think were the most important things you learned philosophically um not necessarily technically that are serving you in the stuff we're going to talk about today so we're going to talk today a lot about liquid biopsies we're going to talk a lot about epigenetics um we're going to talk a lot about certainly technologies that have made those things possible um and when you you think back to your background in dou E what were the transferable skills so I think one of them is saying in engineering which is if if you can't build it you don't understand it right so simply understanding a description of something is not the same as you can build it up from scratch and so you can't always do that in biology but you can do experiments where you're testing the concept of can I really make it work um and so I think that was an engineering concept that served me well a lot um uh you know another it's not exclusive to engineering but was being very first principled right um you know do we really understand how this works um in that particular lab um there's a big emphasis on you know doing experiments where you always learn something right um where you know regardless of whether or not it confirmed or rejected your hypothesis um you learn something new about the system don't do experiments where you know you may just not learning anything um and so that that was a very uh kind of powerful way to think about things so we'll fast forward a bit just for the sake of time there's obviously an interesting detour where after I go off to residency and after you finish your PhD we still find ourselves back together side by side in the same company for four years um which again brought many funny stories including my favorite is you and I getting lost in the middle of Texas actually not in the middle of Texas but just outside of El Paso and nearly running out of gas I mean this was no cell signal we uh we were we were in trouble but we somehow made it out of that one together yes yeah know I remember that that uh us Californians thought that there must be a Starbucks within you know 10 15 miles out in the middle of West Texas and it turns out you can go hundreds of miles with that

[00:06:27] Starbucks that's right passing a gas station with an eighth of a tank saying we'll stop at the next one can be a strategic error uh there was also the time you bailed me out when I forgot my cuff links because you had some dental floss do you remember that oh I don't know if you remember that you yeah you had some dental floss that's right yeah total magy removed but anyway let's let's fast forward to all that stuff so um I don't know what year it is it's got to be

[00:06:57] Circa what 2012 when do you end up at alumina for the first time uh early 2013 okay talk to me about that role what what was it that you were recruited to alumina to do and maybe just tell folks who don't know what alumina is a little bit about the company as well yeah so today um alumina uh is the largest maker of DNA sequencing Technologies right so when you hear about the human genome being sequenced um you know know uh things like you know expression data orn seek um most liquid biopsies most you know tumor sequencing finding um you know genetic variance and in kids with rare disease most of that is done with alumina technology um so they also make the chemistries that process the DNA the sequencers that generate that information and also the software that helps uh analyze it so um uh really took that tool from a very niche resarch technology to uh standard of care and medicine and uh you know hundreds of thousands of Publications and tremendously ADV has been advancing science yeah so 11 years ago you showed up there what was the role you were cast in this was earlier on in luminous history um What attracted me to the company and and why I was recruited was to help help develop more clinical applications and more applied applications of the technology so the technology had uh a use by kind of um certain sequencing eff ficient AOS for for basic research um but the company and I agreed with the vision felt that hey this could be used for a lot more this could be used to help every cancer patient right um uh this could be used to help people with genetic diseases um how can we develop the technology and other aspects of it the assays and softwares to make that a reality um and so I I was hired to do that you know it occurred to me when you even said a little bit of that Alex that many of us uh you know you and I would take for granted some of the lingo involved here sequencing and and and you know what's involved but I I still think it might be a bit of a black box to some people listening and given the the the the topics we're going to cover today I

[00:09:23] I think just explaining to people you know for example what was done in the late '90s early 2000 when quote unquote the human genome was sequenced what does that mean and how had that changed from the very first time it was done by sure you know sheer brute force in the most analog way until even when you arrived um you know 10 11 years ago so so maybe walk us through what it actually means to to sequence a genome and and feel free to also throw in a little bit of background about you know some of the basics of DNA and the structure Etc as it pertains to that yeah yeah um no it's it's really important fundamental stuff um so yeah so quick quick primer on uh you know human genetics so you know in most cells of the body you know uh you have 23 pairs of chromosomes um they're very similar except the X and Y chromosome which are obviously uh different in in men and women um if you were you know each one of those uh chromosomes right right is actually a lot of DNA packed together in a very orderly way um where the DNA is wrapped around CH you know proteins called um nucleosomes which are composed of histones and then it's packed into something called chromatin which is this mass of DNA and proteins and again pack together and then you make these units of chromosomes now if you were to unwind all of those um chromosomes right like a you know pull the the string on the sweater and completely unwind it and you were to line all of them kind of end to end right um You would have 3 billion individual bases right so the the atcg code right at any given of the one of those three billion positions you would have a string of letters um uh you know each one would either be ATC or G and it would be three billion long so to sequence uh whole human genome is to read out that code for an individual right and once you do that you then know the their particular code at um you know each of those uh positions um so um you know you know uh at the end of the last century um that was considered a quite a daunting task but uh you know as I think our country has has often done decided that it was a very worthy one to do uh along with several other um kind of leading uh know countries that believe strongly in science and so so they funded the Human

[00:12:00] Genome Project so all over the world at centers people were trying to sequence bits of this three billion uh basis to comprise the first human um complete Human Genome um uh so it's just quite famous there were two efforts one was a public effort led by the NIH uh and Francis Collin at the time um and um they had a particular approach where what they were doing was they were cutting out large um sections of the Gen uh and then um using a uh an older type of sequencing me method called um capillary electroforesis to sequence um each of those individual bases um uh there was a private effort um led by

[00:12:44] Craig Venter um and a company called Cera um which took a very different approach which is they cut up the genome into much much smaller pieces um pieces that were so small that you know you didn't necessarily know a prior what part of the genome they could they they would come from which is why they were doing this longer more laborious process through the public effort um but they there was a big innovation which is they realized that if you had enough of these fragments you could using a mathematical technique reconstruct it from these individual pieces right where you could take individual pieces looked at where they overlap and again we're talking about billions of fragments here and you can imagine mathematically reconstructing that um very computationally intensive very complex but the benefit of that is that you could generate the data much much faster and so um in a fraction of the time and for a fraction of the money they actually caught up to the public effort and then culminated in um each having a um a draft of the human genome around the same time in um late 2000 early 2001 and then simultaneously in Nature and

[00:13:54] Science we got the first draft of a human genome uh you know a milest in in in science and Alex what were the approximate lengths of the fragments that Solera was um breaking DNA down into yeah um so they were taking chunks out in individual like Mega bases so like a um you know a million um bases at a time and then they would isolate that and then deconstructed even just smaller pieces um which were kilobase uh fragments so um a th000 bases at a time and again so they would kind of take a piece of the puzzle um but they would know which piece it was and then break that into smaller and smaller ones and then after you had the one kilobase sequences they would put it all back together versus um just a contrast that with the private effort which they called shotgun sequencing which is you just you know took the whole thing rounded up brute force sequenced it and then Ed the informatics to figure out what went where and in the shotgun how small were they broken down into they got down to um uh you know kilobase and 100 Bas uh you know multi 100base fragments um uh but the key was all you had to do was just Brute Force keep sequencing as opposed to this more artisinal approach of trying to take individual pieces and deconstruct them and then reconstruct them so it's early 2001 this gets published by the way do we know the identity of the individual I think we do know the identity of the individual who is sequenced don't we I I can't recall uh I think the original one was uh is still Anonymous and and likely to be a composite of of multiple individuals just because of the amount of DNA soon after yeah soon after there were individuals so Craig ventner um you know uh you know public he was one of the he may have been the first you know individual who is named that we have the genome for got it it's often been said

[00:15:59] Alex that that effort um cost about like at the end of that sequencing if you decided I want to now do one more person it would cost a billion dollars directionally to do that effort so what was the state-ofthe-art in transitioning that from where it was let's just say order of magnitude $10 to the9 per sequence to where it was 10 years later approximately what was what was the technology introduction or plural version of that question that led to a reduction and um how many logs did it improve by yes so the the number that and we went back and did this analysis so if you literally at the end of the original Human Genome said hey I want to do one more and you have the benefit of all the learnings right from from the previous one uh a few hundred million dollar um would have been incremental genome got it by um 201 12 it was you know on the order of low tens of thousands of dollars right so um uh you know let's call that you know four you know four or five logs of improvement and what brought that so the day you show up at alumina and it's you know if if for research purposes or if you know a very wealthy individual said

[00:17:28] I have to know my my whole genome sequence and they were willing to pay $25,000 for it or a lab was doing it as part of you know a clinical trial or for research um what were they buying from alumina to make that happen yeah yeah so it was a series of inventions that allow the sequencing reactions to be miniaturized um and then you could do you know orders of magnitude more sequencing uh of of DNA by miniaturizing it um and so um you know the older sequencers they had a small glass tube and as the DNA went through you sequenced it um it got converted into a 2d format kind of like a glass slide where you had tiny um fragments of DNA stuck to it you know um hundreds of millions then ultimately billions and then you sequenced all of them simultaneously so there was a huge miniaturization of um each individual sequencing reaction which allowed you to just you know in one system generate many many more um DNA sequences at the same time um you know uh there's a very important chemistry that was developed called sequencing by by synthesis uh by a a Cambridge chemist uh uh who I know well Shankar Bala suam Manan and he developed aluminous sequence in chemistry which um which ultimate went through a company called Celexa which alumina required um and that has generated the world the majority of the world's genome data um the original chemistry that uh he developed in Cambridge and what was it about that chemistry that was such a step forward it allowed you to to miniaturize um the sequencing reactions um so you could have a huge number ultimately billions in a in a very small glass slide it also allowed you to do something um uh which is called cyclic sequencing uh in a very precise uh and efficient and fast way where you read off one base at a time uh and you can control it and so you imagine you have say a lawn of a billion DNA fragments and you're on base three on every single fragment and you want to know what base four is on every fragment it allowed you to simultaneously sequence just one more base on all billion fragments read it out across your whole lawn and then um once you read it out add one more base read it all out um and so this allowed for this huge parallelization so let's talk a little bit about where we are today to my recollection the last time I looked to sequence uh to do a whole genome sequence today is on the order of $1,000 500 to a th000 is that about accurate yeah that's way too expensive uh Peter um today couple hundred dollar yeah wow okay so a couple hundred dollars today and

[00:20:29] I I feel like I looked at this on a graph a while ago and it was one of the few things I noticed that was improving faster than Moore's Law um maybe tell folks what Mo's law is why it's often talked about I think everybody's heard of it um and and maybe talk about the the step function that sort of it's basically if I'm looking at it correctly there were two Mo's laws but there was something in between that sort of became even a bigger imp Improvement but but maybe tell folks what what what Mo's law is first of all yeah yeah so it's it's it's not like a law like the a law of physics or something like that but it what became an industry Trend in microprocessors and and what it refers to is the density of um transistors uh you know on a microchip right um and um the cost of the amount of computing power um for for amount of transistors and that geometrically decreased um kind of in a steady way um actually don't remember the exact number if it's like doubling every you know two years or something like that but there was a a geometric factor to it that the industry followed for for decades um you know it's not quite following that anymore I mean transistors are getting down to like you know the atomic scale but um you know went way faster than than people had had uh had envisioned yeah I mean it's B basically it basically started in the late 60s and as you said it went until it hits the limits of atomic chemistry yeah and so that that

[00:22:07] Relentless push is is what made uh you know you know you know the whole software engineering Hightech industry possible so back to my question which is if you just look at the cost of sequencing from 2000 till today it's sort of like two curves right there's like the the Relentless curve that you know we gets to where we are in 20133 but then there was another big drop in price that occurred after that and and

[00:22:36] I'm I'm guessing that had to do with shotgun sequencing or the commercialization of it I mean not the concept of it which already existed but is that does does that does that sound right yeah so um so really starting so when alumina really started to deliver um uh the higher throughput Next Generation sequencings it it brought along a a new uh a new faster curve um because of the miniaturizations right so this ability to sequence billions of fragments in a small area um and alumin just contined to and you know I I was privileged to be a big part of this uh this effort um continuing to drive the density down the speed of the chemistry up um all the associated Optics uh engineering software around it um you know drove that much much faster than mors law reduction in cost and so how many were other companies is involved in the uh the culmination of nextg sequencing yeah many um and some of them are still around um uh you know none nearly as successful as alumina but uh you know also some important players there yeah and today that's the industry standard I assume there's no sequencing that's going on that that isn't

[00:23:50] NextGen no the vast majority is is nextg sequencing um you know there's Niche applications um uh where there's other approaches but in yeah the 99% of the data being generated is some version of Next Generation sequencing you mentioned a moment ago that part of the effort to bring you to alumina was um you know presumably based on not just your um your innate talents but also the fact that you came from a somewhat clinical background as well you're an MD and a

[00:24:22] PhD and if their desire is to be able to Branch out into clinical applications that that would make for a fit so where in that Journey did the idea of liquid biopsies come up and you know maybe talk a little bit about the history of of one of the companies in that space that we're going to talk about today yeah yeah so to start with that should talk about first um Tor sequencing right which predated liquid biopsy and so um uh a couple companies most notably Foundation medicine um developed a using alumin technology developed tumor sequencing right um so there had been some academic work but they tried to develop it and we the first to do it successfully as a as a clinical uh as a clinical product and um so what you can imagine is you know there's these genes that are implicated in cancer that often get mutated um they're you know knowing which mutations a tumor has has big implications for prognosis but also for treatment right so um over time we have more and more targeted therapies where you know um uh you know if your tumor has a very particular mutation um you know it's more likely to respond to to certain drugs that Target that type of um tumor um and at the time uh as you know more and more of these mutations were identified that could be important in the treatment of a tumor it was becoming um impractical to say do a

[00:25:51] PCR test for Every mutation right so imagine there's 100 potential mutations you'd like to know about uh if a patient has in their you know in their tumor and their lung cancer um you know doing each of these individually again a lot of expensive um expense a lot of false positives and so um what companies like

[00:26:11] Foundation met is say hey why don't we just sequence all of those positions at once given Next Generation sequencing so um so they would make a panel to sequence say 500 genes or a few hundred genes the ones that are most important uh in in um in most solid cancer and then they would sequence them and then in one test they would see the vast majority of the potential uh mutations that could be relevant to treat treatment for that um for that cancer patient um and so that is still a a very important tool in in oncology today um a large fraction of tumors are sequenced and that's what allows people to get you know um access to many types of drugs right um um you know many of the targeted um uh uh therapies for lung cancer melanoma or you hear about things like you know micro satellite instability or high mutational burden that all comes from you know tumor sequencing um now um in you know so once that was established then uh a few folks most notably at um at John's Hopkins but also other places started to ask the question well you know could we could we sequence the tumor from the blood right and you might say well hey you have a tumor in your lung why would sequencing you know the blood be relevant to looking at the tumor well it it turns out um there is tumor DNA in the blood and you know this is interesting so in the late 40s um it was first identified that there was DNA in the blood outside of cells socalled cell-free DNA um and then in the 70s it was noticed that um cancer patients had a lot of DNA uh outside their cells in the blood and that some of this you know was likely uh from tumors right from the cancer itself right and um if you know anything about tumor biology you know that cancer cells are constantly dying right so you think of cancers as growing very quickly and that's true but they actually um are dying at an incredible rate because it's disordered growth right so many of the cells that divide or you know have all kinds of genomic problems so they die or they're cut off from vasculature so um but the crazy thing about a tumor is yes it's it's growing in you know fast if it's an aggressive tumor but also the amount of cell death um within that tumor is just uh you know is very high and every time one of those cells die um some of the

[00:28:43] DNA has the potential to get into the bloodstream and so it was this Insight along with the tumor sequencing that said you know hey what if we sequence this self-free DNA could we end up sequencing some of the tumor DNA or the the cancer cell DNA that's in circulation um and so um early early results particular from um uh this group at Johns Hopkins um began to show that indeed that was possible um and uh and then a few companies again using alumina technology and then we started doing it at alumina also our own liquid biopsy um assays and tests and Technologies um developed what what became liquid biopsy um in this context it was for late stage cancer so it was for patients who diagnosed with a cancer you wanted to know did their tumor have mutations and you could do it from the blood um there was a big benefit which was you know as you know for for lung cancer taking a biopsy can be a very dangerous proposition right um You can cause a pneumothorax you can you know you know someone land someone in the ICU you you can have you know in rare cases you know um uh you know can lead to death in that type of procedure and so the ability to you know get the mutational profile from the blood um was really attractive and so that started many companies um down the road of developing these liquid biopsies for late stage cancers let's talk about a couple things there uh tell me the typical length of a cell-free DNA fragment how many base pairs or what's the range it depends on the exact context but around 160 base pairs right so that's you know 160 letters of the atcg code um and there's a very particular reason it's that length which is that um again if you you know pull the string on the sweater you unwind the um uh the chromosome right and you keep doing it till you get down to something around 160 base pairs um what you find is that the DNA right it's not just naked it's wrapped around something called a nucleome which is um an octomer or eight of these histone um proteins in a in a cube and the DNA is wrapped around it twice and that's the smallest unit um of Chromatin you know of the you know of this larger chromosome structure and so the reason it's 160 bases is that's more or less the geometry of going around um twice and so um DNA can be cleaved by enzymes in the blood but that nucleosome protects um the DNA from being cut to anything smaller than about 160 base pairs and does that mean that the cellfree DNA that is um found in the blood is still wrapped around the nucleosome twice like it's it's still clinging to that and that's what's protecting it from being cleaved any smaller that's right you mentioned that obviously the first application of this was presumably looking for ways to you know figure out what the mutation was of a a person with late stage cancer without requiring a tissue biopsy presumably by this point it was very easy to gather you know hundreds of60 base pair of fragments and use the same sort of mathematics to reassemble them based on the few overlaps to say this is the actual sequence because presumably the genes are much longer than 160 base pairs that they're looking at that's right so by this point um in um yeah 20 you know uh 2014 2015 um the informatics was quite sophisticated so um you know you could take um a large number of DNA sequences from fragments and easily determine you know which Gene it was associated with and at some point

[00:32:54] I recall in here and and I had a discussion on the podast maybe a year and a half ago two years ago with Max Dean another one of our med school classmates about looking at recurrences in patients who were clinically free of disease so you took a patient who's had a reection plus or minus some adant chemotherapy and to the naked eye and to the radiograph they appear free of disease and the question becomes you know is that cancer recurring and the sooner we can find out the better our chance at treating them systemically again because it's a pretty wellestablished fact in oncology that the lower the burden of tumor the better the response the lower the mutations the less escapes Etc and so did that kind of become the next iteration of this technology which was if we know the sequence of the tumor can we go fishing for that particular tumor in the in the cellfree DNA broadly speaking there's kind of three applications for for looking at tumor DNA in the blood one is screening which which we'll talk about later which is you know people who don't have cancer or 99% who don't and trying to find the individual who has cancer and invasive cancer but doesn't know it um there's this application of what we call therapy selection which is you're a cancer patient trying to decide which which targeted therapy would be best for you and then you're this other one you mentioned is a third application we call um often minimal residual disease we looking at um uh monitoring or response which is you're undergoing treatment and you want to know is the amount of tumor

[00:34:40] DNA in the blood you know undetectable it is it you know and also its velocity is it changing because as you mention that could tell you um is your treatment working the tumor DNA burden or load is going down um is it undetectable and you're potentially Cur that there's no longer that a source of tumor DNA in your body um or you know is it present even after a a um uh you know a treatment with intent to to cure and that the presence of that tumor DNA still means basically um and we appreciate this now um unfortunately you have not been cured or that patient hasn't been cured because there is some nidus of tissue somewhere that still

[00:35:25] Harbors these mutations and therefore is the tumor even if it's not detectable by any other means so at what point does this company called Grail that we're going to talk about at what point does it come into existence and what was the impetus and motivation for that as a distinct entity outside of alumina there were several um kind of technological and scientific insights that that came together along with with as often in this case um some really um bold um entrepreneurs and and investors um so um you know the the use of this liquid biopsy technology and late stage cancers um you know it was clearly possible to sequence tumors from the blood um uh and and it was clearly actually the tumor

[00:36:23] DNA and it was useful for for cancer patients um so knew that you know there was tumor DNA we knew it could be done um but what the field didn't know is you know could you to see this in early stage cancers right it's you know localized cancers that were small um not a lot of data on that but you know clearly there there was the potential um there was also a really interesting incidental uh set of findings in a completely different application called non-invasive prenatal testing so um again totally different application but um uh you know it was discovered um you know principally by a um a scientist in

[00:37:05] Hong Kong named Dennis low that um you could see fetal DNA in the blood or more specifically placental DNA uh in the blood and it was also cell-free DNA and um what he developed actually along with um uh you know one of our professors at at Stanford Steve Quake was a technique to look for tromis In The Blood based on this placental or fetal DNA and this is called non-invasive prenatal testing and so what you do is you sequence the cell prna fragments in um uh in a pregnant woman um you look at the DNA and if you see extra DNA for example at you know the position of chromosome 21 well that indicates that there are you know there's tissues in in the woman you know presumably the fetus or placenta that's giving off um extra chromosome 21 and so this ended up being an incredibly um sensitive and specific way to test for you know uh the presence of tromis you know chromosome 211 18113 early uh in in pregnancy and you know it's it's had a tremendous impact um I was also involved in in subsequent iterations of the test in the United

[00:38:23] States it decreased amous Andis by about 80% because the test is so so sensitive and specific um as a screen that um you know many many women have now you know not had to undergo you know amniocentesis and and the risks around them so um again totally different application of self-free DNA um but what happened is um during the early commercialization of about the first few hundred tests um uh the companies pioneering this and one of them was a company called verada uh that alumina acquired began began to see um in rare cases very unusual um DNA patterns um where they it wasn't just a chromosome 21 or 18 or 13 but you know what's often called Chromo um tripis um which is um many many um admirations across uh the chromosomes right um and mo the woman um the two women who really um did this an analy analysis and um really brought both alumina and the world's attention to it were Meredith Hawk Miller a pathologist and um uh and lab director at at this uh alumina owned company verinata and another bioinformatics um scientist Daria chudova and um what they showed is ultimately that uh these women actually had cancer um and so they were getting they were young you know you know women of um childbearing age um there was ultimately they ultimately had healthy children um but they had an invasive cancer and it was being diagnosed in their self- RNA by this non-invasive prenatal test um and you know as they began to show these patterns to people it became you know clear that they were clearly cancer right so again you know um you know um you know uh if you have many many chromosomes that are abnormal that's just not compatible with Life right or a right um and so when you saw this just genomewide um uh chromosomal changes uh it was very clear that um you know these were in you know incidentally finding cancer in these women so anyway Alex let's let's let's talk a little bit about that actually because I want to dig into that so it's so interesting um so let's take a step back so again whenever you say we're sampling for cell-free DNA we should all be keeping in the back of our mind we're looking for these teeny tiny little 160 base base parap fragments wrapped around little nucleosomes now when let's just go back to the initial use case around triom 21 with 160 base pairs is that sufficient to identify any one chromosome I mean presumably you're also sampling maternal blood so you know what the maternal chromosomes look like and you're presumably juxtaposing those two as you're control is that I assume that that's part of it no it's a not quite so it's all mixed together so in a in a in a pregnant woman's blood and the maternal blood it's a mixture right so you have self-free DNA from you know the majority of the self-free DNA is from her her own cells and tissues um and then you have um superimposed on that a bit of cell-free DNA from Mostly the placenta um and so what you're seeing is this mix of self-free DNA and so um uh and then what you do is you sequence there's different ways to do it but the most common ways you know you do shotgun sequencing and you sequence millions of of these fragments and every time you sequence a fragment you place it in a chromosome based on its sequence you have you know your first fragment you say hey when I compare this to the draft

[00:42:20] Human Genome this goes on chromosome 2 and then you you sequence your SEC you know third fragment and you say Hey you know this SE quence looks like chromosome 14 and you keep kind of putting them in the chromosome buckets and what you expect you know if if every tissue in is is um has an even chromosome distribution you know or two chromosomes is that that profile would be flat and each bucket would be about the same level um but what you see in um a woman carrying a a fetus that has a triom you'll see you'll see 50% greater in the chromosome 21 bucket yeah yeah you you actually see more like five or 10% because again remember 90% of it might be maternal blood right so that's all going to be even but within the 10% fetal right that's going to be um you're

[00:43:11] G to have an extra 50% so so the total might be exra 5% whatever 10% um but that's EAS very but that's a whopping big signal and very easy to detect is isn't it interesting it just gives a sense of how large the numbers are if a 5% Delta is in off the charts unmistakable increase in significance I want to make sure again people understand what you just said cuz it's it's very important because the majority of the cell-free DNA belongs to the mother and because the fetal placental self-free DNA is a trivial amount even though by definition a triom means there is 50% more of one chromosome you've gone from two to three copies in the fully diluted sample that might only translate to a few percent but that's enough given the large numbers that you're testing to be a definitive statistically significant difference that triggers a positive test y uh well put yes Alex let's talk a little bit about some of the I want to come back to the story because this is clearly the beginning of the story um but let let's come back to just a couple other housekeeping items you know a moment ago we talked about self-free DNA in the context of tumor someone might be listening to us thinking wait guys you just said that the majority of the cell-free DNA is from this mother 99.9% of the time she doesn't have cancer where is that cell-free DNA coming from again you know uh when cells um are destroyed right either through necrosis or apoptosis or just you know there's a lot of cell turnover right of cells that replicate right especially epithelial cells blood cells uh and so on um um as those again as the kind of natural biochemistry destroys them some of the DNA from the nucleus ends up in circulation right uh again in these uh where they're wrapped around these nucleosomes so it's essentially um you know cell death and cell turnover is the source of it and since you know again at any one time there's you know millions of cells dying and being turned over there's always um some some base level cell-free DNA in the blood and again I don't know if you've ever done the calculation if not

[00:45:25] I don't mean to put you on the SP but do you have an approximate guess for how many base pairs of cell-free DNA are floating around your body or my body as we sit here right now so what I can say is if you took uh a 10 m blood tube right which is a lot of what these you these test use right and you remove all the cellular DNA remember there's a there's a ton of DNA in the cells in C sure the white blood cells the red blood cells Etc get get rid of all that yep huge huge amount um you know you probably have on the order of a few thousand cells worth of cell-free DNA in a 10 mil blood tube um which which isn't a lot hang on that that's just to make sure I understand you you're saying a few thousand cells worth with where each cell would be three billion base pairs yes yes wow I mean on the one hand it doesn't sound like a lot because there are billions of cells on the other hand it still sounds like a lot I mean that's that's still a big computational problem where it becomes challenging is is when we get into early detection right where if you think about it um for any position in the genome right you only have you say um a few thousand representations of it because there's only a few thousand cells and so that SS to limit your ability to detect you know events that occur at you know one in a million or one in 100 thousand so Alex do you recall these um incident cases of the pregnant mothers who ultimately through this and again I guess we should probably go back and re explain that because it's such an important and profound

[00:47:11] Discovery there were a handful of cases where in the process of screening for tromis they're discovering not that the mother has additional chromosomes that can be attributed to the fetus but she has significant mutations across a number of genes that also are probably showing up in relatively small amounts because they're not in all of her cells is that is that correct yeah yeah uh which is you you could so you might expect a flat pattern right in the majority of cases um or you know what um uh when the fetus has a triom you see these very well-known um accumulations mostly in 21 but occasionally in 18 or 13 y um and instead what you see is um just increases and decreases monosomies and tromis across many many chromosomes right which is just not compatible with you know uh life even as a fetus um and so but there is a um a biology where you do see these you know tremendous changes in the chromosomes and that's often in the case of cancer um many many cancers and and do do you recall what those cancers turned out to be in those young women I mean I assume they were breast cancers but they could have been lung cancers anything yeah so Meredith and and Daria they published a paper in Jam which um for anyone interested which details these um 10 or so cases uh and what happened and in each of them it was a mix um I think there was a neuroendocrine um uterine some GI cancers um it was a smattering of different things and what was the approximate year of that we'll try to find that paper and link to it in the show notes 2015 it was 2015 in jamama got it I mean that seems unbelievable of course one doesn't know the contrapositive one doesn't know how many women had cancer but weren't captured but is it safe to assume that the 10 who were identified all had cancer yes yes so so there were no false positives we just don't know how many false negatives there were right yeah so this is one of the the things that kind of contributed to the to the uh evidence that cancer screening uh might be possible using self- fre DNA which is these incidental findings as I mentioned earlier you know we already knew that yes tumors do put self- pre DNA um into the blood string but this was a profound demonstration that um uh you know in in ual clinical practice you could find undiagnosed Cancers and asymptomatic individuals um and that it was highly specific meaning that when when it was found using this method um you know it it almost well I think in those initial ones it was every case but almost every case turned out to have cancer right now to your point it's not a screening test right because you know even in relatively healthy and and you know women of childbearing age um you know a population of 100,000 you know uh you know you expect epidemiologically you know 10 times or so or 50 times that number of cancers right you know over a year or so so um you know clearly you're missing the majority of of cancer so it's not a screening test right it was just a proof of concept though yeah but it was U an inadvertent proof of concept that really rais that alumina and I think in the field our attention of hey uh using self-free DNA and sequencing be based methods it might be possible to develop a a uh a very specific test for cancer so what was the next step in the process of um systematically going after addressing this problem so uh myself and and some other folks at alumina along with uh with the two two scientists I mentioned maredith and and Daria um and then also in particular the the CMO at the time um uh Rick clausner um who had a very long history in in cancer research um and in cancer screening he was the previous NCI director uh uh under Bill Clinton so that's the

[00:51:39] National Cancer Institute at the NIH um under Bill Clinton and he was the CMO at Aluma at the time and we started to talk more and more about you know um you know what would it take uh to develop or you know determine the feasibility of a universal blood test for cancer based on this self-free DNA technology um and you know being very first principal I I really asked the question why is it in you know 50 years of many companies and a tremendous amount of academic research no one had ever developed a a broad-based blood test for cancer you know not just many cancers you know let alone any cancer and really the only example is um PSA and again the false positive rates there um are so high that its benefit to harm has has you know been questioned many times and and that's why it's no longer you know um you know doesn't have a uspstf um grade

[00:52:36] A or B anymore um uh and the fundamental reason is specificity so um there's lots of things that are sensitive meaning that there are proteins that accumulate um biochemistries metabolites that go up in cancer um but the problem is they go up in a lot of benign conditions right so you know a big benign prostate spews out a lot of

[00:52:59] PSA um uh and pretty much every other protein or metabolite does that and so what you know the biomarkers to date were all very sensitive but all had false positive rates of you know say five or 10% and so if you're imagining screening you know the whole population you can't be working up one of 10 people for a potential cancer and so the key technological thing to solve was well how do you have something that has a 1% false positive rate or a half percent false positive rate because that's what you need to get to if you want to do broad-based cancer screening and relatively healthy asymptomatic people and this is why um we thought it might be possible with cell-free DNA because the tumor DNA could be more specific right than um proteins and other things that are you know are common in in benign disease and so that that was the reason to believe um the things we didn't know is well how much DNA does a early stage tumor pump out if it doesn't pump out any well there's there's nothing to detect the other is the heterogeneity right um cancer is not like infectious disease or where you know you know there's one very identifying antigen or sequence right every tumor is is truly unique right so even two lung cancers that're both the same histological subtype right they can share very few mutations or none right so you can have two squamous cell lung cancers that you know honestly don't have a single um shared mutation so now you need to look at you know hundreds or thousands or even of millions of positions to see enough potential changes and this is where again

[00:54:44] NGS um was a really good fit which is how do you overcome the heterogeneity that you need to Now look for a disease that isn't defined I can't tell you these three mutations are the ones you need to find for this cancer no there's you know a huge um set of different ones for every Cancer and then that got us thinking well look in addition to sequencing many positions and sequencing very deeply and using self-free DNA um we were going to need to use AI or machine learning um because um we had to learn these complex associations and patterns that um you know no human being could curate thousands and of um you know different mutational profiles and try to find the common signals and so on and so what what what emerged over the course of a year is um look this might be possible but we're going to have to enroll very large populations just to study and find the the the the signals and develop the technology and then we're going to need you know very large studies to actually you know do interventions and prove prove it clinically valid that that it actually works uh we're going to have to use NGS and sequence you know broadly across the whole genome uh and only then might it be possible um and so the company at the time you know uh you know decided and this was a board level decision that you know ultimately um this made more sense as an independent company given um the amount of capital that was going to be required given the scientific and Technical risk um given the kind of people that you would need to recruit uh who are passionate about this that um it made sense to do as a a separate company and so the CEO at the time Jay Flatley and early 2016 you know announced the founding of the company and and spinning it out of alumina and I was um I had the honor of being one of the co-founders of it so let's go back to 2016 you guys are

[00:56:51] Now setting up new shop you've got this new company it's called Grail you've brought over some folks like you um from alumina and presumably you're now also recruiting what is the sequence of the first two or three problems you immediately get to work on you know I I so I wrote the the the uh the starting research and development plan and um the way I wrote it was um you know we needed to evaluate um every potential feature in self-free DNA me meaning that um any known method of looking for cancer and cell-free DNA we needed to evaluate that if we were going to do this um and recruit these these cohorts and all these altruistic individuals and we were going to spend the money to do this we needed to not look at just one method or someone's favorite method or whatever they they thought might work we needed to look at every single one and so that's what we did we developed an assay and software for mutations for and then a bunch of other things chromosomal changes ch in the fragment size and and many others and we said look we're going to test each one of these head to-head and we're going to test them in combination and we're going to figure out the best way to do this um and um you know we even had a a mantra that that um uh that Rick came up with that I thought was very helpful which is we're either going to figure out how to do this or we're going to prove it can't be done um and so I think that was very helpful in thinking about how to do these initial experiments so it was a lot of building these assays um and then um we needed a massive data sets to train the machine learning algorithm so we had the study called the ccga the circulating self-re genome Atlas where we recruited 15,000 individuals um with and without cancer of every major cancer type um in most cases you know um hundreds um and then we did uh and then we tested all of these different U methods um the ones I mentioned and and also importantly a methylation based assay and we did blinded studies uh to compare them and see could any of them detect a large fraction of the cancers did any of them have the potential to do it at high specificity because that's what we would need if we were going to De develop a a universal test for cancer that could be used in a broad population so let's kind of go back and talk about a few of those things there because there was there's a lot there so you set up from look we're going to make sure that any measurable property of cellfree DNA we are measuring we are quantifying it we are noting it and so we talked about some of them right so fragment length that seems relatively fixed but presumably at large enough data set uh or sample size rather you're going to see some variation there does that matter um the actual genetic sequence of course that's that that's your bread and butter to be able to measure that um you also mentioned of course something called methylation which we haven't really talked about yet so we should explain what that means um were there any other properties besides fragment length sequence and methylation that I'm missing yeah there there were there were several others one was chromosomal changes so as we mentioned in cancer um this um got it the numbers of chromosomes uh often changes so many Cancers and this is wild but often double the number of chromosomes so you can go from 203 to uh you know double or even triple the number um but these chromosomes are not normal right so you'll often have arms or or the structures of chromosomes will get rearranged um uh and so there's a way to look at that also in the cell-free DNA by like as we mentioned in the non-invasive prenatal test where you look at the amount of DNA per chromosome or per part of chromosome so we looked at what's called these um chromosomal abnormalities um we also looked at cell-free RNA so it turns out um there's also RNA from tumors in circulation now now how how stable is that Alex I was under the impression that RNA wouldn't be terribly stable uh Unlike DNA which of course is double strand and quite stable um so H how how do you capture cell-free

[01:01:28] RNA yeah so so naked RNA is is not very stable um however there's um there's proteins that if the RNA is bound to um and one type is called an argonut protein if the RNA is bound to it um it is protected there's also and this is I assume this is typically messenger RNA that's been in the process of being transcribed but somewhere along the way before translation occurs that there's the disruption to the cell that results in Lis or something and so the the the the you're just basically getting the cell-free RNA because you happened to catch it at that point it was it was it was replicating cell or something or it was just translating protein or yeah or during apoptosis it's somehow during some kind of program cell death it's it's being digested or bound um you know um you know the the amount relative to the amount of cell death is low so presumably most of the RNA is destroyed but you know enough of it does get protected and bound to proteins um you know whether or not it's kind of cellular detrius or Garbage or it's intentional you know it's kind of a a different question but it is present um there's also vascular structure so little bubbles of of membrane that the

[01:02:50] RNA can be contained in um the most common one is referred to as an exosome um which are these little vesicles in in circulation so um in a variety of different ways you can have messenger RNA and other types of RNA preserved outside of cells in in circulation um and so we looked at that also wow how long did it take to to quantify all of these things and presumably I think you sort of alluded to this but we're not just looking at any one of these things you're ALS Al asking the question can combinations of these factors add to the Fidelity of the test correct yeah so this initial research phase um took uh close to three years um you know cost hundreds of millions of dollars um we had to recruit you know um the largest cohort ever for this type of study the the ccga study as I as I alluded to um and there were different phases there was a discovery and then multiple development and validation phases um we had to make the world's best assays to look at each of these features um and then we had to process all of those samples and then analyze them and you know we did it in a very rigorous way where the final testing was all done blinded and the analysis was all done blinded so we could be sure that um you know the the results you know um were not biased uh and then we compared them all and we also compared them in combinations and we use sophisticated machine learning approaches to really maximize the the use of the of each individual type of data from from each you know whether or not it was mutations or the chromosomal changes or methylation so you mentioned that the ccga had 15,000 samples how many of those samples were cancers versus controls what was the distribution of those I believe it was uh it's about 60% cancer vers uh vers verse controls yeah % you sort of alluded to it but just to be sure I understood you're obviously starting first with um a biased set where you know what's happening and then you're moving to a blinded unbiased set for confirmation is that effectively the way you did it yeah yeah so often referred to as U like a um a training set and a test set yeah yeah and so tell tell us what emerged Alex what you know when it was all said and done when you had first and foremost identified every single thing that was measurable and knowable oh I sorry before we do that I keep taking us off methylation explain methylation because that's of the of all the characteristics that's the one I don't think we've covered yet yeah so so

[01:05:38] DNA methylation is a chemical modification of the D DNA so in particular at the C in the ATC code the C stands for AC cytosine so that's a particular um nucleotide or or base in in DNA um uh the the um Maman biology can methylate it means that it can add a methyl group but a methyl group is just a a single carbon atom right um with with three hydrogens and then bonded to that cytosine um and so that's what DNA methylation is so to say a cytosine is methylated it means that it has that um you know single you know methyl group bonded to it um uh turns out that there's about 28 million positions in the human genome um that can be methylated it usually occurs at um what's called cpg sites which is um if you if you go along one strand of DNA this is not pairing of the DNA but one strand um where a c um or a a g uh follows a c so that's what a cpg is it's a c with a phosphate bond to a g um and so at those positions in the genome there are enzymes that can methylate the cytosine and demethylated um and there's again about 28 million um of those sites you know out of the 30 out of the three billion um you know overall um bases in the in the human genome um these chemicals these chemical modifications are really important because they affect things like gene expression um they're um it's it's it's one of the more important classes of something that's called epigenetics which is um Chang that are outside of the genetics or outside of the code itself you know um as you know the uh the DNA code is the same in most cells of the human body but obviously the cells are quite different so a t- cell is very different than a neuron um and other than the t- cell receptor all of the the genes are the same right the code is the same so why are the cells different well it's the epigenetics so so things like which um parts of the gene are methylated or which ones are assoc assciated with histones that are um kind of blocking access to the DNA that that's what ultimately determines which genes are transcribed um which proteins are made and why cells take on very different morphology and properties right so it's it's the methylation is a very fundamental code um for controlling it um so I call the the epigenetics kind of the software of the genome right the the genetic code is kind of the hardware um but how you use it which Gene you genes you use when what combination that's really the epigenetics and what is the technological Delta or difference in reading out the methylation sequence on those cpg sites relative to the ease with which you simply measure the base pair sequences so right you can measure c g a t CC a t TG Etc but then is it the same in the same readout do you also acquire which of the C's are methylated or are you doing a separate analysis yeah so so um there's different

[01:09:10] Technologies to do that for self-re DNA um we usually want very accurate sequencing of billions of these or many hundreds of millions of these small fragments um the way it's done is um and this adds complexity to to the to the chemistry is you pre-treat the DNA in a way that encodes the methylation status in the atg sequence and then you just use a sequencer that can only see atcg but because you've encoded the information you can then deconvolute it and infer which sites were methylated um uh to just to be a little more specific um there's chemicals that will for example um deaminate uh a a cytosine that's not methylated and then that deaminated cytosine um effectively turns into a osil which is a fifth letter in RNA and then when you copy the DNA and you amplify it prior to the sequencing it amplifies as a t because a u um when it's copied by um our DNA plase becomes a t and then you end up with a sequence where you expect to see C's and you see a t and if you see a t there then you know that aha came from a and the U is an unmethylated

[01:10:29] C brilliant yep right and if the c um was not changed then you say then that must have been a site that was methylated because you'll see G's opposite them right well oh sorry if if the C was methylated you'll see the G opposite because you won't turn it to the urisol right right BR so um uh yeah so that that technique is called bisulfide sequencing um there's other there other there are other ways to do it but that's the predominant withth it all right so now back to the question I started to ask a minute ago but then realized we hadn't talked about methylation so you've you've now you've come up with all these different things that you can do with this tiny amount of blood um because again you you talk about 10 mL you know in the grand scheme of things that's a really small amount of blood right that's two small tubes of blood very easy to do um presumably there was an optimization problem in here where you min max this thing and realize well look this would be easy to do if we could take a liter of blood but that's clinically impossible um yeah it would be nice to thonos this uh quote unquote and do this with a finger stick of blood but you're never going to get the goods so it did you sort of end up at 10 mL by um by ACC

[01:11:49] I mean was it was it just sort of an optimization problem that got you there as the most blood we could take without being being unreasonable um but yet still have high enough Fidelity and and maybe asked another way can you get better and better at doing this if if if if you were taking eight tubes of blood instead of two yeah so um there's a couple considerations one is the Practical one right you know you need a format that's that's you know to the extent your standard photomy and and standard volumes that that don't require um that you know uh that are that are below the volumes at which you know you could put someone in Jeopardy uh you know that's a big practical issue but it actually turned out that what ultimately limited the sensitivity of the of the test um was the background biology so for for cancer screening for for broad-based cancer screening more blood would actually not help you interesting um now there's other applications for uh monitoring or the therapy selection where looking for a very particular

[01:12:56] Target um in you know in someone who already knows has cancer you know what kind of cancer and there you could per improve your sensitivity but just for um cancer screening uh you're you're usually not limited by the amount of blood wow yeah and so did methylation turn out to be the most predictive element at giving you that very very high specificity or was it some combination of those those measurable factors yeah so it was pretty unexpected

[01:13:29] I I would say going into it most people thought that uh the mutations were going to be the most s you know the most sensitive method um some of us thought that uh the chromosomal changes were going to be the most sensitive I would say that the the methylation signals were kind of the Dark Horse there was just i' say I had to um you know I had to fight several times to keep it in the running um but uh um but again we we really took a let the data um tell us what the right thing to do is not biases from other you know other experiments let's do this in a comprehensive rigorous way and in the end um the methylation performed by far the best um so it was the most sensitive so it detected the most cancers importantly it was very specific so it could actually um it actually had the potential and did get to less than 1% um false positive rate and then the methylation had this other feature um which was very unique which was that it could predict the type of cancer what was the original um what we call now the um the cancer site of origin um uh you know what what organ or tissue did it originally originate from from um interestingly adding additional adding them all together didn't improve on the mation and I I can explain why now in hindsight you might have thought hey more types of information and Signal are better but uh it actually didn't so so we ended up with one clear result that the methylation patterns on the self-re

[01:15:09] DNA were the you know most useful and and information and adding other things didn't was not going to help the performance and why do you think that was because it is a little counterintuitive um there are clearly examples I could probably think of where you can degrade the signal by adding more information but I'm curious if you have a biologic teic explanation for why one and only one of these metrics turned out to be the best in any additional information only diluted the signal yeah so so it comes down to this is a good engineering principle right if you want to improve your prediction you need an additional signal that car information and is independent from your initial signal if it's totally correlated then it doesn't actually add anything right so um let's take an analogy let's say you're on a freeway overpass and you're developing an image recognition for Fords right um and you say okay what I'm going to start initially with is an algorithm it's going to look for a blue oval you know with the letters f o r d in it right okay um so that's pretty good now now let's say you say okay I know that some

[01:16:26] Fords also have the the number 150 on the side you know F-150 so I'm going to add that right well if you think about it if your algorithm based on the blue oval is already pretty good adding the 150 is not going to help right because whenever the 150 occurs the blue oval is also always there now if you know if if the blue oval wasn't always there or there fors that didn't have the blue oval then then some other signal could be helpful and so that's kind of what what ended up happening is that the methylation signal was so much more prevalent and so much uh more um distorted in cancer that everything else um uh didn't really add because you know um anytime you could see one of the others you could also see many more abnormal methylation fragments yeah that that that's really fantastic I guess I also want to again just go back and make sure people understand the kind of the the mission statement you guys brought to this which was high specificity is a must um so you know people have heard me on the podcast do this before but just in case there are people who um haven't heard this example or forget it I sometimes like to use the metal detector analogy in the airport to help explain sensitivity and specific so sensitivity is the ability of the metal detector to detect metal that should not go through and let's be clear it's not that people in the airports care if your phone is going through or your laptop or your watch or your belt they care that you're bringing guns or explosives that's why we have metal detectors or knives or things of that nature that's why the metal detector exists so it has to be sensitive enough that no one carrying one of those things can get through on the other hand specificity would say so if you're optimizing for sensitivity you make it such that you will detect any metal that goes through that thing and by definition you're going to be stopping a lot of people you're going to stop everybody from walking through if they if their zipper is made of metal you'll stop them so you prosthetic or a big belt or yeah yeah anything you got a little metal on your glasses you're going to get stopped so you have to dial the thing in a way so that you have some specificity to this test as well which is I can't just stop everybody in an Ideal World I kind of want everyone to make it through who's not carrying one of those really bad things and we're defining Bad Thing by a certain quantity of metal and therefore your specificity is to kind of say I don't want my test to to be triggered on Good Guys right I want my test to be triggered on bad guys now when you guys are designing a test like this like the Grail test I guess I should just go back and state that anybody who's ever been through two different airports wearing the exact same you know clothing and realizes sometimes it triggers sometimes it doesn't what you realize is not every machine has the same setting and that's because the airport the people at TSA they turn up or turn down the sensitivity and that changes the specificity as well how deliberately do you when you're setting up this assay have the capacity to dial up and down sensitivity and specificity so while I understand your mandate was a very high s specificity test where was the um the control or manipulation of that system if at all yeah um so there's a threshold in it's complex but there's the conceptually there there's a threshold inside the algorithm right so you can imagine um that um you know after you uh you have this comprehensive um uh map of all these different types of methylation changes that can occur in the fragments of hundreds of examples of every Cancer type uh and then you compare it to all the methylation changes that can occur outside of cancer which we haven't talked about which is very important right so you know most of the methylation patterns are pretty similar in similar cell types across individuals but there are changes that that occur that occur with age or ethnicity or environmental exposure um and and and so on and you know what you'd like is those two populations to be completely different um but it turns out there is some overlap right so there are fragments that occur in cancer that you know can occur outside of cancer um and um the algorithm in a very complex State space is trying to separate these populations um and whether or not you're going to um call something as a potential cancer and say a cancer signal is detected is whether or not you the algorithm thinks is it associated with this cancer group or is it associated with a non-cancer group um but again there's some overlap um you know between these and so where you set that overlap like in the border between individuals who don't have cancer but have for whatever reason an abnormal level of fragments that kind of look cancerous um you know that will determine your specificity so there is a dial to turn where you can increase the stringency um call fewer false positives but then you will start to miss some of the true positives now what was so great about methylation is that these populations were pretty well separated better than anything the world had ever seen before which is why you could get high specificity and still pretty good sensitivity um but yes that there is some overlap um which means you have to make a tradeoff and dial it in and inside the company is there sort of a specific discussion around the tradeoffs of it's better to have a false positive than have a false negative like we let's use the example you brought up earlier right so so prostate specific antigen uh is kind of the mirror image of this right it's a highly highly sensitive test with very low specificity it's obviously a protein so it's a totally different type of assay right it's a you know it's a far crudder test of course um but the idea is in theory and of course I could give you plenty of examples um someone with prostate cancer is going to have a high PSA so you're not going to miss people with cancer but as you pointed out earlier you're going to be catching a lot of people who don't have cancer and it's for that reason as you said that it is no there is no longer a formal recommendation around the use of

[01:23:37] PSA screening it is now kind of been relegated to the just talk to your doctor about it um and of course um you know the thinking is look there are too many men that have undergone an unnecessary prostate biopsy on the basis of an elevated PSA that you know really should have been attributed to their BPH or prostatitis or something else U so not withstanding the fact that we have far better ways to screen for for prostate cancer today you know that's a test that is highly geared towards never missing a cancer um in its current uh format um under low prevalence populations which is effectively the population it's being designed for right this is designed as a screening tool um it seems to have better predictive negative predictive value than positive predictive value correct uh it's pretty high in both because negative predictive value also is is related to uh is also related to to prevalence um but um but you know we just to put some numbers out there right so in the ccga study but then importantly in an Interventional study called

[01:24:49] Pathfinder um you know the positive predictive value is around 40% right that's that's all stages um yeah so that's all cancers all stages right it's a population study so it's what it's natural whatever natural um set of cancers and stages occur in in that group right so that was about um 6,500 individuals and do you do you recall Alex what the prevalence was in that population was it a low-risk population yeah so it was it was a mix of a a slightly elevated risk population and then a um average risk population so Ju

[01:25:34] Just just in terms of risk and I think you'll you'll appreciate this um you know I I think of anyone over 50 is as high risk and that's where the majority of these studies are are happening right so I mean I mean age is your single biggest risk risk factor for um uh for for for cancer right um you know you have like relative to the the population over 50 is about a 10x increased risk relative to the population under 50 and age age 55 to 65 is the decade where cancer is the number one cause of death yeah so it's yeah I would say in in developed Nations I mean that's that's actually increasing right I mean we're making such incredible progress on metabolic disease and cardiovascular disease um so I mean cancer in the developed world is predicted to become surpass um you know cardiovascular disease is the number one killer so but um anyway older populations are at I wouldn't call them low risk I'd call them you know kind of average risk for that age group which is still relatively high for the overall population but but it but it was a mix um yeah prevalence um you know um uh a bit a bit less than 1% um some of these studies do have a healthy bias Vol you you know a healthy volunteer bias to them that's interesting so in a prevalence in a in a 6,500 person cohort with a prevalence of 1% which is pretty low the positive predictive value was 40% um that's right what was the sensitivity for all stages then it must have been 506 I have to mean it's easy to calculate if I had my spreadsheet in front of me but it's it's got to be 60% or higher sensitivity and specificity has got to be close is you know over 99% at that point right yeah yeah those are the those are the rough numbers yeah that's right um so about half of some of the important statistics there right so about um half of the cancers that manifested um over the lifetime of the study were detected um by the test the test actually um doubled the number of cancers in that Interventional study than were were detected by standard of care screening alone so in the the

[01:27:56] Interventional study the the Pathfinder study patients are the enroll Le were uh getting standard of care screening right you know according to guidelines so you know mamography um importantly cervical cancer screening and then uh you know colonoscopies or or stool based testing based on guidelines right um and so a number of the cancers that the Grail Gallery test detected were also detected by standard of care which which you would expect um but the total number of cancers found was was about doubled um with the addition of the uh you know of the gallery test um and that was predominantly cancers where there there isn't a screening test uh for um but but just going back to the positive predictive value just you know the positive predictive value of most screening test is low single digits so we're talking about so so I mean you probably had the experience more than I have but I many many times a a a female colleague friend or someone's wife calls and said you know I got a mamography and um uh they found something I'm gonna have to go for a followup and a biopsy and so on and literally you know 19 times out of 20 it's a false positive right right um and so you know that's one where we've accept we've accepted

[01:29:18] For Better or Worse a huge false positive rate um to catch you know to catch some cancers right and that's why there's there's a fair amount of debate around mamography but again that's a positive predictive value of about four and a half percent so so you know most people get the vast majority of people who get initial positive they they're not going to end up having cancer you know you know um you know but you know still potentially worth it um now we're talking about something where we're approaching one or two uh positive tests will ultimately lead to a cancer diagnosis that's that's potentially actionable so it's um I think sometimes when people hear 40% they say gee that means there's still uh um a fair amount of um uh people who are going to get a a a positive test meaning a cancer signal detected and ultimately not but again for screening tests that's incredibly high yield yeah yeah I mean I

[01:30:20] I think another way to think about that is to go back to the airport analogy right right so this is a metal detector that is basically saying look we're we're willing to beep at people who don't have knives to make sure everybody with a knife or gun gets caught so the negative predictive value is what's giving you the insight about the bad guys and a a for so a 40% positive predictive value means let's just make the numbers even simpler let's say it's a 25% positive predict value it means for every four people you stop only one is a true bad guy now think about what that H think about what it's like in the actual airport right how many times in a day does the metal detector go off and how many times in a day are they catching a bad guy the answer is it probably goes off 10,000 times in a day and they catch zero bad guys on average so that gives you a sense of how low the positive predictive value is and how high the sensitivity is and how low the specificity is so yes I think that's a great way to look at it which is if you are screening a population that is of relatively normal risk a positive predicted value of 20% is very very good it also explains I think where the burden of responsibility falls to the physician which is as a physician I think you have to be able to talk to your patients about this explicitly prior to any testing you know

[01:31:59] I think patients uh need to understand that hey there's a you know a chance that if I get a positive test here it's not a real positive and I have to have kind of the emotional Constitution to go through with that and I have to be willing to then engage in follow-up testing because if this thing says oh you know Alex it looks like you have a lung cancer you know the next step is

[01:32:25] I'm going to be getting a chest x-ray or I'm going to be getting a lowd dose CT of my chest and that doesn't only come with a little bit of risk in this case radiation although it's a almost trivial amount but I think more than anything it's the risk of the emotional discomfort associated with that um um and I think honestly when you present the data this way to patients they really understand it and they really can make great informed decisions for themselves and by the way for some of those patients it means thank you but no thank you like I just don't want to go through with this and that's that's okay too um let let's talk a little bit about some of the really interesting stuff that that that emerged in the his various histologies and the various stages um and I've had some really interesting discussions with your colleagues uh I guess just for the sake of completing the story you're no longer a part of the company Grail um so maybe just explain that so that we can kind of get back to the Grail stuff but but just so that people understand kind of your trajectory um yeah yeah no we should do that so uh yeah so I was at alumina and then I helped span off Grail as a um co-founder led the R&D and clinical development uh and then um I actually went back to alumina as the chief technology officer running all of the company's research and development really really fantastic uh fun job uh subsequently alumina acquired a Grail um so now a solely owned subsidiary of alumina uh and then that was about almost three years ago and then uh recently I I left alumina to um start a new company where I'm really interesting biotech uh company that I'm the CEO of um yeah so no longer actively involved in either company um have great relations with all my former colleagues and uh excited to see their progress um

[01:34:21] I should also say that I I am still a share holder also of aluminum just for full disclosure y thank you um so kind of going back to you know you have a number of colleagues as you said who are who are still at Grail who who I've gotten to know um and you know one of the one of the things that really intrigued me was again some of the histologic differences and the stage differences of cancer so if you look at the um uh the the sort of opening dat a few things stood out right so there were certain histologies that if you took them all together by stage um didn't look as good as others so for example talk a little bit about prostate cancer detection using the uh

[01:35:11] Gallery test so I think what you're referring to is um you know uh there's a big um uh uh a very wide variety of or different perform es in different cancers so they're all highly specific so very low false positive rate because there's only one false positive rate for the whole test which which was probably worth spending some time on later um but for example sensitivity to many GI cancers or certain histologies of of lung cancer um the test is very good at detecting earlier stage um localized cancers um particularly in prostate cancer and hormone receptor positive breast cancer um you know the detection rate is is lower for like stage one cancers um but I think they this gets to a very important issue which is what is it that you want to detect right so do you want to detect everything that's called a cancer today or or is what what you want to detect is you want to detect cancers that are going to grow and ultimately cause harm right so the weird thing about cancer screening in general is there's both over and under diagnosis right so there um most small breast cancers and most D dcis and most even small prostate cancers will never kill the patient or cause morbidity but there is a small subset that will um and so for Mo for those we you know have decided to um again go for a trade-off where we'll often reect things and go through treatments just to make sure that smaller percentage is removed even though we're removing a ton of um other you know quote cancers that that are unlikely to ever uh proceed into anything dangerous um on the flip side 70% of people who die of cancer they die from an unscreened cancer so there's huge underdiagnosis right so again we should we should remember that 70% of people who ultimately die you know of cancer on on their death certificate um they died from a cancer where there is no established screening uh you know um prior to something like grail's Gallery so we have this weird mix of there's a lot of cancers where we're probably where we know we're overdiagnosing um but we're doing it for the right you know for a a defensible tradeoff and then there's a huge number of cancer deaths occurring where you know there's essentially zero diagnosis um but back to the ones where there's um you know uh under diagnosis right um you know it gets back to what does it mean to have tumor DNA in your blood right so the measuring and detecting a cancer from tumor DNA in your blood is a functional asset so for for to get tumor

[01:38:01] DNA in your blood you have to have enough cells they have to be growing fast enough dying fast enough and have blood access so those are the things that you're required now if you have a tumor that's small encapsulated not growing well guess what it's not going to have DNA in the blood so unlike an Imaging acid which is anatom iCal this is really a functional asset you're you're quering for whether or not there's a cancer that has the mass the cell activity and death uh and access to the blood to get and manifest its DNA into the blood so so it's really stratifying cancers on whether or not they have the activities now interestingly this functional assay is very correlated with ultimate um mortality so um there's a really nice set of data that that the Grail put out where you look at kathlin Meer curves so over the course of the ccga study which is now going out I don't know five plus years you can say well what do survival curves look like if you were positive right your test was detected vers your test was uh negative meaning your cancer was not detected by The Grail test and there's a big difference so basically if your cancer was undetectable by The

[01:39:20] Grail test um you have um h a very um good outcome right much much better than the general population with that cancer so this is suggest two things one is um you know a those cancers may not have actually been dangerous because um uh there's there's not a lot of mortality associated with them right and maybe that's also why they couldn't put their tumor DNA in the blood the other is whatever the existing standard of care is it's working well right now if you look at all the the cancers in the

[01:39:52] Kaplan curve that were detected um they have a lot of mortality associated with them and so what it's showing is that it's the dangerous cancers the cancers that are accounting for the majority of mortality those are the ones that the test is detecting and and again this biological rationale makes a lot of sense which is okay a tumor that grows fast can get its DNA in the blood well that's probably also a dangerous tumor that is going to become invasive and and and spread so again it's it's a functional assay so if your test is detected by one of these tests like the gallery test it's saying something about the tumor that is very profound which is that it's active enough to get its signal into the blood and it's you know very likely if untreated um to ultimately you know be associated with morbidity and potentially mortality um and so I think it's an open question of you know these these these tumors that aren't detectable and that are in um cancers we know there's a lot of indolent disease um what does it really mean that the test is low sensitivity for that right yeah I would say that when I went through these data and I went through every single histology by stage um I did this exercise probably 18 months ago um the one that stood out to me more than any other was the sensitivity and specificity discrepancy well I should say the sensitivity discrepancy between triple negative breast cancer and hormone positive breast cancer you alluded to this but I want to reiterate the point because I think within the same quote unquote disease of breast cancer we clearly understand that there are three diseases there's estrogen positive there's hert new positive there's triple negative those are the defining features of of three completely unrelated cancers with the exception of the fact that they all originate from the same mammory gland but that's about where the similarity ends their treatments are different their prognosis are different and to take the two most extreme examples you take a woman who has triple positive breast cancer I.E it's estrogen receptor positive progesterone positive her T new positive you take a woman who has none of those receptors positive the difference on the

[01:42:22] G R test performance on stage one and stage two so this is cancers that have not even spread to lymph noes the the the hormone positives were about a 20% sensitivity for stage one stage two and the triple negative was 75% uh sensitivity for stage one stage two and so this underscores your point which is the triple positive cancer is a much much worse cancer and that at stage one stage two you're detecting 75% sensitivity um pretends a very bad prognosis now I think the really important question here and I I mean I believe that this is being asked is does the ability to screen in this way lead to better outcomes so I mean I will state my bias because I think it's important to put your biases out there and I've stated it publicly many times but I'll state it again my bias is that yes it will my bias is that early detection leads to earlier treatment and even if the treatments are identical to those that will be used in advanced cancers the outcomes are better because of the lower rate of tumor burden and by the way I would point to two of the most common cancers as examples of that which are breast and coloral cancer where the treatments are virtually indistinguishable in the adant setting versus the metastatic setting and yet the outcomes are profoundly different in other words when you take a patient with breast or coloral cancer and you do a surgical reection and they are a stage three or less and you give them adant therapy they have far far far better survival than those patients who undergo a reection but have metast disease and receive the same adant therapy it's not even close and so that's the reason that

[01:44:29] I argue that the sooner we know we have cancer and the sooner we can begin treatment the better we are but the skeptic will push back at me and say Peter the only thing the Graal test is going to do is tell more people bad news so we'll concede that people are going to get a better more relevant diagnosis that we will not be alerting them to cancers that are irrelevant and overtreating them and we will alert them to negative or more harmful cancers but it won't translate to a difference in survival so what is your take on that and how can that question be definitively answered so the it's a very important question um and over time I it will be definitively answered so we should talk about some of gr's Grail studies and how they're how they're going about it um so you know the the statistics are very profound like you said so most solid tumors fiveyear survival when disease is localized um you know hasn't spread to another organ you know 70 to 80% 5year survival um you know less than 20 for for metastatic stage 4 disease so it's it's very that correlation of um you know stage diagnosis versus 5year survival is is night and day and obviously you know everyone would want them and their loved ones and most people in the you know in the um localized disease um um category um you know now there's an academic question like you're saying which is okay well that's true uh but you know you know does that still but does that really prove that if you find people at that localized disease through this method as opposed to all the variety of methods that happens today incidentally um that uh you will have the same outcome and and sure I guess you could come up with some very you know theoretical possibility that somehow that won't um but um that doesn't seem uh very likely and I think it gets to a fundamental question of well are we going to wait you know decades to to see that and in the meantime um you know uh give up the possibility which is probably likely that finding these cancers early and and intervening early will change outcome um so I'm I'm all for and I think everyone is you know bigger and more definitive studies over time but the the idea that we're never going to do that study or just take kind of a nihilistic point of view that until it's done uh we're not going to find cancers early intervene I

[01:47:13] I just you know I I don't think it's cable to to to do that especially when the false positive rate's low um I think there's a few other ways to come up come at it which is is I mean um you know if if what you said was was really true it when you know so take so I've um I've met some of the folks and and been called by them who the Grail test has found a positive um uh I can think of a former colleague in in the test found an ovarian cancer um uh do you think when she went to her OBG yon and said look the test said that I have potentially an ovarian cancer and they did an ultrasound and they found something um that the you know OBG wi said you know what since this was found through a new method let's not intervene so so that there's a malignancy you know um likely you know it is an ovarian cancer um we know what the Natural

[01:48:10] History is but we're not going to intervene um similarly with cases of pancreatic cancer head and neck or things like that so I I don't understand the logic because today people do show up although um it's not very often with early stage versions of these disease ovarian pancreatic head and neck and things and we treat them so wh why is it you wouldn't treat them if you could find them through this modality um I I just don't know of any GI surgeon who says you know um you know uh well you're one of the lucky people we found your pancreatic cancer at stage one too but we're not going to treat it um because there isn't definitive evidence over decades that uh mortality isn't is better so I I get the academic point and you know Grail and and others are investing tremendous amount to increase the the data but um the idea that we have this technology and we're going to allow huge numbers of cancers to just progress to late stage before treating I

[01:49:12] I I don't think that's the right balance of uh potential benefit versus um uh you know kind of burden of evidence yeah so so is is there now a prospective real world trial ongoing in Europe though to actually begin yeah so let's let's talk a little bit about that yeah so um the NHS um has been piloting The Grail test uh and a population of about 140,000 um uh the um they they've done I think so it involves sequential testing uh I think at least two tests and then they look at um outcomes and it's a it's an Interventional study with return of results um and they're looking for a really interesting endpoint here right so mortality takes time right so I mean some cancers I mean to ultimately see whether or not you know getting diagnosed at a different stage and the intervention changes that you know that that could take one or or in some cases two decades um but they came up with a really interesting surate endpoint which is reduction in stage four cancers so here's the logic yes I think makes a lot of sense which is if you deplete if if people stop getting diagnosed with stage four and and say a big reduction in stage three cancer then doesn't it stand a reason that ultimately you will reduce mortality right so so if you remove the endstage version of cancer which you know kills most people um and that you know that you have to pass through most people don't die of stage two cancer they they die of um uh if they were diagnosed with stage two they die because it turned out it wasn't stage two and and it spread right so if you if you if you do a study and within a few years um when you're when you're screening people you there's no more and let's take the extreme stage four cancer then you stage shifted the population right um and you're kind of eliminating late stage metastatic cancer you know while we're waiting for that to read out you know my my personal belief is you know the poten benefit of finding cancer is so significant testing now um you know uh you know for for many patients makes sense uh and then um I think this endpoint of stage four reduction yeah that's a clever clever endpoint yeah uh you know one of the things that I know that that a lot of the the the folks who oppose cancer screening tend to tend to to cite is that a number of cancer screening studies do not find an improvement in all cause mortality even when there's a reduction in cancer specific mortality so hey we did this colonoscopy study or we did this breast cancer you know screening study and it it indeed reduced you know breast cancer deaths but it didn't actually translate to a difference in all cause mortality um I've explained this on a previous podcast but it is worth for folks who didn't hear that to understand why um to me that's a very very um oh how can I say this charitably um that's a very misguided uh view of the literature because what you fail to appreciate is those studies are never powered for all cause mortality and if you reduce breast cancer mortality by 40% or 30% that translates to a trivial reduction in all cause mortality because breast cancer is still just one of 50

[01:52:54] Cancers and even though it's a relatively prevalent cancer over the period of time of a study which is typically 5 to S years the actual number of women who were going to die of breast cancer is still relatively small compared to the number of women period who were going to die of anything and I in previous podcasts have discussed that it's very difficult to get that detection uh within the margin of error and so if you actually want it to be able to see how that translates to a reduction in all cause mortality you would need to increase the size of these studies considerably even though really what you're trying to do is DET detect a reduction in cancer specific mortality I say all of that to say that I think one of the interesting things about the NHS study is it is a pan screening study and to my knowledge it's the first in other words it has the potential to detect many cancers and therefore you have many shots on goal potentially this could show a reduction in all cause mortality and not just cancer specific mortality again I I would have to see the power analysis but

[01:54:04] I wonder if the investigators thought that far ahead do you know I mean they're going to follow these patients long term um uh so they will get uh the the be able to have the data on know mortality um I don't know if powered for all cause mortal uh all cause I mean it's I I think that's unlikely just for for the reasons you said which is that the the numbers would be really high um I mean you know again if you're powering it to see a reduction in stage four over a couple years um that may not be enough yeah yeah interesting well time will tell Alex I want to Pivot if we've got a few more minutes to a topic that you and

[01:54:48] I spend a lot of time talking about these days um and so by way of disclosure you you sort of noted that you've you know left uh alumina somewhat recently you've started another company uh I'm involved in that company as both an investor and an adviser and it's a incredibly fascinating um uh subject but um one of the things that that we talk about a lot is the going back to this role of the epigenome right so uh I think he did a great job explaining it and putting it in context right so we've got these three billion base pairs and lo and behold some 28 million of them also happen to have a methyl group on their sea um I'll fill in a few more details that we didn't discuss on the podcast but just to to throw it out there as a general rule when we're born we have kind of our Max set of them and as we age we tend to lose them so in a as as a person ages the number of those methylation sites goes down you obviously explain most importantly what they do what we believe their most important purposes which is to impact gene expression it's worth also pointing out that there are many Hallmarks of Aging there are many things that are really believed to be at the fundamental level that describes why you and I today look and function entirely different from the day we from the way we did when we met 25 years ago we're just we're we're half the men we used to be um I could make a llas forier joke there but I will refrain um so I guess the question is Alex where do you think methylation fits into the biology of

[01:56:47] Aging that's a that's a macro question but yeah yeah yeah so you talked about the Hallmarks of Aging um uh you know and uh it was uh who's the author who who I think it was Hanrahan um came up with that about 10 years ago this Hallmarks of aging and he recently gave a talk where we talked about perhaps uh methylation is the

[01:57:13] Hallmark of Hallmarks of of of Aging um and what he's referring to is the mounting data that um the epigenetic changes are are the most descriptive of Aging um and are becoming more and more causally linked to uh to uh to to to aging events yeah there's lots of data that show that people of comparable age but different health status for example smokers versus non-smokers people who exercise versus people who don't people who are obese versus people who are not can have very different methylation patterns um there's also some data that look at centenarians um relative to non- centenarians um and obviously that's a complicated analysis because by definition there's a difference in age but you get a sense of different patterns of methylation and clearly centenarians we've established long ago do not acquire their centenarian status by their behaviors right just look at

[01:58:20] Charlie Munger and Henry kiss messenger uh you know two people who recently passed away at at basically the age of 100 despite no evidence whatsoever that they did anything to take care of themselves um so clearly their biology and their genes are very protective um as you said there are a bunch of these Hallmarks right I think the original paper talked about nine and that's been somewhat expanded um but you you share that view

[01:58:51] I suppose that the epig genome sits at the top and that potentially it's the one that's impacting the other so when we think about mitochondrial dysfunction which no one would dispute mine and yours are nowhere near as good as they were 25 years ago our nutrient sensing Pathways inflammation all of these things are moving in the wrong direction as we age how do you think those tie to methylation and to the epigenome and to gene expression by extension you know I think maybe let's reduce it to like a kind of an engineering framework so if we took um Peter's epid genome from 25 years ago when I first met you right and we knew for you know every cell type in every cell um what was the methylation status at all 28 million positions we had recorded that and we took yours uh today where um most of those cells have deviated from that and we could flip all those States back right said look you know um and and that's that's kind of how I think about it is the SS don't go away just whether or not they have the methyl group or not um changes um and some places gain it some places lose it um if we could flip all those back would that Force the cell to behave like it was 25 years ago um

[02:00:15] Express genes uh the Fidelity with which it controled those genes uh the interplay between them would it would it um would it be reprogrammed back to that state um and so you know that I think is a really provocative hypothesis we don't know that for sure but there's more and more evidence that that might be possible and so to to me that's the the burning question is now that we have the ability to characterize that and we know what it looks like um in a higher functioning state which is you know correlates with youth and we are gaining

[02:00:51] Technologies to be able to modulate that um and actually change the epome as opposed to modifying proteins or Gene Expressions but actually go in and REM methylate and demethylate certain sites um can we kind of reprogram things back to that earlier State and and if it is the root level at which things are controlled will you then get um uh you know the uh all of the other features that that the the cell had and the organism had so I think that's the that's a really exciting question to to answer because if the answer is yes or even partially yes then it gives us a really concrete way to go about this um and so I think you you we talked about the Hallmarks and the Hallmarks are complex and interrelated what what I like about the epigenome is we can read it out and we're gaining the ability to modify it directly so if really it's the more the most fundamental level at which all of these other things are controlled it it gives us again maybe back to the early discussion a very straightforward engineering way to go about this let's talk a little bit about how that's done a year ago you were part of a pretty remarkable effort that culminated in a publication in nature um if I recall it sequenced the entire Human epig Genome so if we had the Human Genome Project 24 years ago uh roughly we we had the uh the the epig Genome Project can you talk a little bit about that and um maybe explain technologically how that was done as well yeah so in the development of the

[02:02:30] The Grail Gallery test right um there was a key capability that that we knew was going to be important for a multi-cancer test right so so very different than most cancer screening today which has done you know one cancer at a time right um so if you have a blood test and it's going to tell you there's a cancer signals present and and this person should be worked up for cancer you'd really like to know well where is that cancer likely reside because that's where you should start your workup and you want it to be pretty accurate so if the algorithm detects a cancer um and it's really a head neck cancer you'd like the test to also say it's a it's likely head neck and then do an endoscopy uh and not have to do lots of whole body Imaging or you know whole body pet C or things like that so we developed something called a can s side of origin and so today the test has that if you get a signal detected it also predicts where the cancer is and it gives like a top two Choice top two choices and um it's about 90% accur accurate in doing that but how does that work um and you know you know the

[02:03:40] Physicians and patients have gotten that have described it as kind of magic that it detects the cancer and predicts it um and it's based on the methylation patterns right so methylation is what determines cell identity and cell state right so again DNA code is more or less the same in your cells but the methylation patterns are strikingly different when a cell replicates why does it continue to be the same type of cell when an epithelial cell replicates same DNA as a t- cell or a heart cell but it but it doesn't become those it stays it's because the methylation pattern those exact uh methylation states on the 28 million are also replicated so just in the same way DNA as a way of replicating the code there's an enzyme that looks and and copies the pattern to to to to the next cell and so that exact code determines you know again is it a colonic epithelial cell or a Fallopian epithelial cell or or what whatever it is and so we knew that the only way to make a um a predictor in the cell prna is to have that atlas of all the different methylation patterns and so with a collaborator a guy named U

[02:04:53] Alor at at Jerusalem University um we laboriously got surgical remnants from from healthy individuals he developed protocols to isolate the individual cell types of of most of the cells that get transformed in cancer uh and then we got Pure methylation patterns where we sequence the like like sequencing the whole genome sequenced the whole methylome of all those cell types and we published that a year ago as the first uh atlas of the human methylome in in all of the major cell types and so for the first time we could say hey this is the code which makes you um beta eyelet cell in the pancreas that that makes insulin versus something else um you know interestingly you know there's only one cell in the body where the insulin promoter is not methylated right and and that is the beta eyelid cell every other single cell that promoter is heavily methylated because it shouldn't be making insulin um and so it's those kinds of signals um that when you have the cell-free DNA and you look at the methylation pattern allows the algorithm to predict hey this isn't just methylation signal that looks like cancer the patterns and what's methylated and what's not methylated looks like um color rectal tissue or or a color rectal cancer and that's how the algorithm does it and so um this Atlas again was a real breakthrough for for

[02:06:25] Diagnostics and it made cancer site of origin useful it's also being used for for lots of mrd um or those mon cancer monitoring tests too because it's so sensitive um but it also brought up this interesting possibility which is if you're going to develop Therapeutics or you want to say rejuvenate cells or or repair them that have changed or become pathologic what if you compare the methylation pattern in the good State versus the bad state does that then tell you the exact positions that need to be fixed and then with another technology which can go and flip those States um will that um know reverse or kind of rejuvenate the the cell to to the um to the original or desired state so Alex unlike the genome which doesn't migrate so much as we age I mean obviously it accumulates mutations but with enough people I guess we can figure that out pretty quickly do you need longitudinal analysis of a given individual I.E within an individual to really study the methylome do you need to be able to say boy in an Ideal World this is what Peter's epig genome looked like when he was one year you know at

[02:07:41] Birth oneyear old 2 3 4 50 years old so that you could also see not just how does the methylation site deter determine the tissue specificity or differentiation um but how is it changing with normal aging as well yeah yeah um I think a lot of it is not individual specific so I mean I'll get give you an example so um done a fair amount of work in te- cells and if you look at say exhausted affector t-

[02:08:17] Cells versus naive memory cells where you know uh younger individuals tend to have more of those and it gives them more Reservoir to do things like fight disease fight cancer um there's very distinct methylation changes certain genes get you know uh uh methylated or demethylated um and those changes seem to be uh again very correlated with this um change in um te- cell function and so my guess is my my belief is that those represent fundamental changes as the te- cell population gets aged and you end up with more and more tea cells that relatively speaking are useless and so you know if you wanted to rejuvenate um the te- cells repairing those methylation States is something that would benefit um everyone now that they're definitely um a small percentage of methylation sites that that are probably kind of you know drifting or degrading and those could be individual um specific to individuals there's some gender specific sites for sure there's some ethnic ones um but the major the big big changes um seem to happen more with loss of function you know big changes in age um that are probably common across um you know individuals or know in the case of cancer we also have profound changes when you think about um this space a term comes up I mean if if folks have been kind of following this they've probably heard of things called yamanaka factors um in fact a Nobel Prize was awarded uh to yamanaka for the discovery of these factors can you explain what they are and what role they play in everything you were discussing yeah yeah yeah so what uh with yamanaka and colleagues discovered is that um if you take uh you know fully differentiated cells for example fibroblast um and you expose them to a particular cocktail of four transcription factors um that the cell reverts to a stem cell like State um and these are called um induced Pur potent stem cells so again you you subject um a differentiated cell that was a of a mature cell of a particular type I think most of their work was in fibroblast and the cell when it's exposed to these transcription factors many many and these transcription factors are are kind of uh powerful ones at the top of the hierarchy they unleash a huge number of of changes in gene expression genes get turned on get turned off and then ultimately if you keep letting it going you end up with something that um is a is a is a type of stem cell and why this was so exciting is it gave the the possibility to create um stem cells through a manufactured process so you know as you know there's a lot of controversy about getting stem cells from embryos um or other sources um this you know created a way now to create stem cells and use them for medical research um you know by just taking an individual's own cells and kind of dedifferentiating it back to a back to a stem cell and how much did that alter um the phenotype of the cell itself in other words the fiber Blast has a bunch of phenotypic properties what are the properties of a stem cell um and how much of that is driven by the change in methylation in other words I'm trying to understand how these transcription factors are actually exerting their impact at throughout this regression for lack of a better word yeah so most of those um we call so like we refer to um cell type specific features as sematic features like um you know a t- cell receptor right that that's a feature of a t- cell or a dendrite or an axon would be for a neuron or an L Type calcium channel for for for you know a cardiac myosite so those are you know very cell type specific features so if you turn on these yamanaka factors and you go back to a plop poent stem cell um you lose most of these right and and and that word plop poent means the potential to become anything um at least in you know at least in in theory so um you lose most of these cell type specific features so the the use of the ipscs is then to redifferentiate them right and and that's what people have been attempting to do and it opened up the ability to do that which is you create this um stem cell that now potentially has the the ability to be differentiated into something else you give it a different cocktail and you try to make it a neuron or um you know a muscle cell right and then use that in a in a tissue replacement therapy and there's a lot of research on that and a lot of groups trying to do that you also ask about what is the relationship between that in the epigenetics and methylation state um that has not been well explored that's something that I'm I and others are excited to do because it could be that um the it's you're indirectly affecting the epigenome with these yamanaka factors and that if you translated that into an epigenetic programming protocol you could have a lot more control over it um because one of the the challenges with the yamanaka factors is um if you if you do this for for long enough eventually the stem cell becomes something much more like a cancer cell um and and just becomes kind of unregulated growth and so um again huge breakthrough in in the in learning about this kind of cell reprogramming and dedifferentiation but our ability to to use it in a practical way for for tissue and cell Replacements is not there my my hope is that by converting it to an epigenetic level um it'll be more tractable you mentioned that this is typically done with fiber blasts I assume the experiment has been done where you sprinkle yamanaka factors on cardiac myocytes neurons and things like that do they not regress all the way back to PL potent stem cells um I think to varying extents and so um uh I mean if you truly have a plop poent stem cell it I guess in theory it shouldn't matter where it came from right because it's plur flent so with um developmental factors right so I mean where did where did your first neurons came come from you had a stem cell and then you know in the um you know in the embryo or the fetus there were factors that then coax that stem cell to become you know these other types of cells and tissues right so if it's truly plop poent then um you should be able to do that now I think you're getting at something which is different which is called partial reprogramming and um he and and his um the people have followed his work have have what what they they're trying to do is things which is kind of stop halfway so what if you took a um uh you know a heart cell or a te- cell that's function you know that's lost a lot of function and you give it these yamanaka factors but you know you stop it before it really loses its cell identity will it have gained some properties of its higher functioning youthful State without having having lost it and so there's some provocative papers out there on this um uh uh there's a guy at the Sal Juan Carlos Del

[02:16:24] Del Monte who's um uh done some work on this and some very provocative results in mice of doing these partial reprogramming protocols and you know rejuvenating you again it's mice so all the usual caveats but getting you know very striking improvements in function in eyesight cognition again in these kind of you know Mouse metrics so um certainly interest in in trying to understand how that would um how that might be able to translate to humans the again the worry there would be that if you don't control it then you could make you know essentially a tumor right so um you know it's opened up that whole area of science that it's possible to um do these kinds of dramatic de differentiations how to really harness that in a context of you know human

[02:17:18] Rejuvenation uh we don't know how to do that yet but but there's a lot of a lot of people trying to figure that out if if you had to guess with a little bit of optimism but not like pie in the sky optimism where do you think this field will be in a decade which you know there's a day when a decade sounded a long time away it doesn't sound that long anymore decades seem to be going by quicker than I remember um so it's you know it's going to be a decade pretty soon um but that's still a sizable amount of time for the field to progress what do you realistically think can happen with respect to addressing the Aging phenotype uh Visa V some method of reversal of Aging some truly geroprotective intervention yeah yeah so I'm optimistic and I'm a Believer um I think for specific organs and tissues and cell types there will be treatments that rejuvenate them so you know I I don't it's hard to see in a decade that there's just a you know complete Rejuvenation of every single cell in tissue in a human but you know joint tissues um you know the retina you know um you know immune cells um we're learning so much about the biology um related to Rejuvenation and healthier states of them and then in combination with that the tools to manipulate them which is equally important you could understand what the biology is but not have a way to intervene the tools to go in and um edit these at a genomic level to edit it at an epigenetic level to change the state um and the delivery

[02:19:14] Technologies to um uh to get them to very specific tissues and organs is also progressing tremendously so I I definitely see a world in 10 years from now where we may have Rejuvenation therapies for you know osteoarthritis um rejuvenation for various retinopathies where we can rejuvenate whole classes of immune cells that uh make you more resistant to disease more resistant to cancer um uh yeah I think I think we'll see things that uh will have real benefits in improving Health span Alex this is uh this is an area that um I think truly excites me more than anything else in all of biology which is to say I don't think there's anything else in my professional life that grips my Fascination more with this uh than this question right namely if you can revert The epig genome to a version that existed earlier can you take the phenotype back with you and that could be at the tissue level as you say could I make my my joints feel the way they did 25 years ago um could it make you know my te- cells function as they did 25 years ago uh and obviously one can extrapolate from this and think of the entire organism um so anyway I'm

[02:20:45] I'm excited by the work that that you and others in this field are doing um and grateful that you've uh you've taken the time to to talk about something that's really no longer your main project but something for which you provide uh probably as as good a history of as anyone Visa the liquid biopsies and then obviously a little bit of a glimpse into the problem that obsesses you today awesome uh well fun chatting with you as always Peter um yeah glad to opport glad I have the opportunity to to dive in deep with this there aren't many places to do this thank you yeah thanks Alex [Music] w
