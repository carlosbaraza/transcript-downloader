[00:00:00] you [Music]

[00:00:10] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast of my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode I guess this week is John Dudley before I tell you a little bit about who John is because I suspect many of you won't recognize his name maybe a little reminder about one of my obsessions being archery probably talked about it quite a bit on the podcast to get a better sense of why I love archery so much and why I think it's kind of an amazing model system for life I think you'll enjoy this podcast

[00:01:11] Oh John is someone who from the day I got involved in archery I was very fortunate to be introduced to in terms of his work would be another couple of years before I would meet him he is a professional archer he's the host of what I consider hands down no ifs ands or buts the absolute best content on all of archery including podcasting TV etc so the nock on TV station on YouTube and

[00:01:37] Nikon podcast his ability to teach archery and do archery provide the rarest and smallest eclipse I've ever seen in performance which is to say it's very rare that someone who is the top 0.01% of a performance is also at the top 0.01% of the ability to teach distill and communicate that somehow John manages to do that now I can pour you to tears with all of his accolades he represented the u.s. archery team for many years he's won more medals

[00:02:13] I can count representing Team USA he was the Rookie of the Year as a professional national champion multiple time national champion European Grand Prix gold medalist British National Indoor champion etc honestly it's just I'll turn most of you off by reading this because this introduction will be even longer than it probably is already slated to be I was introduced to John through Joe Rogan when I was on Joe

[00:02:36] Rogan's a podcast a couple of years ago I let Joe know just how much of a huge fan I was and Joe was just kind enough to introduce us and I had the real privilege of getting to spend a bunch of time in person with John so in this episode we don't go too deep into how I got started in archery and how I fell in love with it and how even though when I started I had absolutely zero intention of hunting and how over time that changed and now I view hunting and archery as the two beautiful bookends of this incredible continuum John had already interviewed me for his podcast and so we'll simply link to some of the highlights from his podcast interviewing me where I get into a lot of that stuff obviously I wanted to focus on John and his story and so in this episode we talk a lot about John and his athletic background and how he made what can only be described as one of the craziest decisions in the history of a collegiate athlete which is to turn down a division 1 football scholarship one week into school and go and work at an archery store for 4 dollars and 10 cents an hour building arrows and that's exactly what he did we talk a lot about life in a sense as well because a lot of John's personality comes across in this and you get a sense of sort of his philosophy on life which you know frankly I just find wonderful I love being around John and his family and we can go back and forth between talking about these things in life and then talking about these things in archery and how amazingly they seem to converge so what it is that we're talking about in terms of technically improving something seems to then converge on we know what the application is in life so the last thing I'll say is we asked John to help us curate a list of content from his unbelievable curriculum such that if any of you listen to this and come away thinking you know gosh to listen to these two coconuts talking about archery for so long I at least want to give this thing a try you will get all you need from John's content but we thought we'd simplify it a little bit by curating a step by step set of videos that he's put together that will make it easier than trying to probably navigate from all of his content so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with John

[00:04:48] Doug John it's a little bittersweet that we are at the end of our archery camp here together I know that bonfire you have over there is big enough to either burn Darth Vader or start the new Braveheart movie seriously if the listeners wondering what the context is here when John interviewed me you spent

[00:05:15] I don't know at least a full minute griping about the fact that I reneged on my offer to light a fire so tonight I was like well I'm not gonna be outdone so there is a fire burning that you maybe hear through this mic it's a little hotter than I then I play yeah if on August 8th you hear there's a wildfire gliding across Southern

[00:05:39] California there's a good chance it started behind this big fire pit of Peters in his backyard well look man it is a real pleasure to be kind of sitting here talking with you and I've been we talked about this over dinner the other day that I've been thinking so much about how to convey to an audience that is obviously very interested in performance and health and longevity how two of the biggest interests in my life kind of come to this intersection with one of them being archery and there's probably nobody that's listened to this podcast that hasn't figured out by this point how much I love archery certainly anybody who's ever taken the time to follow me on social media will notice that probably maybe a quarter of the things I post photos of that have something to do with that so in the introduction briefly I already kind of explained a little bit about who you are but that just doesn't do it justice and

[00:06:29] I try to keep the intro relatively short so that the listener can hear an insert of your own words what it is but take me back to kind of maybe some basics right so what does it mean to be professional archer I think most people understand what it means to be a professional baseball player because you turn on TV and you see people playing baseball but what does it mean to say

[00:06:49] John Dudley turned pro as an archer in this year and for the next X years did a B and C in the big picture it means nothing that's the reality I realize I'm fortunate that there's light being shed on archery right now because this was this small thing that if what was it ESPN the Ocho like in dodgeball Archer you would probably be on that if that was real but I started out learning to bow hunt from family and it was just part of the culture coming from the deep south you grew up in Mississippi right yeah I was born on Fort Bragg grew up in

[00:07:28] Mississippi for a while then moved up to the Midwest and I learned archery I think when I was 9 first bow hunting was when I was 10 and I don't know looking back there's been a lot of times where I've tried to decide why I really liked it and a good friend of mine who is a former Navy SEAL retired Andy stump there was this time someone was asking me the same question and sometimes I struggle with why I really loved bow hunting in archery and he just looked at me he goes have you not figured it out by now he's like it's all over your personality and I said no I and he goes because it's hard he goes that is why you do it because there's days where you're good at and there's days when you're not and he's right there several different points in my career where I took different steps because in my career started out learning to shoot a bow bow hunting not being good at it wanting to be better at it deciding to start shooting some target archery because I wanted to be a better bow hunter realizing I sucked as a target

[00:08:32] Archer wanted to be better at that becoming better at that than becoming a better bow hunter then kind of getting a little bit forward in the one aspect of competitive archery I was in so I jumped into another field that was a different types of targets different distances different type of competition did that until I kind of got complacent again kind of I just everytime I don't know I like to jump into something that challenges me and archery is one of those things where I think golfers understand that there's days where you go out and you play and you feel like you feel like you had the perfect game you feel like the next day if you go out and play another nine you're gonna do the same thing but then all sudden you realize no if everything's not clicking

[00:09:21] I can't just do this continually so I just have made a career out of being poor at a certain aspect of it and making it a mission to become good at that and then over the course of 33 years I've got to the point where now I feel like I have a very good understanding of the game and I've learned a lot from a lot of mistakes I mean that's kind of the truth of it well we're gonna come back to kind of a lot of things you've learned and more importantly how you've figured out a way to teach them but you've glossed over some things that I know a lot of detail about it I think for listeners it will be interesting to understand that so this is the first time I've ever recorded a podcast outside and that just me or is there like some loud airplane that's yeah there's an airplane man we're outside I know but normally I don't hear them that loud in my backyard

[00:10:12] I don't know I guess I don't have the microphone yeah there's it's called a microphone it amplifies sound we're podcasting but we're thoroughly enjoying each other's friendship we're out here we're drinking a protein shake that hopefully your monitor gives you some kind of data that you can satisfy your listeners with meanwhile I've also got wine on the back up so this is real we're drinking Jacko's mulk and Cleo one everybody always wants to ask me what my favorite wine is and this is 2012 bottle of Cleo so you were an all-american and you lettered in 12 sports I mean you some of the athletic stories that when you were in high school and you're your big guy so for listeners that maybe don't know what you look like you know you're 6 foot 5 kind of a wall a muscle you told me a story about a high school combine that just blew my mind where tell a story of what the coach said to all of you prospecting quarterbacks that were trying to get

[00:11:10] Division one scholarships yeah I was at U of I I was at a camp there that the Fighting Illini were putting on and I went there by myself my team wasn't with me it was a kind of a thing where there's quite a few recruits that were all brought in there and I remember Greg Landry was there as the quarterback coach and during that first day there was a ton of people down I think we were either on the five-yard line or somewhere in there and it was the first day of camp and obviously the first day at camp a lot of guys are jacking around as it starts and the coaches kind of gathered everybody up and he goes into this serious moment where he's saying we're here to look at all you were going to teach you but you're here to learn but you're also here to put on your best in front of some big coaches and he said a lot of these coaches are only gonna look at you one time and just like in any big game sometimes you only have one time to shine and what you do with that one moment is gonna define what you get out of this camp it's kind of that type of thing and he was talking about it and everything and I was paying attention and sitting on the I think I took one knee I actually have a picture but it's on a little microfiche I should try to get it and see if we can blow it up I'm pretty sure I had like a play band on my wrist and he just kind of looked over at me randomly and he grabbed the ball and he just threw it underhand and he's like you what are you gonna do with your moment and so I did all I knew how to do which was hukka football so I just stood up and took about two or three steps and just heave this ball from I was about from the nine yard line and landed it in the endzone on the other side and I just said I throw footballs and he's just like that was perfect sit down and he just looked over at the other guys like what are you gonna do with yours and then later on they came up to me and they said what else can you do and you know you got quite an arm how did he throw like that and I always had in saamiya I've always had that I've struggled to sleep I've always really enjoyed training and if can't sleep to me I don't know it feels like I've given myself a reason to get out of bed if I go and do something so and it's been that way with archery a lot of times if you watch my bow builds

[00:13:30] I'm building it crazy times in the morning because I can't sleep so I get up and I'll just start put a record on and I'll just start building a custom bow for someone and I'll do that but back then my coach it gave me a key to get into the gym and I would pull the laundry baskets out of the washer room and I would put laundry baskets and opsin and this is the gym and I would just throw footballs I had a bag of footballs and when I was a junior my coach gave me a whole bag of footballs and I had him in the trunk of my car all the time and I would just do three step drops throw it in laundry basket three steps and then when that laundry basket had all the balls I'd go over and do the other one and then outside it was always there called black routes but it was a black right route was like in my when

[00:14:18] I'd be under the center if I ever called an audible if I ever called black it would be a 73 pattern which is just pretty much a flare pattern so it was a quick three-step drop to outside shoulder so I would always go to the 20-yard line put the garbage cans from the football field in the corner and I would go out there and just throw footballs do three-step drops throw footballs and garbage cans that's just what I did so all that stuff led up to that moment of he's like here's your moment what are you gonna do with it

[00:14:51] I'm gonna throw a football and so fast-forward a little bit you end up getting a division 1 scholarship to play football which is I'm sure your parents are just over the moon overjoyed it was a little bit different I remember the first school that recruited me was Ball State and me and my mom went there my parents were divorced at that time my mom was I think I was a sophomore and I really had no idea what the heck we're even doing we went to Ball State and then a lot of different things came in but I decided that I really wanted to go to a Carolina school because my dad was a from Fort Bragg my uncle was a pilot at the time he was in greenville-spartanburg most the Dudley's were all from that part of the area so I really wanted to go there and honestly I really liked Western

[00:15:43] Carolina their offense was really really similar I had choices but that was really where I wanted to go and I think if you would have asked any of my family members what I was gonna do they were gonna tell you I was gonna play football I didn't care anything about school other than the fact it allowed me to play sports and I played sports all the time I mean every single semester in school I was in the sport it didn't matter I ran track did basketball did football played tennis it didn't matter all I wanted to do is I just wanted to play I loved it I loved camps too when my parents got divorced my mom traveled a lot she worked for Baxter Healthcare I told you that and she travelled a lot because she was overseeing plants in

[00:16:30] Malaysia and Singapore and Puerto Rico so she traveled a ton so she just she left an open checkbook in her house and she just said if I'm not home just don't get in trouble do some productive so I just took that checkbook and signed up for every single football camp I could and I was traveling to football camps without my teams I was just going going and being a guy without a team just sitting there and just I loved I loved having coaches around me honestly I performed I liked having people yell at me I liked having a very specific purpose like you're getting up we're doing this from 7:00 to 9:00 then you get a breakfast then we're gonna go out we're gonna freakin run for two I like I just love that it was awesome and so the archery thing just blindsided me because during this whole time during all this high school sport part of my life which when I first went into high school I had no business thinking I was going to be a good athlete because I was very skinny I was tall my dad told me I was like he goes when you ran up and down the basketball court always was afraid of you tripping because I thought it'd be like a chandelier hitting the ground I was skin and bones

[00:17:46] I worked hard and I grew into it but during that time I didn't get to shoot archery very much I liked it I was fairly good at it I would make gas money going to parties and shooting I would put eggs on the top of two-liter pop bottles and I would shoot them off these pop bottles at 40 yards and I just I'd be like you think I can hit that and people that you can't hit that and then

[00:18:09] I bet me five bucks and I would make gas money at parties I didn't drink I drank one time when I was 10 or 11 and then I got really sick off of it and just said I'm never gonna drink again and I didn't drink until my 20s so I would go to the parties because I loved and I would have parties but I just I wouldn't be the partier I would be there and I'd kind of take money off my drunk friends and that's sort of fun yeah I got the first time in my life I ever got drunk I was 12 or 13 working at my dad's restaurant on a New Year's Eve and it was me and my best friend Mike Douglas we were bussing tables and washing dishes and and the whole night were sneaking in drinks here and there like we're sneaking behind the bar and taking a drink of this and a drink of that and this is the ultimate low is at the end of the night when everybody's gone it's like 3:00 in the morning or whatever and we're cleaning up we drank every bit of remaining alcohol that was left on the table and sometimes you'd finish a drink and there'd be a cigarette butt in there and you'd be like oops and you'd pitch the cigarette butt and just keep drinking so we had this cocktail of booze in us and my mom she came to pick us up to take us home she saw that we were just hammered and she was so pissed at my dad she's like how could you let these two knuckleheads go through this so she drives us back home and I just think there's one of those it's amazing that I could so remember something so vividly from so long ago because of 13 12 whatever I remember being in the back of the car and sort of understanding why all those don't drink and drive commercials existed because I was like oh my god I was like out of my mind and then we got home and then she had to do what I knew she didn't want to do which was leave us there to go drive the babysitter home because there's babysitter babysitting my younger brother and so now there's these two drunk 12 year olds and beyond drunk and she has to leave for 20 minutes which is what's gonna take the drive this baby's hit her home and we managed to find a bottle of beer wine or something in the house and took it in the back drank it and started playing catch with it which of course resulted in it breaking and smashing all over the place and then we puked all over the kitchen yeah and she came home to that had to clean that up it was a disaster point being I didn't have a sip of alcohol again until I was probably 22 but that might be me I was a blessing it was one of these things where I got convinced that we needed to get drunk I went to one of my neighbors I had 20 bucks went to one of my neighbors who her memory had a big red like a Firebird her Trans Am or something a red one with tea tops he looked like he just got out of a warrant concert you know he was like a white leather jacket with fringe down it long blonde hair and I went over him like hey dude I mean my buddies want some booze and he goes he said house takes 50 percent and I go I don't care just get me as much as I can get it whatever with this and he came back with a big jug of off-brand peppermint schnapps I remember this and then on top of that like everyone was supposed to bring something to get bombed to this event with me and a couple of my buddies that were just thinking we're cool and one of my buddies brought some snuff and

[00:21:25] I had never smoked a cigar nothing but he's like just sniff it so the first time I ever got intoxicated was on peppermint schnapps and snuff and I don't remember most of the night I just remember waking up and praying that God if I make it through this I will never do this again and that was it I was like upchuck in just peppermint schnapps that was black from the snuff and and that was like that was it so I did not party that's the moral of the story I didn't party I went and I shot archery a little bit on Thanksgiving every year we went down to Mississippi for a family

[00:22:08] Thanksgiving and I would bow hunt down there that was my time to be Hunter I love doing it and I would I would shoot my bow I'd bow fish some in the summertime because at that time we lived in Illinois and my focus was football this is totally my focus well during my senior summer I'm scheduled to go to school I actually moved I think I went to Carolina one time and then I ended up hurting my right knee this knee right here I hurt this knee and and it was mainly because my growth spurt was so severe that my ligaments didn't grow with the rest of my body so they we kind of came up the plan for me to red shirt at a JC school that ran a very similar I think the coaches were somehow affiliated but there they said this is your opportunity to learn the entire playbook you're gonna rehab there we've got some stuff there so I was like okay this is all cool so as this is going down this is in the middle of summer

[00:23:06] I've got my bow in my truck because like I said sometimes I would just randomly get out and shoot carp if I saw carp I grew up on the Fox River in northern Illinois and so I driving down this road and I see this sign that says archery shoot so I thought oh what's that so I went down I turned down this road if you went there now it almost would be like a weird way to lure someone in cuz you're turning down these cornfields roads like going into this place and all sudden I pop in there's a bunch of cars there and

[00:23:41] I walk up I'm like hey what's up with this archery shoot and I go yeah we're having a 3d shoot and I said what's that they're like well 3d targets with scoring rings Mike oh I haven't really seen those and it was three-dimensional deer targets which now you have and there's molded rings molded into the foam so the smaller ring is a certain score and the bigger ring so obviously the more outside of the kill zone you get the poor your score and if you miss it's a zero so I go out with this scorecard get with this group of three guys I don't even know and I start shooting and you have to guess the distance of the target you have to know where the scoring ring is I didn't have any binoculars I don't even know if range finders were around so all this is going on needless to say after halfway through this course I'm out of arrows and because you've missed so I've literally missed practically everything didn't know the distance I grew up hunting with if you can shoot a paper plate at 20 yards you can hunt that was our thing and meanwhile hitting a paper plate meant go out and shoot ten arrows if you can kind of hit it some so I'd got better than that and I could have very specific pins to shoot exact numbers but the in-between stuff like I hadn't filled the gaps right so I went out and just was terrible lost all my arrows blanked a bunch of targets the people I was shootin worth was looking at me like wow this is sad and I said sorry I gotta go I'm out of arrows I'll be back and I left and I remember just driving up to

[00:25:23] Wilmot Wisconsin from this Illinois shoot the only shop I knew of was in Wilmont Wisconsin which is where my dad had taken me to get some of my first bows drove up to this Gander Mountain and I was pissed off the whole way like I am never gonna suck this bad again anything and I drove up there bought another dozen arrows drove back and picked up where I left off shot the course and by then they were already handing out trophies I was like last in and they were already handing out trophies and the guys that were on the podium had polo shirts on with embroidery of what shop they were shooting out of and I remember the two top guys had these bright yellow shirts on it said gat guns Dundee Illinois so this was on a Saturday or Sunday Monday morning I'm in gat guns I'm in there they opened at 1:00 o'clock I was there by 11:00 I just sat around on my car for a few hours and then when they opened I came in and I was like hey I went to this 3d shoe they're a couple guys at one I want to ask him about their equipment and what they're doing they're kind of like oh yeah it's probably so-and-so they normally shoot at night so I just lurked around there until people to show up to shoot League and then I was just this kid with all these questions but why do you have a colored bow why is your sight have a lens in it why are your fletching shorter just all these questions and went on a few days and all the sudden the guy at the shop the manager his name was Mike Donovan he grabbed me said hey kid are you doing anything and I said well yeah I'm asking these guys questions he said no are you doing anything and I said well yeah I go why and he goes I need your help and he pulled me in the back room and he said hey I forgot that you do these guys arrows do you know how to fledge arrows and I said no I don't know how to do any of this stuff and he said okay I'm gonna show you how so he handed me some feathers gave me a fletching jig told me to put the feather in here put glue down it clamp it on the arrow set the timer do the next six in line and then when the timer went off take the clamp off turn this little dial so that it rotates the arrow 120 degrees to the next position put another feather and put glue on right repeat that three times you got three fletchings on your arrow and he's like when these dozen are done to come out and get me so I did that and two hours later I came out and I said hey these are done he's like ok and I was like all right he goes ok do those and he pointed over in the corner and there was just this like a hundred tubes of him with orders wrapped up and kind of in there on what colors they got and everything so this went on for weeks of me just I would show up at 12 o'clock

[00:28:14] I'd jump in that little room and just start flexing the arrows for this guy and then all sudden he kind of told me like hey we got to replace his bowstring and I'm like well how do you do that at some point has he said oh by the way you work here now no no this is all just pure apprentice mode yeah so this is kind of where it gets good so I think he got good about five minutes ago so meanwhile my dad is saying hey what are you doing for work which I was pouring concrete in the morning for an archer buddy one of the guys that I was more or less stalking in this range his name was

[00:28:48] Mike West he had West concrete while I was talking he's like hey what are you doing for job I'm like I don't know he goes well I need help with my concrete company you want to come I'm like he goes we start early kid and I'm like yeah that's fine and I said I just want to be in here by night and he's like okay we start early so I was just running wheelbarrows full of freaking concrete every morning and then when it hit 11:30 I'd be like I got to get to get guns and I would leave and go there and just Fletch these arrows for free and meanwhile several weeks went by where I watch Mike hand out checks to other employees so finally I told Mike I said hey when am I gonna eat my paycheck

[00:29:29] I remember he just looked at me with this look of surprise and he just he goes you want to get paid and I go yeah I've been here for a month from 12 to 8 o'clock every day and he just said you can't put a price on what I'm teaching you right now and he was like cold serious and I said that's cool man but

[00:29:54] I've got to put gas in my car so just like all right he goes let me think about it and then he came back and he goes I'm gonna give you 410 an hour and he goes you'll have to work from 12:00 date every day and I said sounds awesome and I went after about a week I went back to my dad and I said hey I've got I think I want to change what I'm gonna be doing and he said what do you mean and I go I've got this job at this archery shop and it's just the best I love it and meanwhile everyone's teaching me better shooting techniques right they're teaching me a shooting I'm meeting sales reps from arrow companies sales reps from boat companies

[00:30:39] I'm in full dork mode so I tell my dad yeah this is what I want to do and my dad said I assume they're paying you a lot I'm for 10 an hour and I remember my dad cuz he's a psychologist so he's looking at me as if he's kind of wanting to say I really want you to make the right decision right now you're 18 I don't want to tell you you your decision and so he kind of just said I think that's a terrible decision and like most 18 year olds I just decided to freakin wrong with it I mean is it safe to say that part of this is you're pretty good at a lot of things as up until that point in your life athletically how much of this is you getting bit by this bug a month earlier you're at this 3d challenge you're the worst guy there and there's like a lack of familiarity with being so bad at something I mean is that pardon me rephrase the question I suspect that is part of it is that a small part of it or a large part of it no man I think that same sort of things in you I think that same sort of things and a lot of our friends I think a lot of our friends are very similar in the fact of if you give us something athletic to do we won't necessarily be awesome at it but we're definitely gonna be above average at it really fast or if we're not we will make sure we at least get above average at it before we say yeah that was cool I'm gonna move on other things I don't think

[00:32:15] I've ever done anything where I just totally suck at it maybe there's a few if someone got me in a competitive limbo I would probably be like yeah okay I've freaking suck at this and I would maybe take a few lessons and I'd be like you know what I'm six five I'm not meant to limbo so I'd give it a try but for the most part I think that stuff's just in competitive people like people with

[00:32:37] Drive they have Drive all the time right I think yeah I don't know I mean like my hope is by the end of this interview I want to understand this better because as much as you and I have spoken about this stuff over meals and such I find your story remarkable I mean I interview some really amazing people on this podcast and they're amazing in their field of particular science or something you know lots of innings and I have friends who are among the best in the world at something so you're in pretty rarefied air like I can't yeah Aaron I feel like I can even be here no no I mean I'm saying the opposite actually like I can't relate I've never been exceptional at anything I've never been as good anything you are at archery let's put it that way what licious I'm not exceptional I've just I've made it a lifetime passion to give everything I have to master it

[00:33:30] I'm not except there's prodigies I feel like I was born with the talent to do it because as many times as I've kind of been burnt out by it and walk away from it all sudden for some reason I come back to it and then I do it and I realize and there's a lot of people that work tirelessly to try to achieve this result and I really didn't have to put that in and I'm getting it so I feel like this is what I'm meant to do but I don't know I feel like I feel like you're cutting yourself short not saying that you're a hundred percent that way you're just that way in a different light just that way with a projectile

[00:34:09] I mean well look we could split hairs on it I would still argue that you at your best we're better at your craft than I've ever been at my craft or ever will be at anything that will be my craft and that's okay I just mean that it's I'm always interested in understanding how people what kind of passion people bring to their craft now packing up for a moment you've spoken only once that I've ever heard very briefly about something that I was sort of this was a couple of years ago I think it was on Rogen you talked very briefly about something in your childhood that you guys didn't spend a lot of time dwelling on it but it really kind of gripped me which was what happened to you and you're about nine years old with your house yeah we've never spoken about that yeah are you comfortable talking about that okay

[00:34:51] I'll talk about it I mean it haunts me it haunts me and the fact that so just like most kids and this everything happens for a reason I'm happy that happened I've talked to Joe in depth about things that are super close to me so sometimes he's gonna know how far we should go down a rabbit hole this rabbit hole doesn't really it doesn't matter it's part of my past and it's honestly something that allows me to when I'm around friends that have kids that are bad not bad in the fact that they act up but bats rambunctious yeah I tell him

[00:35:26] I'm like hey that was way worse than that and I said you gotta just give him a chance something will happen to where they'll change other direction and a lot of people have looked at me and they're like oh yeah easy for you to say and I'm like no man let me tell you Yeah right because at the surface they would say easy for you to say because your son who's 20 is he's like well even looking at me like them knowing me now or knowing me for the last 20-something or 30-something years they would never realize that me growing up I grew up on skateboards I grew up on BMX bikes I grew up taking money from my mom's wallet so I could go buy like fireworks and I mean I was beavis and butt-head like that's what I was I was beavis and butt-head and yeah I played with fire when I was nine years old called myself in sick from school was at home while my mom was in I think Puerto Rico visiting factory my dad was at work and yeah I started playing with matches ended up catching something on fire in the house panicked and honestly I tried to use the fire extinguisher didn't work guess why because I had been playing with firecrackers I wasn't supposed to have months before that in the garage and almost burned the house down so I put him out this fire extinguisher and just stuck it back up in the house without telling anyone I had completely used it so then fast-forward playing around with fire whatever primal say what you say we got the fire going over here looks cool yeah house started on fire started in a bedroom and I called my dad he was on the other side of town middle of a session with the patient told them there's a fire in the house it's pretty bad

[00:37:12] I'm sorry I'm sorry bla bla bla he just said what's it like in the house I said it's just black it's black everywhere I put it out there's black smoke everywhere and he just said get the smoke out of the house get the smoke out the house so I opened the windows and then open the front door and just like let the air blow through and I was just kind of crying frantically running around the house like trying to kind of prepare myself for when my dad was getting ready to come home to this thing and then by the time I went back in the bedroom it was even smokier than it was that time and then I remember I was just like opening the window even wider and ripping the screen out and keep in mind

[00:37:56] I was a punk kid I was like super I still like heavy-metal but I was in the heavy metal I was a skater I was a troublemaker that's what I was and I wasn't in the sports didn't like sports my dad was an athletic prodigy pretty much and I know that that's probably what was in my genes that wasn't what I wanted to do so all sudden I look in that room I'm in there and I'm trying to get the smoke out and then I look up and through the smoke I can see there's just flames all the way around the entire ceiling and that like fell down kind of right in front of my legs luckily I was able to get out of the house and yeah the whole house burned down the only thing that we had was what was in my mom's car at O'Hare Airport and what was in my dad's my dad's car that was at work that was it so yeah I mean I dealt with this you have an older sister right yeah my sister was at college so I mean yes literally older yeah dealing with all of her stuff being lost and my little brother did this and

[00:39:02] I was dealing with all this stuff and my parents were really good about I've never asked him what their conversation was but they never really they never really rubbed it in I remember my dad telling me I was I was struggling dealing with it honestly we were living in an apartment and my dad told me you know hey you should you know try to get involved with school and I think he said something like isn't there a dance coming up this weekend or something and

[00:39:28] I said yeah and he goes you should go out there go see your friends and stuff so I remember going to this dance and then one of the kids in the school end up like making a request to play burning down the house and so I ended up kind of raging out on this kid I was never really a fighter but I went a little nuts on this kid and then I think my parents just realized we need to get him out of this town so we moved to a completely different town and once we got there I told myself I'm like I gotta make my crowd and I knew the only way I was gonna really do that was basketball football or golf and so that was totally my passion was jumping in there and becoming as good as I can and I remember when I first started basketball

[00:40:17] I wasn't like I had this size but I wasn't natural at it and I remember the my sixth or seventh grade basketball coach even though I was a tallest or the second tallest I remember seeing him like kind of crack jokes that I was uncoordinated and stuff like that I kind of remember that and then all sudden fast forward three or four years later when I was in high school and I was the starting quarterback for our varsity team already

[00:40:43] I remember going back to the junior high for something and I remember running into that or maybe I ran into that coach somewhere in town and I remembered he's like what are you doing with yourself nowadays Dudley and I just said well coach and varsity at the high school and I remember him laughing at he's like

[00:40:59] Yeah right and so like all those little things kind of they just fueled me so at first I just I wanted to do something to pay my parents back for being that kid that burnt the house down literally and then I don't know just I think it began this drive to just be fully committed to honestly fully committed to training because I never had raw talent I just had size to start with so then it just I realized like if I knew every person's positions every single person if I knew what they needed to do every play I would be a leader I could look at them you know what you need to do know okay you're gonna pull you're gonna come across you're gonna pick up the first defense event like I knew every X and every o on the play books and so that was I don't know I think some of that looking back thinking about it now some that probably rolls over and to just what molded my personality of going deep into this stuff do you ever talk to your dad about your mom for that matter but me your dad just because he's a psychologist by training about kind of the wisdom they had to that cuz I know

[00:42:18] I've heard you talk about this a little bit in the past and it sounds like your parents handled this as well as any parents could have I mean I have to think that if a hundred parents had a hundred nine year old boys in that situation like ninety nine of those can end up a lot worse where that kid never recovers from that for example like if one of my kids burned down the house

[00:42:42] I'm just not I don't know I don't know how I'd handle that it's hard it's hard to think about yeah yeah what's hard is not having my dad losing all of his stuff from from his military not having any baby photos everything your parents had like all that stuff's haunting it is like no one could tell me anything that wouldn't make me feel bad about that because in the end I know that they never had to tell me that my dad's never said oh man all my well that's the part that amazes me right yes sort of like that you never yeah that your parents had the understanding that you were going to beat yourself up in eternity over that that they never needed to vent their frustration to you that to me is that's remarkable and it's it's kind of an amazing testament to them and I'm sure they weren't perfect no parent is but that may be their single most exceptional parenting moment yeah we're event yeah for sure and it's another one of those another one of those perfect examples of when negative things happen it's an opportunity to to really change full direction or make something out of it if something blows up there's new pieces there you can build it in a new way because the pieces wouldn't be there that wouldn't have happened right it would still be kind of a solid object that wouldn't have anything so I've just

[00:44:05] I've kind of taken that and dedicated myself to just really want to make my dad proud in that aspect and then kind of rolled it into for whatever reason this archery thing was all of a sudden this was the same sort of thing from the training from the dedication the competition was still there I wasn't good at it but more importantly the archery was for me I think that was the first thing that was really for me again because that was what I loved not what I think I was worried about my dad really loving and I don't know it was in a small way it was also when I knew people thought it was a bad idea it was a lot like when that coach said you're never gonna be a varsity player because that same sort of thing happened with archery people told me they're like I asked about what's these national events or world championships you're never gonna be that good that's what I was told I was told that and then a year later I was already at my first Triple Crown as an amateur two years later I was already and a World Championship as an amateur three and a half years later I was already in the pro class and by the fourth year from that day within four years of that day I was a Rookie of the

[00:45:29] Year in the pro class so I want to just pause for a moment and make sure people understand some of the nuts and bolts about this because if we were talking about football people would understand what the sport is and what the quarterback does and what a wide receiver does and what a touchdown is and all those things I think in archery

[00:45:46] I mean even it's sort of funny like how many hours a day do I do this and my wife still doesn't actually know anything about archery we were gonna laughing about the other day at dinner right know every day at dinner you're like let me put this in this perspective every day and god bless her it's not from a lack of interest it's just the reality of it it's if you're not out there behind a bow looking at something at a distance and knowing what those distances are like I don't think a normal person walks through the world thinking about what is the difference between 50 yards and 60 yards and a hundred yards and 20 yards so can you explain how the competition works what is the actual event what does an actual event look like there are several events but yeah there's so many I've shot on probably four or five different types of

[00:46:30] Pro Tours over the years and all of them have different rules the one thing that's consistent about football you're always on the same field you always have four downs you always have four quarters with archery each event has a certain number of arrows at shoot and once that score happens some events when it's done top three that's it some once the top five scores at the end of the ranking round or qualification around and then the top five will go in they'll shoot down to a winner some have more like an olympic-style round where you shoot a ranking round they rank everybody they rank one to 64 and then number one will shoot against number 64 number two sheets against sixty-three type thing and you'll have brackets and you shoot all the way down into a gold medal match and depending on the event some events are multiple distance through multiple days some events are fixed distances the maximum is up to 90 meters so back they've actually canceled this round here recently but back when I competed a full feet around was 30 meters 50 meters 70 meters 90 meters ito stands for back then it was a federation international was his French I don't even know what it was now it's called world archery they made it much simpler but yeah you would shoot rounds at 30 50 70 90 meters and then once the qualls were done the head-to-heads would all be shot at 70 meters which is 77 yards that was for that type of event my favourite event was the field archery formats which is multiple size bull's-eyes proportion depending on the distance that you're shooting anywhere from 20 meters out to about 80 and you would shoot one round that had marked distance one round that was unmarked distance and then you'd go into qualifications that were half and a half so let's put some specs to this so people understand what we're talking about so most people know how long a football field is that's just a touch over you put it on the one-yard line honestly this almost goes back to like me hugging that football right right so you're on the one-yard line football field the other end zone is 99 yards away which is 90 meters okay so a professional Archer one of the top professional archers can hit with their bow at that distance if they took ten shots what size diameter would they be able to land ten shots inside of this

[00:49:13] Jocko coffee cup right here is about the size of the ten so the ten ring there is about that's about two and a half to three inches no that'd be wider than that do you think looks like about four inches max right that's three inches yeah yeah we could look up the exact area but it's pretty small so take your through the jugs is slightly big coffee mug yeah it's a larger coffee mug but if they shot ten shots most I would say most pro archers are gonna hit that eight out of ten okay let's pause for one more moment here and now explain another distinction which we have yet to explain to the listener which is we talk interchangeably about bows but if anyone ever turns on the Olympics they are watching one type of bow but most of what you shoot and all of what I shoot is a different type of bow can you explain that difference so if you're watching the Olympic Games they shoot recurves so those bows are very long and it's a handle with wooden limbs which are the parts that Bend and there's a string that's a recurve bow so what we're shooting is what's called a compound which is a bow that has round wheels on it that essentially store energy so as you pull it back the limbs of the

[00:50:33] Bowflex but they also have this cam system that's I guess for layman's turn imagine like gears on a bike where as you're going through those gears you have the ability to make it easier at some point so as you pull this back the cam rolls over into kind of a different position to where it gets easier as you get closer to your fully extended position that's probably the easiest way to say it right and it's a little bit easier to hold it at full draw but because of that you're also able to shoot much more poundage at the beginning of that pull cycle so in other words in the Olympics a heavy recurve shooter would be shooting about fifty pounds because as he pulls that bow back every inch he pulls it back further that weight continually increases as he pulls it back so once he gets a full draw that in no way gets easier whereas ours we could shoot a 70 pound bow and as we start to pull it it'll peak at 70 pounds fairly soon and then it gets easier and easier and easier and kind of it drops back you can be much more accurate with the compound bow and you can also achieve much longer distances because the energy stored is greater so the typical speed so your bow or my bow my boat I just know this because it's my bows 292 feet per second is what I would call the muzzle velocity you're close to 100 miles an hour yeah which the way I described it to

[00:52:05] Olivia when she's watching me shoot is if I shoot 50 yards it's taking about half a second to get there what's the speed on a recurve on an Olympians bow way less like way way less and in the Olympics they shoot what distance 70 meters which I've only ever fired a recurve at 20 I don't even understand how those guys fire recurves at 77 yards yeah it's impressive they use the same type of process that I teach just with a different system and actually our our us guy he's a close I can't say he's a close friend because I've known him since he was a kid I liked his dad a lot his dad was a very well respected person and I gave radius' first recurve bow he was shooting a compound but he wanted to get into shooting Olympic style archery so I gave him his first recurve bow and he just set a new world record with it he's one I think medals the last two he's phenomenal he's an amazing Archer but he's just set a new world record this morning Wow explain what the world rec

[00:53:10] I think he shot a 7:01 out of 720 so that's the exact same scoring thing I just talked about so out of 720 points he shot 700 won in this coffee cup with that recurve oh so that's enough you get 72 shots that's 72 shots 72 shots every time you're in that exact 10 ring which is the inside of a coffee cup 77 yards away you'd get a 10 so that means presumably he got nine nines and the rest were tens or some combination there yeah I mean and what's impressive about it too is a lot of times when you're off with the recurve like if you make a really poor shot with the recurve it's really poor so it's possible one of those was a 1 and then so probably not with him but yeah it would have been easy to do out of 72 arrows which is why those scores even though people might have the pace to do that the reality is because they're shooting with fingers - they're not allowed to shoot a mechanical release so it's pretty phenomenal it's amazing to watch it but as amazing as that is that was never a pursuit of mine because these guys trained for four years for one event and although there are world champs and

[00:54:24] World Cups in between sad part about archery is the money pays out a lot more in the compound Pro class than in the recurve class and there's more people there the cost of getting it in is higher - so although that's the Olympic sport the Olympians their paydays are when they win medals and that payday is really only every four years now they'll I'm sure they're getting compensated to shoot but like for me for example my rookie year if I won a pro event the guaranteed payout was ten thousand by the time you got some of your contingency checks you were making fifteen grand a weekend on a win world champs were thirty thousand shooter the years were fifty thousand if you win the vegas indoor tournament which is every february that pays about fifty thousand whereas with the recurve they may make five or ten I don't know does anybody hunt with oh yeah there are guys that'll still hunt on the recurve yeah I was wondering if that was also part of the reason you favored compound which was you started as a hunter yeah then became an archer the two go hand-in-hand I mean they feed off each other yeah yeah I always said and you and I talked about this and you told me you said now that I'm doing this and I've kind of became a target Archer

[00:55:47] I went to Linda high I hunted axis you said I understand that saying that you have which what I tell people is I'm a target Archer in order to be a better bow hunter and I'm a better bow hunter because I'm a target Archer I feel like there's a very very important puzzle piece to being ethical that involves you giving everything you have to be in the absolute best Archer you can be and being able to know your limitations on shots and the reality is we talked about like when Sharon was gonna run that half marathon she prepped for it I just I just decided to do it I didn't know my limitations I just went did it did I do it yeah I did it but in a hunting situation guys that just know how to shoot a bow and then go out and then just take those shots at animals

[00:56:43] I feel like morally there's gonna come a point where if their shot doesn't connect where they want that's gonna be hard to deal with so I've always felt like ethically I need to know my limitations because when that moment happens I'm gonna be able to make ideally make a perfect shot or the more I've done it in practicing in weird conditions the more you realize this might not be a shot I should even take even though I know I can technically shoot this far which you learned from me the list of things I've learned from you

[00:57:24] John is unbelievable and you know we'll link in this podcast to the interview where I was on your podcast and of course I don't want to chew up any of our time here retelling stuff I talked about there which was of how this all spoke to me and what this all why what you're saying resonated so much and that's something that to this task tell can't answer you know you asked me that question I gave you the best answer I had and in the end

[00:57:48] I still don't know I just think there are some people for whom that degree of perfection is so blissful there's such an amazing State and you know my wife said something to me about six months ago which she's never said about any of my obsessions because she's known me for 19 years now and she's been through many seasons of obsession we were talking about the anastomosis in surgery and swimming and cycling and archery and racecar driving and all these things both past and present that are my obsessions and she said you get so pissed off when you're having a bad day in your given sport I used to call her every morning after swim practice on my way to work

[00:58:30] I'd go early a swim masters and then I'd drive into work and she'd be heading to work and probably just call him say hey and she's like I could tell from your voice how the practice went and you have to understand something here we're talking about masters swimming like nobody cares not on the national team right I don't have a Wheaties contract like no body cares in fact nobody else in the pool can tell if I was one second off per hundred that day like it's just not at that level but I mean my day would rise or fall as a function of that and the same thing like if I'm in the simulator for two hours and I come in and I'm surly and pissy she knows like you just didn't drive well and she's like I don't know what it is about archery but she's like this I've only seen you twice pissed off for shooting bad usually even when you if you come in and I say how did you do you'd be like I sucked but you're not pissed it's almost like there's a benefit to archery for my psyche that goes beyond the performance there's something about the act of doing it that is in and of itself beautiful even if I don't meet the objective so the journey seems to matter as much as the destination in archery is anything I've ever done do you feel that way or because you have done it at such a high level do you struggle more with those days or those seasons which I'm sure there have been seasons or months or whatever when you've been off your form yeah yeah I mean there's certainly times that there's been times where where I have felt it but there's also times where I quickly realize that when

[01:00:19] I do that in archery it makes it worse really fast the thing with archery is it really is a sport of Zen and clarity you shoot better when you're trying less so when you get mad you only get worse at it and so this was something that I talked about a lot in my training is I was really fortunate to have a coach walked by me one time and he was a coach he was a well known coach that worked with some athletes but he wasn't one that was kind of sanctioned I don't even know how he got with some of the athletes that he was with but he was with a few really high level athletes and he worked with maybe two or three in the archery world but he was there watching one of his guys shoot and he kind of saw me make a bad shot on a target and I came unglued which I've talked about this in football if I threw an interception I could just run after the guy and if I couldn't get to him I could just hit someone and then especially in high school guess what I played offense defense kicker punter I could just hit someone I could get it out somehow there was release whereas with archery there wasn't so my release would be snapping an arrow over my leg or breaking a stabilizer or when the shoots all over and I know I'm not making the shoot off round like wait until everyone's walking in and freaking hammer toss in my bow through the woods and walking away from it

[01:01:58] I had those moments right I was young sometimes I wasn't even 20 I want to go back to that for a moment because if you're 20 that means you're only one or two years post making this crazy decision to forego oh yeah a football scholarship to work for for 10 an hour to try to become an archer and so when you're breaking an arrow snapping your stabilizer and throw-in your bow into the woods are there moments of doubt where you're saying I could be the starting quarterback in Carolina now like were you ever looking back saying no what was your self-talk in that moment of of anger something defeated me that day and it wasn't gonna do it tomorrow that's what I was like I wasn't looking back I was always right there what's happening now is what I'm focused on and this coach told me he said you're never gonna be any different than you are right now until you realize that the only arrows you have control on are those ones that are in your quiver and I kind of looked at him and he goes do you know how to get that arrow back that's in down there in that five ring I kind of like looked at him again and he goes do you know anyone that can pull that arrow back to this shooting line from that target and I just said no and he goes and you never will he was the only thing you have control on is what you haven't shot yet and he goes you gotta let that go it's the past and that like was so changing for me because it got to the point where

[01:03:29] I started just I was talking to arrows in my quiver one would shoot I'd make a bad shot and think well okay I shot a five now I'm gonna need at least three 12s to dig out of that hole so I'd look into my quiver and be like which one of you son of want to shoot at 12 cuz we got some work to make up for your down there so just feel like are you the one and I'd grab it and I just started doing that and things started to change but what I learned about archery and what I liked about it and the reason why I went into a lot of different techniques or form of archery is because

[01:04:07] I really liked the training aspect I loved it I like prepping I really like to prep so I think that's a big reason why I like to cook I love to eat at the end but I also like when you say hey let's cook I kind of just let me prep so by the way have I had all been successful this week in convincing you to create a sub channel on your YouTube channel for cooking maybe I'll just interject for a moment those of you obviously you've heard this in the intro but school of knock-knock on TV on

[01:04:43] YouTube unbelievable not on Archie on YouTube is it not gonna see I did I just click on the link oh yeah so if you just go to youtube and put knock on it shows up yeah and it's not don't put a K at the beginning it's n Ock just like an arrow knock not like it's a good more than your way to be clear but your cooking is it extra reminds me so much of my father so you know I grew up in a restaurant people always say to me like

[01:05:08] I like to cook as well and people always ask me for recipes like they'll come over and have like that salmon that we had the other day and they'll be like which was the bomb thank you that was the bomb and people always say like hey man can you give me that recipe and I actually finally one day wrote up the recipe for that but I know that whatever

[01:05:25] I wrote is not actually what I normally make I'm always just doing it by pinch of this a pinch of that if you ask me like what temperature I'm cooking an at or how long I don't know I just watch it I just like my dad I remember him literally telling me like once the salmon starts to sweat it's done and I remember trying to explain that to somebody when they're like what the hell are you talking about I was like it just made sense of oil bubbles bro yeah yeah and so you're a lot like my dad when my dad's here and he's cooking it is so enjoyable because it's just I call it street style cooking like it's just a little bit what do you got just show me what you got I'll make it work and you are awesome and we have that's what we've done have consumed we've eaten really well this week by the way I've lost 4 pounds since you've been here which is crazy given how much I've eaten but it's because like part of it is I've eaten so well will we fast a lot during the day we're pretty fasting a little bit than normal but but it's like our dinners are super clean and a lot of times if the entrees not that great I'll end up nibbling on my kids leftovers and crap like their mac and cheese or whatever junk food they're eating but like there's been none of that this week so it's just like yeah it's anyway you do have a gift for cooking I mean I'm not just saying that it's really really been a pleasure to watch the way you interact and think about stuff like even last night you just had that idea out of the blue which was oh my god like if you put this sugar-free maple syrup into this type of mustard and glaze it on the salmon like boom we got to try that oh

[01:06:56] I've gone further than that I woke up thinking if we infuse that if we smoke that syrup and then infuse it into like some frozen whisky balls and imagine the old fashions we can make I woke up thinking about that you have got to pursue this this is a non-negotiable back to the more serious stuff so well yeah cuz I'm trying to get to like so all those processes that I was talking about I just started to realize that I was I was very task driven like all this stuff has always been about it's always been about tasks now it's hard I will say it's hard for me to I can't

[01:07:37] I shouldn't say I can't but it's hard for me to be at my absolute best as a performer during practice because I do perform better when I soon as I turn around and I see people putting cameras on me that's a drive for me that I can perform better than I need that push but I did do a lot of research and I kind of started I read a book I'd read a book called mind gym and I don't read a lot because I don't have a lot of time GIM

[01:08:10] Gyu mmm-hmm because I was really trying to figure out so this is something that's been interesting to me for a long time because I really struggle with a DD and I've been clinically tested I went through a psychological full evaluation for my a DD and my LD which was a full day going through as a teenager yeah yeah because I struggled part of the problem was once I was working at that archery shop I did want to still go to college but I realized really quick it was I realized I had never really taken a book home I just always got passed in classes because I was excelling as an athlete and so I really really struggled with that and I struggled with attention I struggled with certain things there's a lot of things that were distracting so my dad's like I'm gonna take you to one of my friends and we're gonna really test you for this so I have a pretty severe case of a DD and I have an LD as well and so

[01:09:12] I started realizing that in what is the particular LD did they define it clearly probably but I would not know unless I gave you my eval it's kind of a thick eval and I probably have it somewhere so what I learned was in archery I kind of zone out in archery I really feel like that's a big part of why I'm good at it and I'm the same when I weight lifts like I can do something repetitive so many times that I almost get it to a trance in it and it takes someone to like snap me out of that and in competition it's been that way to where

[01:09:47] I've been competing and for example like a cameraman or a videographer says hey man sorry for bumping it up during that shot I'm like when he's like I bumped your elbow and I'm completely oblivious to it because to me I'm so zoned out on that so I really started diving into this I really wanted to find out some of these people that write sports psychology books I was really curious if there's some type of connection between high level athletes that have a DD in other words they're hyper focused they're hyper focused just kind of by makeup and there's certainly times where if a lots going on I can be distracted but during those same times I can be having a conversation with you and people can be trying to get my attention and equally I don't get so I was kind of diving down this road of is this 82 e making me better me getting into my own zone because I also got to the point where during certain practices when I would practice with certain music there were times where I could get into flow states that were honestly that most people don't believe

[01:11:06] I mean I've had times where I shot 99 shots one time into the same era hole without stretching it it took an hour and a half of doing it but I remember I had I had like kind of a meditative type album playing it was just I didn't even know it but it was on repeat like it was on repeat on my playlist so the same song had been playing for an hour and a half and I never knew it and then I would just get into these flow States like that so I started looking up there a connection between people that have these types of hyper focusing and are these people also people that get into a flow state better because then at that point I was almost at the point of retirement and this stuff was starting to become clear to me and I'm thinking as a coach if I get to the point where

[01:11:56] I'm coach and national team's I'm gonna be looking for this I want to be able to find this and so then at that same time I started going into these books and I started to see the difference in personality types between ego driven and task driven personality types so and then clearly I am a task driven mentality

[01:12:20] I looked at a lot of times the task driven personality type athletes are normally the ones that kind of go down at their peak levels for the longest period of time they might not peak as high as the ego driven but as fast as the ego driven can peak they can also to sell so when people are looking at do you want the superstar the ego driven is like your route do you want the task driven the task driven is what you build a team off of yeah it was pretty interesting to go down those if you looked into that stuff have you ever dove down those roads I have and there's other things that I think I think about when I hear people like you talk about things that shape them so you've said already a couple of things that I think are really relevant to my observation of exceptional performers one of them you said you just said it outright but a lot of people don't articulate it is directly you love to practice I have yet to meet a world-class exceptional performer who didn't love to practice so when you talk to Lance Armstrong or his teammates Lance's teammates will you know I'm spoken with at least one of them they'll tell stories about how it just didn't matter like when it was early season training and the ride was supposed to be a six hour grueling ride at the end of six hours Lance wanted to more sometimes he would just go do it by himself and again it's so funny to me it just nothing makes me sort of more annoyed that people simply want to dismiss a natural talent of these cyclists because they thought they also haven't used performance-enhancing drugs and I've interviewed Apolo Ohno on this podcast as well and his appetite for training was just unbelievable I've worked out with Apollo and it's just so much fun to work out with him even as a he's ten years post his Olympian life but he just still like has this complete love for training even though he's not at that same level and so this is it's this love for practice and that's this ability to practice deliberately and to practice correctly and to appreciate that and I just don't think you can get to an exceptional level without that of course my other favorite example of that is Ayrton Senna greatest driver in the history of motorsport and when you talk to people who were around him who I've spoken with many people

[01:14:36] I've obviously never knew him or speak to him but people who were around him they all say the same thing which is just his attention to detail was second to none when every other driver had left he was still there he'd spend the night in the garage talking to the mechanics he knew as much about the car as they knew more than any other driver could know about the car so the two feet off each other I don't know which one's the chicken and which one's the egg truthfully in other words I don't know if the best of the best are the best because they do those things or if because they're doing those things because of something else that is making them the best again for me personally it's just I've never been at that level so but I feel grateful that especially when it comes to something like archery like I enjoy the process I think I was saying to junior we were talking yesterday we were out there shooting when you were working with Josh and I was like I've never once stopped practice shooting practice out of boredom there's only two reasons I've ever stopped shooting in the past two and a half years and it's either I just have a time constraint like I have a phone call I got to get on or something or I physically just break down like I can't hold the bow any longer and my form is deteriorating so rapidly and I never thought of that until like the other day and I was like man that is that's really fun like that's so cool that there is something I can be that you could love that much because you can't say that about a lot of things most things well yeah most things like you can get bored of you can only watch so much YouTube before you're like I'm kind of done with this I can't watch one more Jimmy Kimmel video or whatever it is I got to go do something else I think those attributes are so important to just lifestyle I mean we're talking right now about sport but there's times luckily I've got to the point where I work independently we have a business that me and my wife I kind of do the educational side and then there's a product side that she runs our e-commerce but I still work independently for a lot of people as a consultant and having something to do and being active in that stuff like that is part of a personality type and it's part of a personality type I believe of someone that gets successful in not just one thing but a magnitude of things because there's a lot of people out there that want to be a successful business person or they want to have a successful business and there's times where people will come forward and say hey if you do consulting or if you do brand representation what do you normally charge and we'll talk about that and then all sudden they come forward and then I realized really quick wait a minute this is like being on the team where the coach doesn't know what we're doing for practice no one knows when they get here and I just tell them really fast like this isn't the right team for me I'm here too it's like having that person that wants to lift with you but they never show up if you're someone that has

[01:17:36] Drive you just that's not part of your equation that's a disruption and it's amazing to me how many people that have really good concepts have really good investors and then they come forward and it's almost like if I look at it as a sport there's no task the task portion or the work portion of this thing which a lot of times having a product reveal is that's like being at the world chance but not having all the preparation going into that really in the time that goes into that and start to see that bloom and essentially you see the fruit of that if you don't have it it's just I don't know it's not my DNA to want to be part of that and the amount of people that I know that fail because they are really good about the start and they're really good about wanting to know how they want to finish but they kind of lack the in-between it's just a destructive path and it's unfortunate because I've seen good business concepts

[01:18:47] I've seen good people and I've seen good and best investors fail and I normally see it pretty quick where I'm like hey I'm out there's another thing you've done that one can never fully project this or convey this to people without them knowing you but I do think there's still an ability to convey it somewhat and that is your podcast even in your opening line to the podcast says this is a podcast for all archers of all interest skill levels independent of equipment you use this out of the other thing and I want to come back and sort of sing the praises of why your podcast is sort of one of the most important podcasts for me but there's something that you do that I know a lot of people aspire to be able to do which is you are someone who can sell something honestly and that's not to say you're the same I aspire to it I don't know if truthfully

[01:19:38] I convey as much of it as you but I know like I just know anytime I see something on your site I can just buy it like I don't have to say I wonder if Dudley's just selling this because he's getting a kickback on it that's bigger than if he was I think that's rare that's hard to do it's hard to do that because we're humans and I know were even subconsciously we can be motivated by things we don't see but do you spend a lot of time thinking about the choices you make because I mean I even told you this a while ago but when

[01:20:10] I was buying a Target bow a year ago I mean I was torn between two companies and I tried both of the bows out and I spent a lot of time and a lot of reps on each bow and I mean in the end you reviewed them and there was the one that you went with is the one I went with I mean in the end it was just gonna come down to that so it was that leap of faith I probably even paid more for the bow and that's the type of leap of faith

[01:20:35] I think you take when you trust what somebody has to say about something and of course in my world it's there's different types of products oh yeah yours is million times worse than mine yeah there's more snake oil in my world than yours for sure I guess what I'm getting at in a long-winded way is your credibility is enormous there's always people out I know there's a lot of people that just they're incredibly jealous of the success that you've had because your success has really been as a teacher something we haven't even talked about yet but we're going to but the reality of it is anybody who I've ever spoken with who's got even a half-decent head on their shoulders and who's honest they can say look I don't agree with everything that Lee says but he's the real deal and he is on it I mean he is he's credible you can take what he says to the bank how deliberate is that for you to cultivate that well it's super important I mean it's really really important I was really lucky that when I was 18 and about to turn pro I went to an archery trade show and I walked by a company that I had just kind of started working with but I really wasn't working with him but I walked by and I saw him in the process of building their booth and I could tell they were late and this is at a trade show so if you've ever gone any type of trade show you know you go in one or two days before people build this thing so I walked in and it was Matthews it was Matthews archery and I could tell that they were late and that they were building this new booth and it was a brand new and they couldn't quite figure out how it all went together so I walked up and I said hey do you guys need help and they said yeah so I jumped in there and I helped and ended up building this booth up and then the next day I was in there and just started talking about product to different people and expressing my opinion and then when that trade show was over since I was already there I'm like well hey I'll help you guys get out of here and I helped tear it down that was just kind of what you do right that's just part of personality types especially the ones I like and the next I think it was on the Monday I got a call from the president of the company and he just said hey I'd love to hire you as a sales rep you were had unbelievable people skills and and so and so and eventually I went to work for that archery company at 18 and a half or 19 years old which was very small very few employees fast forward 10 years Inc 500 business twice massive company we recruited the largest ambassador team in the history of archery had the largest payouts in tournament archery of anybody and because I was internal in that company I saw a lot of our people that we were paying to represent us make really poor judgment calls that not only not only made themselves look bad but also at times made the company look bad and then also forced the company to make to make quick decisions on them too we're looking back we were like man that we really need to cut this guy loose maybe we didn't but at the time for him to release confidential information yeah it wasn't good or so because I was young and saw people making mistakes that we were essentially hiring as

[01:24:07] Pro staffers and I was a pro staffer as well and then also because I was a pro staffer that worked for the company so I was directly employed by this company that employed this massive Pro staff so when I would go to an event I had rules on me that were ten times everyone else's like if I made a poor call on someone zero there was like a pro calling in saying like hey what the heck you guys are my sponsor and Dudley called my hair off this weekend I thought it was in so I kind of started to have to deal with that stuff and because I dealt with all those little things it just really started to mold me on looking dot in my eyes cross my T's understanding that your integrity is the archery world is very small in these bridges there's only a few bridges and when you burn them they're burned that's it so the company I work for now Hoyt they were our biggest competitor and when I worked at Matthews and I had lots of opportunities at sales conferences or product reveals or trade shows to talk poorly about the product even though they had a good product I could have easily talked bad about him I could have talked about about the employees because

[01:25:24] I really didn't know him but in the end I always told him I'm like hey this is a small world there's only a few archery companies I said one day we might be working together maybe who knows and honestly the day that I left Matthews the first company that called me was our biggest competitor they're like is it true you're not with Matthews yes it is we would like to talk and that was very clear to me that me being straightforward and truthful all the time especially owning up to when I make mistakes and publicly telling everybody about when I make a mistake about this or that I think it's just critical and I don't work with products I don't like a hundred percent how do you hand a little win let's say you were at Matthews or you're now at Hoyt and there's a product that comes along and you don't like a piece of it I mean I guess maybe now it's different because of who you are you alone or a four of nature within the archery world but before you were the John Dudley how did you sort of handle that gap between this is something I'm not happy with guys like I can't go out and sell this product and them say hey man like do your job well there's two things to that one is if I really didn't like it I can only shot what I shot last year the good thing is they've all trusted me enough to where I'm normally shooting stuff three to six months before anyone else anyway and I normally know about it a year before and you're putting feedback into it oh yeah no question but the other thing is when stuff comes out there's times where competitors have brought out products that are definitely inferior to ones that I like the bottom line is you don't talk about what other people do bad you don't talk about what you do bad you talk about what you do right or you talk about what you do better and that's how it always was when I would go up and have these PR press releases in front of the media I would be going up and talking about what we had at matthieu's that was better than anybody else I didn't have to say these guys are five feet slower per second these guys have a one inch shorter brace height this bow has 7% more vibration in it what I would do is be like we have 7% less vibration than some of the models on the market we've got a more generous brace height we come in at five feet per second faster this bow shoots a lot smoother in the hand for me I always feel like if you focus on either what you're doing right what your company's doing right or what you want to do right you're just going down a super shady road to pick on the things that people might not be doing right at that time and if it's a product that I feel isn't right you're just not going to see me do a review about it I'm not gonna do a review to say it's poor all I'm gonna do is find another product to distract your attention to something that is a better option for you well it's great because again now you are at the point where you the gravitas that you can just sort of curate what is the best and then that makes life a lot easier for people like me and I talked about this a lot on your podcast but there's ten different turns of complete luck that just allowed me to from the day I got my first beau to be sort of plugged in straight from junior right into your YouTube channel and all of your videos and by extension then the methodology which sort of leads me to my next question when did it become clear to you that you had a knack for teaching which a lot of people who are exceptional at the craft are actually not the best teachers at it so there's a very rare overlap between people who are in say the top 1% of doing something and then the top 1% of teaching that's not a huge overlap I don't really know how that came to be I think some of its personality I mean I'm a good PR person

[01:29:34] I like communicating with people I think I'm easy to engage with so I think that naturally helps any teacher or any coach even donkeys I mean I've seen you interact with standing donkeys I was debating whether you're gonna release that to your followers but I'm hoping by the time this podcast has come out the donkey video is virus already out and we will just be linking to it through this podcast okay it might be but I've also been really fortunate to be around really good coaches too that did a great job of leading by example of teaching and like I said I've I've always thrived to learn how to do stuff better it was that way even about weight lifting like earlier today I was at

[01:30:25] Frank Zane's house he's a former mr. Olympia and Frank and I have been friends a long time we met because he loved archery and him and Arnold shot archery as their R&R during their kind of golden era bodybuilding right and so we met at an Arnold Classic and him and I hit it off and he asked for archery lessons and I said yeah sure and what was funny is he said well I'm doing a bodybuilding or I'm doing a training seminar up at a gym in

[01:30:56] Minneapolis so he said what I might do is rent a car and I said actually I'll if I can sit in your class I'd love to drive up so I went up and sat into his class and I saw how he delivered and I'm like man I said you have such a really cool presentation technique and then he just said well up until the last three years of my bodybuilding career I had to have a job as a teacher he's like that's what I do and he was perfect at it so he gave me pointers about delivery and how to put things in front of people to where they can see it and understand it or you can express it and understand it or also how you can if you're really good at what you're talking about you can find a way pretty fast to relate it to something that you know the person you're coaching also likes so I didn't know a lot about you I knew a few details I knew you're into f1 I knew that a new year in the swimming biking obviously when I worked with Jocko I knew Jacko's background as a seal so when I explain certain things

[01:32:05] I might not be the best relating it exactly of how you do it within your field but I can give you just enough to where all of a sudden hopefully you grasp what it is I'm saying just in case I'm talking on a level that's like outside of your world when we talked about the speed of your shot execution I told you I said you're making a great shot but you're making your shot at a very accelerated pace and so I told you it's a lot like if you have a group of people in a car and I say hey let's go 100 miles an hour but I don't want anyone in the car to know that you did it I said you would throttle at a pace to where you were continual and gradual and you would be there but you wouldn't be there with snap and everyone's next backwards and I said right now with your release you're putting your finger on the trigger and you're wanting this shot to happen so fast even though you're executing it properly you're executing it too aggressively so

[01:33:11] I said I want you to make this happen without letting anyone know that it's happening and then the next shot I'm like dude that's it and then right away I thought oh okay I said how much did that relate to you and your car simulator and you're like oh instantly it clicked well not only that I think what was the very very first thing the very first insight was about the elbow position do we talk about this quite a bit on your podcast and you put a video together that's really nice that explains this and I know that many people listening to this aren't a lot of stuff won't make sense but the example the point you were making was look right now here with your hand that's in the back your release hand the elbow is probably about five to eight degrees off where it need to be rotational degrees so yeah very little grossly looks like it's in the right spot but at that angle your lats and deltoids and biceps are doing the work when you have to release the shot and you said I want you to put your elbow here and I was at felt like a very unnatural position to me even that was only five seven degrees back like two inches like looking from the back it was like two inch it's so subtle but she said now I'm putting you in this position and I want you to notice all of a sudden your bicep is totally relaxed your lats totally relaxed and now all of the stress of holding that bow and that release is on your rhomboids which is a tiny little muscle and now you're going to release this air of just contracting those rhomboids which by the way we're partially being contracted before but it was being dwarfed by the larger muscles and you said and this was what really amazed me was you said think about how if you are driving a car you can easily use your quads glutes and hamstrings to move between the throttle and the brake but wouldn't it be more effective if you could just sort of use the heel and the toe going back and forth and the intrinsic muscles of the maybe a little bit of the calf in the anterior compartment of leg which of course is exactly how you drive you drive with finesse you drive using the smallest muscles possible and not stomping in a binary fashion where it's all or none but having that gradation of the difference between a ten pedal and a seven pedal and there's a big difference between a ten brake and a seven brake yeah I think that just impressed me and

[01:35:40] I won I got it immediately I mean it just spoke to me but - I was like you don't even know anything about driving like you're not obsessive about racecar driving that was very interesting to me that you picked that up but I guess I never realized that you've been thinking about this so much because I know you've done the same with Jocko like Jocko has talked to me about first time you told him how to shoot like you immediately related it to a rifle because you know he's got more experience shooting a rifle than virtually anybody and you could immediately put something in those terms and within minutes Jacko's like getting something that he just probably wouldn't have got for a longer period of time if you weren't able to connect it to him and I don't know I just thing

[01:36:21] I've just always been impressed by that and and I think your generosity and when it comes to teaching is really amazing I think look I think everybody I mean to me archery is a beautiful sport it's one of those sports like tennis where you can do it for a long time it's not like football you know the reality of it is if you got into college and you'd played football you wouldn't be playing football today like you might not be doing any might not be an archery today yeah yeah and I really hope that my kids get into it because everything you said about it this is an idea this flow state all of these things are beautiful you never want to hunt an animal in your life which was I certainly had no intention of hunting when I started it teaches you a lot about yourself and it is a beautiful metaphor for life in so many ways this ability to understand that the only arrow you have control over is the one that's still in your quiver you can't turn back time that's such an explicit thing your ability to teach this sport is I think somebody could literally study your videos and get 60 to 70% of the total theoretical benefit that could get having a great coach standing over their shoulder which is yeah hard to believe when you consider how new once the sport is I mean the list goes on and on but the number of students that I have that I've worked with less than a dozen times that are shooting at a level that back when I competed there were such a small percentage of shooters that were even at that level you get someone like Jocko worked with them for a day coach a little bit through the phone gave him a little bit of practice he showed up here I wouldn't guess a lot maybe a few times and then took him to his first tournament style event in July we went to Big Sky and I let him set up a course with me I actually built a course that some of our followers were shooting and I asked Jocko said you want to come out and set this course because

[01:38:17] I said I'll teach you why I'm building the course this way and what you'll learn from every shot and he's like absolutely so we went out I talked to him told him all about different techniques what you do what people that lay a course out do to trick you and so forth like that and he went out there and the day before the real shoot started I went up with Jocko and another seal buddy of ours Trevor and Sharon my wife and I said let's go up and shoot we won't shoot from like the competition steak will move closer and I said because I just want to talk you through something so after we did that we shot probably 20 or 30 targets shooting pretty close then also a little bit further back then further back then I'm like hey this one isn't bad you want to try this one from this steak and he's like yeah no problem and then the next day we show up and I had a private event where people had booked private shooting times to shoot with me and some of my

[01:39:18] VIP friends that I had there and so my intention was to shoot four or five targets with each of those groups so the very first group that I shot with was Jocko and another mutual friend of ours Andy and the people that had signed up so I shot five targets with them Jocko is hitting all the targets and he was shooting him from the proper state which was that course that I laid out averaged 71 yards it was super technical super hard and I told people the stake is the hardest shot here you're always welcome to walk closer there's no score cards here this is kind of a learning event and I got to the end and I remember asked Jacqueline like how did you do he's like I missed one target and he knew exactly why he knew exactly why and I said dude that is unbelievable for you to be shooting at best if he was adding up his arrows to what I would do in a day training when I was serious about it he might have shot three of my training days right and to be able to learn the techniques and the basics and be set up that perfectly with your equipment and then to have the understanding of what you need to do it's amazing but I really feel like it's a necessity not only the archery but to any sport for people to recognize the fact that the fundamentals is what makes people good at things and when people are good at things they stay involved so

[01:40:59] I've always said like my boy Harry he had some video games and stuff that he played in high school and normally for Christmas he'd ask for video games and I noticed really quick that the video games that he played all the time were the ones that he was good at the ones that he didn't win and the ones that were like failed those ones just went back in the drawer and they never got played again and and it's the same way and as parents especially now I look at any kids and I'm like what you need to do is you need to make this fun and you need to make sure that they're doing well at it a lot so that they stay involved with it but that wasn't necessarily the case for you I mean that to me is where but I was also older yet

[01:41:47] I remember so do you think that that's sort of what you're just describing is what's necessary when you're dealing with kids that are in their early teens or preteen preteens for sure you know like yourself your nerd it out right now with archery right and you really want your kids to maybe be involved so if they said hey I want to shoot it's highly likely that you would probably be a little bit more intense with that practice then what I would say is get the biggest bullseye possible put one target that's ten yards away even if you're shooting at 70 or 80 and let them shoot at ten yards all the time and just say okay you shoot for the gold and I'm gonna shoot for the gold and then they're gonna hit nine out of ten and they're always gonna be beaten dad right and they're gonna like that when I started our tree part of the reason why

[01:42:42] I didn't liked it but also didn't get super serious about it is because my arrows were all the ones that my dad had lost bent or picked up in the lost-and-found bucket at the archery range so I was just shooting a smorgasbord of arrows and getting a smorgasbord of results down on the paper so it's amazing to me that I really stuck with it because I probably would have been more infatuated with it and honestly I probably looking back because naturally I think you said it the other day I went out and you made a shot and it was super peaceful in the morning and you made this shot and was like don't don't and you go do you think there's something primal about that sound and I said yeah absolutely like that is a primal sound and you were excited about that you had that excitement I feel like there could easily have been a good chance that me turning into this punk kid it might not have ever happened if I would have really got into like going to an archery range with my dad if

[01:43:51] I would have been good at it really liked it like that could have been my thing so I don't really know but I think that's important for especially for me working with kids now and I'm pretty limited on who I work with like yourself but when I do work with people I tell parents all the time I'm like you can't acclimate your kid - as soon as he shoots looking at you for you to tell them what the score is I'm like that is a really bad training thing for you to do because I'm like you're imprinting your result him immediately wanting your feedback for whether he hit or missed or she and I just think it can't be about that I'm tell the parents regardless of what your kids score watch him on the shooting line and tell them when they're shooting good or tell them when they might need to make technique changes if they're if maybe they're not executing properly I think finding that balance I think it really helps not only the kid but I think it helps the sport all sports because I think people be involved in it or when they are that way let's pivot a little bit to hunting because it's hard to talk about our tree without talking about this extension of archery which is hunting using the tools of archery and as I talked about in some length I guess on your podcast when I got into archery it was purely for the desire to shoot paper targets and learn a new skill that would meet the Peter itea criteria of you could spend your entire life trying to get the last twenty percent of value that'll be so incrementally no one will notice but you which give you a huge kick but eventually I did decide to go out and hunt and it has changed my relationship with archery for reasons you've already somewhat alluded to first of all the stakes are much higher now so now every time I miss a shot on a paper target it hurts a little more I imagine for a moment any one of these shots I take could be a shot in the field against an animal and if I missed that shot and I injure that animal non fatally or injure that animal or cause that animal to suffer I made a mistake and that of course is exactly what got me interested in the sport in the first place was that concept even though I never wanted to apply it to hunting if that makes sense you've spoken a lot in fact I think that when you and Joe Rogan have spoken about hunting on his podcast which you fried rogon like five times or something I've heard every one of those podcasts they were super enjoyable I think you and Joe have some of the best back and forth on this because I mean one I just I think

[01:46:31] Joe is a really smart human being and he's always good at seeing sort of both sides of every discussion so it's not what a lot of people might expect which is to knuckle head bros talking about how hunting is the best thing in the world and anybody who doesn't like hunting is a hippie or something it's not at all like that right it's a very nuanced discussion so one of the things that you've often alluded to is the yin and the yang of this sort of tension that exists so I've been thinking about how to talk about this and there's so much in my mind around this but I'll start with just maybe explain to someone who's listening to this who's never hunted who's never thought much about it one way or the other which is effectively where I was two years ago and never really given it a thought how does hunting fit into conservation like what does it mean to hunt and who decides what animals get to be hunted and when and in what quantity like is it the Wild West we're caring and just go shoot anything they want how does this whole thing work no so each state has Department of

[01:47:33] Natural Resources or Department of Game and Fish they do a lot of studies on where that species is at and what the population numbers are at and with that they also decide how many you need to be taken to keep that herd in proper management and then with that they sell those tags and non-residents often pay a multiplier more than the residents and those funds end up going back into conservation to a magnitude of programs

[01:48:10] I mean if you look at national parks that you have or if you go into a lot of the public wildlife areas that we have in Iowa you'll see sunflowers planted CRP grasses you'll see row crop that's planted in there in certain times obviously there's waterways with fish and so forth and there and the money's from fishing licenses that's what pays to restock those ponds or dredge those out or put them in those wetland programs the sunflowers and stuff that I talked about that's probably an allocation that came from the pheasant tags or the upland game tags so a lot of that stuff that they get its to put back in and to also be able to employ those game wardens to be out there policing that and checking people's tags and making sure they're not overtaking their quotas and etc etc so there really is a check and balance system that's out there and I totally get it when earlier today I was down on the beach cruising around on a scooter that

[01:49:22] I was renting for whatever it is a dollar every 10 minutes or whatever and cruising around down there on the beach I might have seen one person's cat and a seagull well I saw a lot of seagulls so it would be totally understandable for me to see that person side of the story to say why do you need to shoot a deer why do you need to shoot an elk the difference is you go to a place like

[01:49:51] Iowa for example where I'm at where every year I could well Wisconsin I knew when I lived in Wisconsin I knew that so every year I think there was about 750,000 deer that were shot but that was every year and it had to be but there was still millions and millions of dollars paid out every year for insurance claims for deer collisions with vehicles and six deaths a year on average often times more I think it's hundreds of deaths nationwide a year for animal collisions and this is we will put together in our show notes the exact numbers but yes my recollection is it's it's a little over a million collisions a year between deer nationally nationally yeah between deer and automobile in the United States about a million to my memory certainly it's about a hundred thousand and collisions a month between deer and automobiles nationwide and the dollar amount of that is a four or five billion was it I could be wrong and we'll put the numbers in here but it's great it's higher than I recall sort of higher than

[01:51:01] I would have guessed mm-hmm my wife she's from England she's from just north of Liverpool and when we met we kind of talked a little bit about hunting and she was awesome with the fact that I told her my ki get it over here when I'm in Europe I wouldn't hunt deer over here there aren't any I'm a hunter and all I would say is we need to find a way to get your numbers up like let's get your numbers up as a hunter I would love to get the numbers healthier so that yeah maybe there is an opportunity to regulate down the road I don't want them to go away I don't want them to decline that's really not what we want when we look at the numbers of white-tailed deer wild turkeys elk all those things these are based on programs that have been probably the boar and the wild pigs might be some of the most destructive and oh they are the most yeah they're definitely you can't keep up with their numbers their numbers are staggering if you look at the lifecycle of one female pig and how many pigs she could be a multiplier of it will blow your mind and you can't keep up right a very short gestation cycle very quick with the high litter count and with a high survival of litter yeah and then there also her foal are already breeding and within six months once they're born there could potentially breed again in six months right so yeah it's different I told her

[01:52:24] I said when you come to the States you might see things a little different which yeah once she came to the state she realized there's 20 deer a night in our garden we can't grow food fast enough to eat because the deer eat every night I don't know if you were here when she was talking about it when we were having dinner tonight we were getting my stuff ready and she was saying to your son she's like God like what a dream it would be to actually be able to grow all of our own vegetables but it's like you just can't do it oh you live because you were gonna smoke them yeah they would so

[01:52:55] I get it but I also feel like we fill two freezers a year with animals that I trained for all year by a tag put money back into the natural resources shoot this deer process it put it in my freezer and I know everything about it I didn't provide and I guess support commercial farming I didn't do that which I feel pretty good about I know exactly where it came from I know who touched it start to finish and also just

[01:53:31] I don't know it means more to me part of the reason why I'm passionate about cooking is because I'm passionate about I'm passionate about taking something I've put a lot of work into and finishing it by serving it to people that are important to me and if we waste it and throw it away to me it's there's a lot of hard work that went in that if I get an elk that means I've lifted weights all year prepping for that time I've shot my bow

[01:54:00] I've worked on my equipment I've probably bought an equipment so I've invested I went out and then I put on the miles like last year I think I think when we shot our first L I had hunted with my buddy Andy who I talked about earlier we started hunting I think August 24th and then we shot his bowl on 9/11 and I think at that time between the two of us we had put I think it was somewhere around 200 to 250 miles on the ground on our GPS is before we got that shot and I mean it was such a reward and then to break this whole thing down package it all up pack it out three-mile pack out how many trips it took three of us two trips well how many pounds of meat heck if I know a lot I mean easily 500 right yeah yeah quite a bit and then through that we've used it set and then I shot a bowl a few days later I took my bowl took the prime Kutz took him home have used those on my family took all the trim actually grounded in the burger because I knew I was going to be having that event in Big Sky where I was gonna be at that big archery tournament and we really wanted to have a community thank you to the people that follow us so I think Sharon packed and cooked over the course of a few days close to 500 elk burgers at that place that we gave out to people for free and every person that was like that's the best burger

[01:55:35] I've ever eaten I thought every freakin mile that we packed that sucker out of there was it was totally worth it that's a very remarkable and special experience which we talked about a little bit on your show when I was in Hawaii and the access deer which are very invasive their access to your just for you folks listening to this or a beautiful beautiful deer probably when you think of a deer I mean at least when I always thought of Bambi it was really an access to your round here with the white spots and they're I mean they're simply gorgeous actually I've never seen a prettier animal in nature but they're not native to the United States they evolved in India and they evolved with only one natural predator which was the tiger and there's a few things that will sharpen your skills of evading than a tiger so these animals evolved to have remarkable vision not color vision but remarkable vision they can basically see things in frames-per-second we can't their sense of smell is preternatural and their hearing is from another planet and their muscle twitches imagine being able to recruit any type of cornerback or wingback or a half the heck with that kind of muscle twitch factor yeah they're a muscle they're an animal that twitches so much that even long after it's dead it's still twitching like crazy yeah they're so fast and then it was brought to the United States or at least brought to Hawaii maybe a hundred and twenty 150 years ago which is a speck of time in terms of evolution so as far as its concerned the tiger is still what it is built to evade and then you've got clowns like us trying to track it down and such and in the process because it has no predator in the entire state plant is multiplied at a rate that on the three islands in which its present it outnumbers people by you know anywhere from two to one to ten to one and it's basically destroyed the land such that now the livestock don't have what they have so the government of

[01:57:32] Hawaii has basically said look we've got to get rid of this animal entirely and so the compromise is to allow it to be hunted in an ethical way rather than just a wholesale slaughter which is some really interesting stories about that which may be for another time but point I wanted to make was the people of

[01:57:49] Hawaii know this everybody I spoke with who worked at the hotel or elsewhere in the city they understood that this is a problem this animals a pest and when I remember the first day I went hunting there and I brought back a deer and I took it to the restaurant there and I met with the chef and we became friends and she cooked it up for our family and for the restaurant staff and she said this is the first time I've ever been able to cook and access to your she's from Hawaii she was there but she'd never cooked it before she never had someone bring her mind blowing yeah it's mine well because it's not commercially available right like if you don't know somebody who's hunting it you're not gonna get it you can't go to a store and buy it and then fast forward a couple days we got a much larger animal and it was enough to be able to feed all the staff of the restaurant this is a smaller scale version of what you were talking about but what a really special feeling to be able to say this is a circle of life here it's a beautiful animal but it's now out of balance with our environment and this is a little part that we can do to bring it back into balance and in the process that those amino acids that carbon that nitrogen is gonna come back into the people who live here who have lived here and who are not working here so I just don't think I would have ever understood that if someone tried to explain this to me five years ago I think I could have intellectually understood it but don't think I could have viscerally or emotionally understood it and maybe someone listening to this now who hasn't done it will feel the same way but I'm certain they will it's an impossible thing you can try your best to talk about it in a way that where people will at least embrace the idea of it and they'll be curious about it I don't know if I've ever been with someone that decided to pursue it and see what it was really about and then they and then said I didn't like anything about that most people would trigger something to wear there they just ended up saying it was so much different I'd feel so much differently about food that

[01:59:47] I'm buying in a store I kind of want to ask him like what it came from what it was like and you just realize you're missing out on this huge huge piece of what's weirdest think of the rapper's we read especially you but I walked in everything we're eating were label reader's which you should be he should be but people don't read they don't read that on red meat or chicken I mean they might be like well I want organic chickens I don't want any type of steroid in my turkeys or whatever but other than that there's not a lot more questions asked besides that you know it's funny I actually had the privilege

[02:00:30] I guess to go and actually see a place where the cattle were slaughtered and this is considered about one of the most humane places it can be done I don't want to tell necessarily where because this is such a polarizing topic I understand and it's true as far as cows being commercially raised and allowed to eat grass and not given hormones and not given antibiotics it's as about as healthy as it gets but you couldn't help but be struck with the stress that the animals were under when it came time to be slaughtered cows might not be the sharpest tools in the shed but they know that something's wrong when they're walking through this sort of steel barricade that's funneling them and getting narrower and narrower and narrower to a point where they're being slaughtered one you know they're not truly wild animals still they haven't really lived we could debate the consciousness of animals all day long but even absent consciousness I still think an animal has there's different qualities of life that can be given that experience coupled with actually seeing what a wild animal looks like and watching how if you can be an exceptional Archer or hunter yes we're using a gun if you can end that animals life without it suffering and it's basically lived for four years in perfect nature eating exactly what it's supposed to be eating behaving and moving he was supposed to move and then in a moment its life ended it just strikes me as the single most ethical and healthy way you can consume that and what you said a moment ago really resonates when

[02:02:01] I got back from my very first hunting trip I simply I didn't know what to eat when I was at restaurants like when I went out and didn't have control over what kind of meat was being served it was very difficult for me to eat to just order a steak off the menu in fact I really lost my taste for it because I was like you can just sort of maybe of course it was maybe all in my mind but I could almost just taste though the unhealthiness of like what that animal lived like so paradoxically and it was a long-winded way of saying this paradoxically it gave me a greater appreciation for the people who opposed the consumption of meat based on the

[02:02:39] Ethical Treatment of the animal which is odd right you wouldn't think that hunting would make you more compassionate and more considerate of how the animals treated but for me it has done that and for many people I know it's the same for you I know it's the same for many of my other friends in this in this world that's exactly the effect its had yeah there are so many things that hunting has showed me in nature that I would have never ever got to experience just timeless things I mean it's kind of like when you watch

[02:03:07] Forrest Gump and he was making that that run back and forth across the US and they kept showing these parts of America that were just breathtakingly beautiful and a lot of people just take for granted some of that scenery some of that nature and how amazing it was but being an outdoors person I see that stuff a lot and I don't take it for granted it's something to where I want to go back every day I want to see it all the time and and more importantly for me now is I see that first moment when someone goes out and actually bo hunts for the first time and makes a shot and kind of sees it and watches the breakdown and puts in the effort to get it out of there and then you kind of grill their first piece it's like as soon as you see them take it you can see in their face Wow this is the most meaningful meal that I've ever done that is what Thanksgiving should really be that's kind of what it was is when everyone came together with this group effort to have this big feast and that's kind of what digs out of you primarily when you go out and and have your first hunt experience with people that are close and then all sudden you cook it for the first time and give it to your family and explain to your kids where it came from and all those little aspects that you were telling you did I think all that just plays into being more meaningful yeah I'd be talked about this a lot on your podcast so I won't repeat it and we'll link to that so people can go back and hear it because I think we had a lot to say about it and I don't think I said this on the podcast which is well repeat repeated now one of our guides in Hawaii Luca who's all of those guys are like they're magical they're like sorceress to me you know they definitely have a sense that the rest of us that certainly I don't have when my daughter was there when I shot that buck he was amazing like he was amazing the way he talked to her my knowledge if it doesn't have kids I don't know that he spent that much time around ten year old girls let alone right in fact I'm pretty sure he didn't because at one point when Mike and I went off to hike Luca and Olivia went off and he let her drive the Polaris like up and down the hills I was like oh my god how do they not die but I remember him saying to her he's like he looked at her really seriously and he goes you know this is in your blood right and she was like kind of like I'm like what do you mean and he goes like he said you are a hunter you wouldn't be here Olivia if this wasn't a part of who you are and she really got that he really said it in such a profound way I knew what he meant immediately and I think it took her one more repetition to do so but then she got it she got it which was yeah there was a day when you didn't go to the grocery store like there was a day and there was tens of thousands of years ago or even thousands of years ago when this was the only way you had to be able to do this on some level and the pride with which he was able to speak about that to her and share with her I just thought it was delighted she was there and couldn't imagine waiting to do it again yeah yeah for sure well if you look back to how long ago was it really when on that island where you could go to a grocery store and buy food I mean if you go back people that are still there now especially on islands like that are less populated where they may never have I know people there that subside exclusively on what they hunt and fish exactly yeah well I get it I get when people don't understand it have you ever been confronted harshly have you ever found yourself in a situation where there's been a really harsh confrontation when someone is really just sort of aggressively saying John how dare you do this this is an awful thing that you do mm yeah I've had a few people that have been pretty disgruntled mainly in Europe but sometimes I feel like it would be like me trying to talk with Jaakko deeply about what happens in war even if

[02:07:10] I have a agreeance or disagreements with it we're not even on the same field for that I don't feel like I really would have a right to and he probably with me being a friend maybe he would go a little bit in the detail but all I can do is just say I see your point you're somewhere where just isn't going to be clear to you and I think that's the best way really to address it I'd tell the hunting community a lot we don't really want to provoke you kind of don't want to poke the sleeping bear so to speak because there's a lot of people that

[02:07:42] I'll never hear podcast like this there's a lot of people that will never understand the necessity behind it we talked earlier about Frank saying like Frank's is n of a dude as you could ever get he's totally Zen but I remember we were talking one time because he's he's really into meditation they love animals they rescue animals and we were kind of talking about the hunting and he just said yeah you know he hasn't they hunted a lot and I don't know I just he's like I'm okay with it but I just however he said it he was being cordial but I could tell he would have no interest in doing it and he kind of deep down he didn't like what could easily be portrayed as like cruelty to animals shooting them and what's crazy is the night that we drove home from

[02:08:33] Minneapolis to my house we freakin smoked a deer I was driving like a Hyundai Accent and I've smacked this deer and it bounced off the hood and off the windshield and he was like holy how's the deer is it okay and are you okay are we okay and so he was like oh my god and I just said yeah it's really bad I said that it's really bad around here this time of year and then I turned on the lights and we might have seen another two or three before we got back to my house and he was just like I can't believe we hit a deer I can't believe there's so many deer and so I told him like hey man when I tell you we need to shoot deer or I went out and shot a deer this is it's something that needs to happen and and he told me he's like yeah he goes honestly he goes that was crazy he said obviously there's too many so he had a very visual wake-up call some people will never have that and as a hunting community the best thing we can do is realize that we need to speak positively when we have an opportunity and kind of going back to what I said before the easy route is to talk negative and to talk bad about what opposing people have whether in what we should be doing is just talking positive about what we have and we have a very sustainable and in my opinion ethical way of feeding ourselves and we welcome people to it I know it's not for everybody but I think the people that do you come here I think they find a different meaning to eating and it's made me eat cleaner it's honestly made me eat less junk and it makes me more focused on supporting what our environment puts in front of us more so than what some type of refinery does or a chemical does yeah I would agree with all that and as we kind of wrap up here

[02:10:40] I just I want to thank you very much for the incredible work you've done almost single-handedly you have a team with you and you couldn't do what you do without them I know that but you really are kind of changing I think forever the way this sport is taught and I feel so blessed to be in this point where I can be in this complete sink this back and forth balance between the pursuit of excellence within the sport of archery and how it feeds into this completely separate thing called hunting which by the way is about 1% taking a shot and 99% all of the other stuff we didn't even talk about but we've talked about it a lot on your podcast spotting animals stalking animals all of the strategy that goes into it all the physically the grueling physical stuff depending on the terrain that you choose okay I just don't think this sport for me personally would be nearly as enjoyable if it didn't have the educational component that you've single-handedly provided so I feel like if I'd had someone like you that could have taught me the equivalent of what you're teaching me in archery and any of the other things I'd done I can't imagine how good I could have been in those things so I thank you on behalf of a lot of people and my hope is that if even one person listening to this and I suspect there'll be a heck of a lot more than one but if even one person listening to this considers this the opportunity to go down to their local bow shop check out a bow take an archery class maybe buy a bow start watching school a knock and all of your stuff on is it knock its knock on archery then so you teach oh yeah on Instagram it's knock on TV and on the Instagram if you go to my ig TV the knock on TV IG TV I have the school knock the 12-week sessions most of those are all under 15 minutes I think yeah you can do that whole thing in less almost two hours right yeah and it'll pave the way for you to have really good fundamentals and basics it's actually beyond basics we're gonna link to this so much in fact what we'll probably do John is even before we put up the show notes we'll send it to you to look over and make sure you like the order in which we've laid it out so that anybody who says hey I want to get started we will curate every link in order that you would suggest people go to and I mean I'm already looking forward to school a knock again in

[02:13:14] January it's an unbelievable curriculum you've put together and I think you're only at the beginning of what you're the potential of I mean again we've talked about cooking we've talked about all this stuff we could do around exercise and conditioning with respect to this stuff so anyway ma'am thank you for everything both on a personal level but also just on behalf of all those of us that benefits so greatly from your wisdom and generosity oh yeah man thanks a lot thanks for having me to you for sure at first of many thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription ahead and membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic paper person thing we discuss on each episode the word on the street is nobody's shown as rival these monthly AMA episodes are asking me anything episodes hearing these episodes completely access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to spiels like this the qualies which are a super short podcast typically less than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through
