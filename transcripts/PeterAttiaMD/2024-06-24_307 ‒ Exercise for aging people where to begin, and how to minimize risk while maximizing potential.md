In this special episode, Peter addresses the common questions about starting or returning to an exercise routine over the age of 50. Individuals in this age group have frequently reached out with questions about whether it's too late to start exercising and often express concern over a lack of prior training, a fear of injury, or uncertainty about where to begin. Peter delves into the importance of fitness for older adults, examining all four pillars of exercise, and provides practical advice on how to start exercising safely, minimize injury risk, and maximize potential benefits. Although this conversation focuses on people in the “older” age category, it also applies to anyone of any age who is deconditioned and looking to ease into regular exercise.

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the episode:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on exercise recommendations for people aged 50+ who are either starting exercise for the first time or returning after a long break. Dr. Attia emphasizes that it's never too late to start exercising, comparing it to saving for retirement - the later you start, the more you need to do, but it's always beneficial. The discussion covers both cardiorespiratory fitness and strength training, with particular attention to safety and progression strategies.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Muscle mass declines gradually from age 25-75, then drops precipitously [10:25]
- Physical activity levels follow a similar pattern, with sharp decline after 75 [11:36]
- V02 Max declines with age across all fitness levels [15:20]
- Fall risk increases significantly after age 65, with 25% of people over 65 falling annually [1:20:12]
- Toe strength is the biggest predictor of falling in people over 65 [1:27:26]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Start with low intensity and focus on form before increasing load [19:46]
- Prioritize movement quality over volume and intensity [18:59]
- Build aerobic base before attempting high-intensity work [56:07]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For 65+: Start with machines rather than free weights [1:12:21]
- Focus on stability exercises before strength training [1:07:14]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:

Specific protocols:
- Zone 2 training: Start with 2 sessions/week, 30 minutes each [1:00:39]
- V02 Max intervals: 3-8 minutes work periods with 1:1 rest ratio [53:54]
- Strength training: Begin with machines and bodyweight exercises [1:12:21]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"I don't think you can overstate the importance of strength training... I just don't think there's anybody out there who shouldn't be lifting weights." [1:01:58]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are optimal recovery protocols for older adults?
2. How should nutrition be modified for older exercisers?
3. What are the best ways to assess progress in this population?
4. How does sleep quality impact exercise adaptation in older adults?

This episode provides a comprehensive framework for beginning exercise at an older age, with particular emphasis on safety and sustainable progression. The information is presented in a way that makes it accessible to beginners while maintaining scientific rigor.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] I don't think you can overstate the importance of strength training I I just don't think there's anybody out there who shouldn't be lifting weights um I I can't I can't think of a case I mean unless you're decidedly saying I don't want to live the the longest healthiest life I can if that if that's the case then by all means don't lift weights but but if you're in the camp that says I want to maximize how well I can live and maybe even how long I can live what should I do um then you you have to be lifting weights regardless of age regardless of sex regardless of injury you know you have to work around all of those things hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:00:39] AA Peter welcome to a special episode how you doing very well thank you so today's episode is special in that it's kind of shot like an AMA but it's going to be available to everyone and what we're going to cover is one of the most common questions that we see come through day and day out to the website is whether people who are quote unquote older let's say just for general purposes for this conversation 50 plus who realize the importance of exercise but are wondering if it's too late for them to start and this could be whether they've never trained or worry about injury they don't know what to do or how to do it or they just think you know what it's too late for them to really make a difference and so we wanted to create an episode for that group 50 plus who have not been exercising but want to start and although much of what we'll talk about applies to anyone in that age category it also can apply to anyone of any age who is deconditioned and looking to start slow um with that said too anyone who's younger most likely has parents who might be in this position and this could be a good episode to send to them to encourage them to start and so how we're going to structure it is a little less technical than some of our amas and much more conversational as to how you would speak to these people if they were your patients and came to you and were asking you these questions in the show notes we'll have the studies that you talk about we'll link to them we'll link to other content that goes much deeper but this will be a little bit more on that conversational side so with all that said anything you want to add as someone who is now in the quote unquote older category as well yeah my my my wife wife likes to refer to me as an older gentleman now um so that's right I'm am I'm in the over 50 category not just 50 but over 50 um so a couple things one as we thought about putting this together the goal initially was to have no figures no studies you know just really put all of that in the in the show notes but let us talk and um I've sort of begged to have a few figures because I do think that there are times when a picture just says a lot so for folks who are listening to us there's going to be a few times when I'm going to reference some figures from studies that I think really do a lot um uh I guess a couple things to to to state is that um you know and we we'll talk about this in detail um but you know I think we talk about 50 being a turning point I think the another really big turning point is 65 plus um and and again we'll get to some of these things but we really start to notice um reduction in strength at about that age um we start to see vestibular changes that occur around that age and that probably contributes significantly to something we will talk about which is the risk of falling um so while I think everything we're going to talk about is going to be relevant to anybody who's uh over 50 and untrained I I will probably call out specifically areas where when we get into that 60 to 65y Old Camp we want to be even more you know mindful of things and so I think to start I mean you've spoken at length about the importance of exercise for longevity so I don't think we need to start there but let's say someone heard that message is in that 50 plus 65 plus category hasn't been exercising and they come to you and say is it too late for me to start doing this is it too late for me to worry about this and start making changes I think it'd be helpful for people first to hear how would you even respond to that you know I for I've had the same response largely for many years now so I

[00:04:33] I realize that some people will have already heard me say this whether it's on another podcast but truthfully I haven't come up with a better analogy yet and it's really the analogy of saving for retirement so um if you could be talking to somebody who's in high school or college and and you were talking to them through the lens of you know being a financial adviser they their fiduciary what would you say well you would say listen there's the really magical thing called compounding that

[00:05:01] Einstein basically said was the eighth wonder of the world and you want to use it to maximum advantage and to do that you should start saving immediately right if you can start saving you know before you even you know when you get your first job you should be saving um and if not certainly by the time you get out of college um you should be saving and if you do that you don't really have to be that brilliant about it right you just you know if you put all of your savings into an index fund at the age of 22 the probability that you are not going to be set when you retire is so low okay so that's great but what happens if you're talking to somebody who's 45 and due to life circumstances like they just haven't been able to save they haven't they haven't made enough money to even have some disposable saving income or they've had you know they've saved and lost or invested badly or something like that would you say well well you know too bad no of course you wouldn't so I guess the point here is it is never too late to start saving for retirement but you must understand something which is the longer you wait to start the more you're likely going to have to save the greater return you're going to need and therefore probably the greater risk you're going to take so it's never too late to start saving and it's never too late to start exercising but I I want the message to be don't wait because of some reason and say well you know I'm going to wait till

[00:06:34] I'm older because I mean so so anyway I to me that's the best way to think about this and I think it will be helpful for this conversation because we'll touch on these various aspects as it relates to exercis in this age population but can you just remind people of your four pillars and kind of how you think about each of those pillars individually as someone is aging yeah and sometimes I think of it as three or four but I think at last I I think I write about it as four so I'll stick with that but it it's basically stability strength uh aerobic efficiency and Peak aerobic output um and you could argue well those are just kind of a

[00:07:14] Continuum and so I would say sure though but let's not get lost in the semantics um the those things if you define them the way I do kind of constitute everything again stability is kind of a broad term but Ed within stability is you know everything that enables you to dissipate Force safely um everything that enables you to have balance and flexibility because believe it or not those come from stability right you if you have balance by definition you have stability uh you can't have balance without stability you can't actually have flexibility without stability um so you know we we think of training as having a purpose and of course different types of training uh factor into these different activities so there are some types of training that really kind of myopically hit one of these things so if you're you know if you're riding a bike like I do for your zone two training well first of all riding a bike is uh a very one-dimensional activity there are basically no degrees of freedom outside of you riding you know pedaling the crank um and if you do it at you know a fixed power output that meets the criteria for Zone then you're very narrowly targeting that you're doing very little for any of the other systems and then conversely there are other types of training like rucking with a heavy weight on Hills where actually you're targeting all four of those elements right that requires tremendous stability moments of strength large segments of aerobic base or aerobic efficiency and moments of peak aerobic uh output and even anerobic output so that's just something to to kind of you know keep in mind and so Peter you mentioned at the outset there's a few graphs that you think will be important

[00:09:04] I think it's be a good spot for us to pull them up which is one looking at the decline of muscle as we age so people can kind of visually see what that looks like and then one looking at V2 Max across different age brackets and so I'll share my screen here and pull them up but I think it'll be helpful for people if you kind of talk through them and how you look at it through the lens of this conversation yeah so this is a figure that I fought like crazy to include an outlive and I got overruled and just kicked in the groin no way this figure was going in the book so it really makes me happy to be able to show this figure here um the figure for those who are not watching um shows uh it's basically four graphs and uh two of them are for men two of them are for women uh two of them demonstrate fat-free Mass which is a great proxy for muscle mass and two of them show spontaneous uh or deliberate physical activity so in that sense you can think of it as a 2 by two male by female uh versus uh activity and fat-free mass and then each of these has kind of an x-axis that shows age okay so what one notices when they look at this is that um fat free

[00:10:25] Mass um you know Rises up so I e lean mass kind of Rises pretty significantly from birth till about the age of 25 and then it slowly starts to go down by the way this is true for males and females males are on the right females are on the left so you'll notice that from age 25 to 75 there is indeed a gradual reduction of lean mass but then something happens at the age of 75 which is the falloff in lean mass becomes much more significant it's actually even more noticeable in men presumably because they're starting from a higher Baseline but this is clearly a curve that has three segments right birth to 25 where you're gaining gaining gaining 25 to 75 where you're slowly losing uh and by the way we know the numbers right we know that that's actually happening at 8 to 10% per year and then 75 and on where you fall off a cliff so now let's look at the lower figures the low figures show physical activity level and you can see that a very similar Trend occurs it tends to

[00:11:36] Peak a little bit earlier so it's probably peing in late teens and early 20s and interestingly it doesn't have a huge falloff between the uh ages of roughly 20 and 75 it actually stays relatively constant if anything it probably dips a touch in middle age that might have to do when we're at sort of peak work and therefore not as not as busy um physically uh but again you notice what happens at the age of 75 which is physical activity level drops like a stone and of course this begs the age-old question which is which is the chicken and which is the egg because again there is an unmistakable relationship here between physical activity and muscle mass and age um and something very noticeable happens at the age of 75 um of course data like these cannot give us causality in other words can't tell us which one's causing the other but I think anybody who's observed people at this age would come to the conclusion that these are that there is bidirectional causality here in other words as we lose muscle mass we become less active and as we become less active we lose muscle mass and there's one point that I will make an addition to this which actually came from a very recent interview I did with Luke Van

[00:12:58] Loon um and so that's an episode that you can go back and listen to in great detail if you haven't already but Luke made a very interesting point so interesting that I was scribbling it down um as as he said it which was that data like these which are you know we're replete with these sorts of data that show populationbased reductions in activity of Aging individuals always make it look like it's kind of a gradual continuous curve even if if it happens precipitously it's still a continuous curve and what Luke pointed out is well actually that's true at the population level it's not true at the individual level at the individual level it is a series of big discret drops and so when you smooth out thousands of people with big discrete drops it looks like a smooth drop and what it really comes down to is once you reach a certain age even minor setbacks become permanent setbacks and that's the thing we you know we're going to talk about but we have to be able to avoid that situation so I'll give you one example people have long heard me talk about the idea that um once you reach a certain age like 65 and if you fall and break your hip or femur uh the probability of death is really high I mean it's you know in the order of 15 to 30% what often gets forgotten there even though I try to always mention it is of the survivors meaning the people who don't go on to die within 12 months um 50% of those people never reach the same level of function again so that's an example of why these curves are probably not smooth but in fact um have these discreet step offs and now do you want to kind of talk in the same way about how you talked with the muscle and activity decline by looking at V2

[00:14:51] Max yes so again apologies for those not watching but rather listening again please take a a look at the show notes um but here you can see um a table that shows exactly what is happening to V2 Max um as we age now the purpose of this table of course is to show you something else the purpose of this table is to show you uh basically the core tiles of

[00:15:20] V2 Max by age so the way this table is broken up is that low below average above average and then high and Elite combined represent the four quartiles of V2 Max um the the difference is that Elite peels off the top 2.3% for each respective age and sex and so we could talk about what that looks like but I think a more important point and the purpose of I think showing it here is to give you a sense of how every one of these categories Falls in fact what I think is most illustrative is to just look at the elite category so again these are the top 2.3% of the population so for example if you look at a woman in her late teens the top 2.3% would have a V2 Max greater than 53 milliliters uh of oxygen per kilogram per minute and you can see that that will fall such that by the time a woman is 80 to be in the top 3% pardon me the top 2.3% she would have to be greater than 30 millit per kilogram per minute but what's interesting is 30 places her in the bottom quartile for the late teens it would Place her at about the 25th percentile for someone in her 20s so the implication here is that regardless of how fit you are you can still expect to see a precipitous drop here and as I've talked about many times and certainly my patients are probably very sick of hearing this the reason we want to see people um if they want to live a completely uncovered life into the final decade of their life and that's a big you know if not everybody necessarily has that type of an aspiration but if your aspiration is indeed to basically be able to do what you want um you know without limitation climb a flight of stairs carry a luggage up a broken escalator go for a hike um you pretty much need to be two decades younger at the elite level if you're thinking you're going to live to be about 90 um so anyway this hopefully provides some illustration of why that's the case yeah Peter and I think that's really helpful for people to kind of see and hear and it's almost like the the why right so the why you should care about this and why no matter what age you are no matter how quote unquote old you are you really do want to continue to think about this and so now we'll get get into a lot of what people are probably really curious on is the how so you've convinced me I need to care about this and I should do it but how and so I think the first question that would be helpful here is you know what are the most important aspects of training if you're starting or even returning to exercise in later life so this could be people who have never exercised or this could be people who exercise all the way until they were 40 family life got busy they took 10 15 20 years off and now they want to get back into it I mean I think there's a lot that one could say here but I think you would want to start from the principles of exercise variability and movement quality will always Trump volume load and intensity so um I would say that I mean I think most people listening would agree that that's an obvious statement to make for someone who's new to the game but this is an example of something where I would say that's even true for someone like me

[00:18:59] I mean I have a very high training age that's the term that we use when we're assessing patients to understand how much volume they've done and over what period of time um right so basically with the exception of one very bad injury zero interruption in very high volume of training since the age of 13 and yet as I'm now in my 50s I realize I need to be much more attentive to these principles of exercise variability and movement quality and the the reason is quite simply I'm much more prone to injury today than I was before and so um you know I have to think of ways to challenge myself that are not just load dependent um and that doesn't mean that

[00:19:46] I don't still push load in complex movements like a deadlift I do but I'm clearly not going to do nearly as much uh load or volume in those regards and I am going to want to challenge myself and by saying this of myself that what I'm really saying is everybody should be thinking about this especially at this age in terms of um you know circuit training exercises where you're doing more than one thing at a time so an example of this might be that um you know if if someone were just starting out I would want to see them doing more body weight exercises that are slightly more complex movements so for example a stepb lunge um is is an important thing for them to be doing even if it's just body weight versus just working on a leg press with heavy weight so again there's a time and a place for using machines and I think we'll talk about why I think machines are a very good thing for someone starting out because they control the range of motion um but we I think we must be able to to mix that in with more complex movements that are variable in more than one plane and for those movements we obviously want to de load them so that we just begin to do the neuromuscular training and with that let's say potential patient over 50 coming to you and saying you know I want to start exercising how are you going to start to think about the structure of the programming that you give them because again you mentioned like the four pillars and there's different areas you could start so how do you think about that person just taking that first step to exercise you know it always starts with a question that is obvious but sometimes is overlooked and and and and I have to be honest with you this is something that even I think I overlooked a lot years ago and that is you have to come up with something that is realistic for a person because the most important goal when you're returning someone to exercise or when you're starting someone from scratch is you want them to be able to look back in 3 months and view this as a positive experience nothing else matters if that is not true so you know if in 3 months you've improved them by every objectable objective metric and they hated it or they're injured well I I I just don't know how to view that as a success so people are going to be very different in terms of what their appetite for beginning is but because we're focusing this discussion on people who are not like me right they aren't lifelong exercisers um and therefore by definition they're either starting from scratch or maybe coming back to it after a long Hiatus you have to assume that their appetite for training is not going to be 7 days a week two hours a day and therefore what I really want to focus on is the you know the habit of doing something active daily and and not that doesn't mean training every day but it means at least walking or doing something active um so again you're going to evaluate them based on on their

[00:22:59] Fitness level their their level of conditioning and again at the most extreme level if it's a person who's never done anything and is completely deconditioned it's really going to be about walking and that's about it um and it could be as little as 5,000 steps per day every day uh on relatively flat ground uh and of course there's so many ways to progress this if a person is a little bit more conditioned I do like to put weight on them out of the gate right

[00:23:25] I'd like to I'd like to have them do some rucking um and again it doesn't that we're not talking about putting 60 lbs on their back it could be 20 lb on their back um but getting them moving under a little bit of load uh again there's lots of other things to consider here um so again if a person is open to starting with some body weight exercises that's a very uh helpful way to begin doing things doesn't have to be complicated right it could be you know box squats uh wall sits isometric things are much safer uh for indiv individuals who haven't uh done conditioning in the past than isotonic movement uh based um you know meaning um strength movements where the muscle is changing length um you know we I don't know if you want to talk about more now versus later but but again I have strong thoughts on how to begin cardio training so we we've spent a lot of time talking about the importance of V2 Max when we're working with a patient who hasn't done training we do not do V2 max workouts we do not believe in starting people with interval training without building an aerobic base and the aerobic base of course that zone to you want to start building that in a manner that's kind of consistent with where they're coming from so that might just be again walking that could be incline walking that could be riding a bike and then even within riding a bike how do you do that well if a person doesn't have the the the um lower back flexibility and strength it might even be on a recumbent bike as opposed to just a regular stationary bike so all of these things are considerations but again if you forget everything else remember the following you want to make sure that in 3 months they feel better they notice that they are fitter and their appetite to exercise has grown that's the most important thing if you're viewing this both as a participant or as a trainer yeah Peter and let's let's continue down that aerobic path that you kind of mentioned there and so I think the first thing people are curious about is like what do we know about the ability to improve aerobic capacity is that something that can be improved in someone who is older and untrained yeah and that's to me the most amazing part of this is how malleable that system is um in fact I think you could make the case that the physical system so aerobic capacity strength is even more malleable than our cognitive systems and we know that our cognitive systems are quite malleable um again I didn't want to load this with too many stats and and studies but but I think this one is worth mentioning and obviously we can in the show notes give you all the granular detail but um the one study that really jumped out to our team here was looking at percent

[00:26:13] Improvement in healthy older people and healthy younger people so there was a study that did um a six week aerobic exercise they use cycling um training program to assess changes in um you know V2 Max oxygen consumption of course uh workload and endurance now in the older group these people averaged 80 years of age in the younger group The People averaged 24 years of age so you know you couldn't you know you couldn't be further apart and yet in both groups there was about a 133% Improvement in V2 Max a 34 4%

[00:26:58] Improvement in maximal workload so that's basically how many watts could you hit and then a 2.4 fold Improvement in endurance capacity I found this staggering and I would not have predicted this um prior to seeing this study now of course I want people to understand that the absolute levels of all of these things were significantly higher in the 24 year olds that's a given right they have a higher you know they they put out more watts they have a higher V toax Etc what we're talking about here is the malleability of the system what we're talking about here is how much could individuals improve in 6 weeks and the answer is they both improved dramatically um and I should point out something else this particular study followed the six- week training uh uh cycle that I just described with an 8we deconditioning period um and what's worth pointing out here is that the old group declined much faster than the younger group so both groups were able to see significant gains but the older you were the quicker you lost those gains with inactivity yeah and so that speaks to what you mentioned earlier which is the consistency right so if someone starts and they do something for three months and they don't enjoy it and so they drop off again it's not like they're just going to stay at that level that level is going to drop drop back down and so being consistent is almost more important than how high you start that's right yeah again it just it really comes down to this this you you can't overstate this analogy of compounding um and if if anybody really just wants to understand how compounding works just pull open Excel and you know build a very simple formula that shows what happens if something compounds at 2% per you know month uh or 1% per month or something like like that I mean it it it it becomes so nonlinear our brains can't comprehend that um and of course I'm not suggesting that the gains and exercise will compound at that intensity um but but the idea of like how much fitter you can be after years of doing something this is another point I want to make which is you know if you look at a lot of literature in V2 Max training um you know it suggests that yeah it's you're people are capable of improving their

[00:29:28] VO2 max by 13% like that study I just quoted and so a lot of people hear that and they look at the table that I showed earlier and they say well I just had my VO2 max tested and I was at the 50th percentile there's no way I'm going to get to the top 2% of someone two decades younger that would require literally increasing my V2 Max by 80% and this study showed that it could only happen 133% to which I say yeah that study was 6 weeks long you know when we give our patients these audacious goals we we talk about these as two and threeyear goals um so it's very important to understand that whatever we're talking about here we're talking about over a very long period of time one I was going to say too with that long game on BO2

[00:30:14] Max it's as we saw earlier that Elite category also drops so if you're 40 it's not like your Elite category is the same when you're 70 so if you are making that progress and you are increasing just as you age the categories are also going to decrease so you're just naturally going to move up as long as you're maintaining so it's an interesting way to think about it yeah I have I have all of these crazy goals as you know and one of them is like what is the latest age I can like what's the oldest I can be such that my V2 Max in milliliters per kilogram per minute exceeds my age right like clearly at some point that will cease to be true right there's no 80-year-old whose V2

[00:30:58] Max is 80 um so the question is like where does that happen and I think that's a really great heris for the health of a person is does that does that happen when you're 30 you hope not right if a 30-year-old's V2 Max Falls below 30 there's a huge problem uh does it happen when you're 40 that's probably where it happens for most people can you push that to 50 can you push that to 60 so again that's the only way to start to play that game is to basically get in shape and stay in shape so on that let's look at Cardio training first and say you know how would you put someone on a program to help on the cardio side once we've established that a person you know has the basics you know they're they're not immediately injured that you know they've got the ability to start doing some cardio training um I like to really start with

[00:31:58] Base building right I I really you know even even for someone like me who trains a lot remember 80% of my training volume is its own too uh only only 20% of my training volume is is is in that V2 max range um and and again I I've said this before but I it's always worth reiterating understand that I am not training for anything other than the the sport of life if I were still training to be an athlete if I were still training to be a cyclist I would have to do something very different than what

[00:32:31] I'm stating what I what I'm stating is far less intensive than someone who's you know trying to be a master's level athlete in you know pick your endurance sport um so again now we're talking about a person who's new to this what are we going to do I would be really happy if I could get them to start 2 days a week 30 minutes a time now if I took a person who is relatively fit and we did two times a week at 30 minutes per session they're not going to improve enough right they're they're going to experience no improvement if I reduced my training volume to that level I would probably go backwards but you have to remember when you're starting with a person who's very deconditioned they will actually see a training benefit at such low volume so you know not going to throw them in three hour 4 hour a week training um we're going to start them much lower now the question I get asked all the time is how do you help that individual calculate where their Zone 2 is and this is worth spending some time on again for folks who want a bit of a primer when we talk about zone two we are not talking about the same zone two that shows up on your Polar heart rate or your Apple watch or whatever other device you're talking about we're talking about um a very specific mitochondrial level of zone two and it's it's it's referring to an um the highest level of work that you can do while keeping lactate at effectively in indefinite steady state which for most people tends to be below 2

[00:34:06] Millo so um once you're exercising and lactate gets above two you're probably not going to be able to sustain that for you know a couple of hours which is effectively what we're talking about here um because metabolically you are going to um uh move to an area where you're generating too much hydrogen along with too much lactate and the muscles are going to be compromised so um if if you really want the gold standard for measuring zone two you got to be kind of checking lactate levels and I don't really Advocate that for people especially if they're starting out you know I do it but I'm probably an outlier here because I enjoy that level of precision so what I do recommend is two ways to be thinking about this the first is on the rate of perceived exertion which I've talked about at length in the past and that is the talk test um so you know and I've even posted a video I think somewhere that we can probably link to in the show notes showing people what I look like when I'm in zone 2 and what my you know difficulty in in speaking is so we'll we'll link to that so people understand but because I know that people really like you know a little more guidance than that I think using Phil mafat tones um map formula maximum aerobic performance I think is what map stands for um but it's 180 minus your age is a target heart rate and then if you're really new to the thing which again is the audience we're now talking about you might even subtract 10 from that right so a 60-year-old is going to potentially be as low as 110 beats per minute at a

[00:35:46] Target and as they get fitter that's probably going to go a little bit higher now I want to point out that you don't want to be too wed to this as you get more and more involved in your training training um because the fitter you get I think the more variability you'll experience based on recovery so my maone formula would have my heart rate be uh 129 okay well I can tell you9 is never in zone two for me except on the worst day you know maybe once every two months

[00:36:21] I might have a zone two based on lactate where my actual heart rate ends up being 129 it's almost always going to be in the high 130s and sometimes in the low 140s so as you get more conditioned the formula may be less and less valuable and you will rely more and more on RP or if you really want to you know take it to the next level you might even start using lactate final point I say on this lactate even if a person is deconditioned we will we will not use lactate on them because an individual that's coming in who's metabolically unhealthy tends to have very high resting lactates and in fact there were people walking around with a lactate of 2 Millo at rest clearly in that person using lactate provides no value and you should rely on heart rate and

[00:37:07] RP and in that person let's say they're doing two days a week 30 minutes a day how long do you like to see that consistency before you slowly increase either the duration or the number of days you know in part it comes down to what we talked about which is like how do they feel you know I almost want to uh you know Inspire within them an appetite to do a little bit more um so you know I mean this sounds silly but when you're starting out some of this stuff a lot of it is just the Growing

[00:37:38] Pains of being able to sit on a bike and your butt doesn't hurt or being able to walk on a treadmill and making sure that their knees aren't aching or things like that you know so um the you know I I would say within 8 weeks to 12 weeks I would want to start pushing frequency and or duration uh I personally and and

[00:37:58] I don't think there's a right answer here and if there is I'm sure someone will comment I like to push frequency before I push duration um so I'd almost rather go from two to three to four sessions at 30 minutes before we start going to 45 um but eventually I'm going to want the sessions to be at least 45 minutes each and on the other side of cardiorespiratory V2 Max before we get into how you start to build that in for people we do have a few other graphs here that I think are insanely helpful and looking at why V2 Max is so important as people age and so I'll pull them up here but do you want to kind of talk viewers and listeners through this side of it as well yeah this was this was a graph that I was able to get into the book so I was uh I fought hard for this one because boy nobody wanted this one in a in a book and and I can understand why it requires some explanation so um this is this is a figure that shows the hazard ratio I of various comorbidities and performance subgroups so again what's a hazard ratio well it gives you an estimate of relative risk so let's start with the comorbidities because I think that's easier to understand right so if a person is a smoker are they at increased risk and in this case the risk is all cause mortality so they are they are they at an increased risk of death from all causes I think anybody would understand the answer that question is obviously yes the question is how much and in this analysis if you compare a smoker to a non-smoker and ask the question what is the probability of that smoker dying in the coming 12 months from any and all causes the answer is it's 41% greater than the nonsmoker okay that kind of makes sense uh what if you take two people one with coronary artery disease known Cad and the other without well it's about a 29% difference in all cause mortality 29% greater risk I should say if I'm going to be more accurate what about somebody with type 2 diabetes well again it's a 40% greater risk of all cause mortality in the coming year high blood pressure 21% endstage renal disease right so somebody who's on dialysis awaiting kidney transplant a whopping 178% increase in all cause mortality so now what we do is we do the same mortality analysis on that massive cohort Board of people for whom we have

[00:40:28] VO2 max data so these are the data that we showed earlier where we looked at people in those uh cor tiles and so um what I do every time I run a patient through their V2 Max the first time is I figure out where they are and if some let's just say somebody shows up and they're um in the below average Camp um so that means they're in the 25th to 50th percentile for their age I say look if you just go from below average to above average right if I were just to compare you from you know your level at the 25th to 50th percentile to someone who's in the 50th to 75th percentile the hazard ratio is 1.41 in other words you are 41% more likely to die in the coming year than somebody who is that much fitter than you and by the way it's not it's not lost on anybody that that's the exact same Hazard ratio of a smoker to a non-smoker that's how big the difference is and if you want to go from below average to high so now you're going from say the second quartile to the third quartile it's a 100% difference in Risk it's a doubling of the risk of death for that coming decade I won't go through the rest of these numbers here but they're all staggering um and by the way even just going high to Elite 29% difference in relative risk so you know when I talk about how V2 Max is the single most important biomark marker we have for lifespan these are the data from which I make that claim right and and there are obviously other data that are identical to this on different cohorts but the point is there aren't other biomarkers that will give you

[00:42:11] Hazard ratios of this magnitude um now people often ask why is that the case and I think the answer is that V2 Max is probably a remarkable integrator of work so it is not a biomarker that changes quickly and easily to the magnitudes required to do this right um you know you're not going to take your V2 Max from low to Elite in a year um you can do it I would argue you absolutely can do it but it's not going to happen in a year and therefore when it happens it's going to reflect an astronomical volume of work that has been done and the benefits of that work are what are being captured in the V2 Max number and that's kind of the lifespan side I'm going to pull up the other graph here which is more so on the hells span side and I think this was also in your book but when you kind of combine all three of these BO2 Max figures the first one we looked at with just the bracket and the breakdown how it compares to different diseases and then this one kind of paints a really good holistic picture and so do you want to walk listeners viewers through this as well yeah this is another figure that we we show our patients all the time actually we're probably building another one of this because there's a couple issues I have with this figure namely it stops at the age of 75 so I want to see this I want to see the these data extended to another two decades and I realize that it's harder and harder to get those data but I think we can estimate them um what this figure shows is is really the other bookend of why we want a high V2 Max so uh you know the figure above and the discussion I just had a moment ago makes it abundantly clear that if you want to live a long life you better have a high

[00:44:01] V2 Max this figure says if you want to live a good life you better have a high VO2 max because this gives you a very clear all-in-one view of what actually happens as your V2 Max declines you lose capacity so the graph has a lot of information on here but it can basically be distilled down into the following you have three curves for the purpose of illustration you have people in the top 5% uh people right at the middle of the pack and people in the bottom 5% so those are the black uh pardon me the green black and red curves respectively uh by the way for anybody paying attention these data are pulled from a different data source than the previous data I don't think this is as rigorous um a data set and therefore the numbers don't line up completely so the 50th percentile here is not the 50th percentile elsewhere but for the purpose of illustration not important um the x-axis is time of course so as age marches along you are watching a reduction in V2 Max which is the y- axis for all curves so again observation number one is doesn't matter how fit you are your V2 Max is going down down down again as I said the problem with this graph at least one of the problems is stops at the age of 75 and um unfortunately that deprives a patient from seeing that the the curve doesn't continue along the trajectory of what came before it it actually gets steeper and so um what you realize pretty quickly is that depending on where you want to be and that's demonstrated by the activities on the right you're going to need to be pretty high to avoid the fall so what it's showing you is hey if you want to be able to run 10 mil an hour on flat ground that's you know you need a V2 Max in the mid to high 50s if you want to be able to run 6 mph which is a 10-minute mile up a very Steep Hill you need to have a V2 Max of 50 and as you walk down this list you see that the

[00:46:06] V2 Max requirement goes down as the aspiration goes down the point that isn't really clear on this curve is at what point does the V2 Max um become sort of rate limiting for activities of daily living and that's in the High Teens um approximately so so once the V2 Max is Into The High Teens we would say that you are now going to be limited in what you can do from an activity of daily living standpoint um having studied these types of data for a very long time I know that for myself personally and by the way this tends to be true for most of our patients when we put them through the centenarian de cathlon exercise um most people at least based on what they're telling you they want to be able to do in the last decade of their life are going to require a V2 Max of about 30 so high 20s to 30 um in the final decade of their life and I mean Nick when you look at that what's your what's your takeaway if if I'm telling you you need a V2 Max of of 30 if you're 90 yeah you better be in the 95th percentile you you have to be higher right because the the people on this graph who have a V2 Max of 30 um at the at at age 75 are going to be lower than that at the age of 90 so yet you have to be way above the top of the green curve at the outset uh so so again like I know people hear me say and you've alluded to this that oh Peter he's just being kind of extreme blah blah blah blah blah no no no I'm not being extreme the data are right in front of us here like if you want to be able to to be completely unencumbered in the last decade of your life you need to have a very high level of Fitness when you're in midlife and if you don't that's okay you have time to do it but don't don't wait too long yeah kind of is one of those things where it's like we often joke like does everyone need to measure their lactate two times every workout probably not right like that might be you on like the heavy data side but looking at V2 max if you want to be able to do those things that's not like uh you're measuring lactate every day that's just a black and white fact kind of written in stone yep you you you don't need to I mean we should talk about how you can train for v2 Max but yeah you you don't you don't need the devices to do this um even though I like using devices well that's actually where we're going next which is when do you start when someone is starting to train or getting back into it you know you mentioned you'll start them in the zone two a few days a week obviously Zone 2 two days a week 30 minutes is a lot different than a v to Max exercise which can take a lot more so how do you have your patients in that age bracket 50 and plus when do you have them start training for v2 Max how do you have them start training how do you think about that so a couple things one um again you you know the The Wider the base the higher the peak so I want to build a reasonable aerobic base before I start pushing V2 Max and by the way you do experience increases in V2 Max just from

[00:49:27] Base building um aerobic activity so um if you take a person who's completely deconditioned and you put them into just a Zone 2 program and you slowly add duration um and frequency to that and then you retest their V2 Max it'll be higher even if theyve never done a single interval But ultimately to really start to boost V2 Max you are going to need to add more intense movement um I think that the easiest way to do that and the way we typically do it with our patients in a really detrained individual or untrained individual is just to add a little bit of interval training to the zone 2 workout so for example if a person is doing their Zone 2 on a treadmill and let's say you've got them walking 3 mil an hour and you know after a few months they can handle 3 miles an hour at 4% or 5% incline you say great I want you to finish uh the workout doing five one minute quote unquote bursts where you increase the slope from 5% to 10% and you're just going to do it for a minute um and that's going to really Tire them out you do a minute on and take a minute off a minute on take a minute off so you start to get them used to increasing the intensity and this also becomes a chance to assess um is this going to be something that they can do safely or are they going to completely deteriorate in form um so you know I'll just I'll give you an example of something I used to do so I used to do really really what I think is looking back I'm lucky I never got injured but I used to do some really stupid things for v2 Max training um that uh I think put me at too great a risk for injury so I used to do deadlift tatas um so you know

[00:51:21] I would put 225 lbs on a bar and see how many reps I could do in 20 seconds take 10 seconds off and repeat that eight times now did that do a lot for my V2 Max oh you can bet it did but you know when I think about like the risk I was putting myself under from a movement perspective being under that much fatigue in the seventh and eighth round of that where you're trying to push harder and harder I I just don't think that makes any sense and c I mean that doesn't make sense in someone like me who has a lot of training background I you know so so what do I want to do I want to make sure that they're doing these intervals which we'll talk about in a second in an activity where the form isn't going to deteriorate to the point of injury now let's talk about the gold standard for How to Train V2 Max and this is something we've discussed at length in at least two or three other podcast that we'll link to the sweet spot for that energy system is 3 to 8 minutes of work and what defines that what defines that is you do as much work as you can at a steady state in that period of time so it um so at the low end of that is 3 minutes so meaning how hard can you push for 3 minutes such that it's roughly the same level of um work output so Watts uh if you're on a bike for example um but by the end of 3 minutes you're truly spent and then at the upper end of that it would be up to 8 minutes long which obviously means it's going to be far less wattage but the same physiologic response which is by the end of it you are truly gassed um

[00:53:00] I've talked about this again I personally just tend to gravitate to 4 minutes four to five minutes is where I like to do the work um but I think it's great to mix it up um and I'll use four minutes as an example just so folks understand what this should feel like um when I'm doing a 4minute interval I barely notice the first minute so if at the end of the first minute of a 4-minute interval you're dying you went out way too hard it's okay try just try try try different try the next time um at 2 minutes I'm still feeling pretty darn good and believe it or not sometimes I'm wondering if I'm not if I shouldn't be pushing a little bit harder at 3 minutes I'm truly wearing it um and that last minute is brutal and that's again assuming I'm largely holding power constant for the 4 minutes so that's a general rule the way

[00:53:54] I describe it is 3/4 of the way into the interval so 6 minutes if it's an 8-minute interval 3 minutes if it's a 4minute interval 3/4 of the way into into the interval you should be at the 50% level of your pain um and so once a person is ready to graduate into a dedicated V2 Max session that's what I want to do and I want to see them doing that once a week uh again if you're training to be an elite level cyclist you're going to have to do it more than that but if you're training to just know minimize risk and maximize gain I want to see people start to push those and maybe the first time they do it they can only do four rounds of that but you know eventually you'll get up to five six seven eight rounds of that again if we're talking about four minutes and when you put in a warmup and a cool down and obviously I should say you're doing that at a one:1 work to recovery ratio I should have mentioned that earlier so um if it's four minutes of work it's four minutes of a very very passive recovery um not not a hardcore active recovery it's it's a true rest and Recovery um but again if you you know we're talking about 60 to 75 minute workouts here yeah and so I think for what I'm hearing you say is correct it's one of those as it relates to V2 Max even though it's so important and we just looked at all the numbers of why it's so important it's also one of those in an older population who maybe is deconditioned you're not pushing them to start VO2 max training right away like you it's important to get the base and it's also important to take even when they start V2 Max training take it slow and it's more important to build that over time than it is to just try to rush into it and either not enjoy it or worst case get hurt that's right and the older and less conditioned you are the less I want you to hurt during those V2 Max intervals like you know and and again I I I I bring it back to me because I can speak from my own experience with much more clarity the level of pain I am in today when I do my V2 Max sets is nothing compared to what it was 10 years ago

[00:56:07] Nick I mean 10 years ago it was truly pushing to the point of vomiting I do not push that hard anymore um I still push hard probably harder than most people would expect but it's not that level and in 10 years when I'm in my early 60s it will be even less of a push than it is today so you know the name of the game is play the game and stay in the game forever and so we are really looking to minimize injury here and we're looking to minimize burnout and the first few times a person even experiments and dabbles with these 4minute intervals I actually want them to come away thinking that wasn't too bad great try a little bit harder the next time but we're we're not here to to sort of wipe you out um after the first session or even the first couple of rounds anything else you want to say on the cardio side before we move to the strength side well I think you know we we could talk about how to go about doing it um the the good news is for v2

[00:57:14] Max I think you have many more options for Zone 2 believe it or not you're kind of limited because of the steady state nature of it so again for me Zone 2 if I'm not traveling is always on my bike uh which is on a stationary bike so on a on a trainer um that and that's it full stop um if I'm traveling I will usually do it on an incline treadmill so I go to what I consider a normal brisk walking speed which is 3.4 to 3.5 miles hour and then I just take the incline up so I might warm up at 10° or 10% grade but usually I wind up at about 15% grade so 3 and a half miles an hour 15% grade that's my zone to um and so outside of that you can you can do it on a rowing machine if you're a really good rower but for most people they're not efficient enough on a rowing machine so they typically end up blowing up and through their Zone 2 ceiling um you can

[00:58:15] I can do it on a stair Master but you know I just have to you know you just have to be sort of careful about it by the way when you're using stair Masters and treadmills and all these things remember you probably don't want to have your hands on the device because there's too much variability and how much of the um the stress you're taking away does that make sense like if you're in a treadmill and you're holding onto it there's so much variability in how much of the load you're alleviating um that I prefer to just go hands off the machine and settle in at a steady state that's going to be be consistent um when it comes to V2 Max you have way more uh optionality and you know that's where I ride my bike outside but you know you could be you could be doing almost anything um provided that there's a constant enough space for you to do it for you know at least three minutes um so you know swimming great great way to do V2 Max training because you don't have the impact uh all those other things so um again you could do it on a treadmill if you wanted to and you could run or you could you know again just walk at a steeper incline if your Zone you know if your zones permit it um so I guess that's the only other point I would make about this and if someone is older let's say 65 plus so they're in the older side of what we're talking about and they haven't done Zone 2 before and they say hey do you have a preference on is it better to start on a treadmill versus a bike have you noticed anything as it relates to those two where it's because we talked early on about the importance of even just walking right getting like 5,000 steps 7,000 steps so would you want to see people or encourage them to start on a treadmill or do you think a bike is just as safe just as effective yeah I mean look I think all things equal if this is the only exercise a person is going to be doing I might lean a little bit towards the treadmill if they were truly agnostic just because at the end of the day walking is a more valuable skin skill than cycling right um I mean cycling has no application Beyond cycling um and whereas is a very important part of who we are um it's our superpower to be bipedal so the more time you can spend doing it the better you are um again for someone like me it's kind of moot because I walk a lot anyway I'm rucking

[01:00:39] I'm get I'm forcing that system to work elsewhere um so so you know I might as well do something I enjoy the most which is probably riding a bike so moving on now from the cardio side to the strength side we already kind of looked at how muscle can drop as we Agee what do we know about the possibility to gain muscle mass as we age you know it's really interesting it's not that dissimilar from what we've talked about on the cardio front so you know research is very consistent here um in demonstrating that resistance training can increase muscle strength uh and muscle hypertrophy at any age again um you know you you tend to get into very small studies here um but but when you look at you know large pooled analyses you can see that even if you limit your analysis to people over the age of 80 um which are people who are clearly in the in that in that area of um you know being on the downhill for strength and hypertrophy um training can offset losses and in a in a deconditioned individual can actually make gains you know look I don't think you know just as

[01:01:58] I hopefully made a case for why you can't overstate the importance of cardio training both at low and high intensity I don't think you can overstate the importance of strength training I I just don't think there's anybody out there who shouldn't be lifting weights um I I can't I can't think of a case I mean unless you're decidedly saying I don't want to live the the longest healthiest life I can if that if that's the case then by all means don't lift weights but but if you're in the camp that says I want to maximize how well I can live and maybe even how long I can live what should I do um then you you have to be lifting weights regardless of age regardless of sex regardless of injury you know you have to work around all of those things um so again there's a very similar study um to the one I cited earlier again I don't want to go too study heavy but you know this is just so illustrative of the point um it was a study that looked at people in their late 70s and early 80s and people in their 20s um and it at the outset measured three rep max for leg extension and then put them on a six week uh resistance training program and um the people in their late 70s and early 80s had a 78% increase in their strength uh which is almost identical to the 83 84% increase that was found in the younger individuals again I I it's important to understand that yes these people were significantly differ in the absolute strength that they had uh the average leg extension in the people uh who were in their late 70s and early 80s was only 22 kilog versus you know 178 kilog for the young participants um but nevertheless this is an important point that is everybody has the capacity to improve um and therefore everybody needs to be doing this um I think the other thing that we've talked about in previous podcasts most notably I think we've talked about this with Andy Galpin on a couple of occasions is um um the importance of type two fibers so one of the things that Andy said that has always stuck with me and I think it's just such a a great way to think about this he he he almost described it as a

[01:04:14] Hallmark of Aging is the atrophy of the type two muscle fibers um so again you have type one fibers you have type two fibers the type two fibers are the glycol IC fibers they are the much more powerful fibers they have more contractile Force they're the ones that are responsible for power not just muscle size and not even just strength and clearly not muscular endurance and these are the things that basically Peak when we're in our 20s and so you know every day I'm sort of thinking about what am I doing to um preserve them and minimize their loss and again uh a study will link to demonstrates That Type 2 muscle fiber cross-sectional area um was increased by 27% in men aged 60 to 73 with 13 weeks of resistance training now again you have to train relatively heavy for your level of strength um you have to push to make those results happen um but again this can be done very safely as we'll as we'll talk about yeah and I think now is the time to kind of look at that a little bit which is you have a patient who older they come to you and they have not been strength training and you know maybe they even do a dexa and they see their metrics are really low as it relates to muscle mass how do you start to incorporate that strength and resistance training to that individual well I mean I think there's a real parallel here with what we talked about on the endurance side so I always start from the same vantage point which is if you're new to strength training I want to make sure that in two to three months you're looking back at the last two to three months thinking a I enjoyed that wasn't as bad as I thought it was because remember if someone hasn't lifted weights before there's a reason right like there's something about it that they are either intimidated by afraid of or didn't think it was valuable enough I mean there's a reason for it so a I want to undo that reason um secondly I want them to feel something is different I want them to feel like well you know I remember when

[01:06:25] I started this I could only do this many push-ups and now I can do that many push-ups or when I was doing leg extensions or leg presses I had to pin on this weight and now it's like 50% higher and um so so so that's that's the first principle second principle is again similarly we are going to start with volume more than we are going to start with load muscle muscle muscular resistance matters more to me than strength at this point so I'm not going to lead in with let's go after those type two fibers it's going to be let's work on the type one fibers and I don't care if you need to do 15 to 20 reps on every exercise so be it um I'm not even really at this point going to be concerned with all the nuances of RP right you know and we've talked about this on many podcasts including not just the podcast with Andy but with Lane

[01:07:14] Norton um the data are that you know it the number of reps you do for hypertrophy and strength don't especially for hypertrophy don't really matter provided you get to Within in one or two reps of failure well we're not even really going to push that out of the gate um we might prescribe hey pick a weight that you fail at about 12 to 15 reps um but again less concerned as to whether that's an rp2 or an RP 4 um the other thing to keep in mind is in parallel to this you've got to be working on some of the stability stuff which is not necessarily weight based so this is where you're working on um intraabdominal pressure exercises really making sure that they can kind of pressurize the cylinder as we stay um breathing exercises so a lot of the stuff we borrow from DNS and PRI where we want to make sure that they can move their ribs correctly um and obviously you want to make sure that they have the ability to even recruit muscles correctly and a lot of those things are kind of hard but you know I I'll never forget an example Beth Lewis had me do um you know one of the Early times when I met her which was you know laying on a floor right so picture me laying on my back um my knees are up U like my knees are up but my feet are flat on the ground right so I'm in a very relaxed position and it was an exercise around being able to sequentially recruit hamstrings one leg at a time and put the foot down into the ground and pull it back if that makes sense um so again that's a pure hamstring isolation exercise and yet despite having very strong hamstrings I really struggled to do that exercise while keeping my pelvic floor stable um so again those are the types of things where you're not going to get injured but you're going to have to learn to start recruiting and controlling a muscle and again once you do that you're much safer lifting and how do you think about resistance training for people kind of who are in the even older category which is let's say 65 plus I know what that outset you kind of mention that at a certain point the muscle mass you're losing and the things you have to be aware of is even higher so how do you talk to a patient about this who is even in that older category I think you just have to do everything a lot slower so for example somebody at this age um you know you'll do TRX but you want to be much more stable in the positions you're doing I would almost without exception only have somebody at this age if they've never lifted before um only using machines to start I wouldn't really want them mucking around too much with dumbbells out outside of maybe doing carries um but I I don't I wouldn't want them picking even picking up dumbbells to do lunges or things like that I would sort of save that for phase two of what they're doing um and truthfully you know even though DNS Dynamic neuromuscular stabilization which people know I'm a big fan of um when people think about it you sort of think of these baby positions well the reality of it is those positions are very important uh for people of any age and so um teaching an older person uh especially a person who's new to physical activity some of those positions is very valuable because a it's doing all the stuff I talked about a second ago but they're also getting comfortable with being on the floor and moving on the floor again this is a something that you know you and I will take for granted Nick for some time um but but people you know 20 years older 30 years older than us um can't take it for granted that being on the floor moving on the floor and getting up on the floor unassisted um is is something that that they should be able to do easily and you kind of hinted at it there so let's say someone is kind of in this older bracket even 50 plus and they're like okay I'm going to start resistance training they obviously don't have a home gym right most of people in that category aren't going to have that and so if they do walk into kind of their local gym fitness center you would encourage them to start on the machines at first and lower weights just to slowly work that up before grabbing free weights grabbing dumbbells anything like that I mean again I at this level it's difficult for me to provide you know very very um thorough analysis because everybody is different and and clearly what what you might say makes sense if this person also happens to have a trainer who's really good good with them yeah you're going to say look you're going to push things a little bit quicker but if we're really starting at hey this is a person who's you know going to be doing a lot of this stuff alone in a gym where there's a ton of intimidating stuff going around I would say yeah like let's stick with the machines um and I wouldn't be trying to do you know dumbbell presses or you know

[01:12:21] Kettle you know kettle bell exercises or anything like that no I I think you really want to build your strength and stability um with body weight and with machines before you progress again if you have the luxury of having a trainer and that trainer is very good I think they'll be able to progress you more quickly to those other things so then

[01:12:41] Peter you kind of hinted at it there but a lot of people who are in the older category you know they may be concerned about resistance training due to potential injury so when you have your patients who are older or start to resistance train start to build muscle are you worried about injuries kind of how do you speak to them about how they should think about that aspect especially starting out or if they've never started before you know truthfully

[01:13:11] I I I think anybody who's worked with with people be it athletes or or you know people who are really deconditioned you always have to think about this right because you're always balancing provid in enough training stimulus to get the benefit and remember training is a hormetic activity right it has to create a stimulus whether that be on the um Aerobic System whether that be for type 1 fiber the type two fiber like there there has to be a stimulus that comes from pushing outside of a comfort zone um so we have to have that training stimulus but we know that if we do too much we're going to get injured and I hope that by now I've made the case for why injury must be avoided at all cost because injury means time to decondition and the older we get the more uh problematic that gets again you know I think about the back injury I sustained when I was 27 years old that basically left me unable to walk for 3 months and unable to do much of anything for 9 months well today if you look at me there's really no lasting effect of that but imagine that had happened to me when

[01:14:22] I was 70 that's that that's it my life is over like I never get back to where I was so um it's probably safe to say that the most common reason for injury when you're starting out is is progressing along the intensity axis uh too soon so remember we talked about how you push frequency you can push duration you should you could push intensity I think you want to air on the side of again my my heris is move the frequency then the duration lastly the intensity um so so that's clearly true on the cardio cardio training side but I think it's also true on the strength training side um obviously another very important part of injury is just a lack of neuromuscular control um so you know that accounts for many things from why people fall more frequently as they age to how people get injured when they can't let's if we're just limiting it to talking about strength training you know why are individuals getting hurt when they lifting weights well a lot of it is maybe they're moving a weight that they can't control you know we've talked a lot about the importance of being able to control the Ecentric phase of a movement and um I think we've all seen someone in the gym who's just throwing weights around um and getting away with it but that you're going to stop getting away with that the the older you get so we want to really make sure that people have the coordination they're doing the types of drill like agility agility ladders you know uh I high hand eye coordination exercises ball tosses um such that they're kind of generating neuromuscular control in addition to to strength um probably the other big area where we see injuries is due to a lack of movement variability um so um you know

[01:16:19] I people say well you know should do I need to squat and deadlift and bench press and and I think the short short answer is no um I think a lot of those things can be done with for example squats and deadlifts you can accomplish many of those goals using single leg uh variants that are far less weight um and even something like a bench press with a bar I would much rather substitute in um once you're ready for that floor presses um and single arm floor presses so you'll have one arm you'll be laying on the floor with knees um up feet flat on the ground one arm straight up the other arm doing the presses and again what's what's nice about that is on a floor press yet your range of motion is nowhere near what it is on a bench because you're obviously not going to be able to bring the elbow you know below your your back which you could on a bench um so you lose a bit of range it's clearly not as good you know quote unquote as good a PEC exercise but there's also a very good margin of safety there right you're think about how much harder it is to hurt yourself doing a floor press um than um than a than a regular traditional bench press so you know these are these are just some slight examples of ways that you can think about minimizing injury uh and that that's you know by the way just as an example like when I was coming back from shoulder surgery I mean it was probably a year of just doing floor presses before I proceeded to go back onto a bench yeah it kind of reminded me

[01:17:46] I can't remember who it was but someone once told us they used to do Tata deadlifts and that could be potential good example of a good way to get injured correct I mean anybody's stupid enough to do that Nick I mean gosh I would I just I don't even know what I would say if they're doing Tabata deadlifts you have to question everything they say right like how can they be trusted on anything I I think you would probably have to say they're you shouldn't listen to a word they say well if I can remember who that is I'll make sure to tune them out going forward if if you can remember let us know um on that front farus you've talked about it before you mentioned it um earlier do you just want to speak about fall risk we also have a few graphs here that again we went to pulled if they didn't tell such a story but I think it'd be really important here to talk about forisk because I think this is important not only for people in this age category but also even anyone who's still listening that's even younger to see what this can look like and it's also to give them that motivation to even train at a younger age kind of what you at earlier it's like saving for retirement at a much early age so what do you want to tell people about Falls boy I I don't I just don't think we can say enough about it I I think back to all of the failures of our traditional medical training and there's so many right I mean you we didn't you know in in four years and $250,000 of education at Stanford how many hours of lecture did I have on exercise zero you know when was is this discussion about falling presented to us as medical students never right so um you know in the United States over 14 million or 25% of people over the age of 65 will fall each year um now to be clear that's people who report it so we believe that that number is significantly higher um this risk goes up quite nonlinearly so by the time we're talking about octogenarians and nonagenarians the annual incidence of falling is at least 50% and you'll recall that I said that um the risk of death from that fall depending on the series you look at will be somewhere between 15 and 30% of those

[01:20:12] Falls if they result in a broken hip will result in fatality within the 12 months that ensue um pull pull up this graph this is I know that this is a graph had showed in a newsletter a couple of years ago but I I think it's every once in a while you don't really need any statistics to understand this you just need to look at the graph so this is the um normalized death rate per 100,000 people um you know for over the last basically 15 years um these are data from the CDC and you can see that just from 2007 to 2016 we've seen a 30% increase in

[01:20:59] Fall deaths um to put it in perspective um the projection is that by 2030 we're going to expect to see seven fall deaths every hour in the US um again it's very difficult to wrap our minds around this I think and and I think all of us as Physicians certainly myself in this category unless you're a physician who specifically has a geriatric practice maybe where you would see more of this I

[01:21:29] I I just don't think we can wrap our minds around this problem and the magnitude of this problem um again if you look at the data in 2018 um you know we're talking about 36 million Falls reported to 8 million injuries uh that looks like it's going to very quickly become 52 million Falls with 12 million injuries in about 5 years uh for people over the age of 65 so um I think that it's safe to say that falls pose um not by magnitude but certainly by severity um as significant a threat to an aging individual as the typical

[01:22:17] Horsemen that we've spoken about so often what do we know about the reasons for Falls what makes a fall worse than the others you know because as you mentioned these are only reported Falls so there's probably a lot of times where if someone Falls and they get up and they're just a little banged up they're not going to report it to anybody and so if we want to double click on falling in particular what do we know about more detail on that that make it more dangerous than others yeah so I think there's two ways to kind of think about this right there's what is it that increases our susceptibility to fall and why is that going up as we age and then there's another issue which is not only does your probability of fall going up but the severity of the Fall is also going up as you age so those two things are compounding and that's why if you look at the data and I actually do think I included this figure in outlive

[01:23:16] I have a figure that shows the death rate of Falls by decade and I mean if you want if you're trying to explain to somebody what exponential growth looks like you just show them that graph right like that's exponential growth and that's why right two things are compounding nonlinearly and you put them on top of each other so so let's talk about it like why is this happening well

[01:23:41] I think if you're asking like why are there more Falls it's going to be lower limb weakness and we should double click on specifically like the role of the toe there um we had a recent podcast with Courtney Conley that discussed that that um difficulty with walking and balance remember I said vestibular changes kick in around the age of 65 so all of us become less visually capable um and we have less just innate vestibular capacity uh the visual difficulties uh foot pain just poorly fitting Footwear as we age um and then of course there's you know medications that people take so the older we get the greater we see the incidence of hypertension hypertension hypertension does need to be treated it's an enormous uh risk for stroke and heart attack but sometimes we overtreat it and people become orthostatic um and when they stand up they get laded and fall I don't know if you know anybody that that's happened to

[01:24:36] Nick but um that can also be kind of a devastating consequence of um just being alive um you also talk about things that I don't think are necessarily age related um all of those things are age related but but obviously you know um just having you know uneven steps around clutter all of those things um play a role so you know the more of these factors you check off the more likely you are to fall now to the question of you know why is it more catastrophic um you know I think that again you know an amazing statistic is that the leading uh cause of traumatic brain injury in people over the age of 65 is falling right um so 95% of hip fractures are driven by

[01:25:28] Falls um so you know clearly Frailty is the leading cause of this so um Frailty means poor muscle mass poor reactivity uh and low bone density those are probably the things that are driving the um severity of the Fall which are so much higher in a person who's older than you know a person who's who's younger and and so you know you recall alluded back to the podcast with Andy Galpin where we talked about the atrophy of the type two muscle fiber well I think Andy used that as a great example of another reason why Falls go up as people age is that you know if you or I step off a curb we weren't expecting to be there or you know when you're stepping from one level to another and the level is different than you expected that immediately destabilizes you well um the

[01:26:24] AB ility to react to that very quickly and get a firm footing that is a very power driven movement right that's not really about how strong you are it's actually about how explosive and Powerful you are that is a type two muscle fiber phenomenon and as you watch the atrophy of those two fibers you have far less reactive speed in your feet and therefore you're more likely to fall in response to that and so again the more we can train these systems the better we are going to be able to resist falling and you mentioned there

[01:27:01] Courtney's episode which if anyone hasn't listened to or watch will be really good to go back to um but can we doubleclick on the role that the foot plays and fall rist and even in particular one thing she talked about which was toe strength yeah again great episode absolutely worth going back to if you haven't if you haven't uh listened to it and also you know we'll talk about the videos that that

[01:27:26] Courtney and I put together but um you know foot Health matters and I think one of the things I took away from the discussion with Courtney was that tow strength was the biggest predictor of falling in people over 65 um now in that uh podcast uh Courtney ran me through a bunch of tests to determine tow strength um and so you know one of the tests um my my my two favorite right so one of those tests was a little uh card that you put under your toes and it's a dynometer so it measures the force that you can push each toe down as the card is trying to be uh pulled out and so the rule of thumb if I recall was your great toe should be able to push down with at least 10% of your body weight and if it can't it's too weak uh toes 2 through four collectively pardon me two through five collectively should be able to push down about 7% of your body weight um another great test was the kind of Lean

[01:28:39] Forward test so this was when you're um standing up straight you we have this little laser device it sounds more complicated than it is I've obviously already gone out and bought said laser on Amazon um and you know link to all that but you shoot it against a wall and you get a distance and then you lean forward and without you know catching yourself just letting your toes basically do the work to see how far they support you and you should be able to I believe be able to move uh at least 5 in or maybe it's 4 and a half Ines there so those are some great ways to test um and again it's just added so much more to how I think about the importance of this stuff because I have to be honest with you I've always thought of foot as an important thing you know or not always but but you know in the past five years the importance of of toe strength and feet has been important has been relevant to me for other reasons but I never appreciated what a role it paid uh played in Falling um so um yeah that I I'll leave it at that but just just to say you know we'll link here to a whole bunch of exercises that go to explain how to strengthen your toes um next thing you want to talk about here is is really calf strength and again in the in the videos uh

[01:29:58] Courtney goes through the The Benchmark tests for for both gastrock and Solus test um I would say the following virtually nobody I've ever seen has been able to pass these tests out of the gate these are very difficult tests um and that tells us that most of us are heading into older age with um underdeveloped Str strength in our lower leg um and so again I it's it's actually changed my training um and I have added um much more Solus and gastr training and and frankly it's been at a much heavier weight than I've trained in the past um because of my understanding of how those fibers work um the other thing here is around ankle Mobility so another set of tests that Courtney put me through um were um around dorsiflexion and tibial rotation and again I was surprised that I did not pass these with flying colors and um I think I passed on one side but not the other we showed the side that I failed on if I my memory servs me correctly um but um I Al I'll also always remember something that um someone told me many years ago which was if you can't walk down a flight of normal height stairs so call it a seven or or 8 in Step whatever normal is and keep your toes perfectly pointed forward you don't have enough dorsy flexion so if you think about it a lot of people when they're walking downstairs have to turn their toes somewhat out to accommodate the tibial uh or the shin angle with the foot and so I would encourage everybody the next time they're walking downstairs to actually see if they can walk with feet perfectly parallel and pointing forward um and if that's difficult on your uh lower shin and upper foot you probably don't have enough dorsy flexion and so again I think we're we're you know we'll link here to a whole bunch of exercises that you can use uh to train that and there are a handful of devices here that I use and uh again I I really like these devices don't have any affiliation with all of them so um you know not not not promoting something that I'm a part of but but definitely something that that

[01:32:21] I'm a big fan of and looking kind of the last few questions we wanted to hit are just kind of on a few different variables that relate to exercise the first is bone mineral density and you kind of talked about it with Falls and fraility and we had a whole AMA that people can look at on bone mineral density but what do we know about resistance training for bone mineral density and older adults because

[01:32:48] I do know this is something that as people get older they're much more worried about and looking at even compared to people in their 20s 30s and also I think this allows you to talk about which I think is one of your favorite news stories on this subject so do you want to kind of speak to that yeah bmd or bone mineral density which is one of the kind of four pieces of data you get from a dexa scan um is typically reported as both a zcore and a t-core now it's really important if you are getting a dexa scan because you want this information you need to make sure that it's reported segmentally so a lot of places that do a dexa scan don't give you the hip and lumbar spine readings they'll just give you total body tcore and zcore and unfortunately that is not sufficient to understand your risk so you need a t-core for the lumbar spine and you need a t-core for at least one if not both of the hips we we'd like to see it for both hips but some places we'll just do one because the concordance between hips is pretty pretty high um I'll take a moment just to explain what a t-core is a t-core is the difference between your bone mineral density um and the mean level for a 30-year-old of your sex divided by the standard deviation if the t-core is below minus1 that is defined as osteopenia if the tcore is below minus 2.5 that is defined as osteoporosis so that's sort of one thing to understand another thing to understand is how bones work from a density standpoint so um and and I a lot of this is already covered in that ama that we did and we should obvious link to that for for long you know long listening but I'm just kind of giving the the tldr here um we basically are in a bone building net bold build net bone building phase until our early 20s um and then we so we sort of hit bone

[01:34:56] Peak and then it's mostly a decline from that point on for women the decline becomes quite precipitous once they hit menopause if they are not placed on uh estrogen therapy um you might ask why well it has to do with the fact that estrogen is potentially the single most important hormone when it comes to regulating bone health and the reason for it is that bones respond to load so that gets to your question Nick which is why does strength training matter so much it's because it is a load the bones need a compressive force on them to grow and the compressive Force comes typically when the muscles around them are

[01:35:42] Contracting um by the way the one thing that I recall from that podcast that stood out as even a greater impact on bone strength was uh wrestling and Jiu-Jitsu um um so you know take that for what it's worth I know that both of those are near and dear to your heart but what happens is when the bone is placed under load think of it as a strain gauge that measures the deflection of the bone and that strain gauge has to communicate through a chemical signal uh to the osteoblasts and osteoclasts which are the bone building and Bone decaying cells respectively and that chemical signal so the mechanical signal is transduced into a chemical signal that's done via estrogen and so that's why estrogen is so important because it's the chemical messenger that says hey I'm under load

[01:36:32] I'm being deformed please give me more bone building uh material here so um you know what else can I say about that well look you know unfortunately this is another one of those things that declines precipitously um with age um and it's nonlinear meaning the rate of decline goes up by decade it's not a constant rate of decline you referred to a study that was done by Belinda Beck um at I believe Griffith University in Australia we'll again we'll link to that but it was called the lift more trial it was published in 2015 I've linked many times before to a great YouTube video where she kind of talks about the high level of this this is a study that recruited um healthy postmenopausal women with low um bone mass so these were women that all had at least osteopenia t-c scores below minus1 and the intervention group was given 8 months of just twice weekly 30 minutes at a time so 60 minutes total supervised um strength training where they were doing five sets of five reps at more than 85% of their one rep max the reason this study always caught my attention is these were you know women who didn't have a background in strength training and yet they were doing 5x fives and so we want to also kind of dismiss that the idea that you can't take somebody who's new and get them strong 5x5 is are real set right those are those are those are big workouts and these are being pushed to 85% Beyond 85% of their 1rm um so that was the intervention the control group was just given low intensity exercise and after 8 months the um bmd of the lum our spine in the treatment group had gone up by almost 3% at the same time that the controls had lost over 1% of the bmd in their lumbar spine and basically the same thing was true in the femoral neck you saw an increase in the women who had been training uh versus a significant it was almost a 2% decrease in the control group so um again to me it's just one of my favorite studies because of the population that it's using and the

[01:38:53] Simplicity of the intervention um so I just can't say enough about the importance of this I didn't realize it either but how awesome of a name for a study is lift more m o like it's just it's an A+ name got to do it got just got to do it uh that should be a license plate for you I feel like every now and then you're looking for license plates lift more is an a+1 although people might be expecting someone insanely jacked bodybuilder arold style to walk out of that yeah yeah I would I would I would not do justice to that license plate yeah that's probably true just need to do more toata deadlifts to get that muscle size up um okay what about protein another subject that you've talked heavily about tons of places we can link to all of them but how does protein relate to muscle building especially in people 15 plus and how do you talk to your patients about it oh boy they're sick of it I'm sure um because we talk about it a lot protein by itself stimulates muscle protein synthesis ingested protein by itself stimulates muscle protein synthesis so um in English what that means is simply eating protein even without a straining a training stimulus promotes the building of muscle of course that effect is dwarfed by the effect of a training stimulus plus uh protein um I look I think at the high level this is relatively straightforward right you you probably want at least 1.6 gram uh of protein per kilogram of body weight and as you get older you should start to move that number higher and higher because of what's called anabolic resistance so as we get older um the muscles become less sensitive to the effects of the amino acids you know I won't cover it here because I covered it in Great depth with on the podcast recently with Luke von Lon um but but it was actually the first time I had a really good explanation at least speculation as to why anabolic resistance is taking place um so I've never actually really known why um and it turns out that maybe that's because nobody knows but Luke offered um a list of several very uh interesting and plausible physiologic reasons for why the Aging individual is less and less sensitive to amino acids um so again we've done so much on protein I don't think I need to say more here we'll link to all of those references with both

[01:41:38] Luke and Don Layman and Lane Norton as well um but the long and short the long and short of it is all of the stuff we're talking about in this podcast needs to be supported nutritionally and nothing is more important than that uh of protein intake um we can talk about how to divide it all up all of that's covered in those podcasts but the short of it is you really want to be at a minimum of 20 grams per serving um but it's more nuanced than that of course because the type of protein determines the speed with which um you're going to be able to to incorporate it um general rule is you know protein in food is going to give you a longer more forgiving window in which to assimilate it um and again we can to even a recent uh newsletter we wrote that addressed a study looking at some of the conventional beliefs that were challenged by a study that actually Luke was an author on looking at the difference between whey and casian protein in terms of muscle protein synthesis over time all right so Peter I think that kind of wraps at least everything we were hoping to get out and as we said in the beginning you know we've covered some of this stuff in

[01:42:51] Greater detail and other places we l to we didn't want to bog it down with too many scientific studies um and we hope to just kind of give people a little bit of insight how to think about starting to exercise as an older age and one why it's important how to do it how to start building it up and so I think as we wrap any last bit of insight or any last bit of advice you would give to people who are in that category the 50 plus the 65 plus who are saying okay you convince me

[01:43:22] I'm going to start doing this yeah I just kind of go back to you know some of the stuff we've already talked about which is um if if you're if you're in that camp if I'm talking to you and I've hopefully convinced you of this um I don't want you to get hurt I want you to have fun I want you to look back at this in 90 days and say I'm really glad I made this change and that means do something as much as you can right try to do something every day and if it means going out for a 15minute walk after dinner great um if 3 months from now you've manage to get to a point where you have a portfolio approach to how you're exercising so you're doing a little bit of stuff that is actually you know resistance training hopefully even progressing Beyond body weight um and you're even starting to challenge the different Energy Systems from a cardio perspective walking you know walking at a modest Pace versus a a little bit of really brisk walking or uphill walking um and you're not injured and you're enjoying it we've won the game yeah I think that's all really solid and hopefully again hopefully people enjoy this no matter what age you are but I think that's it Peter so anything else you want to say before we part ways try to avoid Tata deadlifts I did just so you know I didn't miss it I did appreciate the call back to you face planning in Brazil from uh low blood pressure so we'll include those links to the photos in the show notes but um I did I did appreciate I didn't want to interrupt you because you were going down a good path but I did pick that up just so you know all right awesome we'll see you next time [Music] w
