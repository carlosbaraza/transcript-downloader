This clip is from episode 360 ‒ How to change your habits: why they form and how to build or break them

In this clip, they discuss:

- The military’s habit-shaping secrets: How soldiers are trained to act against instinct through specific conditioning techniques
- Why visual cues matter more than sounds: In combat, dust clouds—not noise—trigger reaction drills because of how the brain responds
- Thickening of neural pathways = stronger habits: Repeated behavior strengthens neural connections, making the habit easier over time
- Mistakes aren’t punished—they’re corrected: Even in the Marines, failure is met with feedback loops rather than harsh punishment
- Military isn’t selecting for habits—they’re building them: Training is designed to instill habits regardless of starting personality or discipline level

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this portion of The Drive podcast with Charles Duhigg:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on habit formation through the lens of military training, particularly how the U.S. military successfully instills automatic behaviors in soldiers. Charles Duhigg, drawing from his experience embedded with military units in Iraq, explains how the military functions as a "giant habit change machine." The discussion centers on the scientific approach to habit formation, including the role of cues, routines, and rewards in creating automatic behaviors.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- The basal ganglia, present in all animals, is responsible for habit formation [04:47]
- Neural synapses connecting behavior centers become thicker with habit formation, allowing faster electrical impulse travel [05:07]
- Humans are naturally "habit machines" with brains evolved for habit formation [08:11]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Focus on identifying specific cues that trigger behaviors [03:07]
- Use social reinforcement as a reward mechanism [06:12]
- Pay attention to positive feedback systems rather than punishment [06:44]

4. **Notable Quotes**:
"The military is a giant habit change machine" - Military Major [00:16]
"Humans are habit machines... We literally have evolved a brain that is fantastic at making habits" [08:11]

5. **References & Resources**:
Books mentioned:
- "Smarter Faster Better" by Charles Duhigg [04:17]

6. **Key Concepts**:
The Habit Loop consists of:
- Cue
- Routine
- Reward [04:47]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. How can these military-based habit formation techniques be applied to civilian health and fitness goals?
2. What role does individual variation play in habit formation speed and success?
3. How can we identify the most effective rewards for different types of habits?
4. What is the optimal timeframe for habit formation using these techniques?

Note: This episode excerpt focuses primarily on the theoretical framework of habit formation through a military lens. The discussion doesn't delve into specific supplements, exercise protocols, nutrition, or biomarkers, which is why those sections are not included in this analysis.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] you know, in many ways you're you're kind of the the OG guy when it comes to talking about habit formation. Give folks a bit of a sense of your background and maybe even how that uh factored into you taking an interest in this topic. Yeah, absolutely. I had two experiences that really got me interested in habits.

[00:00:16] The first is that when I was in Iraq, I got embedded with a unit that was that was right outside of um Baghdad and I was talking to a captain there. actually he was a major and I I was asking him how do you how do you train soldiers to become soldiers because one of the things that you see in a war zone in particular anyone who spent time around the military is that the behaviors are so deeply ingrained right the goal is to ingrain a set of behaviors that if a bomb goes off which happened underneath my car everyone around you the the 50 18year-olds around you who probably don't know how to do anything with their lives they know exactly what to do in that moment and they react automatically and so I was talking to this major and he's this like little short guy and he kind of like you know really muscular he chaws all the time and I said how do you do this and he said well the thing you have to understand son cuz he called me son the thing you have to understand is the military is a giant habit change machine this is what we do we teach young recruits who maybe don't have any self-discipline maybe maybe you know are prone to emotional operas we teach them the right habits and we've made a science of it. And when I came back to the US, I kind of had this experience where I was thinking about that and I was thinking to myself, if I'm so smart and so talented, right? If I have this great job and I win these awards, why can't I get myself to lose weight? Like, why can't I get myself to go running in the morning every day, why is this such a struggle for me when I'm so good at other things? And I realized it was because I had not learned and studied how habits function and my own habits.

[00:01:50] And that once I learned that, I had the tools to change how I behave automatically, which is of course the most important component of our behavior because it's it's what we do every day. How did you come to understand the ways in which a myriad set of behaviors cuz as you said, right, like a soldier is able to do so many things that basically become autonomic um that might be very counterintuitive.

[00:02:15] In fact, might be counter to the value of your own life. Absolutely. like moving this direction as opposed to that direction under threat. Absolutely. Or or training people to kill which the many people have a natural reaction to not kill it. So how does the military do it? Yeah. How do they employ this uh um reward punishment uh leverage?

[00:02:38] So one of the things that they do is they pay very very close attention to teaching cadetses to to respond to cues. So it one would think if I was saying okay if a bomb goes off what are you supposed to do right let's talk about the behavior that you do when a bomb goes off. The thing about a bomb going off is that a bomb going off is a little bundle of cues and we need to talk about which cues you should pay attention to and which ones you shouldn't. Which ones should trigger an automatic behavior.

[00:03:07] So in Iraq the issue with bombs going off IEDs was dust. when there was an explosion of dust, that is when you should react. And we're going to practice that. So, we're going to take you out into the field and we're going to use ordinance that does not actually produce sounds, that does not produce fire. What we're going to do is we're going to put stuff in the ground that creates a huge cloud of dust and we're going to train you to react to that because we have found that dust is a more predictable and reliable indicator of when you should behave than the noise of an explosion or being able to see the fire. And to be clear, the noise could be coming from anywhere.

[00:03:45] You don't know where it's coming from. It could be a false alarm. It could be something that's a town away. Exactly. Right. And it's often times overwhelming. The thing about like a visual stimuli in in this context is that it's very very recognizable. Whereas an audio stimuli, it's hard to tell. It's hard to localize. But it's also and it also sort of so overwhelms you that it can kick in that fight orflight instinct that we're trying to avoid. So that's so that's the first thing that they do is they pay a lot of attention to cues and they think really really hard about that training. Um in one of my other books smarter faster

[00:04:17] Better there's a chapter about uh boot camp for Marines and it's probably the most scientifically well finetuned training you will find on Earth because it takes in hundreds of thousands of people every year and we have to train them to be Marines. The other thing that they pay a lot of attention to is how do we reward that behavior in a way that will make it automatic. Right? We mentioned that a habit is a cue, a routine and a reward.

[00:04:47] That's known as the habit loop. But what happens in our brain to form that habit loop is that the part of our the basil ganglia which every animal on earth has a basil ganglia. The basil ganglia's job is essentially to make habits because without those habits we essentially can't evolve, right? Right? We just spend too much time in cognition.

[00:05:07] And what the basil ganglia helps encourage, and this is oversimplifying dramatically, but is it takes that cue, that routine, and that reward, and it puts them in a kind of circuit where the neural synapses connecting the behavior centers of those three items becomes thicker and thicker and thicker, which means that as a result, an electrical impulse can travel down that synapse faster. So, if I'm the general, my goal is to take these soldiers and to change their brain so that when they see smoke, they react immediately, which is they pull out their gun, they look for the threat, they go through the mental checklist of look for these five things and then I want to have a reward for them that's predictable and consistent.

[00:05:50] Now, in that situation, there's not a natural reward. I have to create that reward. So, one of the things that I do is I have them train as a unit. And as soon as they all take position, they all say to each other, "Good job. Good job. I'm in position. Good job. Good job. Good job." They're all positively reinforcing each other. That becomes a reward that can build this behavior.

[00:06:12] Which is why looking at the unit or the platoon is so important in how we train soldiers is because oftentimes the rewards that are reinforcing our habits are social rewards that we're getting from other individuals. And during training, let's say it's the first day they're going through this drill and two of the guys fall out of formation, they fail to to get in position. The absence of being able to say, "Good job." Is that sufficient or is there also a punishment of, "Hey, you two guys, you were in the wrong spot. Let's go do it again."

[00:06:44] Well, it's the Marines, right? So certainly the drill sergeants um they have a certain reputation to uphold about about yelling at people. But no, it's actually but it's not doing that much. It's not really doing that much. It's helping people correct. It's it's creating it's creating sort of that instead of a wicked feedback system, a positive feed, a good feedback system where I'm learning very quickly, but it's actually me seeking out that reward. One of the things that you'll find if you look at surveys of why people fight, inevitably they will say, "I joined because of patriotism and I stayed in the military because of my because of camaraderie because of the guys next to me. I I couldn't go home. I couldn't I have to take care of them."

[00:07:25] That be and that's really encouraged by the military and that becomes the dominant overwhelming positive reinforcement is that you act for your fellow soldiers. And when one of them turns to you and says, "Good job. Good job." What he's really saying is you helped protect me and I'm going to help protect you. And that feels amazing.

[00:07:42] So when you think about the number of people that make it through the various forms of training and whether it be Marines, special forces, elsewhere, etc. Um, are they screening for the capacity to be able to form these habits or is their point of view that we can basically instill this in anyone provided some basic set of criteria of aptitude or psychological well-being is present.

[00:08:11] It's the latter. It's latter. And and I'm kind of curious in your work how that plays out. Um, that's exactly why I'm asking right because what so what they what they believe and the science tells us this is true. Humans are habit machines, right? We we literally have evolved a brain that is fantastic at making habits. And so we can take almost anyone assuming a baseline physical readiness and and mental capacity. We can take anyone and we can teach them to be a good soldier.

[00:08:40] Now, some people are going to be elite soldiers, right? Some are going to become special forces. They might have an aptitude where they're more comfortable with willpower. They're more comfortable with grit. They're more comfortable experiencing discomfort. And so they might be able to create habits faster. They might understand sort of just intuitively or through learning how to affect their habits. But we can do this with anyone which actually I'm curious when someone comes to you and they are ex exert they are showing a a habitual behavior that you think is negative that they want to race and you want to race. Are there some people whom you believe like it's just not going to happen like I can't help this person?
