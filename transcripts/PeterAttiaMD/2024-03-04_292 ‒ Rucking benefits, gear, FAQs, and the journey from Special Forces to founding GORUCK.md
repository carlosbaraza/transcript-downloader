[00:00:00] the best things that you want out of life require passion and energy and activity you have to do them we need to be people who do things and the more that you do the more confident that you get doing things and this is a really important lesson that everybody has to relearn throughout the course of their life and you have to keep doing stuff the body is antifragile the more that you work it the stronger it it it gets and and that's an amazing amazing thing that we have and to not know what we're capable of is just a shame and so let's let's intentionally do these physically harder things than than nothing than just you know living our lives on phones or always walk always standing to then sit to never move I mean there's just so much freedom and there's there's so much benefit that comes from from your ability to move yourself and to carry weight and you are built and born and have evolved in order to do this you just have to kind of do it hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:21] AA Jason thanks so much for for making time I know you're here in Austin for some for some awesome stuff that maybe we'll get to but uh always great to be with you in person again thanks for having me out to your podcast Studio you know people who listen to this podcast especially for the past year or two years now have heard me talk about rucking a lot and uh I point back a lot to to you and to Michael Easter and of course you and Michael are friends in fact I met you through Michael so clearly we're going to talk a lot about rucking today but I I think you know for people to kind of understand what it is and all of the how-tos I mean I've got a list of all these questions that I know you're so fasile in um I think maybe to to put in context kind of your broader

[00:02:07] Mission it makes sense a little bit to kind of understand your journey uh so so so maybe we can kind of start with some of that let's start where where should we go all right so you grew up in Florida um you have a military background let's talk about how you found your way there and you know what what what we doing in high school and college that ultimately led to that yeah so I was born in Ohio my mom was really young when she had me we moved down to to Gainesville Florida

[00:02:36] I was The Unofficial mascot for the women's tennis team gogators and you know I kind of grew up like that bounced around with my mom and you know at that time I the military was not really a thing my grandfather had fought in Korea he was an artillery officer never talked about it right my uncle was a a helicopter pilot talked about it a little bit but I didn't see see him that much and so this was not something that was top of mind for me at all I mean the ' 80s was you know Wall Street and

[00:03:07] Gordon Gecko and all of that kind of stuff and how old was your mom when when she had you my mom was 18 and 5 days old when she had me wow so very young and you know that's a very that's a hell of a way to grow up I became very close with my mother you know and just kind of went around with her everywhere was your dad in the picture my dad was and still very much is yeah so he still in Ohio those are still kind of my roots and both sets of Grandparents were in Ohio they lived a mile away I me my parents were in high school together and um and so Ohio was always this kind of grounding thing but it was because of my grandparents mostly I mean my my dad yes and my you know my mom would go back we'd visit Ohio but um it was because my grandparents and they had an an extraordinary amount of influence on my life in high school what in college and whatnot what what did you want to do just to give you the the years I mean I was in Jacksonville Florida I went to the Bowl school which is a a really it's it's an athletic school it's very competitive and you know it was really really hard it was the hardest thing

[00:04:10] I've ever done was high school and you know I've done I mean it's just you don't know who you are yet the school was really hard I mean The English Department just kicked my butt and you know it just all it's coming at you have eight classes and it's it's like I do not there's no part of me I'd rather go back to the special force qualification course then go back and and do a year of

[00:04:33] English at bows um but I played tennis I played a little basketball and so I was always I was always into sports growing up and being really active and and so I I just I I didn't know what I was going to do with my life though I wasn't good enough to go to a big school and play tennis I went I played D3 tennis at

[00:04:53] Emory in Atlanta and and that was great that was a a great way for me to kind of focus what did you study I studied economics and and art history which was a my grandmothers were both dosen at the Dayton Art Institute so in Ohio and that was just kind of an important part of how I how I grew up in a lot of art museums in America and in the world and so um so you know went to college and then I graduated in May of 2001 and I I did well in I did well in college I finally figured out the the school stuff and it turns out that if you don't live an hour from school and you're able to kind of focus a little bit more and and there weren't these kind of distractions as much in life oddly I was just kind of too focused in college frankly and so I played tennis I did well there I did well in school and and that's kind of what college was for me and you know I I remember applying to these places that people told me I should apply to right pick your bank apply to them pick your consulting firm apply to them and I I had no real I didn't know what any of that was which I don't think most people do at 22 right like what what do you do at Goldman Sachs if you're 22 what do you do at McKenzie if you're 22 well importantly you pay your dues and so you have to figure out how to get into these larger organizations and you know I I didn't know how to do that yet and so I went and traveled around Central America and kind of backpacked a little bit and then came back and was like man I got to get a job I got to do something so I started working at this marketing firm and I was working at a call center on 911 in in Daytona Beach literally across the street from the racetrack and that was just the day that you know anybody that was alive remembers exactly where they were on 911 and for me it was just this enormous kind of sense of sadness and anger that led to to to rage and you know at 22 years old military age male with no dependence no attachments I mean

[00:06:57] I felt compelled to serve our country and and that was a really important thing for me now saying that you want to serve our country and watching you know nvgs the night vision goggles and everything's in green on CNN and it's operation anaconda and it's you know yeah I want to go do that I want to be that you know I mean that's a lot different than the process of of actually signing up to go fight in a time of war and so I I looked at all other kinds of places the CIA the FBI the whole alphabet soup Universe went and started looking all those and and you know what rightfully so those places take a long time to get in the the application process is is long and even on the military I mean I just gone to college so I have this big enormous brain right and I'm so valuable and smart and and uh yeah that's not how it works um but you know everybody wanted to serve our country at that time it wasn't something you just walked up and said oh

[00:07:56] I'm going to be an officer and pick your branch there was a line of mile long of people young people that wanted to serve our country because of what happened at 9/11 so without even a huge call to service there was this this call to service and you know I just kind of I remember reading by now it's 2003 and I started working at a bank in DC and I'm still kind of applying to places but I keep not it keeps not clicking say say more about that I mean we're a year and a half what what's happening in that year and a half between 911 and early 2003 so I felt really down in in Daytona

[00:08:30] Beach and Jacksonville Beach where I I was I just felt really far away from what was going on and and so I had some friends that were in New York I went and visited them in New York and it just felt very communal in a very positive way I mean it was nice to be around parents and loved ones in Florida but

[00:08:48] Ground Zero was in New York and the Pentagon was in DC and it just felt like that's where the decisions were being made it it felt like that's that was just such an important place place at at at that time and I wanted to see it I mean I I went to New York in October of 2001 I mean you can smell it still anywhere you were you could smell it and

[00:09:11] I can smell it sitting here in your office right now I know what that smells like and and God bless the people that that worked through that and I mean they just day after day they just ped pulled bodies out of the rubble and I mean I still get goosebumps when I think about like the amount of sacrifice and the service that went into that day and then to the handoff to the military and I was just didn't know I mean the military is kind of a family business thing it's it's you're you're best served if you're familiar with what that looks like now at the time late 01 and most of o02 presumably you know anybody could walk into a recruiting office and join the Marines or join the join the Army or things like that so not necessarily Special Forces um was that something you were thinking of or were you thinking immediately or were you still at that point thinking no I want to be in the CIA or the FBI or something yeah so the the full picture there was uh Johnny Michael span died he was the first casualty of of the war and he was in um the ground Branch or the paramilitary side of the CIA right now he had come over from the Marines and he was chosen for that mission this was the

[00:10:21] John Walker Lind prison Uprising where where Mike span died and he had a special language skills which which gave him why he was given that mission and you know they needed to kind of loosen the reins on some of the press around 9/11 at that time for various reason like people wanted to know what was going on and his story was in fact a very inspirational one for me personally and it it's like that's what I want to do I want to be on the tip of the spear serving our country like that and so that led me down the path of the CIA and it's a it's a long process I mean I went through I went through a almost all of it and you know it was just not I mean I was 22 years old I'm a very active person and and I I wanted to join the paramilitary side of the CIA the CIA does not take people and turn them into soldiers it takes very very well Tred highly experienced soldiers and it plugs them into kind of a different Mission set and I didn't know any of that so there was this guy that was interviewing me and finally you get to one-on ones and there's more of those and there's lots of those and I'm in a you know one of the office parks in Northern Virginia and he looked at me and he was like look we don't train I kept asking about this how do I get this he's like we don't we do not train people off the street to go do this you need to go join you know the special forces or you need to do something like that inside of the military first and then come and work with us and I'm like okay finally a year later here we go we have our answer and so I really doubled down on the officer route again because I felt like that's what I should be doing and and and and just for folks listening officer route because you have a college degree corre rather the the enlisted route for people say just doing this right out of high school correct exactly and and so you know and there's far fewer numbers of officers those numbers are determined by

[00:12:11] Congress you know inlisted ranks they can grow very quickly and when you're fighting a war you need to grow enlisted ranks very quickly and so we were and so fast forward and now there's the buildup to Iraq which was also I I I know what it felt like to live in America at that time it was very started to become very divisive and all that which puts some strain on my process my thought process just because I I joined up to go to

[00:12:34] Afghanistan and fight al- Qaeda um but ultimately you know you don't get to choose when you're when you're serving you don't get to choose and I just remember reading there was the uh the Generation Kill series that came out in Rolling Stone and it was written about the Recon marines that that took Baghdad and that whole thing it was later made into you know TV series movie and stuff and I was just like and and that was

[00:13:00] March of 03 I'm like man these wars are passing me by like before you know little did I know that they would go on so so long but it just felt like I I needed to do something and so I I bypassed the officer route and I I started talking to the Army and they had this program where you can enlist and they would guarantee you slots into the schools that that comprise the Special

[00:13:22] Forces pipeline the only caveat is you got to keep making it and and so you know there's a lot of different schools in that Pipeline and so it starts out with basic training in Airborne school and then a prep course and then selection and then another Prep course and then phase two and phase three and phase four and survival school and language school and all sorts of stuff and so you just have to keep making it through and then they give you that little green beret and you feel like you're king of the world and so they basically said you'll you will you will be able to rise to the level of Your

[00:13:53] Capacity yes and you have to get lucky I mean you know you if you get injured you get recycled you get I mean anything's possible but yes I mean and and so you know part of the calculus is you you look at say the the Army and there's a lot of infantry options so say you go through basic training to be to join the

[00:14:13] Infantry okay well you're infantry qualified you can serve in you know the 101st you can serve in you go to Airborne school okay well now you can serve in an Airborne unit 802 Airborne or whatever the case may be and then once you get like you can still fight and that's what I wanted to do was I wanted to fight and you know I it's it's odd because I was not a kid that grew up I don't start fights I don't like I wasn't just you know fist fighting every day on the playground or anything I just felt I mean in every every fber of my being I just wanted to fight for our country where do you think that came from and and I mean you know if you think about other kids you went to college with college with who were in the exact same situation they graduated right before 9/11 um um do you have a sense did you did you talk about this with any of those guys and who were your friends in college and did you get the sense that you know that any of them felt so compelled and and if not why do you why do you think this was sort of unique to you you know I have thought about it and I don't really understand I mean out of our high school class there were two of us that joined the military my wife would join the CIA later and serve on the front lines in

[00:15:23] Africa as well you know that um but we were the three out of a CL you know class of 15060 we all graduated in '97 we all graduated from college in 01 you know in college there was an RC program at Emory which frankly I thought was a little bit odd Now full full story here is my grandfather you know both of them kind of revered the military right at the same time and and in our country they had both kind of worked really hard and been successful and and like loved our our country and and yet you know my grandfather this is something I don't think he got right was he had this idea of you know after Blackhawk Down in

[00:16:10] Mogadishu with with Bill Clinton he was like nobody should ever serve in this man's military and I think that that's a very knee-jerk and very human reaction to say when you don't like someone politically but you always need people to serve this country or else everything that we hold dear crumbles in other words the the need for service should be completely nonpartisan amen and and that's it's not just the military man I felt compelled to fight but I'm I'm a you know a military age male that's been active my whole life who's you know predisposed to want to do hard things and and challenges and and and that's not more important or better than someone that wants to become a teacher we we need both and we need to celebrate both and honor both for what they do for us and our kids and our society and our way of life and I I so I think it took kind of all of the data points in my life that brought me to that point and I just I really I really wanted to do something special with my life and I didn't know it's it's a scary time how do you do that do you do that by joining company ABC D the short answer is no that's a stepping stone to something else you have to learn you have to push on life and it's going to push back and you have to learn what matters to you and what doesn't what are you going to do and what are you willing not what do you refuse to do and for what reason and you have to learn these things the hard way and and everybody's a little bit different and just my life had brought me to that that point and it just happened to be 4 months before 911 and then 911 and then it took me two and you know over two years to finally join this was not an immediate thing a lot of cowardice baked into that whole process you know cuz it's it was hard it was really hard and then you know keeping it secret from my family my mom crying on the kitchen counter when I finally told her like yep sign up join the Army today oh that's awesome like said no Mom ever yeah right I mean

[00:18:10] Iraq's on the front page news every night they're they're showing you know portraits of soldiers Sailors you know Marines who are dying in in Iraq yep I'm going to go I'm going to go fight like that's not that's hard did your conviction waver by the fall of 2003 uh less about public sentiment um which you know I think even by the fall of 2003 public sentiment had not fully sort of you know shifted on Iraq um but just in terms of your own thinking about hey you know Al-Qaeda based out of

[00:18:46] Afghanistan probably half in Pakistan at this point that's where the fight is not sure I understand this Iraq thing I mean what was your thinking about that personally I never really understood the the the buildup to Iraq I mean wmds I mean I I never really got it but I still knew and and this is something that I I now have this litmus test about regret I think that regret is about the worst thing that you can carry around with you everywhere you go in life and and I think that most of us know when we're going to regret something we just don't listen to that voice that's inside of our head and so I knew for a fact politics damned I knew that I would regret it for the rest of my life if I didn't join up and serve our country at that time and so that that out Shawn any of the other potential all of the other stuff and it was hard once it's like you are joining up to go fight you're not becoming an officer you're going through this enlisted route to become a special forces Soldier intentionally going to fight on the tip of the spear and we're about to start a or we have started second war on a new front and it's it's you know so what wavered was oh man what did I make the wrong decision I can probably get out of this and I can probably go join go go try the CIA again

[00:20:13] I can probably you know go cash in some favor from somebody somewhere and get an officer Billet and you know be safer but you know being safer doesn't always spare you from regret and in fact it's it's usually just a way to delay what you know you need to do which is the right thing for you and your path and that was a really really hard decision and a lot of ways it was a it was an extremely selfish decision but for me for the rest of my life I mean I had to be willing to roll the dice a little bit at that time tell folks where kind of green Beres fit in the hierarchy of the military uh I I think people are sort of familiar with special forces and people have maybe heard of Navy Seals and Army Rangers and uh Delta Special

[00:21:00] Forces you know but but I think for most of us those things are kind of vague yes so the the main and the the main difference between Green Berets and pick your other pick your other the the seals the Delta SEAL Team Six you know the Rangers is those are in essence strike forces I mean the Rangers are and the Marines I mean the Marines take the take the beaches they secure the land and then a bigger Force comes in it is speed and violence of action and it's it's they're doing it with other Marines the the classic mission for the Green

[00:21:41] Berets that people will remember is right after 911 of a few odas a few operational Detachment Alphas a teams of green ber went in to Afghanistan into the Boneyard of the Soviet Empire right and instead of fighting as the Soviets did which is is more assaulters more helicopters more whatever instead of just throwing more of our own people at it we linked up green Beres linked up with the Northern Alliance and and fought by with and through them in order to defeat the Taliban and that happened in you know under three months and so that is the The Sweet Spot for what we in in Army Special Forces Green Berets are synonymous and and historically did that how long had they been around had they been around since n had they been around since 19 52 okay so Korea basically yeah and Vietnam was very much a a lot of the similar work was done with with local indigenous tribes the mountain yards in Vietnam and it I mean this has been I mean green bra's in a 100 countries right now right and they're working with local forces if you go to Africa green BRS are diplomats right I mean you know diplomats working out of the embassy is fine but you've got I mean who's who's really controlling that country is the the military so you need military people to go and be kind of diplomatic with those people and we do we train we train up partner forces and then we get them to achieve our desired instate our our mission set and so in the case of

[00:23:14] Afghanistan after 911 it was you know overthrow the Taliban and do it with the minimal footprint possible so you can send very few Green Berets in and and God bless the Air Force while we're at it because you know having air cover and that that's a that's a total Game Changer so where did you learn the skills that are clearly diplomatic right

[00:23:34] I mean to be thrown into Afghanistan and realize that you have to now work with the Northern Alliance is very different from saying hey this is our show right meaning our show meaning like we're here to do this now it's we're working as partners to do this together um was that explicitly uh taught was that part of the training or are they selecting for that as their weeding people out so these were some of my Cadre my that were the the guys that were on those teams you know Triple Nickel Oda 555 595 and like those were guys that had just come back and were our Cadre um and and so it is part of the selection process and I think that when you get into whether it's the military or business or anything so much is determined by who you serve with and and what are you looking for out of the people and so you need this strong culture and yes it's very much a part of of the Special

[00:24:34] Forces pipe and like do you play well with others right and and then there is a a language component like you have to be able to speak foreign language which how long did it take you to learn a foreign language so I already spoke German so I I passed out of the that part of the language component but that's because I'd also lived in Germany for over a year at that point and studied abroad and done all that which is part of what you need to be successful I mean there is a the the culminating exercise of the Special

[00:25:02] Forces qualification course is called Robin sage it's a mock War spread out all over North Carolina and you would insert like we jumped out of an airplane with 125 pounds on a ruck sack between our legs right jumping out and then you land which is hurts and then we rucked for 18 plus hours with 125 pounds on your back yes to link up with what is a gorilla Chief like a it's it's B basically a warlord and you know you're testing your ability to think in a gray area because the military is very doctrinally based it's black it's white you know if this happens you do this if that happens you do you do that right and this is a world where you know the the Warlords have malleable morals and so you know you roll up and this is your your point of contact and there's a an execution that happens within four minutes of you being there and this is this is in the training environment but this is real I mean this is exactly how it happens and it's and so you're just kind of well how can you not lose your cool you lose your cool you burn Rapport you're you're done you just you you have sacrificed the mission because of your dogmatic principles that you brought with you from America and I mean if you don't like that don't don't leave our Shores and and don't take this job because you have to learn how to how to conduct yourself like that because you still need to work with them if you don't work with the northern you're going to lose against the talian let's talk a little bit about the physical training um I'll preface this by saying that I'm sure most people are familiar with what hell week is like for the seals and you know what the the the the um what's their underwater demolition buds yeah buds that they go through um for for months leading up to it um it's very interesting by the way I'll caveat this by saying I I I have three good friends who are former seals and uh they're very much like you which is to say they're they're not these they're not what people would expect stereotypically right these aren't you know super aggressive individuals um and I'll I'll share with you a question I have asked them and and you can I'm sure you you might Echo the same thing which is um you know what predicts a person's success going through that grueling physical uh series of tests I and then the second question

[00:27:30] I asked them because these guys are all now in their 40s 50s even knowing what you know today having the mental toughness you have today could you physically go back and do it again so I'll share with you their answers as we get into yours but um let let's go through what what was physically involved in in the most demanding part of that training so if you you see this stuff on the Discovery Channel which I had seen as well and you think that that's what it is you think think that the yelling and the screaming which plays really well on TV and it lets people think that that's what it is like that part is laughable and it's very it's very short it was very very I mean

[00:28:10] I'm talking that was hours out of years of training was was yelling the the the hardest thing that you're competing against is your own mind and so the rucking is the foundation of special forces training just to answer the the the foundational you what I have what we have done at go is very tapped into this we've not invented this we've not created it and what I learned I owe to the people that taught me and it's a tribal culture and

[00:28:42] I'm and I'm grateful that I was able to to to share some time with them in that regiment and and so I had no idea what rucking was when I joined the army I started out you know doing stuff in the gym on you know normal stuff that you would do with the mirrors everywhere and you know people and just like normal stuff and then I ran a lot I thought okay well cardio and I'll get strong it's it's better than nothing right you need to have miles on your legs and you need to be strong but it's that is not what this is about and you know you start out I mean special force selection ultimately to be a great teammate you first have to be a great individual so they test you really really hard to make sure that you're the type of individual that has that has the the ability to do really really hard things and to not quit because the the draw to do that is is hard but you know so you start out and it's 45 lbs dry meaning water doesn't count any consumables don't count they weigh you when you get there don't be late light or last are the rules and there's a series of checkpoints that you get throughout the pine forests in outside Fort Brag place called Camp McCall and you're just doing land navigation route after route after route after route you're plotting with map and

[00:30:05] Compass you have nothing and you're doing this alone or in teams always alone to start out okay always alone so you have to be a great individual first and you know you start to learn stuff like okay well if I plot this route I got to go through this Creek ah that won't be too hard there's a draw you know anytime you get water you get vegetation when you got vegetation it's going to slow you down there's thorn bush and all this stuff and you would get to you you get there and it's just so thick and you lose which direction you're going you're getting all turned around and you're trying to save two miles of walking around this this draw this heavy vegetation next to water because you know your feet hurt because you've got blisters because you've put so many miles on them already on uneven ground and your feet get wet which makes them harder and you know you don't it's just like there's so many what would be a typical distance for that type of a navigation early on I mean you're doing you know overnight I mean I don't know it's a Five Points say and it's going to take you I don't I'll just say six hours maybe more maybe eight hours I you know seems like forever and you're you but the thing is is sfas or special force selection it's it's three weeks you're just doing this over and over and over and over it it doesn't stop and so they're making and did they explain to you why did they say there's a physiologic reason why rucking is the foundation of what we do did they say it's this it's simply the most efficient way to mimic what you will have to do in the field there was Zero of that it was more you're here to be tested it's silent there used to be a whiteboard there there's kind of barracks and stuff and everybody's in there and there was a white board and the Cadre would write the next hit time on the Whiteboard that's the only way that instructions were communicated I mean if you're looking and and the main point is if you're looking for someone to give you more information or to help you solve your problems if you're looking for that you're in the wrong place this is not like the Army where someone's going to walk around and make sure that you have everything they're going to weigh your ruck at the end of your at the end of your iteration and if you if if you're 44.9 lbs you're done adios see you later so you're responsible for putting the ballast in the pack oh yeah and so what what we would do is you know there's rocks everywhere which man walking around on Pebbles after being out and about and your feet are sore and and I don't just mean the muscles are sore like the skin is sore and your you got shower shoes so flip-flops on and it's just man I can feel it right now as I'm describing this your feet are just shifting around around and hurts you know and you would take that that gravel and you would put it in a little bag and then you would use like fish scales and they have them out you can go weigh your ruck and if you're dumb you're going to put 55 lbs in and if you're smart you're probably going to put you know 47 in just because scales are different and if 2 lounds is going to be what undo you you got bigger problems so you want to make sure that you don't be late light or last and so you always have to have that there it's a very it's it's breeding this culture of autonomy and the selection process is weeding out people that basically people self- select so how many people start at that 3-we uh selection process oh shoot hundreds at that time and what's the attrition I don't know 20% make it maybe

[00:33:44] I mean it's it's and of the 80% who don't make it across that 3 weeks how many raise the flag and how many are are show up light or can they're trying but they just fail I mean most people self- select they they get out in the middle of so they give you a flare right and you'd be out in the middle of your navigation say it's it's at night night when it's cold and it's raining I mean the conditions of course matter and when you see people popping up their flares what that means is I quit because the

[00:34:17] Cadre then comes and gets them and puts them in the back of the pickup truck and you know takes them to the quitters fire which they conveniently locate right next to the where the people still going through the course are going so they have you know the warm fire and all this stuff and it's it's like one of life's great like don't fall prey for that and these folks that end up quitting what do they end up doing are they they go serve somewhere else I mean so honorably you know they go to Alaska or the 82 airborne and a lot of them would were you know at that time they were going straight to war and and you know I got a lot of respect for that like there's not they these are the people that are showing up Towing the line you can't know if you have what it takes to go through this until you go through it now you talked about predictors of of success yes you need to be physically fit say you need to be able to carry weight and do all that whether you know you can or not I didn't know if I could or not but I kind of figured it out um but really what it boils down to is there is no kind of predictor like you can't look at at a lineup and say oh you were the high school quarterback and you look like a you know a statue of what physicality should be I can tell you that from my personal experience those are usually the first ones gone well I was just about to say so in posing this question to many of these Navy Seals who are friends of mine that's exactly what they said is if you were the the

[00:35:47] All-American captain of the water polo team that looks like an Adonis you're probably the first one that's gonna quit which I always found interesting in fact one of my friends mentioned that the one of the toughest guys in their buds was the most physically underwhelming person he had ever seen uh he described him as a you know 5 fo8 kind of slight build didn't even speak English that like English wasn't his first language he was Mexican like he just didn't look like an imposing figure in any way shape or form but he's like guy was mentally so tough and um you know that that's that's kind of the I mean sounds like that's what you're saying it's not just not quitting it's performing I mean you have to perform this isn't like oh if you don't quit we're just going to like you're good you have to make your hit times and then you have peer reviews so in this this sort of testing against uh you know do you play well with others I mean you're stack ranked by everybody on your because they put you in groups at at certain points right and you know if you're consistently last the Cadre just start pressuring like you don't belong here and then that just starts to eat inside your your brain until they're giving you the words that you're going to tell yourself and then once you tell yourself for the last time then you're You're gone all you have to do is say I quit I'm done I don't even like to even use those words you know and and so the I guess that's the beauty of it though is that it it's the unknown and you have to push someone for it won't work in two days it won't work in 5 days you have to push this over days and weeks and months because you're just wearing down someone's will because it gets hard now it's interesting do you think how how old are you today you're probably in your 44 okay um and you were about 24 when you did this yep could you do it again man I I I love to sit and say yes you know it's the I I think there is a percentage the risk is much higher just because injuries are injuries are so much more prevalent and you don't recover as quickly it's amazing that's exactly what every one of these guys to a man said the same thing cuz I said look you you've made the case to me that this is mind over body all day long your mind is clearly at least as strong as was when you were in your 20s could you do it again and they all said no for exactly that reason they said the fundamental difference is I we simply could we didn't have the recovery we won't we wouldn't have the recovery capacity today that we had in our early 20s so I mean now I got another buddy who who's was an enlisted Green Beret for a long time and then just went back and and joined the officer Corps right now to do that for the Infantry he had to go back through Ranger school now he did he's a couple years younger than I am in

[00:38:57] Ranger school 62 days and can you do that yes you can do that I mean the volume of of ocean work at buds is really really really significant right like it's it's a different type of they're feeding you a lot at at buds they don't feed us in the Q course how much weight did you lose a l i mean i certain phases I was down to 180 you know they laughed and called me Skeletor by the end of a bunch of them cuz you

[00:39:27] I'm tall and skinny and and I had to work really hard I thought that you were supposed to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Rambo or these guys who had played Green Berets and what I found is that you know getting unne you can never be too strong but you can definitely be too big and so the more weight that you have on your body that's nonfunctional the like the more you have to carry around with every step that makes you slower so you don't want to do that and and so how do you become this kind of lean super mediumsized perfect kind of specimen of of of efficiency if you will and naturally it does that for you cuz you're just rucking so so much and it just crushes being fed throughout these training activities MREs boxes at MREs there's a little bit of time at the at the chow hall at Camp MCO but not really you just don't have the time and what's in the

[00:40:22] MREs a couple thousand calories of stuff that'll last 10 years how gross they're they've gotten pretty good actually I mean and and hunger is the best sauce so when you're hungry you just it it tastes amazingly it it tastes amazing some of my best meals were MREs because I mean one of the phases we went dumpster diving you know and we found a whole bunch of stuff and we ate it and it was incredible it's one of the best meals

[00:40:46] I've ever [Laughter] had yeah it's interesting so um what was so so the 45 dry is kind of your 4 a.m. to rcking Y as the training progressed talk more about some of the rcking uh challenges yeah so 45 dry was uneven and kind of tank Trails so tank trails are basically Sandy trails that tanks would go on on on on bases right and those are you can you can make better time on those because they're not you know sloped and and stuff quite as much and we would have straightup Ruck run competitions I mean and you have to meet certain time standards on that and that is just you and you have a we call it a rubber duck like a version of a rifle that you have to carry with you which is just you know asymmetrical carry of several pounds for 10 miles or 12 miles or carry that in your hands not strapped on the pack yeah yeah and so those were foot races you know the 45 dry was also across you know just the Pine Forest and a lot of miles and then then you get into team tactics and the team tactics means that you're carrying heavier

[00:41:55] Machinery heavier machine guns and stuff so there's tripods there's more ammo at this point it's it's blanks and training of course but you know there's there's larger machine guns there's a saw there's you know there there's stuff like that which someone has to carry and so you're you're dispersing the load a little bit across the team but everyone's rocks get a lot heavier so call it 85 PBS right and you're you're patrolling much more slowly you're learning what a wedge is you're learning how to do ambushes and raids and you know you're you're you're you're getting to an attack point setting your rucks down and and then you're you're going and you're going lighter to attack a

[00:42:33] Target and then you're you're going back to your rucks and then you're egressing with your rucks back on and tell me about what the sacks looked like because presumably you know when you're carrying all of these trimmings youve you've got to be strapping them on so so what does the base pack look like I mean the big green army Alice pack I mean and it's you know everyone how much volume how many liters is it inside rough like all of them it's enormous okay and it's it's it's a really really really big pack I me I don't know 80 90 lers I mean it's really big and it's and it it doesn't go above your head so it's not like the big hunting packs or whatever that you would see that that goes above it's it's kind of on your shoulders and then you also had this it's called loadbearing equipment this kind of uh like almost like a vest of sorts and it would have a a belt on it where you would store other stuff magazines and stuff like that which kind of prevented you from using the hip belt on the Alice pack which was you know you just kind of get used to and so you've got that big pack on your back with or without a chest strap without and then no hip belt because there's kind of a hip belt but it's not really a load it's not a load transfer and and that's that's also true in kind of you know the real world I say the real world of of of combat I mean you have stuff on your front that you need putting all these straps and stuff this sternum strap and hip belts and all this stuff I mean that's fine if you're going to insert over a mountain to get to your Target and then drop your rock like maybe you need to do that but if you're carrying stuff on any type of an urban assault or anything like that I mean you have like I had my pistol my chest rig was right here on my on my chest right my my my uh magazines for my

[00:44:23] M4 were right here like I'm not going to uncp my hit belt so I can then get at my my ammo that's that's not in line with the priorities of work like you want to get that ammo as fast as you possibly can so all of that load is on your shoulders yes until you get into to what I talked about with the 125 PB insertion and stuff and at that point it's you're doing everything that you can to carry that load like you're trying to just change it up so that the blood can flow to different places once you CU if you jack it down on your hips great it'll give your shoulders a little a little bit of relief and you jack it down on your shoulders to give your hips a little relief the blood you can kind of feel it coming back to life it's just such a great feeling as that happens so you're just kind of adjusting it constantly so the 125 lb exercise tell us what that was again you parachuting with that with that pack so you jump in with that which is it's a team effort to kind of waddle to the to the airplane and get on the airplane and kind of collapse back and sit down and then you hook up and then you're you know you're you're jumping into you know an air strip in North Carolina from what elevation not not too high I mean I don't know 800 feet th000 feet I mean so your parachutes coming open immediately yes well so it's it's not a Halo jump so it's a static line jump which basically means that you have your your your backpack at that time is Your Parachute and you hook up into the side of the plane it's like what you saw in banded

[00:45:51] Brothers one of the greatest series ever created you see them hook up and then as they're going out the parachute immediately and your your ruck sack is off your belt and it's dangling in between your legs the issue is you I mean what what's holding it though you're holding it with your hands it to to your belt no it's attached to your belt it's attached to your belt it's fully attached and then you you kind of lower it down so there's a lowering line right before you you land you lower it down because if you don't you're I mean it's just the the risk of injury like breaking your legs or whatever the way that you would fall would be harder cuz you actually want to like like a parachute Landing fall you land with two feet and then you kind of roll your legs over to disperse the the force against your your body it still hurts but you know you fall faster with all that weight and you just land hit like a sack of potatoes and I just remember landing and I I'm doing it right now too I kind of wiggle my toes and my knees and like all right nothing's broken good get up and then you got to get that thing on and you're like getting on all fours like you get it on and kind of roll over like a dog and you like you're you're you're grabbing the back of your hamstring to pull one of your legs forward and then pressing up and it's a whole thing now once you have your team you're one person does not have a Ruck on and then you help somebody else get up once you get it up it's easier it's still really hard but it's easier and and it's a team effort to get down and then get back up and it's it's just excruciating and it's you know if that's going to be the hardest thing in in your life you're also in the wrong the wrong business cuz you know that's basically just physically demanding and what was the chat the physical part of that how long did you guys have to go I mean that was 18 hours insertion that's right you said 18 hours my God I mean and it's just horrific it is so slow and it's you know it's in a combat situation is which means it's you know they have timelines that they're trying to hit and basically it just it really really sucks and it's a right I mean it's Pine Forest North

[00:47:55] Carolina Pine Forest so there's some some hills and it's it's not hard it's not hard balls it's not concrete so how often do you take the pack off to rest gosh as little as POS you just want to get there but you know it's like all of a sudden they simulate that oh there's potential enemy over their hide you know and like the last thing you want to do is stop because you just want to keep going and get there and and like that starts to eat away at you it's all you can think about it's like being cold is the only thing that I would kind of equate it to it just starts to consume your your thought no matter what's going on if you're that cold it just kind of eats away at you and that pack and at that weight it it just eats away at you you can't think tactically you can't kind of like head on a swivel paying attention to enemies it it doesn't happen and so as commanders are susceptible as we all are to kind of risk aversion like hey you need to have everything in order to be prepared for this Mission I mean there's this other maximum which is speed is security and if you know there's there's greater

[00:48:58] Assumption of some risk if you have fewer things but you have greater speed and so that's kind of a a a worthwhile thing for people to consider like how do you achieve Mission success do you actually need 125 pounds but that that's beside the point in training you need at this phase of your training you are in really good rucking shape you are in really good shape of everything and this is the beginning of a mock war and they need to make sure that you are exhausted and not thinking lucidly and they need to make sure that you can operate under conditions of extreme stress and they do that and it's it's very effective and the thing is is that when you go through that when you are done you know that you did something you can't cheat yourself you know what you had to do to do it and it is an amazing feeling of gratitude for the human body and the human mind that you get that is the gift that you get with these people that you share this sacred experience with and so you don't want to Short Change yourself of that in any way you want you want the full red pill experience take the red pill do the thing and watch what happens to your mind when you're done now at this point you've really got all the people who are going to select out have done so correct um so are there I mean it's just such a physically demanding task that I have to imagine that there were people who's is there but physically they can't keep up do you guys stay together no matter what so almost nobody washes out by that phase I mean there's the practicality of the army has every incentive to weed people out as quickly as possible they don't want to keep people in a training pipeline for years only to find out at the very end that they're not I mean it costs millions of dollars to to to do this in addition to just wasting time so you're getting people I mean the body has grown accustomed to this I you start 45 dry you're going at various speeds to include shuffling and fast to O you know over uneven terrain you're getting up into 85 pounds you're you're starting to know that this is really vital to your ability to operate and do this job so you start to take it upon yourself to do this which I did a lot of I started rocking a lot because that was the thing that I needed to do to achieve Mission success which was to pass this damn course and so by the time you get meaning on your own time you were rcking oh yeah how much time did you have for yourself so I mean you would go through a phase and then sometimes it would be you know a month until the next phase started sometimes it wasn't and there were so many people going through at that time that you know slots and phases and and and all this they just needed a lot of a lot of people to do this job so it's just you have to maintain your your degree of physicality and that's that's part of it so what workouts would you do on your own when you were at home for a month to stay in shape so on Bas I would go and park at the uh I would go and park at one of the gyms which are always there's tank Trails everywhere it's kind of a thing and so I would go on Long rocks of varying degree of weight right and you know you're also doing things like how do you harden your feet and keep them hard like Cliff's Notes version is start out with uh thin thin socks right if you develop any hot spots ring those socks out or trade your socks and and keep going right and and don't let it develop until it gets blisters but the hot spots will eventually turn into calluses if you treat them correctly and when you go out into the field with calluses I mean man you start getting blisters blisters have no kind of bearing on your physical performance other than that they go straight to your brain right like this is so much pain and you just start to think about it and it consumes you so you have to start to think about well how do I prepare my feet for this how do I do this and so I just put a lot of miles in and then I would do these mad dashes into the gym

[00:52:59] I've never actually loved going inside of of the gym so I would put headphones in I mean this is back in the sort of you know edra laddin Universe of you know pregame when pregame was really pregame workout and I'd go in there just like a madman and just I didn't know what I was doing right I mean this this is long before CrossFit started you know

[00:53:25] Midway through the Q course and that was an interesting thing it was you know sandbags and pullup bars and stuff like that that was it's part of the training though and one of the guys came out there had these two instructions was razor and blade right like awesome call signs and he's like man there's this new thing called CrossFit you know and it is awesome high-intensity training and this is what you need to be the heroes that your country demands of you at this point it is so good it is so fast we're going to do one crossfit workout and then we're going to go on a 10 mile run or a 10 mile Ruck and then we're going to come back and we're going to do another crossfit workout that's how good it is right and it's like awesome I'm in and it was so simple it was sandbag I mean and you got everybody in in this dirt field just rolling around in it and it's it's like don't cheat yourself man look around and see who's see if anybody's cheating if they're cheating you do not want to serve with them I mean that is motivation right there you know and so there was just this culture of I mean it is iron sharpening iron all the time and you're around it all the time and you start to to to just live like that it's it's it's animalistic in a in a good way and and so yeah on my own time sure I would I swam a lot I mean I dedicated myself to becoming the best that I could be and and because I can control those variables I can't control unconventional warfare I can't control the the problems that they're going to get me I can't control my perfect reaction to this or that it's unknowable I don't know what these things are going to be but I know that the best thing I can do is to set myself up for the the optimum physical response that I have to anything and I found that at times where I found some of the doctrinal things that they were teaching us to be a huge challenge to me I mean linear Ambush versus an L-shaped Ambush like why are we doing this remember asking that question and it was like why don't you low crawl for the next hours until you come up with a good answer for that question it's like okay got it no more questions right college boy right and so like some of these were really hard but I found that I could make it up to the team by just being in great shape carrying more weight longer and doing with smile and my face and so that was the variable that that I controlled so I took up a lot of swimming personally I you know at that time I was there was this uh kind of this hippie Street in fville North Carolina called Hay Street and there was this yoga studio down there and I told nobody that I was going and doing I was doing yoga every day when I didn't have when I wasn't out in the field and I was doing it because I I wanted to not get injured because the volume of work and Reps and just you can feel it you're getting sore and it's it's a thing it's just a lot of weight and miles and Reps and how can I set myself up for success and so I started doing getting my ass kicked by these like older ladies at this yoga studio and I was in there and you know they probably knew I was in the Army but I was trying to kind of camouflage that of of sorts I I didn't want to talk about it by any stretch and I was doing that just to kind of give myself a a little bit of an edge at least for me I thought it was an edge and and I think half the battle going into anything is to go in confident if if you've cut Corners you know it that's the thing you you know the cat's going to find out but you know it and that Burrows inside your brain and then when something doesn't go your way you start to play the whatif game that whatif game is so dangerous but if you if you've done what you can do and you show up ready then you know the outcome is going to be what it's going to be and and so I was committed to that process and I really am am grateful that

[00:57:19] I had that opportunity to kind of see what I was made of according to a standard that I had nothing to do with establishing when did you finally serve did you when did you go into the field so I joined up in October of 2003 and I earned my Green Beret in May of 2006 and then went to 10 special for first of all that's just that's two and a half years yeah I mean that's unbelievable how long that takes right yeah it is there's a lot of it's a lot of training that I got it's part of the reason why I mean I I know how much I owe you know I'm not talking about taxpayer dollars although

[00:57:59] I'm grateful for those I'm I'm talking about like the the amount of knowledge that I got from the people who had gone and done amazing things and with with like a human spirit that is burning so brightly and for them to share some of that with me throughout my my training and just to breathe some of that same air I mean I just feel like I owe and and and I owe at least what they gave me and and more and and so that was I mean sacred sacred time for me and then it got even more sacred when I got to my team and and uh you know we deployed in 2007 and we were in Iraq and that was a really nasty time in Iraq I mean the surge was going on lot of lot of guys and and girls were dying and it was you know I was not immune to questioning my own decisions and mortality and why did

[00:58:54] I do this and and all of that and um and then did make it through obviously and then you know came back and went on a uh we served in Stuart and out of uh Germany and then we also went down to morania the Islamic Republic of and did you know worked by with and through some of the partner forces down there for a period of time which was great and then

[00:59:14] I got out in late 2008 what determines when you're going to get out so my contract my initial contract was five years and what I expected was you know I I remember these these primarily men that that served in you know say World War II and storm of the beaches of Normandy I mean most of them served for a couple years and they were gone for a couple years and then they came back and they resumed a a life and they started and they started businesses or they you know worked for a company and they did these things and I kind of

[00:59:48] I never had the opportunity to really talk to somebody about what it was like or I didn't wasn't able to even ask the right questions even if I could have but I thought that that's kind of what it was I thought it was going to be a hey check the box and go do this thing and serve your country and come back and you know then then now now I'll be ready for

[01:00:07] McKenzie and Goldman Sachs and pick your bank or your consulting firm and now I'll be ready for my my regularly scheduled life and and but this service to our country it it changed my heart in the process and so that was the that was the hard part about when it was time to kind of transition out I mean I had a 5year contract and what were the options if you chose to renew that could you have stayed right there in the field oh yeah I mean and I you finally start to get good at what you're doing you're not just trained you've actually done you've actually applied your training and it's one thing to train for war and it's another thing to to fight in a war and and I don't mean just physically the the physical reactions are pretty straightforward to to a large extent I just mean the the actual emotional contemplation of your own mortality and how do you function against that like what are The Quiet Moments like at War when you know someone on another team dies or when you know your flags at half

[01:01:11] Mass because you know an ID struck someone in the next town over or whatever it might be and how do you process that and if you don't process that you you don't know what it's like and you know so that's why you know going through that I I know what that's like and it's not it's it's not great I also learned how to kind of draw strength and and draw strength from my team and Trust in my training and and kind of fight through it what do you think it says about that processing that if anything speaks to the relative differences that people experience when they leave the military in other words um when you think about whether it be PTSD or lesser versions of that um do you think that that has anything to do with how one processes grief in the field I think that there is a I mean I think first off tribe by Sebastian younger is a fantastic book yes on on this it's one of my one of my favorites and he is just a National Treasure to me the way that he is has brought so much of my thinking forward on this as well it's not necessarily the problem of the soldiers it's the problem of society and just being so disconnected and when you go from this this culture that you're living and breathing in with these guys that you you love and I and I mean love and you're just so much a part of something that matters you matter to them and they matter to you at a very deep level and then when your you know your families matter to each other and you're you're motivated by the mission and service you wake up you know that you're doing good and it feels really really good and when that infrastructure goes away and there are other components to that infrastructure I mean the Army and the military I mean everything's kind of taken care of you know there's housing allowances or there's housing that you stay in there's Chow Halls there's like everything is just kind of it just kind of works right and you're in that and you're allowed to focus on being a part of a team and so my transition was was extremely hard and it's you just lose a sense of identity but practically you lose kind of a structure you lose a purpose you lose friends yeah I was going to say how many of your uh call it Brothers really because it's probably what it is how many of your brothers did you go from speaking with and seeing every day to not having contact with outside of the occasional phone call that's right you all of them basically so no one else you were close to was leaving at the same time in reasonable

[01:03:59] Geographic proximity no absolutely not and and I think that's probably normal that's normal that is the norm because you know you go back to where where are you from then and now you've been five years completely removed from any of the normal structure of society your friends who you were probably close to before you went in have moved on they've gotten married they've had kids they've been promoted been at that bank for 5 years and I've been you know doing something different and you know I think there's I

[01:04:33] I felt like I was quitting I felt like I had when you left military I mean because they went right back to Iraq you know and there was a like I you know whatever was going on irq didn't matter going on in Iraq that that's not what mattered What mattered was this team that we had and our ability to serve together and we were safer and we were more effective and we were you know better able to carry out our mission together and and so you know when someone removes is is removed from that and this is natural I mean people come and people go no matter what but to do it of my own valtion felt like I was quitting on my team and that was a lot to kind of process because then you know there's the practic the Practical side of well you're giving up a job you're giving up an income you're giving up purpose identity and and just the structure of okay you wake up you do pt physical training in the morning you go for a run or a Ruck or you lift weights or you do whatever I mean there's a lot of camaraderie that comes out of that you feel a lot better and and so I started to reject all of the things that

[01:05:44] I thought I didn't love about the Army the structure of well I'm never I'm never doing PT again never going to wake up early again right I'm I'm not going to you know everything's going to be just efficient and and you know so optimized and I'm in control of my destiny all the time now and and I think that you know for that quote freedom I gave up a ton I mean the freedom to to to go It

[01:06:13] Alone is like what's the point like make sure that that's what you actually want and you know it took me a while to kind of rebuild a a group a team of friends or people that I wanted to do stuff with it took me a while to be kind of vulnerable enough to let anybody in so I wasn't just kind of robotic about the whole thing because like I I really didn't want to talk about the Army at all you talk about in your book like like you would run away from diet questions I would run away from army questions right so you know grew my hair out and like you know would basically had a series of if not half truths just fullon lies about not and you know just no I didn't serve there no

[01:06:58] I like no I wasn't in the military let's talk about something else I've been you know film making or I've I mean it was just for my own kind of just because I didn't want to talk about it why do you think that was because I felt like I'd quit so there was this deep sense of shame that what why would you get out when you're winning the Super Bowl you know like from this high mountain like the opt so did you think about going back yeah it's it's I very much thought about going back and the the personal side was was very complicated my my wife

[01:07:33] I married a year and a half into my time in in the Army we had grown up together went to high school together finally knocked that cowardice as well like things come in twos so I joined the army and I told the girl finally that I loved her and so we got kind of the courtship was handwritten letters from basic training you know and we eventually got married and I told her about what I was doing before I joined up and she eventually applied to the CIA and applied as a language instructor and they're like no no no so they made her a case officer she went to the farm she graduated the farm and became a case officer I think 5 days before I became a

[01:08:11] Green Beret you know got put on a smoking hot plane to darford to help work on that issue like right after she graduated and then was posted in war torn West Africa Aban coir for 3 years after that so I was at Fort Carson and then I was in you know Iraq and she was in West Africa and then I was in morania she actually visited me in morania while

[01:08:34] I was there from were you married at this point yes so was part of the reason that you left to also be with your wife yes and I was going to go join ground Branch I was going to go back and finally join where Mike span had served in the paramilitary side of of the CIA and now I knew the people you know I mean it's and you brought the skill and

[01:08:55] I had you know quote checked the box and I you know I was very I mean I cried when I was driving out of Fort Carson you kind of they they you take a razor blade to your your base pass it's on your car let you kind of slide through a certain uh entry point so that you don't have to stop and do the same security as if you're a civilian and you turn that in and then I've cried all the way through Kansas going back home to

[01:09:24] Florida to get on a plane to fly to Africa and I was like what is going on you know I just did not foresee that happening and it was this very kind of loss of something like it was a grieving process and you know our it's just at that point em and I had been married for almost 5 years and never lived together

[01:09:45] I mean that doesn't work and so the the thinking like she can't join the Special Forces but I can join the agency I mean having at least one boss of a company is is easier to coordinate and that was naive as well I mean that was it's really really hard to make that stuff work those tandem couples it's it's nice in theory but really someone has to be willing to kind of take a a back seat or else both suffer or both kind of are compromised in their careers so what happened when you got to Africa it was about what you would expect it was not perfect you know there was this kind of skip to the end and sat phone call calls on top of a you know a bunker with mortars coming in to you know my wife in

[01:10:30] Africa on you know meetings of whatever she's doing down there and working 100 hours a week by Wednesday and we had kind of just Grown Apart and it was I brought all of my baggage with me which was I'm I've given up everything to be to be there she you know was used to working and working and working I mean you know case officers are measured in scalps meaning how many people do you get do you recruit that are that are assets and you know the harder you work just like anything else the harder you work the more you'll achieve and and uh you know the more you fish the more fish you catch right and so you know she was um it's like hard to incorporate me into that I didn't have a job right I couldn't really work there the embassy had openings the the opening that they had was for a janitor and I like I've PL spent plenty of time cleaning the head you know I'm not above it right at that point in my life I did not have the I did not have the self-confidence to sort of enough to say okay I'm going to go from a Green

[01:11:36] Beret to being a a janitor at the US Embassy in in Aban I just I couldn't stomach that at that time so I mean I was back shoot I was there two months and then I flew back and was sleeping on a buddy's couch in New York and you know we're trying long-distance stuff kind of and we met in Morocco you know the thing things that you do to kind of Salvage something that's in the crash and burn phase of of its of its time and you know

[01:12:04] I mean there is a happy ending to this like we we did get divorced yes she came back to the States we did get divorced um years later we got remarried we have a great family and we're very happily married and I can imagine life without her and it it certainly that that's the greatest failure of my life and I don't like it what's the failure divorce from the the the girl that I loved my entire life and you know not making that work do you think it could have worked I mean in that first in that first version I mean hypotheticals are a very difficult thing to sort of answer I mean there there are scenarios where it could have worked I mean it was kind of hanging on by a thread and then it wasn't then it's hanging on by a thread and then it wasn't I mean the fact that it does work now to me is proof that yes it could have worked maybe it's possible that it works so well now because you both lost it it's very true that's that could also be true it's you know but I I will say this that I was used to doing pretty well at things and it it going through that I don't want to sit and rationalize something and say like oh it's all good that this failure happened right I I just want to say that the the Silver

[01:13:27] Lining to it was it made me a lot more compassionate it made me a lot more understanding that you don't know what people are going through so be kind it's it's it's a good thing to be kind to people you just don't know because at that time I mean have a whole new set of oh how are things going like oh yeah they're going great thanks let's move on talk about something else so then I just stopped seeing people and kind of became a Hermit and it was me and my dog in a country song and you know a bottle of whiskey and that was not a healthy phase in my life at all so cuz then I'm out of the army I don't have a job I don't have prospects for a job I you know don't have a marriage anymore how are you supporting yourself so I mean I had a little bit of money saved up and I was um I just didn't have a lot of expenses and and presumably you could have I'm sure you had a GI Bill you could have gone back to grad school I mean did any of these other ideas entice you that's what I did I went back to to business school in in DC and you know it's another case of I'm I'm grateful to the

[01:14:31] American taxpayer for that opportunity because as you kick this off with sort of you know the how do you process grief and how do you do like what is that like PTSD or PTSD light or however we want to kind of say it but the time that that bought me to kind of help figure my stuff out I I had a lot to offer I just couldn't do it at that time I have a I have a lot a lot to offer now and I'm really happy to offer that to you know our country the world the Next

[01:15:02] Generation whomever and I'm I'm very motivated to to do that and and that's in no small part because the American taxpayer was willing to finance my school for a couple years and kind of helped me transition a little bit and gain a little bit more confidence and time and all of that stuff and so I would just say you know going through it just it starts to stack Murphy is around and he's just striking left and right and what I learned in sear school which is survival school is everybody has a

[01:15:35] Breaking Point no matter how tough you are no matter how much of a hold out you know name and serial number is is not reality you you will crack everybody cracks it will happen and so that is a maxim for life and to think that you won't is just hubristic and when did you realize you were heading in that direction I I I just kind of knew I was just it was just really really bad I just lost the desire to do anything there wasn't there wasn't some moment I wasn't suicidal in in in that kind of sense I was just not well I just didn't I'm a I have a lot of energy in life I I'm active I like to do stuff and it took my dog which Emily gave to me right we were still friends throughout this oddly and the greatest gift I ever got until we had kids was I mean she we had one dog that had been with her in Africa and she looked at me and she was like you need him even more than I do you can have him I mean that's I mean you you could maybe even argue that we wouldn't have gotten back together without that happening and in some you know because then my life was this like just just not good right I mean I'm just living in a basement and um you know I got a dog and I don't have any Mission or purpose I have nothing to do so I you know I have a friend and I I asked a friend for help which was very humiliating I mean because I'm I'm the guy that doesn't ask for help ever right like that becomes your stick and that's what the Army especially Special Forces especially these kind of you know

[01:17:21] Special Operations units that's what it is I mean you yes there's a team component and you know in tactically if you need help but you don't need help solving your problems right like emotional problems you don't bring those to the team you know that's not a thing and so when you have to do that when you get out it's a very foreign territory and it's a very shameful thing and I think that that is a problem that we need to kind of take head on and say there's a lot of strength in in asking for help and you're going to need it so you need to be part of something bigger than yourself you need to take care of yourself you need to do the things that were healthy in the army that brought you this value you need to do those things still you need to you know phys physical training and take your pick there's a lot of great things that are a part of that it's a very social organization you get to know the people that are around you you develop deep and

[01:18:17] Lasting friendships through you know doing hard things that develops a lot of camaraderie and you need to go do those things and be active and it's just very easy to fall into this kind of state of all that's gone I'll never be as cool as I as I was and I don't know what I'm going to do with the rest of my life I don't have any exactly transferable skills and you know this is just not what I signed up for anymore and you can go down that spiral and everybody's got a Breaking Point and at no point during this so so where where you are right now the friend's couch Etc the divorce how what year is this how far after 2008 it's fast that's 2009 okay and and so my flash to bang on this was was pretty fast I mean I ended up I ended up starting school late 2009 which ended up being I mean it's like a full year of not good but but a year at that time felt like a long time and you know it was kind of like okay well I got to do school felt like an easy thing to all right I know this is progress to somebody I didn't really I'm like okay

[01:19:27] I'll go back to school I guess you know during that period of time are you picking up a ruck sack again so the funny thing is um the only thing that kind of got me off the couch was Java my dog I mean the funny thing is so I believe in community I I think it's you know the social health part of our Lives is is vital to to everything that matters the most and you know to me you plus a dog is the most foundational like it's the bare minimum for a community you plus one and that one can be a dog and for me it was and it's like he had to go out he needed exercise he needed someone to take care of him so serving someone else or in this case a dog was a huge unlock for me to kind of face the world again and that was that was really

[01:20:17] I it's very it's still very humbling to think about you know i' just been this special forces soldier that felt like I could do anything with my team to I couldn't do anything and it took a dog to kind of get me out of that state and then you know go Ruck was in the background of of all this Emily had actually had the idea for it in West

[01:20:38] Africa was like hey you should do the go Ruck thing because I'd buil her a go bag right full of supplies and stuff for her to put in her car and one to put at her house and it was just in case a go bag is a bag that when everything goes wrong it's the one thing you grab it's what we would put in the trunk of the Humvee because if our vehicle's disabled and we have to fight we need more bombs and ammo and water and radios and batteries and all that stuff it's just more supplies and that's a good thing when you're when you're fighting do you have a go bag at home right now yeah what's in it uh it's mostly medical stuff I'm going to have some some weapons as well um but that's that's mostly for I mean what scares me or what I'm cautious about are these times of whether there's hurricanes or power outages or these kinds of things where it becomes Lawless and you know everybody jumps on I 10 or

[01:21:28] I95 and then people are running out of gas and it's like how long does that last who knows and those are the kinds of things that kind of concern me and yeah I think a lot of people um don't remember what happened during Hurricane Katrina which people probably remember there was a real kind of delay on the part of the federal government in getting Aid in there and I don't remember the exact number of days but it was surprisingly short as to how long it went from no power no food no water to complete lawlessness and violence I mean very short like we're talking four or five days yeah um and you could make the argument that that's the most compelling reason for self arment um it's not the home invasion right it's not the like

[01:22:19] I'm in bed and someone breaks into the house it's the total societ breakdown that comes with a natural disaster or something like that yes I mean you're more likely to hurt someone that you love most people are more likely to hurt someone they love in this kind of there's a robber in my house situation just give them everything y I mean these are only things this doesn't matter like the idea that you're going to shoot someone cold in your hallway I mean you have to be extremely well Tred and you have to be able to Target discriminate and make sure it's not a bad guy and make I mean is this your first time in that kind of situation if so you're stressed like go go shoot with the heart rate of 160 sometimes see how you're doing it's hard you know in the middle of the night you've just been woken up like that's not those are not my deep dark fears what I the worst case scenario are the natural disasters and stuff like that so you know yes we have a go bag and we have a med pack in the back of our truck as well and stuff like that you know our office is a safe house we have a lot of stuff there too and a big safe and all that kind of stuff so you're making her a go bag and we were trying to figure out what I was going to do when I when I was there in in Africa and she's like oh you should do the G Ruck thing but where did that name come from go Rock versus so go I just kind of started calling it a go rock to her like a go bag a go rock that that was just what we we called it

[01:23:40] I mean we had a an sop a standard operating procedures for what would go in our GO bags I probably still have it somewhere but I haven't looked at it since I was in Iraq and but I tailored it to what we had there and I just used an a a surplus bag an extra bag that I brought with me it's like now you have this right just in case and it's better to have just in case and know where it is and so what she meant by that was take the special forces's way of life and then I built you know one for her boss there and another person at the embassy I was like okay well I can fill a year doing this that's fine upgrade people's home security and teach them a little bit about what to do just in case and it just the the language was a barrier cuz it's French the you know the import export business of using diplomatic pouches to send stuff to populate people's go I mean it just it's building a business from scratch in West

[01:24:31] Africa as a diplomatic spouse was I mean you your marriage better be on perfect ground and you better be in there for the Long Haul like the smash and grab year that I was going to have doing that like was would not have worked but the idea sort of endured and so I moved back and I was just kind of still searching for something to do I needed a hobby and this became a hobby and so I was like oh these bags are too military I don't want anything to do with the military so I need to make them less military but still awesome like the ones I had in the military and so I put an ad in

[01:25:05] Craigslist New York City for a backpack designer and you know got a bunch of people that wrote in and found this couple that was in Boseman Montana and that started a year and a halfish process of of working with them on a couple prototypes and then that led to incubating what were the specs that that you gave them so I started out with an old assault pack that I had an assault pack is a way stripped down version that you would take on an assault and and when you think about assaulting in places around the world I mean doorways are narrow you're you're in a stack to go into uh a room meaning there's four of you and you're as close as you can possibly get you can't have these huge rocks right because you're going in and clearing the room and so milliseconds are are life so you have to have really small silhouettes of of stuff and and more what you would associate with an urban style backpack not a big giant hiking pack or or a big giant Alice military pack or or whatever and so started with one of the assault packs and just said hey we'll strip away all this stuff that makes it look too military and let's do that and and also

[01:26:12] I'm guessing you immediately realized at that point that the weight had to come in the form of iron plates and cuz you wouldn't have the luxury of cuz I've seen like our mutual friend Joo when he rucks he's using kind of like a more traditional pack where it's got a pole on it that you're basically dropping heavy plates onto when you were in the military and you were doing your own training how were you loading up a pack putting waves in the back rocks rocks yeah I mean rocks and stuff and you would wrap them in something so it would kind of protect the the the interior lining so full I mean full story I did not start go rock with this idea that rocking was going to be the thing I just

[01:26:53] I I did not think about it like that at all it it was you know this whole series is something that Emily and I have tapped into it's not something that we've invented or really created but what were you thinking who were you thinking the customer was when you got a hold of these people in Montana so the summer of 2010 I drove around realized

[01:27:12] I'm in business school at the time and so there's this idea about you know total addressable Market size and and there's there's kind of well you can go to retail and you get press and you can do all this and direct to Consumer was still not quite what it is now I mean Amazon was not Amazon yet and then these things and I I thought that it was going to end up being and I was surrounded by some Artisans and stuff in New York and like I wanted this to be beautiful and simple as well right I mean Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication is Da

[01:27:45] Vinci and I've I I really love that quote when it comes to the design of of things it's also less to go wrong it's less to break and so the summer of 2010 in between years at business school I drove around to 48 states in my Ford Expedition with my dog and I approach small men's stores and other kind of retail places about having them carry this 48 states drove to All 48 in how many weeks the summer so twoth weeks two plus months yeah to probably 10 to 12 yeah that's incredible yeah well it was very painful is what it was cuz you have these these hopes and these grandiose dreams and I it's like I don't know how to do Facebook ads I don't know how to do Google ads I don't know anything about that but I I'm I can get in a car and drive around and go meet people face to face and kind of tell them the story and and we're going to get people to buy this stuff and I bought this sport rack to go on top of the the truck right because I I needed extra space with so many rocks that we were going to sell I didn't sell any rocks none went to every state I was finding a new store so the toward the end of my first year in business school started making a list of all the higher end Men's stores around the country and

[01:29:04] I did that only because of a price point thing I mean we're it was gr1 primarily we're making gr1 exclusively in America and it cost me more than I wanted to charge everybody else when I saw the price I was like oh my gosh what is this this is insane right but I just never thought that founded by Green Beret made in China just never had that good ring to me so I wanted to double down what was the price premium to Make It in

[01:29:28] America versus China forx oh my God yeah Forex and I mean I didn't cost it but that's what it would be now and so uh and we've never made in China and so but I I thought okay well this is an advantage that I do have and one thing that special forces teaches you is don't fight fair I mean definitely don't do that like I'm never launch a ground war in Asia right Princess Bride but but never fight fair I mean bring the air force with you to a gunfight always why would you not right use what is your unique uh strength that you have bring that to the fight and I thought that it was me driving around and going and meeting people at these shops and convincing them of the story and the quality and all this stuff and it just was an unmitigated disaster and it just didn't work so I went back to business school because of the price because people didn't understand who would in their right mind want to buy a backpack to put weight in it to walk around like which there was no rucking at the time this was just an an everyday carry kind of a cool bag with a lifetime guarantee oh it wasn't so I don't I don't have a gr1 so the gr1 was not one that was fit to have the slots of the weights in it we'll fix that with gr1 with with you gr1 has a back panel with a zipper on the back of it I'll show you in my car when when we live um mine's in there that's 10 years old and there's a zipper that's next to the back it's completely separate compartment and we had an assault pack that was kind of like that in war that was designed to put a hydration bladder there the problem with the hydration bladder there is that it's this big giant lump in the middle of it and it's very uncomfortable it's very terrible position for it so but when we deployed we would put our laptops in there and so I was just like okay well this is sure you can put a hydration bladder if you want but this is for a laptop as well and so it became this kind of travel bag well okay so then I have every dollar and then some of but what started out as mine and

[01:31:35] Emily's and then was just mine right and know my half poured into you know inventory and all this stuff of primarily gr1 which cost how much to make it was well it was $295 was what it cost like for the price on on the website okay and and you know at that time it was let's say roughly I mean I there's this idea of the golden ratio like you would charge forx and that's wholesale pricing and I think I kind of split the golden ratio saying okay well you know if it costs a hundred bucks and how do you calculate cost is a very tricky thing I'll just give say it costs a 100 bucks everything costs more than you think but let's say the direct cost were 100 bucks it's like okay well let's charge 300 and we'll be able to make some of that up direct but I can still have some margin at 14750 to sell to wholesalers and the wholesalers will be more about press and you know direct is where there's more margin and kind of you know that was kind of the thinking so when you're doing the 2010 tour of 48 you have what size inventory like you're ready to put these into stores if people are willing to take probably have um 2,000 rocks what is it that people are rejecting are they rejecting the idea of a backpack or the idea of rucking so rucking was not definitely not a thing it's just look but presumably you told them what it was well rucking was not the start point for this even though I had and it's going to come quickly though and I'll get to that um but it was not it it was just this hey this is bombproof gear and here's his great story and I think it would go well in your store and it might be that over time it ends up in nor stoms or it ends up in these higher end things because it's quality and craftsmanship and and all of that people just were I would meet with them and they would say uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yes and then it was just silence everyone loved the story but you have an unproven brand trying to charge $300 for what people perceive to be a backpack that's very simple and black it's it's it's the ATI kind of features selling because everybody you know oh look at all these features it has I think that's a terrible because it's more stuff to break it's like show me all the stuff that it doesn't have and tell me why it's going to last forever that's that's kind of my thinking that was very much against the grain of what people wanted to hear apparently we didn't have all these crazy colors we had black it was a model

[01:34:10] T4 to give you any color you want as long as it's black and that just was not a compelling argument and nobody's going to walk into a store and say I want to go rock in 2010 so then they have to buy the inventory and educate the people and education's really hard I mean really hard so people are just completely unwilling to take a chance and I understand that you know I understand it and so I have all this money poured into it and sold none and I'm back in business school I'm still being floated by the taxpayer in essence and you know and and so I'm like man I got to do something so I started a there was a partnership with an obstacle course racing company called tough mutter and this was kind of part of the long longer journey of finding partners and working by with and through them to kind of get the word out on what go Ruck is and so

[01:35:01] I'm started showing up to these tough mutters and this is when it was really hot that market was really hot I mean they were getting 10,000 people a weekend to show up and so I started the first ever tough mutter was I think may may of 2010 and it actually kicked off that summer and it's like oh this is going well and then nothing right and the next one wasn't until the fall out out west but I put together a team and we stuffed the ruck sack with bricks and we wrapped those bricks with duct tape and then we did tough mutter together and was like okay let's do this like a team and so I I brought a bunch of my old buddies that I'd served with and we did it at the first one and that felt that was fun that was how I got back into rocking and so we had we had that and it was like people then like wow I want to do that like oh yeah it's simple go back become a Green Beret I'll see in you know 10 years right and it just kind of one thing led to another though and it was well why not do something that's kind of like that that's based on special forces training that doesn't require this huge obstacle course and so created an event called The Go Ruck challenge which basically became fight club with backpacks so tell us about the go Ruck challenge so it was led it first it was led by me you know current and former

[01:36:14] Special Forces and it was hey meet me at 10:00 a.m. at the you know on on the beach in San Francisco details not forthcoming like bring you know and and you were doing this through Facebook yes Facebook and then tough munter had it on their site for a while we were partnered with them for about a year until maybe we became a little too successful or something I'm not sure but that kind of faded and but then the hardest thing you do is go from zero to one and so how do you you have this great thing and like how do you break through how do you do it and I had so many other partnership talks and you know us man ufacturing partners and all this stuff but this was the one that ended up working because it it it gave me kind of a platform to fall back on what I knew how I had been trained which is goes back to again how much so you would just travel around the country spontaneously popping up for a go fight club with backpacks and so you know the overhead was me flying out there and you know the business model was pretty simple the the cost of the challenge was half the price of the ruck sack and you got to keep the ruck sack so if gr1 was $295 it was the price to enter this event was 14750 and you got to keep the Rock and in the first ones I brought your bricks for you and I brought duct tape and you know it was it's like here you go now make them disappear they go in the rocks and and so it just did that city after how many people are showing up to these the first ones were 20 I mean the second one was six and I had to beg four of the people to show up so there was some element of

[01:37:48] I was taking pictures and people were really responding to this cuz it was it was a very challenging thing it was it it was not there was no published route there was no published course there was nothing and typically how long would a route be when you showed up so we we kind of developed it over time and I started to bring in some of the buddies that I'd served with and it started out as 5 hours that proved to not be long enough it the the tough which was our original event the tough challenge it it ended up settling in at about 10 to 12 hours and we have all different kind of lengths now there's a 24-hour version there's a 3 version and a six hour version and stuff like that but it's a how how is the weight determined so if so it's we've kept the same thing since the beginning which is if you're 150 lbs or over you have 30 lbs and if you're 150 or under you have 20 and in the early days it was bricks so six bricks or four bricks and you had to put those in in the rocks and it was me or the the the Special

[01:38:47] Forces uh Cadre going along with the group the whole time so there was it was not there was no separation it was a pure team event yeah so so how I mean that's okay that's not a lot of weight but it's enough weight that for somebody who is not necessarily in great shape this is a hard thing for them to show up and do so it's a lot more weight when you're doing Indian runs for you know what you call Indian runs I don't even know what you call them now sorry it's it's a you know 10 miles of that so you line everybody up in in rows of twos you you slap the rock of the person in the back and they Sprint to the front that's what you guys do for the whole challenge well that was part and then you're stopping along the way and doing you know physical training now it got more and it's it gets a lot heavier when you start ripping logs out of forests and carrying down Fifth Avenue which we did it you know you find it so so again my point then is even more dramatic which is these are not things that people show up to do when they just want to start to get in shape no and that was the exact idea this was meant to be just this is finishing school this yes this was meant to be an extreme right of passage that you would show up and you would you would got it you would do the same way that how is confidence how do you get confident you you earn it you do really hard things and you show yourself what you're capable of because you can't cheat yourself and so it started out as this thing and people were just blown away I mean sitting in the parking lots or wherever their cars were or wherever when we were done and people are just exhausted and so proud of themselves and they've made friends with these people that they had nothing in common with I mean we didn't care if you're you know black white young old male female gay straight civilian military didn't care

[01:40:35] Rock up and follow me so how many of these were you doing a month I mean it was every weekend and so I would I would go somewhere and I do a route Recon Friday and that was you know hours and hours like where am I going to find a log where's all this other stuff that I can do what's closed what's open would you already post the start time the week before or how okay so you give people like a week you show up Friday you spec the route then it's you know tape the bricks starts I got smart I started tell them to bring their own bricks which is way better and and so you know the say it started at 10:00 on Friday night was the first one 12 14 hours later it's noon and then you can start at 10 o'clock Saturday night as well and then you're going overnight and then you're done Sunday morning oh the challenge would be back to back oh yeah or two groups two different groups and so I'm sleeping under a bridge or you know on a parking lot somewhere for a few hours between the events and the greatest pep talk in the history of goor Ruck is the one that the Cadre gives himself between those two events CU it's it's brutal how many guys did you have doing this with you hundreds now I mean we've put on 10,000 of these since 2010 oh but I'm saying how many of you were like instructors that were're going to do both the Friday Saturday oh it was it was always just one you and one no it was just me oh until you're training somebody else and so then you have two of you but they have to sort of do and

[01:41:58] Shadow and be shadowed and then they can kind of do it and and part of the thing is you can't believe that how how much people are willing to do like you cuz when you're transitioning out of the military and these are all Special Operations guys you think that you have this kind of exclusive license to doing really hard things and what I found is that there's people all over this great country who really want to do hard things that want to sign up and say send me and they just didn't choose the military and that's okay I wouldn't have chosen the military either without 911 and so you've got these people and man the human Spirit just burns so brightly and it's such a gift to get to spend that time around these people it's just magic and you get to see it you get to feel this transformation that they have as individuals and and as a team and it works because it's it's it's in the human terrain with these Cadre who are well-versed in in the human terrain and pushing people and training people and and getting them to where they need to be as a team and so I mean I was doing this all over the place and then more of us were doing it and more and more and more it got to where we were running you know over a thousand 12200 a year of these and then the pandemic crushed a ton of it but um but in in and so where did rucking come in is kind of the important part because it was just a write of pass like you're never going to want to do this again right write a passage good thanks for coming out and but people started to say well how do I train for this I'm like no it doesn't matter just show up and you know take your take your licks right yeah but but give me a sense of it like what the people who were showing up most people are completing it oh yeah that was the point what was the feeder to this population were these Runners primarily like so yeah so this this goes back to what we've what we tapped into and you know the military was much more than front I mean realize you know when was the Afghanistan surge 2010 under under

[01:43:58] Obama yeah 10 or 11 yeah under Obama and so you still have this Resurgence of kind of special forces in the in the media and then I was leading a goor rock challenge in Boston when Bin Laden was was killed you know I mean there's just this very front page prevalence and people wanted to kind of be around that and sure but these people were what type of athletes coming in to be able to do something so extreme without training for it specifically I'm just thinking of the little stuff like if you to I don't think I could have on my first day doing a Ruck done this simply because like the

[01:44:34] I mean just the amount of discomfort due to how foreign it was so that that was the beauty of it though was that it was a team event so if I saw that you were struggling with your ruck and I i' I've done this this is one of the favorite learning points that I had I would get these people usually big strong dudes right who you know have egos because they're big and strong and they think that they should be the strongest and carry all the weight and they should never show weakness and so there's this one event that was running in Key West and this guy we were we were moving towards Index this is like 12 hours in and it has been brutal and it's hot and all this stuff and he's like I'm like

[01:45:13] Hey we're moving you you're unable to keep up with this team give your pack to that person he's like nope a real man doesn't give his pack up I'm like okay that's fine I go so there's there's two courses of action here right the first course of action is you're going to give up your pack you're going to you're going to submit to the speed that the team needs to go on to get to the index point now and we're going to we're going to finish happy we're going to have beer when we're done it's going to be a celebration of life the human spirit will burn brightly the second the second is you and your ego are going to quit this event right now and for exactly 60

[01:45:48] Minutes not a minute less not a minute more this this squad is going to do Squad push-up on this sidewalk until it runs like the River Nile with their sweat if you want to inflict that upon your team 12 hours in that's what your that's your choice is right now well he gave up his pack and we went there and someone carried it for him and we got to the end and then I get you know a note a after him like thanks so much because you know I needed that in my life because you know I have to learn you know imagine that he's one of us that doesn't have feelings that you know has a hard time asking for help that you know thought he was checking the Box on something that was another mud run but he he got a lot more out of it and that that is a great gift to be able to give that to somebody and to do it with a purity of Heart Like That was not about me that was about him and his team and that brought them together and then we were up all night partying and

[01:46:41] Key West and it was it was a ton of fun and and that was just an important lesson that you would learn so yes you could have done it but it may have been different and so the thing is is those who much is given much is EXP Ed those who can carry more weight they do carry more weight and you you how did you choose who was going to carry 60 lbs what do you mean which 60 well his 30 plus their 30 oh I don't care they have to ultimately here's the beauty of it is that they have to rotate it because for the team to optimize it's like the log was the great instructor too because they would get the log and they would immediately reject it because it's very heavy right and be like okay move that way and they're expecting this to go on for a very little bit of time and so they would do it and what you have to realize over time is that you can't keep getting the strong people exclusively to carry this because they have a Breaking Point too they will get exhausted you have to rotate people with frequent frequency so I'd rotate people or I would let them kind of fail for a little bit because that's pain is the greatest teacher of of them all and and so then they would start infighting and then I would not that's that was one of the things you I would never let that continue so I would stop and say like look the first hour you're going to fight it the second hour you're going to finally start to develop a system that works and the third hour you're going to be ready to carry this thing the rest of the event and they're like what they're 20 minutes in right now thinking that they're about to put this down I'm like no no no this is going to work I know because of how much is this log way typically I don't it's it it's whatever we could rip out I mean they're big I can show you some they're big and they're always gnarly you know one side's way more they're not telephone poles one side's way heavier with roots and nasty stuff right into your shoulder and and all that and so it was it was you know there was a lot of learning points and teaching points and and it was very extreme and it was it felt great I felt like I had Mission and purpose again and and that was fantastic like serving others and giving back with what I had learned about building teams and personal endurance and overcoming and and sharing that and teaching that to other people was very very rewarding and that that was the foundation so it wasn't until Co that basically the idea of using rucking as the training came about if I heard you correctly no so it started much earlier than that so people started asking how do I train for this and I was like doesn't matter just show up and take your licks well then they started to self-organize they started to form Ruck clubs around the country where they would just meet up and people would go for rucks together I'm like that's insane who does that you know I mean well I used to do it but you know that's insane for you to do it right and and so they started to do that and then they became kind of Social Clubs as well it finds out that you know people are looking for people are looking to be part of something bigger than themselves they want to be they want to find friends that want to go do stuff not everybody just wants to Doom scroll not everybody wants to going to bars is fine but going for a rock and then then going grabbing dinner with the people that you you know that you talk to about your life and what matters to you and you listen to what matters to them that stuff is hugely important and are the lessons that I learned in in SF and in

[01:49:55] Special Forces and that's just what we saw from the community and so it became this ground swell of okay so people wanted to self-organize I mean if those are easy te leaves to read you know this isn't me inventing something this is people saying we want to do this independent of this company called go rock and and that is such a amazing thing to have happen and so then we started building around that and saying okay yeah let's cuz at this point the company makes the company is an event running company that provides a pack yes we developed I mean it took two and a half years of figuring out how to develop the packs we we had you know internal sewers as well we have a repair department called scars which is where we offer our lifetime guarantee I mean we have the DNA of a manufacturing company as well we just also have the energy of our own events company it's kind of a weird thing that we still wrestle with a little bit I mean I I don't on some existential level because

[01:50:59] I can't imagine a world without both but it's it's unusual usually a manufacturer will sponsor a race or event series or whatever or you know but we developed this kind of both from the ground up out of necessity and so it sort of turned into okay well how do I train for this and then it was okay well you know what else can we do and so we started to make longer events and harder events and heavier events and lighter events and shorter events because you don't always want a 24-hour event like this or a 12-h hour event like this and so then it sort of started to be okay well let's live that life and then we have rucks and we developed the Rucker which was a a pack specific for for rucking which removed the laptop because you could put a a

[01:51:44] Ruck plate in the laptop compartment but what we found was if you do that at a go rock Challenge and you drop your rock and the iron meshes with that zipper right there it's going to break it there's nothing we can do no matter how well we build it you can't do it the zippers are the weak part in almost every piece of gear no matter the gear so we always use the best zippers but you can't you can't endure a crush load against a zipper like that and so we we remove that as a you know as a failure point for rocking and training and and the Rucker was born and so then we had cast iron plates and we've been messaging that for a while almost decade got it so let's talk about the training cuz this is where I think people you know who've listened to this podcast or you know heard me talk about it I'm become a real fan of this um and I've talked about how I I sometimes I almost don't even include it in my Tally of weekly exercise if I'm adding up the number of hours in a week that I'm exercising it's almost an afterthought to include The Ruck even though the Ruck is isn't isn't a great source of exercise but I often talk about how I sort of do it as

[01:52:52] I don't know I think it's kind of like mental health for me um because it's the only thing I do without any other input right so if I'm in the weight room or on the bike I'm either on the bike I'm listening to a podcast if I'm in the weight room I'm listening to music or something like that but this is something where I'm decidedly never carrying a phone um so I'm either just alone in silence or I go I'm doing it with with a friend or my wife or something like that um and i' I've really really fallen in love with it and

[01:53:21] I've yet to bring somebody on a Ruck with me who hasn't kind of if they haven't fallen in love with it they' certainly come to appreciate why this is this is a great thing to do and they've gone out and bought their ruck sack and things like that but certainly I get a lot of questions and so I I kind of want to go through some of these with you so

[01:53:40] I guess the first question is do you need a ruck sack a formal because I have a Rucker 4.0 y my wife has a Rucker 4.0 um we have a spare Rucker 4.0 in the garage that if you come come over we basically have three packs to rotate tons of weights to slot in all different permutations but somebody listening to this says man I don't want to spend 300 bucks on one of these things can I just use my backpack seems to me the answer is clearly yes you're just it's just a little more convenient to use uh to use one of the formal packs that you guys make is that fair the answer is clearly yes you are correct and I think you know look the last thing I ever wanted to be was the Willie lman of backpacks I refuse to do it I'm just not that's not why I was put on this Earth you know and and so I think that people should be more active myself included let's be more active and so try whatever you've got don't wait on this this purchasing funnel about well I I'm going to deliberate this because it's expensive and I'm going to wait and wait and wait and maybe someday I'll buy it and do this don't do that go find a backpack you have one at your house put 10 or 20 pounds in your back or whatever you want put a bag of rice I don't care put some water go walk around your neighborhood cinch it down make it kind of as tight as you can and I'm reluctant to tell people to put too much more weight in it because that's where it gets more uncomfortable and once you add too much more weight to something that's not built for rocking it just it's uncomfortable becomes a bad ride and so then you're like well I hate rocking right and you can find a bunch of people that hate rucking right it's usually people that served in the military that you know carried a ton of weight that got no sleep that had to take fighting positions when they got there and you know it's like wrapped up into this whole kind of universe I'm talking about 20 lbs 30 lbs for pick your mental health physical health social health if you're talking to your your wife or a friend or or a loved one start there don't give yourself any excuses that you have to go buy something because because you have what you need to go get started right now my kids use their backpacks and school books great they'll come with me with they'll and it's just so cute to watch them load up as many books as they can put into their backpacks that's great um okay let's talk a little bit about some of the parameters around weight yep so what guidance do you offer to let's start with a person who is not that fit but they're listening to this and they're like you know what guys I'm going to give this a try but they're not an athlete y they're not they're not capable of you know Herculean tasks at the moment they walk around they could put in 10,000 steps of you know but but that's about the extent to their Fitness how do you start this person out I mean 20 lbs try it for a couple miles okay I mean it's one of those things where you the this is completely different from running in from the standpoint of if you are walking as part of your daily life that is the same movement you're you're not doing this thing where there's all this different gate and you know new things with your your Achilles or with your the way that you land or foot strike or heel strike it's so much simpler than that it's just carrying a little bit of weight and the thing is is that your shoulders will get a little bit sore the first time that's good that's that's how they get stronger and so it this should not be some crazy thing where you start out with you know a third of your body weight or more and you want to really see what this is all about I mean start out Simply go for a walk and see I mean it's so great to be outside it is so great to to kind of the sunshine and the wind and and all of that that that's those are additional benefits if you want to start on your treadmill start on your treadmill that's fine you'll get the physiological side of it at that point but this is so simple I mean you you get a little sore if you want to go a couple miles great go a couple miles come back and try it again tomorrow and what kind of guidance would you provide as you escalate the weight and or if you're a person who's already kind of fit and wants to add this in so there are some some variables here there's the speed that you that you Ruck and there's the weight that you carry and you know and then there's the distance and the elevation I suppose and the elevation and all of this and so you know I mean this is you have to kind of listen to yourself or what are your goals in this

[01:58:15] I mean if you're training up for hike this is a great thing to do if you're training up for hunt this is a great thing to do to just Baseline right Baseline your your Fitness like that and I mean I just I don't think there's any reason to go out of the shoot too hard I didn't I mean I started out with minimal packs and basic training and that's kind of was the I mean 45 dry was by the time

[01:58:37] I'd done a little bit of this and you know it's 45 on 200 lb is still less than 25% I mean we're not talking and I was in really good shape otherwise so there's no shame nobody cares I me it's like if you come to my driveway when you work out or we go for Ruck I don't care how much weight you carry if you ask me how much should I carry it's like okay great like let's talk about your specific situation if you're used to doing you know if you're used to carrying weights or if you're used to squatting a lot or if you're doing the things that that are going to kind of prepare you to carry weight then great try 30 or maybe 45 if you're really fit if there's no shame and start out with 30 go for a couple miles what's the worst thing that happens you're like oh

[01:59:20] I want to make that a little harder there's that there's no problem there it's just getting out is is is kind of part of the joy without such the the pressure about well what's your bench press and your deadlift how much exactly can you do just simplify it just simplify it all what about the um differences between a ruck sack and a weight vest so I used to use a weight vest to train for hunting trips so I would put you know again put put it over my shoulders and go up and down Hills with that um but I know you've thought a lot about the ergonomics of this so so what are what are some of those differences yeah and it was fun to see you Dr humman going back and forth on this a little bit I think he had spent more time with a weight vest and and um that actually inspired Michael Eastern I to go even deeper into weight vest versus versus rucksack so an important thing is that weight vests are vital to the success of soldiers and police officers and those who are in those kinds of dangerous jobs and so there's a component of train like you fight if you need to be comfortable in a weight vest if if your job requires you to wear a weight vest to do things like stop bullets that's really important what I will also tell you is that people that wear weight vests have typically terrible posture because of it it is just kind of a compression downward that doesn't really open up there there there's less in order to breathe better you you have to kind of create this this cavity of air in in the front of your your belly which the more fatigued you get the the more that you do that when you're wearing a weight vest and so you're kind of hunching over a little bit it's it's not good for what

[02:01:06] I would personally say you want your spine to look like this if you can you know Dr saret would say if you can you have to own your breath to own a pose well rucking is no different if you can own your breath it means your shoulders are back and you can take a really deep breath while you're rocking and and so the the the weight vest is also you know it looks a little different than a ruck sack you can't quite blend in quite as well this is getting into the Aesthetics less than the the physiological response but the ruck sack is more comfortable and and I say that from not the standpoint of I'm trying to to live more easily I say that from the standpoint of

[02:01:46] I can put my shoulders back it's posture corrective for me so it rolls my shoulders back when I cinch it down tight which for me works well to maintain solid posture that is the opposite of say uh lower back or net curvature forward which is more likely when you don't have that on your on your back now one of the things that I remember from when we went out for a

[02:02:11] Ruck uh last year was that you didn't use the chest strap which comes on the ruck sack and you weren't using the hip belt which is an attachment you can buy for 20 bucks or something um I've played with both of these I also do prefer not to use the chest strap I find it actually makes it harder to breathe it does and so I actually prefer to have It

[02:02:35] Wide Open which means there's a little more pressure on my shoulders but that's a worthwhile trade-off because I have unrestricted breathing but I do quite fancy the belt um and I just recall you weren't using either is that just a throwback to your days of the use case you referred to earlier which is look in the military I wasn't going to wear a belt cuz it would get in the way of me grabbing a magazine so I did grow up like that with my rucking where we just didn't use hip belts and you know I mean for a hip belt to there's a butt coming and and the butt is for you know the fit for me when you start to transfer the load around your your hips it it kind of reduces some of the stability that I have with the weight and the way that my shoulders go back and the way that I breathe now when you get into very heavy loads hunting style elk loads or you know heavy military ammunition loads or something I mean I found that there's a lot of value in just alternating how you're doing it because you want the blood flow to go certain ways and there's even when it's a shoulder only carry there's little tips and tricks to kind of just flex your shoulders around just a little bit so that you can get the blood flow to go there even a little bit more um but I just it's just not a comfortable thing for me and so I don't

[02:03:59] I don't use it and what you find is that for the load to actually transfer can be at odds with how much you cinch the ruck sack down yeah you can't cinch it down much on the shoulders if you want it to be cinched tight on the hips is what I found at least right so then for that to be a both thing that's why these hunting packs are enormous and they're really long and they're built to carry really heavy loads that you can do either with for me it's just not quite as practical and I'm I prefer the feeling of the shoulder carry I mean they taught us high and high and tight on your back is where you want the weight and stable always so whether you use our stuff or whatever you're using you want it to be stable the more that stuff is Shifting around inside of your ruck that's where you're going to you you have the opportunity to okay you step on uneven ground and then you you you go a little bit too far this way and then you tweak your your back in the wrong spot or your your whatever it might be you don't want that when stable is is exactly how you want it and so I really like that feeling of stability high and tight on my on my back just right up on my shoulders so would you just sort of suggest that folks muck around with this and figure out what feels best to them yes absolutely and and you know I think that the idea of the resistant side of rocking starting with your shoulders and going all the way down to your feet I mean to me it's it's you're you're you're starting that resistance with your upper body and when you transfer all the load to your hips you're starting it much lower on the body and so it's It's Different Strokes for different folks Just My grandmother used to say and people like it certain ways depending upon how the the fit is and you know but there's no especially at lighter loads you know people who are say used to carrying book bags or they're used to doing these types of things I mean you're used to carrying that on your shoulders you've already prepared yourself this is not some you're you're you're walking in your part of your daily life you're training for this you're you're ready and so there's this this idea of kind of just ride that through and as you get more weight say you start to get up to 45 or you start to maybe max out a third of your body weight then you can kind of you'll it puts more pressure on your system your

[02:06:28] Technique and you might want to transfer the load or you might want to do it a little bit differently I mean if I do really long really heavy rucks I will occasionally use the sternum strap in the front because it's going to take some of the load off my shoulders which allows the blood flow to come back to my shoulders and my hands and that then lets you know just gives me that little break and then I I I just kind of continue the the mission and so for you nowadays how many events do you lead in a month typically or in a year I don't lead a lot of events I do a lot more of

[02:07:01] I mean I have people over to my driveway every weekend when I'm home and you know people come over from the community or we run events you know out like what it means to be a g rock event is certainly broadened we've decentralized a lot of the hey work out like this bring the people together in the Parks bring the people together in your driveways this doesn't need to be so complicated and and go for rucks and wherever you want to go and and so I I do that a lot but I you know I don't know I probably only lead 20 events a year now you led one in

[02:07:34] Normandy didn't you I did we're going back next year in in May and June for the 80th so tell me about the one you did was it for the 70th we went for the 75th so we have different kinds of events the the one that my wife and I did together it is it was a 75 km Ruck only which which was about 50 Mi and it started at

[02:07:56] Utah and it ended at Omaha and when you and it passed through you know all the things that you saw in band Brothers the cities point to Hawk did you do it on the beach or did you do it above the cliffs you can't do it on the beach so you've got to go around to the cities and and and then around the kind of

[02:08:14] Inlet and then you come up and almost at dawn we were at the German Cemetery which is black tombstones and you you walk around and you know it's it's obviously it's it's one thing to know that we were on the the side of Right In Justice and God bless those those men and everybody in our country that that had any part in that war because we did right you walk around that German cemetery and you see 16 17 18 year old kids that are buried there I mean it's it's just another perspective that you get from seeing that especially that far in and then you go to point to Hawk and you see where the Rangers scaled that wall wall against those machine gun nests right there I mean it's just the amount of sacrifice that's gone into this and then and then from there we handrail the final piece from point to

[02:09:03] Hawk to Omaha which is my favorite rock on planet Earth and it took us to to Omaha and then the American cemetery is there and I I think that's the most American place on planet Earth it's amazing and I get goosebumps thinking about it right this second and it's it's something that to see what that what they had to endure for that to happen it is mind-blowing and you know think not only of of their passing think of the glory of their spirit is in the it's at the American cemetery and it's it's hard when you're there because it's a very solemn place but man there was a there was a lot of Glory of a lot of spirit there so you'll be doing an 80th anniversary there we are we're we're running a lot of different events so there's an 80 km roughly a 50 mile again probably the sameish route and then there's you know a 262 put on some 12

[02:09:53] MERS do some commemorative hero workouts we'll do some of our challenges of different lengths we'll put on some scavenger hunts we'll put on some stuff for the kids we'll do you know so we have two chatea right on the beach pretty close to point to Hawk and we'll be running stuff out of there we have this really crazy long endurance event as well called gor Ruck selection which is patterned after Special Forces assessment selection it's the toughest endurance event in the world it's Pass rates sub 1% it's the only event where we try to get people to quit and and so we're doing what is that event it's 48 hours it's it's uh late May next year we're doing it for the first time overseas it's going to be at Normandy and it is uh it's it's the Dark Side of goor Ruck but you know people ultimately wanted the the the biggest test they could possibly find and so you know there's usually either this past year one one person finished the year before zero people finished the year before that one person finished and so it's it's kind of a people come and it's it's aggressive so that's the first event that we're kicking off with and then we get into the the more fun stuff that's that's there adk doesn't sound like it's just pure fun stuff I mean that sounds pretty challenging it's actually that event is my favorite event to do as a participant you have to put the miles in you know to kind of train up I did it the first the first time we ever did it we did it in DC and it was a torrential downpour and man I I went in with a little bit too much pride like oh I've been rucking for a long time and you have 20 lbs so end up having 25 plus your St you know including your stuff and and I was like oh no I I'm good you know and man I had to go to the well to pass that thing and it was under 20 hours I mean you're rucking you're not shuffling you're not Ruck running or anything like that if if you want to hit that kind of time hack but the the beauty is just it it does kind of wear you down it's it's longer than you want it's harder than you think the 40 mile

[02:11:45] Mark is about where you're like I'm ready to be done but it's great to get the time with the person person that you have there and you get this this you know what you'll find over the course of these kind of longer events is that it's there's highs and lows for all of you but they don't come always at the same time so you're there and you need someone's help and they help you they just lift your spirit up a little bit and and then you in turn do that for them I mean it's like hey I got some

[02:12:16] M&M's you want some I mean that can change your whole life you know just amazing and so it's it's little stuff like that and it really brings you closer to to the people that you're there with and that was that was great great experience I don't know that we'll do it this year because it's it's a couple you won't do the 80 personally I

[02:12:35] I I think we'll probably choose mem and I will probably choose a shorter distance only because we have a lot of events to also put on and that that takes you out of commission for a couple days and you do this right on June 6th no we do it in we're there for basically two weeks prior okay and so it's

[02:12:51] Normandy is a great place it's also very big yeah and it's also going to be very busy Le to theary I mean June 6th is where all the heads of state will be at you know the American cemetery which just means there's more traffic there's more checkpoints it's harder to operate so we the way that we plan it is we let people show up early we run our events like that during the week and the weekend prior and then we kind of if people want to stay they can stay and if they want to go home by then they can they can go home it's kind of up to them but it's it's a great great opportunity to bring people together in a place that

[02:13:23] I I think like I think people should go to Washington DC as well and go see our nation's capital and see the Lincoln and the Washington and you can't get as close to the capital as you used to but go see the capital and the Jefferson and go see these things that the MLK and the FDR and go go see them and and read what's up there read the gburg address at the the Lincoln you know it's it's it's amazing and as well I think more people the more people that go to

[02:13:50] Normandy the the better it's just an amazing Place let's talk about Footwear for a second because um this is something where um you guys have started to take this you know as kind of something you own now um why why why do you guys make Footwear and um why do you think that the Footwear you make is is is really good by full disclosure I I wear your Footwear right so I'm wearing um uh what's the one I wear the ballistic trainers ballistic trainers is what I wear I love both the high top and the low top um about an 8 mm drop that's right supportive um I have found at least I found prior to wearing these that I was destroying shoes like I there are certain minim Minimalist Shoes that I like um but but I just felt I needed more support but but say a little bit about why you guys have taken the innovation in Footwear really seriously

[02:14:47] I mean it's you're almost a footwear company at this point now aren you yeah so the an important thing happened was that I met a guy named Paul Lichfield Footwear is is a lot of dark arts I mean you cannot the process of building Footwear there's a lot of chemistry involved and there's a lot of dark arts you can't do this like you can put you can sew a ruck sack you have some sewing machines and a cutting table you can sew a ruck sack together you can iterate a million times you can do this Footwear is just way more complicated with lasts and molds and foam chemistry and all this stuff and so you know I I met Paul with Emily a long time ago when he was still at Reebok and and he was running the advanced concepts group at at Reebok at the time and he had invented something called the Reebok Pump and and been a shoe dog you know one of the the foremost shoe dogs of of his generation and still and has sold over a billion pairs of shoes so you know that's a lot and there's a lot of expertise that comes with that to help navigate the dark arts because getting into your own kind of hey I'm going to start a shoe company because it sounds sexy is a great way to build terrible product because you have to liaz with the factory and get the molds built and and there's just a lot that goes with it so important was that we had someone who's a real expert I'm

[02:16:06] I'm a really aggressive product tester I Hate Everything till I kind of accept it if you will right and then great art is never finished it's only abandoned right and so there's always this kind of Relentless pursuit of Excellence but you have to have somebody who is just dogmatic in their beliefs that knows what they're doing that is an subject matter expert that has dedicated their life to this as as a profession and so without that was unwilling to get into the Footwear business the reason why

[02:16:34] Footwear is so important is that if you lined up a 100 people who have spent who are Masters Of The Ruck most of them at this point would would come from the Special Forces community and you said what's more important the ruck sack or the boot I don't 90 plus perc if not all 100 will say the Footwear and the reason why is because when that goes wrong it is just excruciating I mean Napoleon lost because of you know foot problems right I mean you can lose Wars you can lose everything based upon the the feet of your your soldiers and if they're not doing well it's really hard to do anything you just you're living on your feet all of the time and so it turned into this of yeah we had some Footwear in the military and we were always just modifying it to make it more like a sneaker but still supportive and you know there's all this stuff in this civilian sector about okay well minimalist and and all like you cannot go through the training that we went through in minimalist stuff your feet just need more support under that kind of load and and so we just kind of took the most beloved shw in the military repertoire which is the jungle Boot and we started there and we made that hours that that was the basically the boot that I wore in the Special Forces qualification course we stripped away the weight we you know we added tread that was lightweight that would still work with that that that most importantly will provide the support for your feet for all of the miles and it let you scale up the weight and the distance and you know because this is go rock we we want stuff to last forever I it doesn't but we want it to last forever and that's how we build it and and so that's just in our ethos and we're uncompromising about that so we were unwilling to do it unless we could build best-in-class worldclass product and we wanted to solve a real world problem not just a stylistic problem like oh this is going to be a cooler looking shoe that's a terrible problem to solve right the problem is you live on your feet and you're carrying weight of of any amount volume distance whatever it might be and we need to build something something around that and and that's that's a harrowing task because there's all now there's all different facets of how people carry and is it Offroad or is it you know on

[02:19:01] Trails how did people grow up you know I mean you look at how Born to Run kind of ignited that the Vim five finger which I call the Five Finger Death Punch when I would see it at events because people would just destroy themselves when they would wear this because they're so unsupported with so much weight for so long and you know people just don't know and they they they are looking for answers it's like what's going to work and if you're carrying weight or you're living on your feet you need supportive

[02:19:30] Footwear that's the deal yeah I love my minimalist Footwear but um I have learned I would say the hard way that um that rcking is not the time for it um my daily drives about 50 to 60 lbs and um the amount of foot problems I was I was having especially someone like I have very hypermobile feet so that makes me it seems even more susceptible to injury on uneven terrain with that much weight so um yeah so so maybe talk about the ballistic trainer versus the boot like you have a couple of different models how would you help somebody navigate those yeah we do I mean you know people do make decisions based off of how things look or how simple they are I mean we we come from a special forces background so we have stuff that's the boots are inspired by you know our jungle boots that we used to wear we just sort of strip them down you know and then the ballistic trainers started out as kind of a you know the best garage gym shoe on the planet and you know there was a little bit of hey how do we solve a problem that you can lift push pull drag sandbags or barbells or stuff as well but this is go Ruck so you need to be able to Ruck in them as well and you know at that time CrossFit it started out with a really minimalist drop for lots of different reasons but you you know I I don't think many of them very good over the Long Haul and we came in with an 8mm drop sh we said this also happens to be the best shoe for

[02:20:59] CrossFit but for for us it's also the best garage gym shoe and you can Ruck with it and live you can live in your feet with this ballistic trainer on as well and you know the the drop does matter so basically the the the ruing offset or the the heel lift as it might be and you know that's how you prevent things like shinsplints and and it keeps the Achilles a little bit safer you take a little bit of that strain off it the thing is is that you can argue philosophical positions forever right like you you should have a stronger Achilles and a stronger shin and a stronger foot and the word should is not really very useful the thing is is that people grew up how they grew up and there's a lot of asphalt and people weigh what they weigh and the more that you weigh the more strain your putting on your feet with every step and how do you walk and you know all of those things and so yes I think it's important to to actually strengthen your feet as well you know walk around your house Barefoot do whatever right but when it comes time to perform and you have a lot of weight you need to you need to support your your foot has three arches you need to support them all over a lot of dynamic movements you know pavement uneven terrain whatever it might be and there's a lot that goes into doing that successfully and so those the the stuff that we build is designed for that yeah

[02:22:27] I I do most of my activity Barefoot but I don't do you know I I I take care of my feet when I rock and when I do kind of my heavier carries and stuff like that so that that makes a ton of sense what are the most common injuries you see in people who Ruck and what are the steps that you recommend people take to mitigate those I mean you see a lot of

[02:22:51] I mean if you do it at lighter loads you don't see a lot of injury and you've seen this proven in special forces training mean the number one cause of injury is running and there's no close second you know lifting is number two and marching is way down the list right I mean if you the injuries that you'll see are usually from people that start

[02:23:11] Too Fast Too Soon with too much weight so slow down reduce the weight listen to your body if you start to get shin splints they're not going to get better from doing more of the same thing you know so yes you can ice and rest and do all this stuff you can also just reduce the weight and and the distance and the in the time and and put the variables that are like that I mean I you know look my standard I have a 45b plate I carry it often right it's it's by the door at at my office it's by the door at my house if I walk the dog I Ruck the dog if I'm if I can take a phone call outside I put the 45lb plate on and I go walk around I go walk around the neighborhood and I take a a phone call lets me kind of you know squeeze a few more hours out of the day that I don't have to dedicate to Just Fitness you know um some days I don't feel like doing that much or some days I want a little bit more and you just have to listen to yourself I mean look if you start running with weight you're putting a lot more strain on yourself so make sure that you're physically able to do that you know there's a middle ground that's a shuffle that is really really interesting to me and when I want to do a little bit more and I don't want my knees to feel like I just went on a long run and I just try to keep my feet as low to the ground as possible and I just move them as fast as possible and I I just kind of Shuffle and my heart rate goes up a lot more and you can really accelerate that pretty quickly now the faster you go and the the more that you

[02:24:38] Gallop the greater risk that you're going to have of injury so most people walking with 20 or 30 pounds you know you're you're not really going to see a lot other than shin splints if you're unready if your Achilles starts to hurt then dial it back a little bit get a little more ready or or look at supportive Footwear if your shoulders are sore right then you know decrease the weight or if it's if it's a good sore then that's them getting stronger yeah I always find that in the winter I just rock less cuz I it's for whatever reason I I enjoy the heat more so I have less motivation to go out in the winter and I always find that when I really ramp up volume in the summer that first week I feel it in the shoulders again but as you said it's easy to distinguish a good from a bad s this is a this is foreign to me S versus this is a this is causing an injury sore so if you get too much weight what you'll start to do is you'll start to lean your body forward your upper body you'll pivot at your hips a little bit too much while you're doing it and you're doing that because you're trying to put the weight over your stronger muscles and you're you're kind of cheating and it's kind of know how Arnold talks about I don't care how many push-ups you can do I want to see you do 10 perfect push-ups like Master the movement first and then get into the miles and and and and all that like do the movement correctly and remove the ego a little bit about how much weight that that you have especially if you're starting until you get comfortable or know what you're capable of and and keep good form while you're doing it and you're going to reduce the risk of really anything so that's kind of really a Critic thing because if you start hunching over and stuff you're kind of not you shouldn't be doing that yeah for someone starting out what would be the frequency you would recommend they do it if they're starting out at a modest weight would you put any limit on it I mean it's so much as subjective around well what's their step count and you know do they work out otherwise I mean try couple miles couple times a week I don't know I really don't I probably need to just have a more strict hey this is exact what you should do but if you tried 2 lbs with 30 two miles with 30 lbs and you're like okay that was cool I mean that's 30 minutes of your life I mean you can do that a lot you can yeah

[02:27:02] I think at light enough load it the the you know once you're in a cardio zone two or below there's really no limit to what I think you can do in terms of frequency I mean yeah so you're you're the expert what do you I mean that's you that's my feeling as well I I I never so so people always ask me hey Peter when you're doing your ruck is that a zone two workout for you and the answer is no it's a Zone one zone four but it's it's never just I'm never just a steady state heart rate of 130 to 140 at least I just haven't the only way I can do that is

[02:27:37] The Ruck Shuffle so remember how we do our rck and we end up at that track at the school there I can get into zone two if I do a shuffle I can titrate the speed of the shuffle to zone two but walking here and there my heart rate's either pretty low or pretty high when we're going up those really steep hills um which is part of the reason why I don't really Bank it as exercise in my mind um what I really enjoy are those pushes up the hills cuz then you're kind of getting that V2 Max Y and I really like the walking down the steep hills cuz you're really working on how to your breaks work and breaks are the things that fail when we age and so walking down a very steep hill and we have a lot of them here with weight on your back is a really good way to train Ecentric strength strength while the muscle is lengthening so would you recommend going very slowly while you do that or is there any any value in increased speed while going downhill because I don't think there's a value in increased speed going down I mean the only athletes I know that do that are sprinters do that you sprinters will do downhill running to teach the muscle like how fast the legs can go

[02:28:50] I don't I don't I think the risk reward for a normal person like me is not there to justify it so I'm not going incredibly slow I'm just going at what I think is the safest Pace possible when I go down whereas going up I'm really limited by my cardio system I'm basically going up as fast as my lungs will carry me because I the way down hurts my knees more the the faster I try to go my wife was a really really good runner and when we would ever go for run she's like you got to make up make up speed on the downhills I'm like I'm just not willing to do that on a training run if you will and it's the same thing for me with rucking I I I know what you're saying about the brakes it's it's you can transition it into kind of a like it's a leg workout on the way down unless you're sacrificing one of my favorite workouts and I don't do this often because this truly is a workout is is a heavy 80 to 100 pack and where we live there are four short but very steep hills and it's an up and and down of all four and that's it that's the so walking there and then an up down up yeah there's four and that is brutal Michael

[02:30:00] Easter and I have gotten into this 100 pound onemer thing and it is a it is a thing I mean to actually Baseline your time against that is the I'm I Ruck a lot and it's what's a what's a benchmark time that one should think of for a 100 and you're doing this as a shuffle oh yeah yeah it's a shuffle and you kind of what gets exhausting is when you you change too much like a walk to a shuffle like you need to kind of pick a Cadence that you can kind of go what give me an example of like how long would it take to shuffle a mile with 100 lbs on your back 9:30 was I was about to say 10 minutes we did pry I've seen a a really really really competitive Runner did it in 630 I mean that's inanity though right so it's still a cardio it's still a V2 max type of game I wonder at what point it it starts being more about a strength carry like at a really extreme weight uh at a heavy enough weight when you simply can't even

[02:31:01] Shuffle it it probably shifts more to just pure strength yeah but the the 100 pound I mean so you know 10 minutes and I'm it's it's a smoker it's a lot of fun so you know because rucking can turn into this this for me it's it's more like a baseline And I think about how do I sleep well at night I really really priori I ize that and you know getting step counts and some percentage of those with weight on my back is a very useful tool for me to sleep well which kind of then tomorrow comes and it's a better day right and and and so yet I think it's also fun to have these kind of challenges with a rock on my back cuz I also hearkened back to those days when I did that and it was really really fun and they were foot races and and all of that and that was a lot of fun so so what do we know about the plates because you guys obviously sell these amazing plates now that just make this so easy and plug-and playay they slot right into the the pack um what's the over under on

[02:32:00] TSA Pre here in the US allowing those through security because for many of us it would be great to be able to take plates with us when we travel to both have them at our destination but also just frankly utilize the time we're in the airport amen so I personally have done this 50 times I'd say and never been confiscated now this there's a raging debate inside of the kind of go

[02:32:26] Ruck community and a lot of people do get confiscated like more enough to where it comes up I mean I found that the best way to do it if you want to do it first off you have to be willing to check it if or sacrifice it if it doesn't go through but you separate it out you put it in its own thing and you can put a little even a descriptor on what it is or you have to be ready to tell them what it is and I think the more people that kind of know what rocking is the more likely it'll be that it's okay have you got a sense of whether the people who are getting confiscated are lighter plates versus heavier plates is there any pattern to what's getting confiscated because there a light enough plate maybe viewed as a potential weapon where a 50 lb plate nobody thinks you're going to be wielding that I think the opposite I think the heavier ones are more likely to get confiscated um I mean the other things so what do you when you've gone 50 for 50 carrying what size plate 20 or 30 it's always 20 or 30 so the other thing that I do though is I just have a a stuff sack and instead of using a plate it's it's more like a you get somewhere you can find some rocks outside a hotel and that finding 20 lounds of that is not hard I mean you can wrap a dumbbell from a hotel gym which I've also done I mean it's not as nice of a ride that's that's for sure but there's this ability to kind of multi-use the things that you carry or you travel with so hey your dirty clothes bag you can also use to put rocks in it I mean the the reason I really want to bring a plate is I'm thinking about like you know you go on vacation to Europe or something where you're not going to have the luxury of going to the gym every day but you're going to walk 10 miles a day wouldn't it be great to just have that 20 30 lbs on your back for 10 miles a day walking around and have that not be you know a dumbbell jabbing into your yeah I mean a more like a sandbag that that goes in that takes up a little bit more volume is like I've had good success with that

[02:34:22] I've had really good success with that even in the states with my garage and all of the toys that I have you know you Baseline with the weight and then you say okay well I want to add 20 pounds today I just throw a sandbag in like it's it's not always just stacking it's easy in it's easy out you know it's you can use it for other stuff too and it's it it works great you mentioned earlier a treadmill so um are there yeah what are the advantages or disadvantages to rucking on a treadmill I mean the disadvantages are very clear to me that you're not outside you know there's these fractals that

[02:34:58] Easter talks about which you also have talked about and there's you know you're missing out on Sunshine and wind and light and all of that kind of stuff I mean I've I'll give you some advantages to treadmills are simply safety and practicality and all of that that kind of stuff I mean I have a couple friends that are surgeons at Mayo and they get home at 3:00 in the morning and you know they want to get their workout in then and they're on their treadmill I'm like okay you do you guys do you I'm not here

[02:35:26] I think you should do what works for you at at the end of it I just Americans are spending something like what 93% of our time indoors now I mean it's it's a ton and so giving yourself a little bit more freedom to go outside it's it's going to look more I'm more comfortable walking around with a ruck sack on than I am with like a weight vest or a big giant hiking hunting pack or whatever is I mean you you kind of look like you can blend in you can go Ruck and get the groceries you can bake it in and you know so treadmills are fine it's better than it's it's the physical side but you know staring at some screen the whole time and and doing that there there are other downsides to that if somebody wants to do one of these really extreme events like the 80 kilm Normandy challenge how how do they train for it what recommend they show up I mean cuz we really know how to train for a marathon I mean that's a that's a well oiled machine what is the build pattern of of volume um to get ready for something like that I mean we do have sort of mileage training plans against that so the I mean you need to at least do a a marathon like you need to at least do half 40K yeah you need to at least do that and the the way that I have always cheated the distance is by weight and trying to maintain the same speed so you have this variable of because you're trying to do the 80k in what time under 20 hours okay so you need to be able to rck a marathon in 10 hours and the event is done with how much weight you'll have 25 it's not not much so you would say how much would you increase that to maintain the pace oh I would I mean I would you'd go 50 pound 50 or 60 almost almost all the time I would almost never train with 25 almost never you know or the the beauty that you can do also it's it's kind of what I was talking about with with the sock system to toughen up your feet with rucking you can go a certain distance and you can drop weight if you want and you can go faster if you're dropping weight to kind of you know start this descent into well I can't handle it anymore I'm just going to walk that's fine too do that but you can drop and then you can pick up your speed and so you're you're hitting the systems a little bit differently in the same type of of movement or process you just kind of have to experiment with it it's unlike running you have this other variable that you can control and it's it's kind of fun to control it because it's a different workout like you're saying 100 pounds is a lot different than 60 totally different yeah a lot different and you reach this point and everybody's got this point where an incremental amount of weight weight added feels like an exponential amount of weight added and that can change over time relative to how much you rock or what you're comfortable with I I'd say but you know it's it's kind of up to you like what do you if you have an hour like what do you want to do you know you can you can do a lot of different things you can go lighter and faster you can go heavier and slower you can go middle of the road and try to push you can have of push on one of those systems a little bit bit more and and that's fun so you've said to me before your goal is for rucking to be the new running bigger than running the goal is that rocking is bigger than running what's that going to take well we're in the early stages of it I mean first off it takes awareness that people are actually rucking so everybody that joins the military is is rucking so you're at M let's start out now you've got millions of people right you go to airports I mean I don't know roll bags and like stacking stuff so that everything is easy all the time like you sit on a flight for 10 hours and then you you know you stand on a walking escalator and then you go sit at your gate for no don't do that right put everything on your back you have handsfree movement that's Freedom you know you can do this in an airport you can do this while you're traveling it's going to make all of your adventures better while you're doing it as well you can you're training to climb the mountain in the airport right there you know you're training to to to explore the city with a by any time that you put a Ruck on your back you know I mean go to Europe which you're you're mentioning it's

[02:40:05] Cobblestone roads there's narrow sidewalks there's I mean roll bags are just not it's just a ball and chain around your life and so the first step is to just say this is better because and to get people to kind of buy into that and then there's just just the physiological side of this is extremely healthy for people to do and it's and I come at that from a baseline of activity the best things that you want out of life require passion and energy and activity you have to do them we need to be people who do things and the more that you do the more confident that you get doing things and this is a really important lesson that everybody has to relearn throughout the course of their life and you have to keep doing stuff the body is antifragile the more that you work it the stronger it it it gets and and that's an amazing amazing thing that we have and to not know what we're capable of is just a shame and so let's let's intentionally do these physically harder things than than nothing than just you know living our lives on phone or always walk always standing to then sit to never move I mean there's just so much freedom and there's there's so much benefit that comes from from your ability to move yourself and to carry weight and you are built and born and have evolved in order to do this you just have to kind of do it yeah it is our superpower right

[02:41:46] Michael Michael wrote about this in the comfort crisis that there's there's you know nothing that's evolved to carry more than we do so we have to just do it and you can work it into your life the risk of injury is fractional I mean you're you're kind of even describing it as like I'm just don't even almost count it as exercise now most people would count a an hour and a half with 60 pounds on their back exercise and when you do your Hills you'll count it as exercise right the the scalability it's it's a very simple thing to do you carry weight it's not a new machine that's going to turn into a tow rack it's not Mr spandex yelling at you through some screen on a bike right it's it's it's none of these gimmicks it's not a new band it's not a new whatever it's so simple this has been going on for Millennia it's why humans exist you know this has been proven by the Roman legion rucking was their litmus test to get into that it's been proven in all of the Special Operations communities the SAS has you know started the west and that came over to to Army

[02:42:51] Special Forces from there to Delta to all of all of these kinds of units it's it's foundational to our ability to survive and thrive as a species and for us to then take a little bit of that that's been proven for Millennia and enrich our lives so much to take these steps and to become more active it's such an unlock in our lives when you take this kind of responsibility and you say I I just I want to be a more active person and all the all of a sudden you're around active people and then you're you're figuring out you know how to move forward and and and that's just

[02:43:27] I mean I want to die with my boots on moving forward up a hill somewhere you know and and that's my My Hope and my goal and part of that is physical maybe but part of that is also metaphorical it's it's very much tied to a mental Outlook of life you know do you want to kind of take your two fingers and roll your bag onto the the walkway and stand there and then go find a seat and sit down and stare at your phone or do you want to take Life by by take the bull by the horns right yeah no one of the things that we do with our patients is talk about this marginal decade what are the activities you want to be able to do in the last decade of your life and we want them to be noted very specifically right so these have to be quantifiable things um and you know I want to be able to rock three miles over uneven surface with 20 lbs in my back in the last decade of My Life um I have a feeling you'll be doing much more than that but it's you know to your point um it's a really beautiful thing to be able to do and I'm really I'm I'm I mean you know

[02:44:34] I'm so grateful for what for what you're doing and I I suspect that we're we're really on a both positive first and positive second derivative of the appreciation for this and the adoption of this so I suspect that this time next year you know you'll be looking back saying I can't believe how many more people are doing this there's been times in my life where I felt like I'm completely crazy you know it's it's kind of the the entrepreneurs journey and I I

[02:45:06] I'm not asking for any kind of sympathy I I I've chosen this this path of my own valtion and I'm and I'm grateful to what has brought me to this path and there's other times in life I know that that's not I want to live a life right like I we're all meant to be part of something bigger than ourselves and we're meant to have friends and spiritual soulmates and people who are fighting the same fight without this transactional approach to the world like you want to believe in the human spirit in in other people and it it's you know it's been very uplifting for for me at a very deep level that you've embraced this and just live that life and have told people that they can get a lot out of this as well and and and like it it gives me more strength to to drive on with this mission that is is near and dear to me and this is a a mission so near and dear to me it comes I mean we tapped into this we didn't invent it it comes from this long story that I have with 911 this terrible day happening that eventually helped me find enough courage to join the army that somehow these guys who had fought in the the invasion of Afghanistan put me through some Gauntlet that somehow I I passed and measured up to their standard which is very humbling to do that then I served with these people who had been there and done that and they they they taught me so much and what I left was this overwhelming desire to pay that forward because of how much I feel that I owe everything that I've been afforded and so that can become a very lonely Journey at times though and it's been amazing to have to have your just activity your support in in that and and kind of I don't mind being crazy but I'd rather be crazy if if if you're also crazy if that makes sense I'm happy to be crazy with you Jason thank you so much it's been it's been it's been great um spending this time with you today and uh again thanks for what you're doing and uh I hope that a lot more people after listening to this are are gonna kind of dip their toe in the water and I suspect that they will experience not just what

[02:47:28] I've experienced but what everybody I've dragged on a Ruck has experienced which is I'm going to go do that regularly thanks it's it's been wonderful to chat with you I appreciate it [Music]
