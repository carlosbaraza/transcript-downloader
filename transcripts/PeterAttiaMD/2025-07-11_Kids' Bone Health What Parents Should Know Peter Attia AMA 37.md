This clip is from episode Navigating bone health: early life influences and advanced strategies for improvement and injury prevention (#214 rebroadcast)

In this clip, they discuss:

- Nutrition & Activity Are Key for Kids – Bone health for children ages 8–20 relies heavily on proper nourishment and staying active during the short window of parental influence
- Bone-Loading Activities Matter Most – Simply being active isn’t enough—kids need activities that specifically load the bones to optimize development
- Kids & Power-Based Sports – Jumping, lifting, and other strength-based sports are emphasized as better options for bone development than endurance-focused activities
-  Rucking as a Bone-Building Tool – Carrying heavy loads while walking—known as rucking—can safely build bone without stressing joints
- Avoid Smoking, Especially for Young Teens – Smoking is especially harmful for bone health in children under 16, who are more vulnerable during development

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this clip about kids' bone health from The Drive podcast:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This segment focuses on optimizing bone health in children, particularly during crucial developmental years (ages 8-20). Dr. Attia discusses the importance of physical activity and proper nutrition for building bone mineral density (BMD) in youth. He specifically addresses the surprising finding that running doesn't have as significant an impact on BMD as might be expected, and explores potential reasons for this observation.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Running impacts can produce forces up to 8x body weight at the knees [01:22]
- Elite runners' low BMI may be a confounder in bone density studies [01:59]
- Bones are mechanical sensory entities that remodel in response to mechanical stress [04:06]
- Children under 16 are uniquely susceptible to bone health interventions [03:26]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Ensure adequate nutrition and physical activity [00:40]
- Maintain healthy BMI (not too low) [02:24]
- Incorporate activities that load bones [00:40]
- Avoid smoking, especially before age 16 [03:26]

Context-specific Recommendations:
- Include power-based sports and jumping activities [03:02]
- Consider rucking (walking with weighted backpack) [03:26]
- Include strength training appropriate for age [04:06]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Rucking 5 days per week recommended [03:26]
- Farmer's carries and weighted walking [03:02]
- Power-based sports and jumping activities [03:02]
- Weight lifting (age-appropriate) [04:06]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Bones are mechanical sensory entities that are going to remodel in proportion to how much mechanical stress they're under." [04:06]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal BMI range for bone health in children?
2. Are there specific strength training guidelines for different age groups?
3. What are the best ways to measure bone density in children?
4. How does nutrition specifically impact bone development during growth years?

The clip ends before discussing many of the other categories requested (supplements, nutrition details, biomarkers, etc.), so I've focused on the information that was actually presented in this segment.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] I think we laid a lot of the groundwork that we need to do and um this next section we'll get into kind of everything people can do um to improve it individually. But before we get to kind of like how you the person can do it um we did have some questions from subscribers who said you know they have kids and they want to improve their bone health and we've talked about how important it is. So before we get to the individual, is there anything in particular, any advice you would have for people who have kids on those very important ages, you know, the 8 to 20 on what they can do so they can really optimize the bone health? Yeah, I think this is very important. You know, I when

[00:00:40] I stopped to think about all of the things that, you know, a parents got on their plate to try to help their kids with during this relatively narrow window that your kids are in your house and and and therefore somewhat amendable to your influence. Um, you know, I think the most important thing probably comes down to being adequately nourished and being very active and in particular being very active in things that load bones. So, one of the things that was a bit surprising to me was that running didn't have a greater impact on uh BMD. So, in a moment, we'll pull up that figure,

[00:01:22] Nick, that I think is pretty interesting that shows all of the different sports and how they impact BMD. Now, I'm going to posit that the running one has a confounder in there because if you think about it, running puts a lot of force on muscles, right? I mean, especially when you think about the hips, which are two of the three bones that are attached to muscles that feel exper that experience great force during running. So, why is it that running where you're potentially at at least at the knees experiencing eight times your body weight with each impact, why wouldn't that do more? And

[00:01:59] I've been thinking about this for some time and maybe somebody knows the answer, but my suspicion is that the confounder here is body weight and BMI, right? And that when you talk about elite runners, and usually these are studied in elite runners, they're very weight conscious, right? running is running and cycling are the ultimate strengthtoe uh ratio sports and

[00:02:24] I do wonder if we're seeing basically malnourished runners and what do I mean by that basically people that are you know BMI is too low might be perfect for being a runner but it's too low for optimizing bone mineral density so I guess this is a long-winded way of saying running might not be enough Um, so obviously running is a great thing to do and it comes with a lot of benefit, but you probably want to make sure that your kids, both boys and girls, are doing other sports that involve more power.

[00:03:02] So, probably things that involve jumping and actually lifting heavy things. Um, this kind of a great plug for rocking. You know, I talked mentioned Michael Easter briefly at the outset. I mean, one of the things that Michael writes about in his book, The Comfort Crisis, is the importance of just walking with heavy stuff. So, either doing a farmer's carry, doing a ruck, which I love. You know, I try to ruck five days a week.

[00:03:26] So, it's, you know, backpack with heavy weight in it and just walking around and and always trying to find a hill to walk up and down, kind of loading myself without the knee joints being susceptible to that. Um, so going back to the kids, I think we just want to make sure BMI is not too low, hormone dysfunction is not there, um, energy availability is is there, body fat's not too low, all of those things that tend to occur. Obviously, smoking, you know, you know, uh, we obviously want to make sure nobody's smoking, but as as as we just talked about, kids beneath the age of 16 are uniquely susceptible to this.

[00:04:06] So, um, again, it's pretty straightforward. Lots of nutrition, lots of physical activity, and specifically physical activity that builds muscular strength and because I think that's going to apply the greatest force to the bone. And the bones, as we talked about, are mechanical mechanical sensory uh entities that are going to remodel in proportion to how much mechanical stress they're under. So again, lifting heavy stuff matters and that doesn't mean that 12-year-olds need to be deadlifting three times their body weight, but we also don't want to shy away from kids lifting things.
