This clip is from episode 351 ‒ Male fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility, and navigating testosterone replacement therapy | Paul Turek, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Sperm Banking Is Recommended Before Cancer Treatment – Even if cancer prognosis is uncertain, banking sperm is strongly advised due to future fertility risk
- Paternal Age Impacts Offspring Health – Risks like miscarriage, birth defects, and conditions such as autism and schizophrenia increase with advancing age
- Sperm Freezing Has a Long Track Record – The process is well-established and reliable, with about 50% survival of viable sperm after thawing
- How Much to Bank? – For IVF, three ejaculates are often enough. For low-tech methods like IUI, up to 10 may be recommended for multiple pregnancy attempts

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of the discussion about sperm banking between Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Paul Turek:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The discussion focuses on sperm banking, paternal age effects, and reproductive health. Dr. Turek, a board member of Legacy (a sperm banking company), provides expert insights on when men should consider banking sperm and the risks associated with advanced paternal age. The conversation covers both practical aspects of sperm banking and the broader evolutionary implications of paternal age-related mutations.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- 40 is considered older paternal age in national guidelines, with 50 being definitely "older" [01:38]
- Paternal age risks follow a "hockey stick" curve with inflection around age 60 [02:46]
- Approximately 50 mutations occur per generation, with half being neurodevelopmental [04:38]
- Sperm freezing success rate: about 50% survival rate after thaw [08:36]
- Three ejaculates needed for one child via insemination; 10 ejaculates recommended for three children [09:21]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Bank sperm before any chemotherapy treatment [00:32]
- Consider banking before age 40 if planning delayed reproduction [01:38]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Cancer patients should bank regardless of prognosis [00:32]
- Three ejaculates minimum for IVF purposes [09:21]

4. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Sperm count should be evaluated before banking [09:21]
- Quality control assessment post-thaw [08:36]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Human evolution is entirely driven by sperm" [04:38]
"Maybe it's not disease. Maybe it's where we're headed." (regarding neurodevelopmental changes) [06:36]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific storage conditions required for optimal sperm preservation?
2. How do lifestyle factors affect sperm quality prior to banking?
3. What are the cost implications of long-term sperm storage?
4. Are there any genetic screening recommendations before banking?

The other categories (Supplements & Medications, Exercise & Movement, Nutrition & Diet, References & Resources) were not specifically addressed in this transcript segment.

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the key points discussed regarding sperm banking and paternal age effects, with particular emphasis on practical recommendations and scientific insights.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] What advice do you give a guy who comes in your practice? Maybe you don't see a lot of these guys, but let's let's say you get a guy um who comes in and says, "Hey, look, I I want to I want to bank my sperm. I want to freeze my sperm." Now, presumably, you'll get a lot of that if a guy's undergoing therapy for cancer or something like that. Um is there anything a guy needs to know? And would you recommend a guy do that if he's 40, doesn't have a partner, but says, "Look, I want to have kids." And is isn't there something to the idea that my sperm are better today than they will be in a decade? It's a huge issue.

[00:00:32] Paternal age. Yeah. Paternal age and fertility. Paternal age. So we can we can go there. But I don't place value judgments. I say good idea. Uh I am a disclosure. I'm on a you know a board of legacy. Uh I was I love their mission driven the way they're mission driven. And so I I like the fact of going for military and exposed patients and this and that and VA. So, but I'm I'm I'm for that. I think it's the lowest hanging fruit in the field, especially obviously for chemo, for cancer survivors and things. It's like I don't care what you think might happen with your cancer, I would still bank it. I started a nonprofit called banking on the future. 16 year olds to 21 year olds with cancer, we'll do it for you. We'll pay for it for 5 years just to give us a sample. Y because it's so much harder afterwards or not. Right. So, so you would advise any male that's that hasn't reproduced and who might want to who's undergoing any chemotherapy for any cancer just play it safe bank for cancer. Yes. Now, should anyone do it for any reason? Probably not. But again,

[00:01:38] I don't pass the judgment. If they're worried about something, then I'm worried then than then they should. What paternal age do you worry about? So, good question. Uh and you look at like national guidelines for sperm donation, 40 is considered older paternal age, 50 for sure, right? Mhm. If you look at risks to offspring, miscarriages, stillborns, um autism, birth effects, things immediately related to conception, prematurity, those go up with paternal age. Then you look at birth effects when they're born. Those go up, you know, one to twofold. And then the worrisome ones are the single gene defects and the epigenetics like psychiatric morbidity.

[00:02:23] So the autism, schizophrenia, dyslexia, bipolar disorder, potentially Alzheimer's in offspring. Yep. And they're not detectable at young. So big issues. So I've written a lot about that, published on it. I was actually having my second child at 50 when I was writing this thing that should not be doing this, you know, writing a paper on all these risks called repro and with Alan Deenko from

[00:02:46] University of Pittsburgh. But I think it's a hockey stick curve for risk to offspring. And you think the the the inflection is 40 or 50? I think it's more like 60. Okay. I think there's a slow linear increase in risk to offspring from 25 to 50 or 60 and then there's an inflection and then there's the blade of the stick and I think that's logarithmic. It's the same curve as women.

[00:03:12] Yeah. But they're shifted 20 years earlier or something like that. Yeah. So it's a shorter curve but the same thing 40 38 to 40 is kind of a point where things really ramp up with chromosomes. The men's stuff is not chromosomal. So if you take the curves together, they're different spans, same shape, but I think the female curve is on top of the male curve. This is not a the same relevant relative risk, right? So women, you know, you go from 25 to 40, your your chance of a a miscarriage. So it's chromosomal. It goes up quite significantly after that. Very significantly. And the end the consequence of women's issues with offspring related health is basically miscarriage. Yeah. And in many ways it's almost easier to detect, right? Because very so so it's it's can be more dramatic but it usually and now prevented with with pre-impation genetic testing. Men are different. You can't detect these things. They're single gene mutations. This is the med the machinery is constantly working. It's getting old. the quality control of the process goes down and little gene mutations get in there that are always being always being spun off in the heat of the engine and they're getting they're not getting vetted. So the machinery is not doing a good job. So they're getting through and they're not going to be they're not going to be lethal. They're going to be delotterious. So that's where you get things and autism is a classic one.

[00:04:38] Paternal age related um looks like that's the biggest risk factor for it and that worries me a lot. Right. So I think [Music] um it's interesting the facts are that human evolution is entirely driven by sperm. Yeah. Because eggs are just sitting there correcting the problem. is entirely driven by sperm and half and so 50 mutations a year a generation usually gets spit out based on in a nature paper um probably between generations and it there's always mutations occurring in 14-year-old fathers but it goes way up with 60-year-old fathers so the rate of mutations goes way up with age but it averages 50 over your reproductive life and most of them half of the mutations that we are throwing off as a species are not ears or hands hands or feet or height or thing, it's all neurodedevelopmental. It's like half neurodedevelopmental. Yeah. So, when you think about what we're seeing, you know, the Martians from the 50s and the movies with big heads, that's kind of where we're headed. It's autism, dyslexia, bipolar disorder, you know, these are neural developmental neurogenerative issues. And why is that? Well, that's what's going on. I mean, that's where we're being stimulated. That's where we're being asked to evolve. Look at the last 30 years, right? Funny. one of the biggest investors in uh Salesforce um said to me I was said to me I you know I realized I was dyslexic when I when my son was born and I said really he said yeah but you know what it helped me be the man I am to realize that Salesforce is going to fly gave him the first 500,000 gave him the first million they never took any more money and he said it let me focus I was so autism is one of diseases where you put out you you ignore a lot of input and you find the the gift and it's amazing if you go down the rabbit hole of what they're good at, it's like their whole brain trust is there. So, is that a disease or is that where we're headed?

[00:06:36] I mean, I think it exists on a spectrum. I I think any anyone who's who's probably spent time with kids, you know, using ASD as a um as as an example, boy, you know, you know, mild versions of it the way it can be defined because it really has three categories now in the DSM5. Um I think the mildest version probably comes with more superpowers than limitations or maybe equal amount, but but clearly the more severe it gets, uh it's pretty debilitating. But but this this idea of paternal age, we're calling it disease, though. Yeah. But maybe it's not disease. Maybe it's where we're headed. Maybe it's the future. Maybe the nonsequittors that come out of those brains. I mean, look at who's changing the world right now, at least in Silicon Valley. Yeah. But but again, I would argue most of those people would be in category, you know, class one, not class three. Um what's the uh what's the thaw success rate? Right. So if a guy is 40, he's he goes ahead, he freezes and banks his sperm, assuming they were good to go in, right? Are they very high probability of thawing correctly? So when you freeze sperm, it's about a 200y old process regularly used for about 75. I forgot who the Italian scientist was who froze sperm in snow and then thought it and it was alive. A couple hundred years later after Leewinho came up with a microscope, they found it was moving and it was possible. So egg thawing is very new. Egg freezing and thawing is very new. This is very old. So everyone is thinking about sperm now because eggs are being frozen left and right. But this is much older technology and the cell is much hardier than an egg. So it does a lot better typically. When you freeze it, it's the freezing process that kills sperm be from icicles on the inside. Yes. And then while it's frozen is usually no issue. And it's and then there's another problem when you thought rapid temperature shift. So that's where the kill rate comes from in a good sample half of it should survive. Okay. And so in so how much sperm would you tell a guy to bank if he has to do it if it's the definitive samples for his life? So meaning he's 40 or he's about to undergo chemotherapy or some other exposure where he should just assume he will not have normal sperm again. What do you tell him? So I usually say depending on what technology you're going to use, but if your sperm count's normal, three three ejaculates is one kid's worth of sperm with insemination technology where you would thought and then and then turkey based it. So 10 ejaculates for three shots on goal for three kids potentially. Three kids with low technology, but 10 ejaculates will give you most of China with IVF. Got it. Oh, when you say low technology, you mean

[00:09:21] IUI or something, right? So there's three levels. X, no tech, high-tech is IVF, and in the middle is IUI. Y, that's the stuff that's turkey basting. It's relatively straightforward, relatively cheap. I see. Three kids for that, but plenty of sperm for IVF. So, three ejaculates would be more than enough if they're normal for IVF. Yeah. So, the population you're talking about may be cancer survivors. Half of those will not be normal. They're really looking at

[00:09:44] IVF. So, they don't need that many. Yep. But I'd say three is a good number, but it's an insurance policy, right? I'm Peter Aia.
