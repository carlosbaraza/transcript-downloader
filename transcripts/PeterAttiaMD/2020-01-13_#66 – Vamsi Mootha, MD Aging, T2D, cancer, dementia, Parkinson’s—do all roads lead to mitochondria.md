## Description

Full title: #66–Vamsi Mootha, M.D.: Aging, type 2 diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease–do all roads lead to mitochondria?

Original release date: 8/12/19

In this episode, Dr. Vamsi Mootha, an expert in mitochondrial biology and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, shares his breadth of knowledge on the mitochondrion organelle: its history, function, genome architecture, and his research of rare mitochondrial dysfunction. Vamsi is currently focused on finding clinical treatments for the 300-some identified rare mitochondrial disorders, but in this work there is a wealth of potential implications for longevity and chronic disease. In this conversation, Vamsi elucidates how the latest research could give insight into conditions related to aging, including but not limited to Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, cancer, and much more. We also explore some of the most exciting potential therapies for mitochondrial diseases such as hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), how exercise affects the mitochondria, the use of hyperbaric chambers for cancer therapy, and the mechanisms by which metformin might confer longevity benefits in a non-diabetic individual.

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is dr. MC muta

[00:04:14] AMC has a professor of systems biology at the Harvard Medical School he has an appointment at the Broad Institute which is actually where we met to conduct this interview and we talked a little bit about what makes the brode so special he specializes in rare my and real diseases as opposed to longevity per se something that I'd love to talk about but I think you'll see in this interview why it's so interesting to talk to someone who specializes in rare orphan mitochondrial diseases about longevity his laboratory uses a blend of genomics computational biology biochemical physiology and systems biology to study mitochondrial function and dysfunction he received his bachelor's in mathematics and computer science at Stanford before going on to

[00:04:54] Harvard as part of the joint MIT Harvard program in medical school he stayed in Boston to do his training in internal medicine though as we discuss he now focuses exclusively on research he's received more honors and awards than I could name here but it's always worth mentioning it when someone is a genius

[00:05:13] Award recipient so he won the MacArthur Foundation Award in 2004 which obviously puts him in pretty rarified earth in this episode we talk about a lot of things we start with at least for me one of the best discussions I've ever had on the mitochondria and you might think at first that some of this recapitulates things that were discussed on previous podcast you may recall we had a great discussion of mitochondria with Navdeep

[00:05:37] Chen Dell but we go a little bit deeper and we talk more about some of the evolutionary pressure around the mitochondria and even though at first you might think well gosh this seems awfully scientific where is the application if you stick with it you're going to see where it comes and and how understanding these rare orphan diseases that most of us have never heard of can give us an insight into Aging we do eventually start to talk about metformin which I know many people ask about and he provides a great insight into or several great insights into what metformin may or may not be doing and again for at least for me this was like just the master's class in mitochondrial biogenesis electron transport chain etc talk about ways that we can target mitochondrial proteins and complexes to treat disease but perhaps the single most insightful and interesting thing that we talked about that completely blew my mind was the role of hypoxia as a treatment I want to repeat that again the role of hypoxia oxygen DEP evasion as treatment now we're gonna cover this in a way that I think is very interesting so I don't want to say any more about it but I do want to add a disclaimer to this that MC and I spoke about after the podcast and I and I want to make sure it's here right so now as he emphasizes that there published research to date on the beneficial effects of hypoxia and animal models of mitochondrial disease is still in its early stages and it's restricted to animal studies it is not yet ready to be applied to humans to extend these ideas to humans would be premature and irresponsible since hypoxia can have life-threatening implications if and when the concept is extended into humans it will need to be done so in a clinical trial setting with the appropriate ethical regulatory and safety measures in place so with that caveat and without further delay please enjoy my conversation with dr. MC MC thank you so much for making time today no absolutely welcome ya sight unseen - I'm always impressed when people I don't know in advance agree to sit down with me I'm kind of honored humbled so so thank you very much thank you for coming in meeting yeah the broad is quite an impressive place tell folks a little bit about where we are right now and what makes this unique even within the hallowed halls of Boston biomedical research institutes now I think it's a really exciting place and I've had the pleasure of actually watching it blossom from nothing it's really the brainchild of somebody named Eric Lander who was one of the leaders of the human genome sequencing project and as that was being completed in draft form in 2001 and then in quote finished form in 2003 he saw the need to create some sort of an entity that would take advantage of the power of genomics for improving biomedicine so he created this Institute and it's unprecedented in a lot of ways it's joint between Harvard and MIT it involves all the hospitals here in

[00:08:40] Boston and it's basically a incredible forum where people can get together and basically pursue projects that they can't pursue on their own in their own individual laboratories there's a big computational theme here a big theme on being systematic in once approach not focused narrowly on the protein that they've studied in the past but being systematic and seeing where the data takes you and there's a very pervasive theme of collaboration as well so Eric has always said that the Broad

[00:09:10] Institute is a bit of an experiment but that would spin about 1516 years and I think without a doubt it's been a wildly successful experiment do most of you here at the Broad have an appointment elsewhere like I know you spend much of your time at Mass General lots of people here spend you know they have an appointment at MIT does everybody have another appointment outside of the broad almost so there's almost two types of people that work at the broad there's some people that are actually formally employed by the broad institute and there's others like myself that are employed elsewhere in my case I work at

[00:09:42] Mass General Hospital and Howard Hughes Medical Institute that's my primary appointment my paycheck comes from there but then I spend a day a week over here working on collaborative types of projects I can't pursue easily my own own lab suit which almost two types of folks of a year I think one of the neat things about the Broad Institute is you know traditionally there's this grad student postdoc assistant professor academic track but how about for all the other people that want to do research in a non-profit academic setting but aren't interested in applying for our one grants or teaching the broad actually has an entire research scientists track as well and so you can be employed here as a research scientist doing science and funded here and funded here and I think that's a very very different organizational model compared to any other academic organization let's back up for a moment you studied at Stanford where you you did were you a computer science major what was your major an undergrad I was math and computer sleighing okay got it did you know you wanted to get into biology and medicine you know when I was a kid I'm an Indian American my father is a retired surgeon as it turns out my three older siblings would end up becoming doctors also so I like to joke that we had the medicine gene in our family so growing up I was convinced

[00:10:56] I wanted to be a doctor of some sort but then in high school I fell in love with math I did the high school math competitions was pretty good at those two the high school science fair competitions in math did well with those and so I ended up going to Stanford with the goal of being a math and computer science major and that's what I squarely focused on and then towards the end of college when I was looking for a research project my advisor told me about the work of Sam Carlin he's a statistician that was developing some of the underlying methods for biomolecular sequence analysis he's a fundamental mathematician in stem this is like early 90s early 90s that's right that's right so I ended up working on

[00:11:38] DNA sequence analysis as a college student writing code try to analyze DNA and protein sequences and I fell in love with that and then my adviser said why don't you contemplate a future career in in medicine if for no other reason going to medical school is a great way of learning physiology you know thought about it from a practical perspective I applied simultaneously to PhD programs in mathematical biology and also played two MD PhD programs and I applied to this program joint between Harvard and

[00:12:10] MIT actually thought that it was an MD ph.d program this is all pre-internet mm-hmm so I thought it was an MD ph.d program but it wasn't it was a straight MD program but it's a joint program between the two institutions yeah they would set aside like a I remember like 20 students for this it what was it called the H HST HST program it's exactly right yeah that's right so so part the HST program and it was kind of catered to students that had slightly quantitative backgrounds math computer science types of backgrounds it provided a bit of a more gentle introduction to medical school I could have used that for my first year of medical school was just unbearable I mean it was such a culture shock of that only one told the story on the podcast before the worst exam I've ever done in my life from the point when I decided to care about school was the first semester histology exam in medical school because I very arrogantly and naively assumed that if I understood the concepts of histology I didn't need to memorize anything so I took this very pure math approach which was I could just derive everything in my mind

[00:13:18] I understood the fundamentals and that got me a 53% on a final exam in histology which like I just sat there looking at this number thinking how is this possible am I the stupidest human being that has ever walked the face it was really a wake up call that said you know you're gonna actually just have to start memorizing things around here it's a big culture shock I think when I know you have a background in engineering and applied math so very similar to my background and it made for a lot of unhappiness for me also that first semester of medical school at least you were in California I was facing the

[00:13:57] Boston winter at the same time I was facing histology that's a good point I did have that going for me so when you finished med school you did a residency in internal medicine you stayed in Boston correct Brigham that's right that's right I've been here now for it's hard to believe but about 25 years during residency at the Brigham is obviously certainly among the top three most academic medicine programs in the country was talking 20 or colleagues yesterday and you know he made the point that when he looked at sort of his class or the you know the the cohort of people that entered medicine at the Brigham you know you just fast-forward 20 years and they're basically the leaders within each of the different scientific fields so I assume it was a pretty deliberate decision on your part to really preserve sort of academic optionality yeah you know it I think at almost every single one of these juncture the nodes yeah yeah exactly from college to medical school medical school to residency I think maybe I'm just inherently a bit of an indecisive person but I was unsure as to whether or not I wanted to do a residency by then it fallen in love with basic research and the question was was

[00:15:04] I going to do a basic science postdoc or was I gonna do a residency and so just as I did at the previous node I decided to just apply for both so I simultaneously applied for postdoc positions and for residency programs that was the era when you would fill out your residency match list with the number 2 pencil mm-hmm so I'd fill it out every decent I kind of rogen number 2

[00:15:26] I loved those things so I would fill it out and then I would rip it up the next fill it out and rip it up the next day and I joked that the only reason I did a residency is because the due date was another number so that said I want to put you on the spot and ask you a question that I get asked all the time and frankly I don't know the answer to it and I feel bad that I always provide sort of nebulous answers but I do get asked a lot by either college students who are contemplating medicine or not or medical students who are interested in research and the question is a variant of one if you're at the college node but you're very interested in medical research is there benefit to doing an MD and then the second-order question is if you're in medical school and you're gonna finish and you know you want to do research is there a benefit to doing a residency now I generally tell people and I if you disagree with me I hope you say so very loudly I generally say if you're in college but undecided about medical school or not I would say don't do it pursue the PhD if you are in medical school and presumably at least somewhat interested in medicine still do an internal medicine residency because there is no substitute for doing that type of research and at least having the ability to understand clinically why you're doing it so again do you disagree with that and if so how would you or how would you modify that Hale to get asked this question quite a bit because I think there's a group of people out there that love science are probably good at clinical medicine if they do it but they're also good at research if they do it and maybe they're inherently a little bit risk-averse as well so they're always trying to figure out what's the best path for me the advice that I had gotten when I was in college was that the reason to go to medical school if you're interested in research is that it's one of the best curricula for understanding physiology how do all of the parts come together and operate and trying to understand how an entire living system operates if you don't go through all of medical school if you don't learn Anatomy if you don't learn histology if you don't learn cardiovascular physiology it's a bit tough but it's a good point you make right which is in somewhere between 16 and 24 months which is the pre-clinical part of medical school it's almost impossible to get a more well curated view of the human body because it's been optimized for that over a hundred years it's exactly a right more and it's a living system right I mean you could study yeast you could study Drosophila but the human is extraordinarily well investigated and you're right in about two years or so you have a very intense curriculum studying one living system different aspects of it so from that perspective I think it's a great education it's a broad education for biomedical research at the other node again I spend a lot of time thinking about this and one of my advisors that you said at least do an internship because then you'll be licensed you can prescribe medicines at that point and there is something special about caring for patients there's something very special about going through the process of residency with your colleagues and again you really get to see the human living system at some of its extremes so

[00:18:44] I think it's a great way of continuing to learn physiology and pharmacology as well so I'm super grateful for the path of course and of one experiment but I'm really happy that I did medical school and I'm also super happy I did the clinical training as well because it completely shaped my research focus as well okay no that makes sense I generally say the same thing which is I don't regret the path I took though I'm glad I didn't know in advance what it was gonna look like because it would have seemed too indirect but nevertheless so right now you spend virtually all of your time doing research is that correct that's right when did you stop seeing patients it's been about five to six years or so was that a tough decision it was tough because we went through this entire medical school and residency process with the goal of actually seeing patients and caring for them the truth is the number of patients I was seeing was asymptoting as a function of time emotionally it was very very difficult to go to zero so even though I've seen probably one patient a month or so five years ago or so going to zero was actually the harder part but at some point I had to just do the math and say there's only a certain number of hours per day I'm running a pretty big research group that's focused on mitochondria and mitochondrial disorders and the long-term goal is to impact these patients and so I'm gonna let other people be the ones that care for these patients at the frontline under try to develop new diagnostics and drugs for these patients so let's start talking about the mitochondria when did you come to the realization that that was the area you wanted to focus on and what is it about the mitochondria that especially drew you in so as a first year medical student I was a little bit unhappy you're in Boston it was cold there's a lot of memorization that first year that first semester in particular I wasn't sure if I'd actually made the right decision in coming to medical school from a math background and then right in the middle of that first semester when we were taking our histology and pathology class with a very very brief lecture on myopathies muscle diseases and there's one slide that basically indicated that there's a rare form of myopathies that are due to mutations in the mitochondrial DNA now truth be told I don't think I'd appreciate it at that time that we had our own mitochondria with their own genomes and so that immediately fascinated me you dig a little bit deeper you learn that these were once bacteria they're kind of swimming around in ourselves and that's kind of cool you see an image of mitochondria in the muscle it's just beautiful and there's a something that really captivated me and

[00:21:23] I kind of got hooked on that organelle at first semester of medical school and I've told this story to other people Peter but what happened it was a few weeks later my dad's cousin who is at that time a postdoctoral fellow in the Harvard research one of the research hospitals she heard that I was unhappy so she invited me over to her house in

[00:21:44] Somerville for a Friday night dinner so it started to snow I took the red line all the way to Somerville it was a 20-minute walk to her house by the time I had gotten in my shoes were soaked I was freezing she immediately looked at me and said oh my god you look terrible and so she took my coat off she tried to drive me up and she started cooking dinner and then her boyfriend appeared like an hour later and now is about eight or nine o'clock or so we had dinner together and then we found out that the tea had been shut down and so not only was I an unhappy first year medical student but now I'm spending Friday night with my dad's cousin and her boyfriend in Somerville and so they create a makeshift bed for me in their living room I'm spending the night there at this point and I look at the bookshelf and there's a textbook of mitochondrial biology on the bookshelf so just a few weeks earlier I had this initial encounter with the organelle I saw this books I just took it off the shelf and I just started reading it I read about a hundred pages that first night I borrowed it and I basically devoured that book over the course of the next few weeks and I just fell in love with the organelle at that point and thought to myself but this is what I want to work on for the rest of my career as that's an amazing story and I think for people listening that's they shouldn't be concerned that they haven't had that Eureka moment right I mean I

[00:23:06] I've heard a lot of amazing scientist talk about their passion and not all of them in fact most of them don't have such a laser moment like that now of course I get the stories of people that have those moments are even more vivid in my mind of that oh my god I can't think of anything but this so let's talk a little bit about the mitochondria you've already alluded to some of the really interesting features about it so let's start with the well gosh which one's the most interesting let's just start with the lineage right so how did these bacteria find their way in to these eukaryotic cells yeah this is I think one of the most fascinating aspects of the organelle so this is a process known as endosymbiosis so the current theory is that there is an organism probably resembling a modern-day gram-negative rods something like a rickettsial species that merfolk smight not even know what that means so gram-negative is just a staining that allows us to identify a type of bacteria so you've got this bacteria that is shaped like a rod literally and how does it get its energy prior to this encounter the thinking is that it had a full electron transport chain and was probably capable of doing aerobic metabolism using things like oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor and one of the theories proposes that that had an electron transport chain that's not that different than modern-day mitochondria the hypothesis is that that somehow merged with something resembling modern-day archaea so there's three main domains of life you have archaea you have bacteria and then you have eukaryotes in eukaryotes have nuclei so the hypothesis is that there's an archaeal a since there's a bacterial species they form a union of some sort and this is what gave rise to modern day eukaryotic cells maybe about one and a half billion years ago that's kind of remarkable and is the idea I mean what kind of evolutionary pressure must have been placed to create an entirely new species it's also binary it seems somewhat binary to me is it and in other words when you look at the difference between I don't know say a chimpanzee and an ape or an ape and a human you can see lots of continuous evolution you know Neanderthal etc etc what you're describing sounds much more switched on switched off is that the case was this a or were there lots of iterations that we can't even appreciate today in between the Union and the current paradigm as far as we know endosymbiosis of the mitochondrion only took place once oh so there are lots of eukaryotes almost not all but almost all eukaryotes have a mitochondrion and if you look at the DNA of those mitochondria that still have a genome the phylogenetic analysis tells us that this was a monophyletic event this took place only once if that's not true for something like the chloroplast that also arose through serial end of symbiosis and that likely took place at least two independent times in evolution but for the mitochondrion you probably only took place once as far as we know and the chloroplast of course is to a plant effectively what the mitochondria is to like us that's exactly right yeah so how many genes do we think that that gram-negative rod and two mm and at the time the species that it merged with would have had how many for the best of our guessing probably also a few thousand so you had two things that had comparable numbers of genes merge and yet today you or I would have thirty thousand twenty thousand genes inside the nucleus and we'd have is it thirteen genes inside our mitochondria thirteen preserved genes so in other words to a first-order approximation the mitochondria lost all of its genes but deeper dig says actually it's somehow hung on to thirteen why do you think that was this is what we call reductive evolution modern-day mitochondria actually represent a mosaic so you need about a thousand proteins total to make our mitochondria and so some of those are attributable to the original bacterial ancestor and others are brand new innovations that even that original bacteria did not have but on the reductive side approximately a thousand genes from that original bacteria have either been lost altogether or have been transferred to the nuclear genome so that that genome today is tiny needs only about 16,000 basis it encodes thirteen proteins but that's only if you're looking at animals there's a lot of different eukaryotes so there's a lot of mitochondrial diversity so you and I still retain 13 proteins that are encoded by our mitochondrial genomes but if you look at malaria it's also eukaryotic it has a mitochondrion but it's genome only encodes three proteins today so that's additional reductive evolution what about things like you know flies yeast are they also variable flies are also animals and so most animals you would put them in the category yeah that's right so they would have about 13 sometimes 14 proteins but if you look at something like Giardia which causes a terrible diarrhea illness beaver fever that's a eukaryote it's actually lost its mitochondrial DNA altogether I know we talked about 13 proteins is it one-to-one mapping or are there genes that are non-coding or is it right so the mitochondria genome encodes two ribosomal RNAs 22 tRNAs and then there are 13 proteins yep so obviously to have 13 you we pretty much have a good sense of what the function of each of these are how many diseases that afflict humans result from genetic disorders they're inherited mutations that produce dysfunctional proteins right there's all about 250 different syndromes of the mtDNA of the mitochondrial DNA and by syndrome I mean there's a particular mutation that's associated with a particular clinical phenotype but that's only for talking about the mitochondrial disorders of the mtDNA that's right is that a higher or lower frequency on a probability basis given the number of base pairs because you said something like only what 16,000 base pairs it's relatively tiny we have genes in our nuclear genome that are 10 times that size so from a probability basis that you could have 250 mutations in that 16,000 base pair that would each lead to these distinct mitochondrial diseases is that more or less robust from a DNA perspective than our nuclear DNA I don't think we have a good answer to that question there's a little bit of an ascertain meant by ax syn clinical medicine so you know when I was going through residency probably when you're also going through your clinical training the answer to almost every single question about mitochondrial disease was maternal inheritance mm-hmm and that's because the nuclear genome was sequenced in draft format in 2001 but the mitochondrial DNA was sequenced in 1981 so those almost exactly 20 years earlier and it's small and so as soon as you saw patients that had a particular clinical phenotype that could be a mitochondrial disease it was easy to sequence the mitochondrial DNA so beginning in 1988 when two papers were published reporting the first mutations in the white unreal DNA it's been relatively straightforward to sequence set and associate mutations in the mtDNA with the disease phenotype and this is why now there's about 250 of these empty DNA mutation clinical phenotype mappings the nuclear genome has has been a little bit slower to follow since 2001 in beginning even a little bit before the the completion of the genome sequence we've now as a community been able to identify about 300 different genes in the nuclear genome that underlie mitochondrial disorders and of course that's 300 different genes but then there's different allelic variants as well so I think it's gonna be a little while before we can we can answer your question in a satisfactory way but it's a really provocative question and one more number to sort of extract from that is do we have a sense of how many genes in the nuclear genome are required for mitochondrial function so in other words what's the denominator nuclear wise right I test you one of the areas that we focused on heavily in our laboratory so beginning soon after the sequencing of the human genome we knew that the human genome encodes about 22,000 proteins it's an important question is which of those find their way to the mitochondrion it's gonna be more than 13 these are elaborate organelles so we used a lot of methods in the early 2000s things like proteomics GFP tagging microscopy computation and were able to identify about 1,100 proteins that are made by the nuclear genome that find their way into the mitochondrion so those 1,100 proteins have to work with those 13 proteins in space and time to do all the amazing things that the organelle does how do they communicate do we do we know how expression of mtDNA is coordinated with nuclear DNA it's a really really interesting question so some of the mechanisms are known but a lot of mechanisms are not yet known so when you exercise for example if your deconditioned and if you do a combination of aerobic training and strength training you can actually increase the number of mitochondria and there's an entire transcriptional program that will turn on all those nuclear genes but that same program will also turn on the replication factors that will go into the organelle and cause the mitochondrial DNA to replicate as well so it's a really smart transcriptional program that's that's in response to exercise make more of the nuclear encoded components and make more of the mitochondrial DNA and make more of the mitochondrial DNA encoded proteins so that increases mitochondrial density in a given cell so you have a myocyte of muscle cell do we know what the actual signals are they basically instruct the cell to make more DNA so what is the input from the exercise you mentioned two types of exercise right strength training and aerobic activity those have very different physiologic properties so what is it that at the physiologic level is leading to this nuclear level one of the important signals is something called a MP kinase the change in the ATP to adp ratio that's known to be one of the activators of this particular transcriptional program that induces mitochondrial biogenesis so this would be an decrease in AMPK activity an increase in a MP kind increase okay so that is basically sensing something like the ATP to adp ratios going down you know so when we exercise the ATP levels are usually pretty nicely defended but then what's happening is there's another reaction that's taking two ATP molecules making an ATP liberating a MP while ATP levels are defended some of these ratios chains and that can be sensed and that's one of the inputs into this program that says let's make more mitochondria now we'll come back to this far down the line but just because it's you mention it one of the effects of a drug called metformin that everybody loves to ask about is it activates AMPK does that imply that metformin administration by itself alters mitochondrial density so I think when we talk about exercise I think EMP activation is generally regarded as one of the important signals for mitochondrial biogenesis but I don't think it is sufficient it's not sufficient an Esso sorry though potentially I think it is but I would need to review some of the older literature to really confirm that so what do you think some of the other signals are I think some of the other signals are things like calcium and clearly there's other signals there's a couple of disease states as well where we see a massive proliferation of mitochondria they're not functioning properly but there's a massive proliferation of malfunctioning mitochondria so we're trying to work at some of those signals as well so as of right now it's a bit of an open question as to exactly how the number of mitochondria is sensed and regulated but we know some of the inputs right we know crudely what the inputs are right exercised as you mentioned what are some of the other things that even hormonal e for example did nutrients play a role one of the study said I was a part of about 10 to 15 years ago or so show that even things like androgens and testosterone can actually influence the amount of mitochondria disuse is a great way of rapidly eliminating mitochondria and then in terms of nutrients nad is an important signal as well this transcriptional regulator that I'm talking about it's called PTC one alpha and upstream of it is something called

[00:36:36] Sur t1 which of course utilizes any D as a cofactor so there's a couple of these inputs having lunch with David Sinclair later today so we'll be talking plenty how's Italy absolutely so I think a couple of these signals are beginning to emerge but we're not at that stage right now we're in a pill we can put seven of these things give it to a patient in boom we can replace exercise we're not there yet but you'd be remarkable if we understood the process well enough so that we could one day yeah there's been lots of claims of exercise in a pill I remember the New

[00:37:14] York Times wrote about something called iris and God they wrote about it in 2011-12 and then I saw it again recently and it's funny of course you see these stories which you realize they're being written about in such a crude way that you can infer nothing so you go back and look at the paper and you realize it's kind of a ridiculous claim at this point what is the turnover of mitochondria in a cell so if you have let's put some scale to things for folks so I'm gonna take I'm gonna biopsy one cell from your quadricep one muscle cell how many mitochondria approximately would be in it assuming you're a relatively well conditioned individual talking about the number of mitochondria is a little bit ambiguous because they're not quantal units mitochondrial constantly undergo fusion and fission so at any given state you can have a different number of mitochondria the mitochondrial DNA is a quantal units you can ask how many mitochondrial genomes are there per nuclear genome in a cell type okay so a fibroblast will have a few hundred maybe a thousand copies of the mitochondrial genome for each of its nuclear genome that's right but there's a lot of variation the highest would be what like a cardiac myocyte or something or a neuron the unfertilized egg wow it has half a million copies of mitochondrial DNA see I wouldn't have guessed that I don't know why I could have come up with ten guesses and that would not have been one of them it's remarkable and Dad sperm probably has a few hundred at best and I would have guessed the sperm needed more because it's doing the motion right it has to fight to get to the egg part of the reason is that the egg is so big relative to the size of the sperm so that's to a first-order approximation the explanatory variable but the unfertilized egg is sort of the olympic gold champion when it comes to and the

[00:39:05] Michael fells was the Michael Phelps of mtDNA that's right that's right and then red blood cells of course have no mitochondrial DNA and what's the turnover look like right so if you have a cardiac myocyte that presumably lasts for a long time you're in an individual like these cells are not turning over quickly are they turning over new mitochondria constantly is that how often is that mitochondrial

[00:39:29] DNA churning over I guess I'm trying to get at is what's like the half-life of these sort of non discreet mitochondria I think in most non-dividing tissues the half-life is on the order of a few days Wow so we are cranking out mitochondria that's right that's right there's differences between dividing cells versus non-dividing cells when you have a dividing cell obviously as a function of the eukaryotic cell cycle you need to double the number of mitochondria and then you partition that into two then you double partition so dividing cells have very different mitochondrial turnover dynamics than non dividing tissues like must learn neurons mm-hmm like a hundred other questions I want to ask but I also don't want to I want to get us back to the beginning so that we can set the framework to ask some of these other questions so you alluded to something right which was I believe something that at least for me until very recently I didn't think was challenged or questioned which was the origin of said mitochondria being maternal so presumably in the early 80s when we first we like I had anything to do with it when people far smarter than me sequenced mitochondrial DNA given how few the number of genes were it was not difficult to realize hey this all seems to come from the maternal side not the paternal side and as recently as several years ago that was considered almost an axiom all the DNA and your mitochondria comes from your mother not your father has that been called into question lately have there been exceptions to that I think the textbook teaching is that the mitochondrial DNA is transmitted exclusively maternally and the reason for that is related to this comes back to the egg I'm sure it gets back to the sexual dimorphism that egg is huge it has half a million copies of mtDNA that sperm is tiny it only has a few hundred copies of mtDNA so by sheer dilution it's very difficult for dads MTD need to get transmitted right it's outnumbered half a million to a hundred but on top of that there's actually active mechanisms that will seek and destroy dads mitochondria so the mitochondria coming from the sperm are coded with a protein called ubiquitin so after fertilization those mitochondria are actually actively illuminated by a surveillance program so not only is it very difficult for dad's

[00:42:03] DNA mtDNA to compete with a huge number of MT DNA molecules from mom but those that do make it inside are actively destroyed as well so mechanistically these are the two reasons why empty DNA is passed on almost exclusively from mom to child now with that said about 15 years ago or so there's a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine that took a biopsy of a particular individual and they saw empty DNA molecules with two different appetites and then they looked at the haplotype of the father and they concluded that this was a rare case of paternal transmission so that paper from about 15 years ago was sort of the lone exception to this rule that we accept as an axiom and then about a year ago or so in 2018 another paper merged again claiming that in a few families there is paternal transmission of mtDNA it's a rare event but this is an active area of research rules are made to be broken and I think two things number one I think other people will have to try to replicate these results to make sure that even if they're rare they're real and not some sort of a technical artifact and the number two if they're not technical artifacts I think there's an opportunity to learn something very very deep about the mechanisms of maternal transmission right because that would suggest based on the explanation for how this takes place it's hard to deny that the first ones gonna continue to take place which is just the stochastic sampling but you could you could certainly see scenarios under which the find and kill program malfunctions and therefore you sneak in a little bit of the paternal DNA that's right and in fact in one of these papers that was just published in 2018 they speculated that perhaps there's a mutation on the nuclear genome and I approached that program so that it's possible for dads mtDNA to get transmitted all that that is interesting but I think to the first order approximation we can still assume that mitochondrial DNA is maternal yes so let's talk a little bit about sort of mitochondria 101 so you're you're a first year medical student learning about the mitochondria here's here's basically what you learn right you've got these you've got this inner membrane this outer membrane I forget what the term is that they call it the powerhouse of the cell or something like that if there's some sort of glib term that I know that people who study mitochondria like yourself and deep chendo who I've interviewed sort of bristle at the simplicity of such a term but the idea is all things being equal a cell takes in glucose free fatty acid substrate for energy and let's start with the glucose because well probably spend more time talking about glucose today through what

[00:44:54] I can't even remember ten steps we turn glucose into pyruvate more or less we then basically have a choice a cell has a choice based on the availability of oxygen and the rate at which ATP is being demanded so if oxygen is scarce relative to ATP demand you can take a inefficient route but at least you guarantee to get some ATP which is you can turn the pyruvate into lactate and lactate itself is interesting and maybe we can talk about it but you generate some ATP if the demand for ATP is not as great and there's sufficient cellular oxygen you can take that pyruvate and make acetyl co a and that acetyl co a then becomes one of the substrates leading into this thing called the electron transport chain you alluded to walk us through what happens in that latter scenario I like to think of the mitochondria being a key place where there's energy transformations so in order for a cell to work it needs energy but in the same way that in order to live our lives we need to have one type of battery for our iPhone a different type of a battery for a laptop a different type of a battery for our automobile we need energy packaged in different ways so this is sort of the charm of the mitochondria and what it does is it's gonna take fats and carbohydrates and proteins and it's going to break it up almost like a Kuzon art and as breaking it up it's gonna harness the electrons and that's what's called an electro-motive force that's one type of energy so you're probably familiar with things like the NADH to nad ratio that's basically an electron carrier so that's one form of energy and certain types of enzymes can be powered directly by nadh and nad+ an energy form and that energy form can be used to drive transport so let's explain what that means to people so everybody knows what a battery looks like like literally a Duracell battery that you stick into whatever you know your kids toy and that's typically about 1.5 volts right a 9-volt battery gets its name because it has nine volts but everyone recognizes it as the goofy square one we take this I think for granted because we sort of have these backgrounds in math or engineering and stuff but I think for the average person it's helpful to understand what voltage means and you just alluded to it right it's a potential it's a gradient that is created by disproportionate placement of electrons and it's only with that that you can generate power so why does a battery die why is it that let's pretend

[00:47:45] I'm still using a Walkman all right I put my two 1.5 volt double-a batteries in my Walkman at some point it stops working why at some point it's not gonna be able to hold charge and so I'm probably more familiar with the mitochondrial battery than I am with the doora cell battery but when you have nicely functioning mitochondria you can charge them you can create a nice voltage that can be used for work you can dissipate it you can recharge it but at some point when it gets older when the membrane is a little bit leaky er when it can't it'll stop holding charge so it's that ability to keep a difference in charge across the membranes that is the same reason your little 1.5 volt battery in your Walkman

[00:48:31] I love that I'm saying walkman by the way there's half the people listening this won't actually write out what that means or then 9-volt battery in your detector or frankly the fancy I don't even know how many volts a Tesla battery is it's like 12 volts I'm guessing or something like that in an electric vehicle whatever but there's a reason you have to keep charging these but at some point even when you charge them they cease to work if it's a rechargeable and you race to saying look think of a mitochondria as partially being a battery that's right that's only one form of energy right so that's taking chemical to electric that's exactly right and so you can have an electro-motive force you can have a proton motive force and then you can dissipate that battery to basically catalyze the formation of ATP which most people know is the energy form that's used to power muscle when you exercise so the mitochondrion is doing all of these elaborate energy transformations from electrical potentials to proton potentials to phosphorylation potentials and different enzymes and processes and machines in your cells will use one or the other this is so exciting like I've tried to have this discussion with my daughter who's 10 and she's not quite at the point where she sees why I think this is amazing but she's almost at that point where I guess you can look at a piece of food on the plate and explain why eating that is essential right like where is the energy in that food so maybe we'll use this as sort of the example to go full cycle so you are looking at a cheerio on your plate right now that cheerio is mostly carbohydrate so we'll simplify this and it's got glucose in it it's probably got more complex carbohydrates in it but at a molecular level it's a lot of carbons joined two hydrogen's carbons joined two carbons and carbons join two oxygens and oxygens join two hydrogen's that's probably most of the bonds correct so bonds contain energy there's chemical energy there which of those bonds would be the most energetic probably the carbon hydrogen in total number just given the ubiquity of it right that a carbon hydrogen has more energy than a carbon carbon I'm guessing

[00:50:50] I'm not too sure I think that's the case in the show notes will list what the potential energy is in each of those bonds but nevertheless you go through this process of actually eating the thing you put it in your mouth you break it down mechanically you've broken it by the time it exits your stomach but it's really once it gets absorbed out of the bloodstream that you begin this chemical process of breaking those bonds and then you get something for free right when you break those bonds that's when you're getting the energy to create this electron gradient that's right which you then use at the end basically do this one thing you alluded to which is phosphorylate the ATP so that energy gradient allows you to then put a phosphate back on to an ADP that's the most obvious one from food now you talked about nad and NADH can you say a little bit more about what those are and how they fit into this in particular in the mitochondria again the classical teaching is that nad is an electron carrier when you have two electrons that's gonna be in what's called the

[00:51:54] NADH form and if you don't have those two electrons it's in the oxidized form which is the nad form that's another way of holding the energy that can catalyze reactions what we're learning over the last few years is that in addition to this role as an electron carrier the nad itself can be used as a substrate for other reactions outside of the mitochondria or inside outside of its role as an electron carrier okay and that biggest role for that is in these will come I guess will allude to it but there are these complexes in the mitochondria but that's still as a redox carrier so the electrons go from the

[00:52:33] NADH or transfer to the electron transport chain and that's basically a wire that's going to conduct the electron mm-hmm until they hit oxygen and make water that's a downhill process and during that downhill process these protons are pumped across the inner membrane generating about 150 millivolts and that can then be used to to do work including catalyzing the conversion of

[00:52:57] ADP to ATP and that's what we call oxidative phosphorylation yeah but then talk about the other example that you were using there and this is a newer area of biomedicine and actually David Sinclair has worked in this area quite a bit but everything that I just told you relates to electrons coming on and off of nad so when we talk about any D to nad ratio that's sort of the the redox potential but that any D molecule it can also participate as a substrate in certain chemical reactions so sirtuins use nad exactly sirtuins some of the DNA damage response pathways the parts to let you use the nad as a cofactor so that's important because it's possible in certain states like when you have a damage to cell for example if you have a cell with damaged DNA that nad can decline very very rapidly it's an electron carrier so you're actually losing the ability to carry some of this charge now this is interesting right because observations are as we age these nad levels decline is that due to greater demand for it is it due to reduction in production and of course the clinical question that everybody asks is is there benefit to replacing it what's really interesting is there's a couple of different signatures of aging process so if you biopsy muscle from individuals of varying ages you'll see a gradual decline in the nad content if you quantify the amount of mitochondria using any of the different metrics you'll see a decline if you look at things like vo2 max and skeletal muscle as a function of age you'll see a gradual decline so there's this gradual decline in nad and an mitochondrial activity as a function of age and I think the big question in the field is do you just have an old and sick tissues you have sick mitochondria or will targeting the mitochondria actually somehow alleviate its associated decline in tissue function this is such an interesting question and something that probably until a year ago I don't think

[00:55:13] I spent enough time to think which is what does it mean to age at the level of the mitochondria and what are the implications of it and perhaps most importantly what can be done to slow the rate of Aging now you study a problem at sort of a different node which is you are looking very specifically at diseases that people most people haven't actually heard of and I don't want to say you're not interested in those diseases per se because you are but they're basically a gateway for something else so later on in this podcast I suspect we'll come back to more of this mitochondrial fitness health inflammation my toffee G there are many other topics I want to explore with you but let's now having laid the groundwork go back and talk about your work and what you're learning so give me an example of some of the diseases that you study in your lab we've historically placed a lot of emphasis on a very large collection of individually rare inborn errors of mitochondrial metabolism these are typically single gene disorders they can be due to recessive mutations in the nuclear genome or they can be due to mutations in the mitochondrial genome but at the end of the day there's a component of the mitochondrion that's defective at birth it's what we just spoke about is the fact that as all of us age there's a gradual decline in the activity of mitochondria big question in the field is whether that's cause or consequence these other 300 rare monogenic disorders of mitochondria there's no doubt there's no question the gene did the randomization for you you know cause and effect that's exactly right the mitochondrion is defective at birth and now we can actually evaluate what the consequences you said about 300 what is the phenotypic spectrum how many of these for example are fatal within the first year of life they tend to follow a bimodal distribution the recessive mutations in the nuclear genome they tend to present early in infancy within the first few weeks or months of life the mutations in the mitochondrial genome those tend to present a little bit later in

[00:57:27] Wow so let's focus on the latter group for a moment I mean unless you'd prefer to start with the former which one do you spend more time looking at we spend a little bit more time on the nuclear options because they present earlier and presumably they're more severe that's right okay so give me an example of what some of those mutations are and what their phenotype is one of the clinical syndromes that we study something called lis syndrome so there's about 80 different genes that can be mutated to give rise to this clinical syndrome which is basically a subacute degeneration of the gray matter it's a very rapid neuro degeneration it's a terrible terrible disease and what age are people when they start to experience this neuro degeneration so most of these kids are actually born developmentally

[00:58:11] Wow and then within the first couple of months of life there's some sort of a stressor sometimes it's some sort of an infection sometimes it's a dehydration that'll put them into a neuro metabolic crisis and at that point if you look at their brain of our eyes you'll see lesions in the brainstem the basal ganglia sometimes the spinal cord corresponding to regions of necrosis Wow so quickly fatal and what did you learn

[00:58:38] I mean you have one syndrome but there are many paths that produce it what's the are there common threads to the genetic insults that lead to this awful phenotype no great question that's exactly what we're trying to figure out so thanks to genetics we've not been able to we as a community I mean have been able to map out genes the nuclear genome some of these are the mtDNA but at the end we get this thing called lis syndrome and we're trying to figure out what exactly isn't about the broken mitochondrion that gives rise to this phenotype and honestly we don't know what the full answer is right now but it's a very very active area of research right now it might be naive but just listening to you describe this I can't help but think can we learn something about Alzheimer's disease or other forms of neuro degeneration which I think many people are starting to argue are basically neuronal energy crises so there are lots of insults right you can have an accumulation of toxin you can have insulin resistance frankly you can have microvascular disease all of these things are predisposing people to neuro degeneration and something that they could all have in common is depletion of energy to the neuron which would be perhaps the most sensitive cell to an energy reduction I mean anybody can think about that for a moment if you know somebody who's lost their ability to breathe for a period of time usually the thing we care about the most is their brain because that's the first thing that you suffer from when you have a hypoxic event so is that based on lis

[01:00:15] Center is that the explanation for why you're potentially seeing it disproportionately in the brain versus skeletal muscle is it just the sensitivity of the brain to energy withdrawal or do you think there's something specific about the mitochondria in neurons mitochondrial disorders can actually impact almost any organ system and soli syndrome represents one type of clinical manifestation of mitochondrial disease but there's another set of disorders that impact the skeletal muscle as well

[01:00:46] I think at this point we don't know why mutations in one subunit of the electron transport chain gives rise to brain disease a mutation in the neighboring subunit of the same protein complex that's equally evolutionarily conserved will give rise to muscle disease Wow there's a massive non-linearity over here that we simply don't understand right now so if there is one and only one silver lining in these awful diseases it's that scientists will have no shortage of questions to ask for decades to come no I think this is a super active area of research right now in part fueled by the link between mitochondrial decline and aging so that's such a complicated problem you know trying to understand why a car breaks down after being in service for 25 years it's hard is it at some fanbelt break did the battery stop charging did the tire deflate it's kind of hard to know why our car breaks down after 25 years in these rare minor disorders we have 300 different forms of that automobile that was almost broken at Birth that that makes sense yeah we study them in part because these patients need new treatments and therapies and so that's enough of a motivation for us but we also do expect that a subset of them by studying them will inform what's happening in more common form of aging your lab studies oxygen but not necessarily in the way that most people commonly think about it most people when they think of oxygen and mitochondria something that comes to mind pretty quickly is Ross absolutely I spoke with a friend of mine Navdeep chendo and we spoke a lot about Ross and now I've had a great take on it which was look we think of Ross typically only in the negative and they do lots of negative things but they may also be a signaling molecule and therefore an essential thing talk to me about the lens through which your group looks at oxygen so remember a while ago you asked a very very astute question you have these 80 different genes when they're mutated they give rise to this thing called Li syndrome which is a different type of a neuro degeneration what is that pathology pathogenesis look like the traditional dogma from mitochondrial pathogenesis is that when the powerhouse of the cell is broken there's not enough ATP and there's a power failure that's the traditional dogma and without a doubt there's truth to that in some instances what we've discovered is that in addition to producing ATP mitochondria are also consumers of oxygen most of the oxygen that you breathe Peter is being consumed by your mitochondria when a patient has a birth defect in the mitochondrion in addition to not being able to produce sufficient ATP they also have excess oxygen as well so oxygen delivery tends to be patent in these patients but the utilization ends up being poor and oxygen just asking for people to understand how does oxygen even get to the mitochondria so we all understand that breathing air that has oxygen and let's even go one step further and just take it for granted that there's a gradient in the lung that allows oxygen to get into hemoglobin to a red blood cell now that you have a fully loaded red blood cell in an arterial that enters a capillary how many things have to happen for oxygen to get into the mitochondria specifically not just the cell oxygen is not particularly soluble in water or fluids and so we have an oxygen carrying protein called hemoglobin that's found in our red blood cells and so in the lungs all of the red blood cells and their hemoglobin get loaded with oxygen and now these red blood cells are delivered to peripheral tissues and the oxygen gets extracted from the fluid and as the fluid gets depleted in oxygen the hemoglobin will basically offload its oxygen and so there are certain tissues that become extremely extremely hypoxic so oxygen will get extracted by a tissue largely by diffusion and the mitochondrion is basically consuming most of this oxygen so a cell that is sitting there it doesn't require an active transporter to get oxygen across its outer membrane so it just diffuses across its way when oxygen enters the cytoplasm how does it get over to the mitochondria depending on the cell type either diffuses how does it know that the mitochondria is the place it needs to go well it's being consumed so it's a little bit of a sink basically so that what that's what I want to understand there are lots of places oxygen could hang out so what is the force that is drawing it into the mitochondria is it simply utilization it basically creates a vacuum that's right that's right now in certain tissues like skeletal muscle and heart we have other oxygen carriers in the tissue things like myoglobin are oxygen carriers so they're almost little buffers of oxygen yeah loaders right so

[01:05:56] I think of them as like another storage for oxygen inside yeah that's right but that still has to get off the myoglobin and get sucked into the mitochondria effectively right that's right so it's another little storehouse if you will it's another buffer of oxygen so that when you're exercising for example you may not want to be oxygen limited so you have a little extra oxygen in your myoglobin but basically your mitochondrion is where most of your oxygen is being consumed so it's a sink and so that's the reason that we have gradients inside of ourselves it's amazing I've never really even thought about it this way but it's sort of interesting to think at how efficiently the body disposes of carbon dioxide because as you alluded to earlier the end of that downhill gradient is a final path of electron acceptance generating h2o and co2 both of which we managed to largely off gas so somehow those things have to exit the mitochondria weasel out of the cell cross the gradient and go back to whether in the case of co2 get back to the hemoglobin molecule and get carried back it's like there's a lot of things going on here well so one of the things that we're discovering by studying these rare diseases and this happened because of a crisper screen that we did a couple of years ago but we've what we've now discovered is that one of the consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction is excess unused oxygen so in other words if a mitochondrion is failing to do its job you will be failing to utilize oxygen therefore you would see an excess accumulation of oxygen that's right and we believe this is our hypothesis now it's that some of that excess unused oxygen is what is contributing to the pathology that we see in some of these rare diseases it's a very very different type of an idea it's not all about the ATP it's about excess unused oxygen and we're not necessarily invoking reactive oxygen yeah she's about to say is it through free radicals or is it actually oxygen to oxygen no extra electron oxygen this is dioxygen toxicity that we're talking about the way that I like to think about it is that if you have an automobile that's outside and it's rusting its rusting in part because the oxygen is directly oxidizing iron you may produce a radical but that's not the phenomenon yeah so the car outside is not rusting because of too much superoxide or hydrogen peroxide it's direct oxidation of iron centers by oxygen and so one of our hypotheses is that enzymes are tuned to operate within a particular oxygen range and when the mitochondrion is not functioning properly oxygen levels rise that excess dioxygen can now oxidize enzymes that will damage them as a consequence so it's a very very different way of thinking about mitochondrial pathogenesis now what isn't the body correct for that and note that well the oxygen in the mitochondria is not being utilized as quickly as my evolutionary prediction would allow but therefore we're gonna there's less gradient pressure so I'm gonna off gas i'm gonna offload less oxygen to the cell with subsequent trips through like in other words you almost think this would have been corrected in a few milliseconds well I think it a healthy human that's exactly right we have pretty solid matching of oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization but we're talking about patients that have broken mitochondria so this is one of the things that we're at you're trying to investigate one of the ways that Ron

[01:09:44] Haller at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center has proposed diagnosing patients with mitochondrial disease is to put them on a treadmill measure their oxygen extraction and patients with mitochondrial myopathy s will often have high venous oxygen let's explain that to people because we're gonna talk about vo2 max and you alluded to it so most people associate that test with sort of peak athletic performance but let's talk about what it looks like if I came into your lab and you were doing this you'd hook me up to a device you'd put me on a treadmill you'd make me you know have to do some work to stress the system you'd plug my nose and put a little miserable device in my mouth basically creating a seal that would prevent me from being able to get oxygen or dispose of carbon dioxide in any place other than the gas chamber that is attached to the tube going into my mouth you'd put me at the you know you'd ramp up the speed of the treadmill and you would be measuring essentially two things the amount of oxygen you're putting in and if it's room air we sort of know what that is but more importantly the concentration of oxygen coming out and that difference is what you're talking about it's that extraction now what happens at a normal person when you do this so Peter we actually don't do these types not humans and so yeah but one does this yeah what would normally happen is a what would you be measuring as a normal person works harder and harder in the difference between provided oxygen and returned oxygen so again we don't do these types of studies but in these types of physiological studies that people like Ron Haller other cardiologists will perform they'll look at cardiac output as well as the oxygen tensions on the arterial and venous eyes and so by looking at all of these numbers you can actually figure out quantitatively the number of o2 molecules being delivered as well as those that are being extracted versus those that are being returned to the venous system until you sort of do a mat you can do a mass balance on oxygen effectively that's exactly right that's exactly right and as it turns out in these patients with inherited mitochondrial disease for some reason the cardiac output is high the extraction is low in a healthy individual usually the homeostasis is such that you're not going to be delivering more oxygen than you really need so that homeostasis is somehow broken in these patients with what so that patient would actually have a very high lactate level as well because if they're able to produce the cardiac output but they're not doing it with oxidative phosphorylation they're using their escape valve so they're gonna disproportionately have high lactate levels it's relative to a healthy individual that's right so Ron Haller would actually argue that a high lactate in combination with a high venous oxygen is suggestive of a mitochondrial myopathy there's a researcher at the

[01:12:38] University of Colorado who is looking into this very phenomenon as an early indicator of type 2 diabetes and it's really fascinate I'm gonna be going out there to spend some time with them this summer they've made the observation that in the early stages of insulin resistance the muscle the Skell muscle in particular becomes inefficient at ox foss so you start to see even at baseline even a person sitting at rest their lactate levels could be twice as high as that of a fit individual and of course he came to this through the thinking that if you want to understand that disease of the mitochondria look at the exact opposite look at the fittest people in the world look at you know the endurance athletes and ask the question what do their mitochondria do well and then what becomes the polar opposite of that and then disease now what you were describing is the most extreme example

[01:13:35] I've ever heard of this right absolutely what you're describing is actually very consistent with a series of papers that were published probably in 2003 and 2004 including by myself and collaboration with Leif group and David L childer Ron Khan who used to be the president of a Joslin as well as Gerry Shulman from

[01:13:55] Yale in sreekumar denier at Mayo Clinic all of us had sort of papers at the same time they've adult rulers here right David Altshuler used to be here he's now at vertex oh but he was one of the founders of the Broad Institute but all of us had papers published at about the same time that showed that if you take skeletal muscle from pre-diabetics healthy individuals that have a family history of diabetes but are still healthy they'll all have a reduced number of mitochondria the expression of those 1,000 genes required for mitochondria it's just a little bit lower if you look at any one gene it's not significant but if you look at the entire pathway the entire pathway is down the vo2 max is down so there's a series of papers back in 2003 in 2004 that led to the the mitochondrial hypothesis for type 2 diabetes the big question still to this date almost 1516 years later is is that actually causal for the diabetes or is it just an early epiphenomena there's something else X that lies upstream of the amount of mitochondria and independently the predisposition to diabetes or is that a part of the causal path that's still unanswered to the state and there's nothing in a Mendelian randomization that can answer that question so as you probably know these types of methods are only now becoming possible so we're trying to work on those types of projects right now you need large numbers of heavily genotyped individuals you also need to have nice biomarkers or proxies for mitochondrial function so those are some of the types of things we're trying now because it comes up from time to time do you mind just explaining how Mendelian randomization works and why it's so powerful again this is not an area of my expertise others are much more expert at it than I am but the analogy that they'll often use in describing a

[01:15:57] Mendelian randomization is a little bit like a drug trial so in a drug trial what you'll do is you'll take individuals and you'll randomize them either to a drug arm or a placebo arm and then you'll look for an outcome there's an intervention which is the assignment of the drug or the placebo and then you can actually check to see whether the outcome is correlated to that particular intervention and if you see an effect now that effect is attributable to that intervention because the decision to give the intervention versus the placebo was done randomly if you didn't do it randomly you can't make that assertion that's right that's right now in a Mendelian randomization experiment the idea is that there's a randomization that took place at birth and so if you look at something like LDL levels for example an important question is are LDL levels causal for heart attack or they simply correlative for heart attack so thanks to genetics we have a lot of genetic variants that can help explain the population variation in LDL levels once you have a good solid genetic instrument now what we can do is we can take a very large number of individuals and we can actually draw a bell curve for what their genetic LDL levels must look like we haven't measured LDL in them but from the genetics you can actually come up with a kirpan the population and now you can say let's take this tale they've been randomized to a high genetic level of

[01:17:30] LDL verses of this tale a low genetic level of LDL now let's see what that outcomes are and based on the statistics based on the patterns of correlation you can then make the inference that the LDL is their causal for heart attack or there's no evidence for a causality I am a not a an M R Mendelian randomization jock but my recollection in reading some of the papers about this is the one place that either as an investigator or a consumer of this science where you have to force yourself to look closely as you can be fooled if the randomization of genes meaning if the genes that you're looking at can also control something else that is related to the disease that could have a counterbalancing effect as I correct that I guess that's one place where one has to be quite cautious

[01:18:21] I think there's multiple places were I mean as soon as you have feedback loops you can get phenomenon called reverse causation you can have your genetic instrument also has to be really really good so again this is not my area of expertise so it has to be pursued with with care for sure so there's probably gonna be a fair number of false positive results for all true positive results from Mendelian randomization studies yeah but it is interesting I would love to see the M R when it's done for this particular question because again you know the implications are significant both from the standpoint of preventing chronic disease or risk reduction in chronic disease but also as we try to approach the question the way that you phrased at a moment ago which I really liked which is everybody kind of has the

[01:19:13] Gestalt of that car that just sort of breaks down and sometimes it's attributable to a catastrophic failure sometimes you blow the head gasket in the car and it's that it dies at that moment and it just becomes economically not feasible to put a new head gasket on other times it just gets harder and harder to start until it's just not worth draw iving anymore so taking this to humans how important is mitochondrial health to that process in other words does it become more often than not one of the drivers of this feeling this lack of robustness this lack of stability within the organism and it seems to me that it's it's on the short list of candidates right I mean when this process goes awry you are interrupting one of the more fundamental systems in human biology that affects almost every cell in the body right absolutely I think it kind of cuts both ways because

[01:20:16] I think when other processes in the cell fail I think the mitochondrion is at risk for also failing so it's a highly reactive organelle as well if that makes sense it's gonna be a tough question to fully answer and this is why we like these rare genetic disorders because they teach us about the pathology pathogenesis of the organelle and a few defined modes and the big question for our field is which of those rare diseases which of those rare forms of pathogenesis bears any relevance to the common form of wear-and-tear aging right so there may be a small subset of rare diseases where the fan belt is broken at birth right but it may be the case of the fan belt as it turns out is so resilient you never have to change it and it's rarely the cause of a car breaking down but it could be the case that it's actually a sparkplug right it could be the case that there are certain birth defects with a spark plug is actually not working at birth and as it turns out with wear and tear aging spark plugs have to be replaced and so we have 300 different forms of monogenic mitochondrial disease right you have 300 single point of failures to study and that gives you a beautiful picture of what it looks like some of these are gonna bear no relevance it's a common form of aging that's gonna be a fact but the hope is that a small number of these will bear some relevance to the common of aging and just to be clear we care about these diseases just because these are terrible diseases and we need therapies for them and so that alone is motivation for our work in this area but it's also our hope that studying some of them will provide insights into the common form of aging as well you talked earlier about signatures of time and another one of these signatures of time is inflammation within muscle cells there was a paper that came out about a year ago that used sting to basically block the ability of a cell to sense breakdown in mitochondrial DNA are you familiar with this work I'm a little bit familiar with the sting pathway my understanding it's been about a year since I read this maybe a bit less was that see really if you study muscles as they age you see more and more inflammation so the question is what is drawing inflammatory cells into muscle as we age and the hypothesis was going back to something you talked about earlier the DNA of mitochondria is bacterial in origin and therefore if you have a loose fragment of nuclear DNA in the cell it shouldn't be especially immunogenic but if you have a loose fragment of bacterial DNA in a cell that should actually be quite immunogenic our immune systems would think of that as foreign so the hypothesis was what if the increase in inflammation we see is due to greater and greater mitochondrial damage that is leading to more and more exposure of mitochondrial DNA and I believe to test that it used sting and remind me I think sting actually blocks the ability of the cell to sense the mitochondrial DNA is that correct not just mitochondrial DNA but I think it's a general nucleic acid okay sensor and so there could be different sources I think it could block the sensing of DNA period I think ordinarily it's designed to sense the DNA incoming viruses or incoming pathogens but you could imagine that if a mitochondria rupture is that same DNA nucleic acids can also be sensed and you're right because the mitochondria used to be a bacteria a lot of the components inside of our mitochondria resemble that of modern bacteria and can be very immunogenic I don't know if you follow there's a study that came out of the beth israel deaconess a few years ago on sterile crush injury and as a former surgeon you probably appreciate it but the observation was that when you had an enclosed crush injury so skin has not been surrounded right there's a massive inflammatory response so this investigator was actually trying to figure out what the inflammatory nightís was did a lot of fractionation and ultimately figured out that there was some mitochondrial derived molecules and I believe that they found that the mitochondrial DNA as well as something called formylated peptides are highly inflammatory just remember those 13 proteins that are made by the mtDNA the translation of those 13 proteins resembles the translation of bacterial proteins and bacterial protein translation doesn't begin with a methanol tyranny it begins with the formal but I know tyranny remember this yeah this is my god I feel like I'm back in medical school can you just just for no other reason than for me to remember that let's go through that so your your

[01:25:13] DNA makes your messenger RNA your messenger RNA then moves over to be translated and to actually have the amino acids put in place to resemble the code that's being said so talk about where the meth terminal and shows up there in you and I in eukaryotes protein translation begins with thiamine residue in bacteria it's not a simple methionine but it's a it's a modified molecules called formyl methionine and first order approximation it's almost a signature of a bacterial derived protein and we actually have receptors that are designed to detect formylated peptides it's a sign of some sort of an infection now as it turns out our mitochondria have bacterial origins as we have discussed earlier so these 13 proteins they still begin with the formal meth I mean presumably they can get away with it under normal circumstances because they reside within the mitochondria they're protected and shielded from the immune system that's right so in certain injuries right this can actually escape and you can basically activate the same inflammatory pathways that we have that are ordinarily designed to detect incoming pathogens I can't wait to actually find that paper so that was who is the author on that I forget his name but he's from the Beth Israel Deaconess it was less urgent Oh 203 ish no no this is probably within the last about five years okay well we'll find that paper and link to it but basically that paper and the paper I was referring to from about a year ago which I think was in science both point to a similar conclusion which is you can have a profound influence by simply damaging the mitochondria and both of them would point to consistent plausible explanations which are the body confusing the contents for bacterial contents I think it's a very reasonable hypothesis which then begs the question if we believe that the aging inflammation phenotype is not beneficial how do we prevent mitochondrial breakdown as we age I mean this becomes one of the key aging questions right if you believe that and again I don't know what the best analogy is but sparkplug failure plays a role more often than not in the overall picture of decline the longer you can protect those things preserve those things the better another way to evaluating the causality question is if we had a drug that could somehow rejuvenate mitochondria then you could ask the question does directly intervening on this organelle you know the aging process and unfortunately as of right now we don't have that type of a magic bullet but exercise is one of the best ways of turning over bad mitochondria and inducing the biogenesis of good mitochondria but the challenge of course this exercise does there's lots of things you know now that said we always this is one of the differences between I think being a scientist and a doctor when you're wearing your doctor hat you just have to know what to do for that patient in that moment and it's a luxury to know how and why it were right so when we think about the importance of exercise I've always found it ironic that I probably classify or qualify as an exercise addict like in the true unhealthy sense of the word you know I probably meet all the criteria of addiction and all of that stuff but up until recently I don't think I really appreciated the value of exercise I think it was honestly just something I did out of my neurotic pathology but I actually I think if asked would have said that nutrition played a much greater role in health sleep played a much greater role in health and then exercise you know I mean it's it's great but you know if you I'd rather you eat well and exercise a lot or something to that effect I'm certainly revisiting that and of course I also find it silly to do these sort of zero-sum games like it has to be one or the other Road you know presumably doing all of these things well is the optimal strategy but the deeper I look at exercise and I'd love to know your framework for this because I'm still trying to create one

[01:29:34] I'm putting exercise very loosely into three buckets strength training very specific aerobic training so this would be maximum mitochondrial output with minimal generation of lactate and then anaerobic training where you are basically demanding ATP at such a rate that you are really running through that lactate production pathway do you think that's a reasonable framework to of buckets of exercise do you do divide them even more granularly as you think about it mechanistically we're really not exercise physiologists I don't think

[01:30:08] I can comment and just personally do you think of it in a way like that I think that's very reasonable you know just in hearing you talk I mean again we're not aging researchers but it's all asking you a question if that's okay as anyone actually you know people have given metformin to mice they've given rapamycin to mice but has anyone given mice those three flavors of exercise to determine what the impact is on longevity yeah I believe those experiments have been done and I believe all of them show benefit I'd have to go back and look at the literature in mice in fact I'm the process of just starting to work on to that chapter in a book that I'm writing the problem is I generally bias against heavy mice literature but you at least have the advantage of control so the short answer is definitely each of those as a medication right if you think of each of those as a pill each of those produce a longevity phenotype where it gets challenging I think in humans is well I think there are so many ways to die when you get old that for example accidental death would rank in the top five causes of death for people over the age of 60 now the type of accident can change around but by the time you're in your eighth or ninth decade falling becomes such a significant cause of death due to the frailty of the individual that some of that exercise for example strength training almost assuredly offers protection from that type of death so the question is I think it's a little hard to tease out how much of that benefit is in the cardio metabolic side versus otherwise the other thing that's really challenging and studying humans is we don't have really good prospective studies in anything that resembles a longevity phenotype so you are now stuck using something I think I recently described as the most servile trash ever shat into civilization which is epidemiologic questionnaires to try to impute based on you know you telling me how you've exercised over the past 10 years how that's going to predict your longevity phenotype and again the problem there is the dose matters the specificity the quantity the quality these things matter and they're very difficult to tease out from these retrospective views so I think the evidence is very compelling that exercise matters and that's maybe less the question I'm interested in I think what I'd love to gain insights into and we may have to rely on non-human models is just as we now can tailor a drug to do something very specific can we tailor our exercise to be as optimal as possible so if you took an individual who said Peter look I'm willing to exercise five hours a week or I'm willing to exercise ten hours a week but

[01:33:15] I'm not going to be a professional athlete how do I take those five hours a week or ten hours a week or whatever it is and make the best use of it to impact all causes of mortality meaning reduction of the risk of atherosclerosis cancer neoplasm neurodegenerative disease and accidental death from you know strengthening the exoskeleton so that's clinically the question I'm most interested in as it pertains to exercise but I'm convinced that at the center of that question is understanding the role of exercise in mitochondrial health I think this is a very important piece of the puzzle and certainly much more important than I appreciate it even two years ago I think what you described about these age-appropriate or age acknowledged declines in vo2 max mitochondrial density mitochondrial efficiency Venus o to concentration I think there's something really important there and even if exercise is affecting something upstream that is affecting that at least we have a great proxy through which to measure I think there's going to end up being a lot of really interesting nonlinear dynamics of mitochondria as a function of age as a function of exercise there's a few vignettes I'll share as you probably know if you don't use your skeletal muscle you lose lean muscle mass you lose your mitochondria very quickly how quickly you have measurable defects in the vo2 max after 10 days of hospitalized bed rest and to recover the vo2 max that you lose in 10 days it takes about six weeks or so oh my god yeah I knew it was bad he knows that bad so there's quite a bit of hysteresis over here right quite a bit of hysteresis so it's going to be complex and nonlinear the programs that turn on mitochondria during exercise they're really elaborate and the idea that you replacing it in a pill may end up being kind of naive I think that exercised us so many things simultaneously it's like 17 different inputs into the system and it may be the case that it's only if those 17 inputs are provided with the right dynamics and the write-off rates that you get properly functioning more mitochondria in certain disease states some of the muscle disorders that I study the ragged red fiber that you may remember from your board exams the ragged red fiber represents an accumulation of poorly functioning Moya cond Rhea so I think that if you try to bottle up just two of these factors or three these factors we may be able to produce more malfunctioning mitochondria but it could be the case that we've evolved to require 17 inputs provided at the right time and place in order to get proper might of biogenesis it's a really really smart program this ptc one alpha program because it simultaneously turns on mitochondrial biogenesis while also turning on some of the tofu g programs and so you're actually turning over your bad mitochondria while you're turning on your good mitochondria simultaneously and that's what happens with exercise well let's you read my mind and I don't know if you could read my little notes

[01:36:28] I'm taking over here because as we're talking I'm making little notes of things I want to ask you and that's exactly where I wanted to go which was let's talk about what etaf AG means in the context of mitochondria so people who listen to this podcast know that I'm a big fan of fasting periodic fasting because even though we don't have great ways to measure a toff eg clinically I think we have pretty good evidence that periods of really strict fasting meaning exclusively consuming water for some period of time my hypothesis is three to seven days produces meaningful etaf adji but how does exercise impact that based on what you've seen in the mitochondria so I don't know too much about fasting but when you do have proper exercise regimes what we observe is that there are transcriptional programs with multiple inputs some of which we discussed earlier but those are probably not that will basically turn on all 1000 of those proteins to produce more mitochondria but that same program is also saying hey let's turn over some of the previously produced mitochondria so it's a very very smart system it's not gonna just produce more good mitochondria in the presence of bad mite as it'll actually cleanse the system as well and remind me what you said I know you already answered this I apologize when you look at cells that are not turning over quickly so Maya sites neurons what did you say was the approximate turnover of mitochondria probably a few days a few days unbelievable so it's just this is a an unbelievable amount of work to create the new and systematically and selectively discard and recycle the old that's right that's right and the signals given that you like exercise

[01:38:10] I'll tell you one study that I thought was really provocative and maybe you already know it but it came from I think Michael wrist ow and Ron Kahn about 10 to 12 years ago in PNAS you know this study I don't I don't think I did we keep going as a human study okay they 2x2 matrix they randomized humans either to exercise or no exercise and and the oxidants or no antioxidants yes okay I know this study but please keep going no this is great so which of the four quadrants do you think is best I know the answer is I want you to yeah you keep going yeah yeah so most people would probably get those who would say exercise with antioxidants must be the optimal health absolutely and what this study showed that was a little bit counterintuitive is that antioxidants on top of exercise almost prevents or racist some of the beneficial effects of exercise and the authors concluded that things like reactive oxygen species are probably playing an important signaling role as well that helps in the adaptation you need some of those sparks in order to turn on new programs that are net beneficial so if you erase those sparks yet you prevent the full benefit of exercise so just another reason why the entire system is so complicated I mean I think investigating exercising again we don't do that that's not a core scientific focus of our laboratory but so many diseases ultimately their risk is reduced by exercise so studying it as should be a very important objective for all of us it's so interesting because that's a that is a great example I'm glad you brought that up and Navin eyed that we didn't talk about that study we talked a lot about this issue of blocking Ross and how if one has cancer for example the evidence is becoming pretty clear that the last thing you want to do in a cancer patient is give them an antioxidant as sort of anti sort of dogmatic as that would seem because the

[01:40:13] Ross actually play an important role in selectively targeting a cancer felt itself versus a non cancer cell listening to these discussions makes you almost wonder how in the world does any drug show up with a benefit in longevity it's it's almost a miracle that rapamycin can so ubiquitously across so many species extend life when as you point out most of the things that do the heavy lifting in longevity have 17 prongs that can't be replicated by a single molecule I mean it just it seems impossible the one that has me very interested right now and I again I don't know how much you've studied this my guess is even if you haven't just your peripheral knowledge will exceed that of anybody's is metformin so like anything most people listening to this podcast know a lot about it I had a interview with NIR Barzilai who I'm also having lunch with today and Neer's certainly one of the world's experts on this topic so we had a great discussion of all of the benefits of metformin don't think it's really disputable how big those benefits are in people who have diabetes

[01:41:21] I think that is becoming very clear and then by extension in people who are insulin resistant what I think is not entirely clear and I think is the purpose of what NIR is hoping to study with tame is if you took a non diabetic non insulin resistant individual and gave them metformin will you enhance their longevity phenotype and the one area that I'm most interested in this question is what is the impact of metformin on the ability of exercise to improve the phenotype and that's something that just on a personal level I've been experimenting with a lot so doing a lot of lactate testing on myself with and without metformin and using lactate as a proxy for mitochondrial function so you know we were talking about this a little bit before but just for the listeners of what I do is take a resting lactate level I shouldn't be using any more ATP that I'm using at this moment what is my level of lactate then on a bicycle that allows me to control the wattage to the nearest watt basically move in five or 10 watt increments slowly you know spend ten minutes at this wattage go up by five for ten minutes go up by five for ten minutes and keep measuring lactate levels and you generate a performance curve in LP see a lactate performance curve and you do this with and without that Foreman you see a difference the question is does that difference matter clinically and is it possible that metformin is actually not helping in the context of exercise are you seeing that in the presence of metformin if you are exercising you're producing less Lak theater I'm seeing more lactate in the presence of metformin now again this is an N of one study on myself but it makes sense that you could I mean that's a plausible how are you measuring your lactate using blood in the finger yeah we should do metabolomics on you I mean with our new instrumentation we can measure not just lactate but literally measure every hundreds of new blades it gives a little bit more of a comprehensive snapshot of all of your metabolic to please could we get an IRB to do that easily let's do it I'm doing it all in so we could do it we could do an on metformin off metformin snapshot because so here's my crude thinking on this is if metformin is inhibiting complex one it wouldn't be beyond the realm of possibility that the body might preferentially not shuttle pyruvate into the mitochondria I mean it's still doing so to a great extent but if it's disproportionately keeping pyruvate outside and turning it into lactate that could drive up lactate levels the thing that surprised me the most is how high my resting lactate levels seemed to be I mean I remember before I started taking metformin you would barely check a resting lactate level but it was usually below 1 millimolar now my resting lactate level on metformin is typically between 1 and 2 millimolar it's about 2 X and I'm doing this in as painful and but hopefully valid away as one can do it which is I'm using two separate meters checked in duplicate on the third drop of blood like I'm trying to be his systemic as possible anyone listening to this who wants to do this I just want to warn you in advance before you get started lactate meters are upsettingly expensive and the strips are the racket I mean they'll sell you the device for 300 bucks and each strip costs you about $5 so every time I do one of these dumb tests which I typically do about once a week it's like dinner and a movie for five people but you'll be amazing to see what a broader sequence of metabolomic looks like to understand is there something that's happening and by the way then the next question is do that in somebody who has diabetes and see if you see an improvement or a reduction in performance you measured your fasting resting lactate before you started med form and do you know if it went up after you started metformin and it went back down again or well so that's an interesting question so before I started taking metformin I would do lactate testing but I was interested in a different question so it's not an apples to apples comparison we always had a resting lactate just because you wanted to basically calibrate the Machine and make sure your machine was working but generally when we did what the what was called this LP see the lactate performance curve it was mostly geared towards identifying a different position on the curve which is very crudely done but you do a series of efforts at different power outputs or in a swimming pool at different speeds or on a track different running velocities and you'll notice that the curve is nonlinear so it starts like this I'm sort of drawing it goes flat and then it starts to ask them to it starts to shoot up for a quick towards a vertical asymptote that if can be approximated by two linear curves and the intersection of that curve is generally a person's lactate threshold and that's different that's usually a higher number than two millimolar let's just say to make the math easy that usually is in about the four millimolar range and it's that point where that corresponds to on the x axis that output is generally about the fastest velocity or output a person can hold for a certain type of race that we were interested in studying so I have infinite numbers of those data for myself back in the you know days long before I took him at Foreman but it was undeniable how low my lactate level started so I at least have that data point I think that's really interesting we published a paper in PNAS a couple of years ago where we placed either healthy individuals or patients with mitochondrial disease on a treadmill at a 10-minute exercise test and then drew their blood at rest peak exercise and post recovery just to look at am at a balloon response to exercise so of course we get lactate and the Myto patients some of whom have complex one deficiency not because of metformin yes of a genetic deficiency they begin with a high resting lactate and there's a parallel rise in their locked date that that parallels what happens to a healthy human and it stays high parallel with the healthy individual post recovery do you remember offhand how high their resting lactates were relative to the non insulted it was single-digit millimolar it wasn't sky-high I want to say something like 2 3 4 millimolar but we should look that up just to confirm but it'd be interesting to see this is purely science now talking to you is whether we could repeat that exact same study not with genetic complex one deficiency but we can do Stormin right exactly yeah you know a lot of people ask me about metformin and aging and again we don't do aging real aging research center or lab we hope to be able to impact that through some of our work and I'm hoping that my questions are like prompting you to celebrate your yeah you your you've got all these amazing tools to study it right absolutely it really of a space that really captures anyone's imagination but if you ask me how I think metformin is working I think it's probably related to the body's homeostatic response to complex one inhibition so of course metformin hits complex one I think that's undeniable it may have other targets but without a doubt it hits complex one when complex one has been blocked the body senses it there's a feedback loop there's a homeostatic response and that's probably what if net protective or helpful and it may be the case that throwing a wrench in a complex one it turns on 15 of those 17 inputs that you need to sort of rejuvenate not just your mitochondria but other parts of your cell as well I think there's some really interesting experiments and worms as you probably know there's quite a bit of worm longevity work and there's early studies by my MGH colleague Gary ruffian as well as Cynthia Kenyon who was at

[01:49:30] UCSF innocent hour calico they did RNA i screens to basically look for genes which when disrupted would lead to a longevity phenotype in one of the one of the gene sets that was most associated with a longevity phenotype was the mitochondrial electron transport chain at the same time one of the gene sets that was associated with a drastically reduced lifespan was the mitochondrial electron transport chain right you can ask the question it was a different subset of genes obviously there's about 90 genes total required for the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation so the question is why do loss of some of them lead to longevity and why do loss of others lead to a shortened lifespan one hypothesis is that it's just the strength of the allele if you some of those RNAi eyes really wiped out the electron transport chain probably led to early death of the worm but if you just gently block the electron transport chain with the right

[01:50:32] RNA i alleles perhaps mimicking what metformin does you do get a longevity phenotype so a this is in the field I'm not alone but I think there's others in the field that think that maybe one of the ways I met Foreman works is sure it does block the electron transport chain but then it comes back and cause us an entire adaptive but we're a homeostatic response and isn't that an adaptive at the whole organism level I'm not gonna put you on the spot and ask you if he thinks people should take metformin I think the broader question is do you think based on what you've seen in the e.t.c models that it's quite possible that a drug like metformin can be beneficial to some and harmful to others oh I think without a doubt I mean we know that metformin is useful for type 2 diabetes so I think it's a fact that for a subset of the population metformin is helpful and beneficial you know in a rare subset of cases you can actually have fatal lactic acidosis from drugs related to metformin things like then for me right which is more potent that's exactly right that gets back to this idea of the potency or the allylic strength of inhibition of the electron transport chain but if you took that acute toxicity aside I mean I think this is really the question I've now become fixated on if you take somebody who is already maximizing the benefits of exercise nutrition sleep these things that I think the more we look at them the more powerful they are it's one thing to say the addition of metformin offers minimal benefit or incremental benefit it would be another thing if you're more in the Ross category that you alluded to earlier is this actually undoing some of the benefit that's why I actually think that the experiment that you and I just discussed a few minutes ago trying to see what the cross-product of exercising that form and look like I think it could be totally fascinating is it going to look like the wrong constant from a decade ago where there is at least one experiment out there that suggests that but again I don't know how deep they look at this so this is a very interesting idea I'm the only drawback of this idea means I have to keep coming back to Boston now we're entering the right time of year to do it so that's right that's right yeah yeah so changing gears from the role of hypoxia is a therapeutic I mean based on what you see in the mitochondria how do you see that as a potential therapeutic option this is something that we're really excited about on the preclinical level and I really want to emphasize this Peter because oxygen follows the Goldilocks principle right I mean too little is absolutely fatal deadly what we're discovering is that too much in certain instances genetic backgrounds can be damaging as well and so all of our work to date has been focused in preclinical models one of the things that we are discovering in these rare mitochondrial disorders is that a lot of the ATP levels are actually nicely defended by glycolysis and so although the textbook

[01:53:41] Dogma is that a lot of these disorders or disorders of energy deficiency under resting conditions ATP levels are okay but what we're observing is high unused oxygen and important question is how can we now try to interdict and somehow try to reduce the delivery of oxygen so in least in our mouse models we're using hypoxia chambers we actually dilute the air that the mice breathe with nitrogen we use some of the devices that the sports industry has created nitrogen generators face masks tents we place the mice in those apparatus dilute the air with nitrogen and then we evaluate the impact and at least in some not all some of our mouse models of mýto disease the benefits are striking let's explain again just why this is so profound right so going back to the model you described earlier in a subset of clinical scenarios where mitochondrial function for lack of a better word is impaired you're seeing a much higher level of oxygen returned to the lungs despite a high output of energy imputing that their mitochondria simply aren't working that high amount of oxygen itself can be problematic so you're saying well rather than putting you in an environment where the ambient oxygen concentration is 21% we're going to lower that how much do you lower that - by the way in these tents with the mice at sea level we're typically breathing about 21% oxygen we reduce it down to about 11% how is that I don't know much about my altitudes but that strikes me is really low is that like the top of Mount Everest low it's not

[01:55:22] Everest it's probably base camp so it's 18,000 feet Everest is what 7% may be exactly exactly so we're talking about certain parts of Bolivia we're talking about Mont Blanc yeah yeah but my brother's been to base camp and he did something really funny which is something only my brother would do he typed out a series of questions for himself that at sea level the answers to which are patently obvious 10 questions and at 10,000 feet and 15,000 feet and then at base camp is 18 and then I think when he was there they ended up not being able to cross the ice walls but they could still get to like 21,000 and then I got at 21,000 feet he would video himself answering these questions and it was actually quite interesting not just the huffing and puffing that invariably goes into it but the length of time it took him to think of the answers which when you consider the fact that he was answering the same questions in over ever again it should have been the opposite it should have been easier and easier and easier to come up with what year did such-and-such happen or whatever that's no joke right I mean that's still for many people quite a deficit so how did they improve earlier in the conversation we're talking about this disease called Li syndrome so with a mouse model of Li syndrome it's actually due to a loss of one of the subunits of complex one so it's a recessive loss of one of them nuclear subunits of a complex one and this mouse is born looking okay it's a developmentally okay but then right around date 3035 it starts looking sick and by day 55 it'll basically fulfil our hospitals euthanasia criteria its lost body weight it's become hypothermic it's very very sick it has lesions on brain

[01:57:02] MRI is there anything in its periphery that looks lesion or is all of the insult of the brain this initial cause of death is probably brain driven and if you look carefully other tissues are affected as well so that's what happens at 21% oxygen there's a very stereotyped trajectory these uniformly fatal at about day 55 or day 60 if these mice are grown at 11% instead of 21% they now survive to about a median of one year oh my god so you've you've restored them to half their normal lifespan that's right and what's their function level how do they interact are they do they act like normal mice up until then when we were doing these experiments a very talented former graduate student she's now at

[01:57:46] UCSF and our lab manager over at MGH they're doing these experiments they actually thought that there's a genotyping error because the mice looked so good we actually thought that we'd miss genotype them and so they look they look great they put on body weight they put on body temperature so the results are striking but again I want to emphasize that this is all an animal model still if you're a parent who one day has a child born with this condition to think that the answer could be your child instead of living a few months could live into their 40s or 50s by moving to a part of the world which would be the easiest way to accomplish this I don't think it would make sense to live at sea level and wear an oxygen deprivation mask for your entire life but if the answer is guess what you're gonna go be a Sherpa I mean that's unbelievable to think of I mean that's I would not have predicted that at all based on what we've discussed that it could be that strong in effect well what's interesting is in the past people that she proposed hyperbaric oxygen as a way of rejuvenating that was my take on that's what I would have stupidly suggested also which is wait a minute we got to try harder to get that oxygen in there let's go hyper back so have you done that in the mice and the mice died even faster under hyperbaric conditions so we didn't try hyperbaric because that's higher pressure but we just tried hyperox okay okay so we went up to 55% which is what is often given in the operating room as an example the mice will die within a few days of exposure to 55% oxygen so there's something about having what about hyperbaric at 21% we second try we haven't tried that yet but just hyperox 'ok at 55% these mice will die within a few days of exposure

[01:59:26] Peter within a few days of us publishing that paper we actually got phone calls from across a country of cases where patients that run the outpatient had been placed on hyperbaric chambers and then they actually ended up you know in some cases dying within 24 hours or going blind and a good eye within 24 hours and so I think there's some anecdotes that suggest that super high oxygen levels on a broken electron transport chain can be very damaging in humans as well well this is sort of interesting right because I'm the cancer front people have talked about hyperbaric oxygen being a very potent tool because the mitochondria of cancer cells are going to be defective on balance relative to the non cancer cells that's again outside of your wheelhouse but how do you think about hyperbarics in terms of a tool to selectively target cancer mitochondria we're super excited about it and in fact we're really not a cancer biology lab but there is a subset a very very rare subset of tumors where we're currently exploring that idea I think others have thought about trying to starve cancers of their oxygen and glucose our idea is the exact opposite maybe in certain instances you want to flood them with oxygen do you have a sense of which cancers in humans might be more or less susceptible to that pressure we're looking into that now but it's gonna be a rare subset of cancers where there may be some mitochondrial mutations to begin with so in other words it might be less about the given histology and more so you know it's funny I talked to Keith Flaherty recently and this is a great example of targeted therapy and cancer right imagine you have your tumor you get it sequenced and you realize oh look you you have a tumor whose mitochondria are especially weak you are a great candidate for hyperbaric oxygen person B over here the mitochondria your cancer cell look perfectly fine hyperbaric oxygen if anything is not going to do at best it's gonna do nothing and worse it might actually harm your other cells we've looked a little bit into this literature we have an oncologist in our laboratory that's looking in this direction and hyperbaric oxygen has definitely been proposed as a cancer therapy in the past but there been mixed signals and exactly as you're saying it may be the case that if you know how to precisely target it maybe you'll see a real signal anything else in your work have you thinking about cancer beside this is a great example is there anything else that you think about with respect which you've learned and how it pertains to cancer prevention or treatment with a series of projects about five six years ago or so where some of the guys in the laboratory were looking at turf ohmic datasets from large numbers of cancers just asking what are the most consistently altered metabolic pathways in cancer so there's about 1,500 metabolic enzymes encoded by the human genome which one is the most upregulated or downregulated across all cancers and that pan-cancer analysis it wasn't a mitochondria focused analysis to be clear but it revealed a few mitochondrial enzymes in the folate pathway that are the most consistently up regulated enzymes across all cancers so the mitochondrion is a powerhouse of the cell it does produce ATP but it's also a biosynthetic machine as well so there's a few pathways within the organelle that are designed to produce one carbon units for growth folates things like that that pathway was highly highly up regulated it gave rise to the seductive idea that maybe mitochondria are not being used for energy in cancer but rather as biosynthetic machines for cancer so that was an idea that you know we and others stumbled upon about five six years ago or so but it's not an active area of research in our lab what's interesting cuz it's very consistent with other hypotheses that the Warburg effect is less a deficit of the cancer cell due to defective mitochondria or inability to undergo ox foss and maybe the Warburg effect is the result of a cancer cell wanting to get a higher throughput of substrate to foster growth obviously Matt Vander Heiden was the author on a paper that talked about that in several years ago about 2009 it hadn't heard the folate story so that that's kind of yet another really interesting point single carbon biology is pretty interesting stuff that's right that's right and several investigators like Josh Rabinowitz David Sabatini our group had dinner with David last night great yeah we talked we actually were talking about single carbon metabolism and the challenges

[02:03:59] I went to med school with Josh by the way oh wow yeah yeah Wow okay yeah so actually the three of us about five six years ago or so we all had sort of independently stumbled upon this mitochondrial pathway as being dramatically upregulated Josh with metabolome makes David with RNA I us with computation and I think to this date there's a lot of data that supports the idea that business upregulated in cancers now where they're targeting it is going to be beneficial that's an open question still but without a doubt this is one of the pathways that is powerfully upregulated in cancer states on the topic of cancer and we've talked about these other chronic diseases but it doesn't really appear that there is a chronic disease in which the mitochondria remain normal if you look at cancer if you look at Alzheimer's disease if you look at atherosclerosis and if you look at type C diabetes all of these diseases have mitochondrial signatures that differ from what we would consider healthy well it gets back to the opening parts of the discussion where we said that if you take any age of tissue is gonna be associated with dysfunctional mitochondria and if you take diabetic muscle if you take

[02:05:04] Alzheimer's brain parkinson's brain you're gonna see dysfunctional mitochondria and this is why it gets back to it's a cause or effect or is it going to be some complex non linear combination of cause and effect and this is where using that systems biology approach or trying to gain insights from these rare diseases may inform a subset but not not all of these actually think that for parkinson's the the causal hypothesis is pretty compelling out of all of these disorders say more about that because i i don't know anything about parkinson's that i didn't learn in medical school which if i recall is more to do with dopamine secretion out of a part of the brain that the substantia is that it where you basically lose that doesn't know yeah and so the patients that maybe start out with genetically fewer of those because there's a distribution of how many you get maybe the ones most susceptible I'd never thought of that as a problem that shows up in the mitochondria so expand on that again we have two classes of disorders right we have sort of common complex diseases and we have monogenic diseases and the big question is does the pathology we see in the rear monogenic forms bear any relevance right to the common forms of disease it's funny I mean the way we're talking about it your hands are showing it in a way that I think is is representative right you had your one hand out over here and you said look these are the very simple monogenic diseases most people have never heard of them they're typically quite brutal but they kill relatively few people on the other hand you have there's a divide right that's right and it's like it's it's quite discontinuous isn't it well also on this side you know the prevalence of these monogenic mitochondrial disorders is about one in 4,000 but then as you cross the continuity evelyn's is one and one yeah exactly and then you have these other disorders like type 2 diabetes and

[02:06:57] Parkinson's and Alzheimer's that it's not 1 in 1 but it's also not 1 in 4,000 so you're saying Parkinson's maybe the closest example that you you can think of it's spanning this these two worlds I think so ok I want to hear more about this well I think there's a couple of couple of reasons one is if you take you know the common form of Parkinson's disease and if you take some of the post-mortem material the biopsy that or if you take post-mortem material and you look you let you see mitochondrial lesions you'll see an increase in a mutation burden in the mitochondrial genome you'll see complex one deficiency already we're seeing some of the molecular features of mitochondrial dysfunction but perhaps even more compelling is that there are some talks and forms of Parkinson's certain types of herbicides and insecticides are actually toxic to complex one so you're saying there are people who have

[02:07:50] Parkinson's and I apologize for my ignorance on this where they don't actually have a dopamine deficiency in the brain but they have a Parkinson's like phenotype purely from an insult to their mitochondria from say a toxin right so in these instances what we think has happened is that because of a environmental pesticide or insecticide the mitochondrion has been poisoned in some of these dopaminergic neurons and those neurons actually die so there is a dopamine loss I see I see okay but the root cause is the mitochondria right right so so that's toxin evidence where we know that a direct toxin to the mitochondria in humans can give rise to a parkinsonian like disease in mouse models if you give a high dose of wrote known as that it's a complex one poison okay in this actually gets back to the med form exactly so if you infuse into a mouse rotenone which is a very potent more potent than fen form and yes I mean and there's some potential off-target effects this like micro molar or millimolar potent micro molar plan singer it may hit other things like microtubules as well but it definitely hits complex one of the electron transport chain that's been used as a model of Parkinson's disease mm-hmm in rats and in mice and so I think between the talks and evidence the fact that sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease can be associated with complex when deficiency or myocardial mutations

[02:09:20] I think helps to support the idea that mitochondrial dysfunction can play maybe in the causal path for Parkinson's disease are you optimistic that we are going to be able to target mitochondrial proteins as therapies I mean the more I listen to this the less optimistic I am truthfully just because of the exceptions being exceptions and not rules

[02:09:50] I'm actually pretty wildly optimistic okay that's great because I'm coming away like discouraged like there are too many moving pieces to be able to use a single molecule so are you thinking of stacking molecules or attempt tell me where your optimism comes from well like it comes from the fact that five years ago in some of these mouse models or cellular models so we had zero ways of alleviating mitochondrial disease in a dish or in a mouse now we have in our laboratory we can use and again in a preclinical way we can use hypoxia and it actually helps to restore cellular function and longevity and health span in mouse models of mido disease we're using other approaches that are evolutionarily inspired we call these protein prostheses where we take proteins from other organisms from other kingdoms of life we transplant them into human cells with mitochondrial disease and we can effectively rescue the cells and so what about how do you how do you transfer all the cells or are you just saying that you can just you're just do that you're doing this ex-vivo this is all ex vivo right now right but still it's a proof of concept that's very powerful I mean nowadays we have nucleic acid therapeutics gene therapeutics protein therapeutics so so give me an example of one of the protein prosthetics getting back to the earlier part of the conversation we spoke about the fact that the electron transport chain was probably one of the earliest features of the early eukaryotes probably resembling the electron transport chain of bacteria that can do oxidative phosphorylation but then during reductive evolution certain organisms lost parts of their electron transport chain now there are certain organisms that have lost their entire electron transport chain and we think that one of the ways that they're able to survive is that they gained a new protein that basically complements part of the activity of the electron transport chain so we've identified some of those proteins if we place those proteins in a human cell you can poison the mitochondria at any of five different ways and the cell will still proliferate because it has our protein that evolutionarily we believe allowed that organism to lose its etc' to begin with does that make sense yeah hide it just seems too good to be true well this is why we call it a prosthesis it's not a hundred percent fix of the solution what it does is it probably corrects part of the redox imbalance and the electron transport chain but not the full proton pumping capabilities yeah so so play this forward you you now could argue another treatment for type 2 diabetes is in addition to making the changes we're gonna make right because I still believe deep down that you can cure type 2 diabetes with corrective exercise and nutrition and sleep I think you if you get those three things fully optimized type-2 diabetes goes away with the exception of the late stage cases where the pancreas no longer works but what if you could add another layer to that which oh by the way here's some mitochondrial prosthesis that's exactly right it's not gonna fix all of the functions it like our dreams but it can become additive to other things that's right that's right that's one of the ideas that we're exploring right now can we actually in the context of things like fatty liver and diabetes can we use some of these mitochondrial protein prosthesis to either augment or bypass some of the broken functions of mitochondria to restore function I don't know if you've ever thought of this because the idea just popped into my head when you said mitochondrial protein prostheses have you ever thought just in sort of random sci-fi like thinking of the opposite which is performance-enhancing prosthesis for mitochondria I mean if you think about the efforts that athletes can go to to enhance aerobic performance the most obvious of these of course is blood doping and use of EPO which simply deliver more oxygen to the system but in 30 years will people be talking about genetic cheating where mitochondrial performance and function has been enhanced well it's funny because the sports industry is so often

[02:13:56] I mean the sort of underground elissa sports world of doping often is so ahead of the medical world it's actually pretty amazing yeah it really is I mean one of the compounds it's like ebo it's called FG for 592 it's a small molecule that blocks one of the prolyl hydroxylase is missing it tricks the system into thinking about its hypoxic and you end up producing more Ipoh that drug was in clinical trials and before the drug was even approved it was being used by cyclists which is already amazing but what's also even more amazing is that the anti-doping agency knew to look for drugs that were not yet even approved by the FDA in some of these athletes and so it's like the Red

[02:14:40] Queen where you everyone has to stay ahead of everybody else yeah it's an arms race do you think like theoretically there are ways to enhance performance through again I'm not a huge advocate on genetic engineering I still think it's so there's so much sci-fi and the the limitations of actually getting a virus that could be taken up ubiquity but but putting that aside for a moment could you engineer a better mitochondria could one I mean I don't to put you on the spot but could one engineer and even better mitochondria how much waste is in the system I I it's funny I haven't if I ever did this exercise it's so long ago that I don't recall but from an engineering perspective how much room for improvement is there I think it's gonna take a while before things like that are possible and I gather from this conversation that you like me like automobiles and so if you have an engine the way to enhance it is to turbocharged it but turbo charging it is not taking one spark plug out and replacing it with another sweetie changing the way air flows through it is recycled so you have like 17 different things you have a turbocharger you put it on top and there's like 17 other things that you have to alter so the entire system connects up you have impedance matching you have airflow matching so that in the end you have a better performing automobile I think something analogous applies to mitochondria it's not gonna be just one thing that you can turn on if you want to try to the system is already pretty optimized right and so if you just change one thing it's probably not gonna you can break it yeah you can break it with one thing but it's hard to enhance with one thing that's actually a great way to just think of biology in general it's pretty easy to break it at a single point cyanide nothing the most extreme example right de trota toxin so easy to kill and break at a single molecule which comes back to a point I made earlier it's mind boggling when something like rapamycin works right again I don't I mean you had dinner with David last night so he's clearly one of the world's authorities on rapamycin and its function but at least if we could have metformin the only way that I can conceive that it could have this total body impact is if it's doing something that then causes the entire system to respond even when we've talked about statins every medical student in the country knows that statins are life-saving every single medical student in the country knows that statins had HMG co-reductase but why is that right is there other things that it's doing that are also important beyond the reduction of LDL the way that statins work my understanding is that sure statins directly target HMG co-reductase but then what ends up happening is because you're not producing so much sterols you turn on an entire srebp transcriptional program right and you bring more receptors to the surface of the liver that's right more of the statin efficacy is due to the LDL clearance than the reduction of cholesterol synthesis that's exactly right that's a even B benefits beyond that is my point and some argue there are actually a whole camp of LDL denialists who can't deny the efficacy of the drug and so the sort of hypothesis is well all of the statin benefit doesn't come through the LDL reduction through the mechanism you describe the unintended consequences the wrong way of saying it but the non-obvious consequence but it could be some of the anti-inflammatory benefits that come from it or you know the endothelial protective benefits but the point is that there's an entire response to hitting 80 mg koy reductase and a consequence of that program is that you have more sterile production so in the end the amount of cholesterol that you're producing is kind of balanced what you've inhibited it but you've turned on more of the enzyme so it's comparable but you've turned on these other 17 switches as well at the same time one of which is the LDL receptor which helps to clear LDL levels there may be other things as well that are turned on that are not beneficial so

[02:18:47] I think physiological systems are so complicated trying to identify all 17 of those things and turning them on at the same time in general I think is going to be hard even in the next 30 years but it may be the case that some of the interventions are you know what people refuse ISM do you think of this is when you look let's look at the three examples you've just used a statin metformin and rapamycin none of those are some pure I mean they're synthesized today but they are all derivatives of naturally occurring compounds I'm sitting here as you're telling this story trying to think of examples of purely synthesized de novo molecules that have such benefit there may be examples but it seems less obvious do you think it's a coincidence that some of the most potent agents that we have in medicine which by definition it seems are the ones that have to do multi pronged inputs tend to come from naturally occurring substances does that just speak to our coevolution with these things no absolutely I think there's been this arms race right the bacteria are fighting these fungi and the fungi are fighting these plants and so there's all sorts of small molecules that are designed to throw wrenches into other mitochondria or translational programs or nutrient sensing programs so natural products are remarkable chemistry's and they've evolved over hundreds of millions of years to target physiological systems and so I'm a huge fan of natural products and the biology that they expose is so interesting we'll close with it with the question that's admittedly kind of a tough question so I apologize for putting you on the spot and no no qualms if you can't come up with a good or great answer but when you think about the world you want to explore here with the questions that you want to ask so much of what happens even at the level that you're at is still constrained by resources have you ever had the thought experiment or the the sort of fantasy of what if you were in a totally resource unconstrained world so you never had to apply for another grant in fact you were given some lump sum of money that was beyond what you could imagine and even just from an IRB standpoint there was nothing that stood in your way of doing kind of something that was still ethical but but maybe today would be logistical e-2 challenging do you have a sense of what questions you would want to probe but specifically what experimenter set of experiments you would you would do if in this dream state it's a tough question it sounds like you're basically asking me not to be limited by anything except my own imagination and I think so often in biomedical research that is what limits us but it's a great question

[02:21:34] Peter one experiment that would be kind of a fun experiment to try is really motivated by a recent work on oxygen so what we've observed is at least in preclinical models when you have severe mitochondrial decline breathing thinner air appears to be beneficial now how about in a common form of aging when there's a subtle decline in mitochondrial activity is there excess unused oxygen and will breathing thinner air be beneficial and given that I'm not resource-limited I mean wouldn't it be cool if we could construct a ritz-carlton hotel or condominium at 16,000 feet that's extremely comfortable and perhaps another ritz-carlton that looks identical at the plains and we could take a very large cohort not five not ten but thousands of people that live at either the plains are at the high altitude for many many months and we try to evaluate whether there are any biomarkers of aging age associated disorders that actually improve under thin air maybe they become worse under thin air but it would be something like a crossover experiment that would allow us to test the idea that thin air may be beneficial for chronic diseases I love that idea that is elegant because one you could do that you answer the question right which is in a resource unconstrained world like that's tens of millions of dollars would allow you to do that call it you know hundreds of millions of dollars could do that longitudinally and your intervention is elegant in that it is it's going to touch lots of things that's interesting so 16,000 feet so following up on that have you done or contemplated doing the less beautiful version of that in mice where or

[02:23:38] I'm sort of disdainful of mice but maybe rats or something that's less inbred where you have models of type-2 diabetes but they're genetically born with norm mitochondria has that experiment been done we're doing those types of experiments now in of course our focus is on some of these rare genetic mitochondrial diseases but we're going into some of these other conditions more common conditions that are also associated with mitochondrial dysfunction so those are currently ongoing when we get back to that dream experiment what is interesting Peter is experiments like that had actually taken place in humans and they can be read the natural experiments and one of the experiments there's this one paper from the early 1970s that was published by the Indian Army it was the Indian Army reporting on the health outcomes of a huge number of their troops who India has historically had border disputes with China I think it was in the 1960s

[02:24:38] India deployed more than a hundred thousand troops on the Indochina border and don't quote me on the numbers but about 25 thousand of these people were at extremely high altitude and another hundred thousand or so were at the plains they were there for about five to seven years or so and of course the food that they ate the temperature the activity all of these were different between low and high altitudes but one of the variables that was different was oxygen and after I think it was seven years the Indian Army actually wrote this paper it's only been cited a few like maybe 20 times or so they reported the long-term health consequences and what they showed is that death from things like infections were much higher acutely upon going to high altitude but if you look at chronic diseases like incidents of diabetes stroke cardiovascular disease they were much reduced in the high altitude arm even after they returned to the plains I think or slightly as long as they stayed at the only only as long as they stayed in the altitude I don't think they had long term follow-up actually but you know it's this type of data that actually makes me wonder whether what we're observing in some of these rare forms of mýto dysfunction and the interaction of might under of oxygen perhaps some of it could be relevant to more common conditions as well super interesting they keep going on but I you've been generous with your time especially to a total stranger this is really helpful I want to thank you for the work you're doing and I want to thank you for taking the time to explain it to me into a few people listening thank you so much this has been a lot of fun for me you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at Peter Chia MD com maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what
