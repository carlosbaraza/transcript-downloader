This clip is from episode #357 ‒ A new era of longevity science: models of aging, human trials of rapamycin, biological clocks, promising compounds, and lifestyle interventions | Brian Kennedy, Ph.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Intro to Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AKG) – The discussion begins by introducing AKG, a central metabolite in the TCA cycle, and its potential as an anti-aging intervention
- Lifespan vs. Healthspan in Mice – In mice, AKG extended lifespan by 5–10% and significantly improved frailty scores
- Importance of Time-Release AKG – The benefits of AKG are tied to its time-release formulation, as standard AKG is metabolized too quickly to be effective
- Combining AKG with Vitamins – Mouse studies found synergistic effects when AKG was combined with vitamin A (for males) and vitamin D (for both sexes)
- Future Potential and Excitement – Optimism about AKG’s role in aging intervention and hints at unpublished studies on vitamin A’s impact

## AI Summary

Based on the provided transcript segment, I'll analyze what was discussed. Note that this appears to be only a portion of the full episode.

1. **Executive Summary**:
The discussion focuses on biological age measurement tools, particularly comparing epigenetic clocks and clinical chemistry markers for predicting mortality. Dr. Kennedy and Dr. Attia discuss the value of different biological age measurement approaches and their practical applications in healthcare settings. The conversation emphasizes the importance of actionable biomarkers versus purely predictive ones.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- First generation clocks tried to predict chronological age, while second generation clocks predict outcomes like mortality [00:02:48]
- Some first generation methylation clocks perform worse than chronological age at predicting mortality [00:04:25]
- Clinical chemistry clock using about 50 parameters outperforms methylation clocks [00:05:38]
- Study using NHANES database with 200 months of forward-looking data showed improved mortality prediction [00:04:46]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Monitor standard clinical markers that are actionable and interpretable by doctors [00:07:11]
- Pay attention to markers even within reference ranges, as combinations can indicate increased mortality risk [00:07:48]

4. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Complete blood count (provides about 30 parameters) [00:05:38]
- Standard clinical markers including:
  - LDL
  - Blood pressure
  - HbA1C [00:03:04]
  - Inflammatory markers
- Cost approximately $300 in Singapore for complete panel [00:05:38]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"These are actionable things... you can treat LDL, you can treat high blood pressure, you can treat these markers" [00:08:08]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What are the specific 50 parameters included in the clinical chemistry clock?
- How do insurance companies' mortality prediction models compare to these new biological age measurements?
- What are the specific principal components mentioned in the clinical chemistry analysis?

Note: The transcript ends abruptly during a discussion about potential drug interventions, so some sections (like Exercise & Movement, Nutrition & Diet, etc.) cannot be completed without the full transcript.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Let's go back to the kind of the epigenetic clock situation. So, do you think that there could be value in this as a tool? Right. And and let me hold the bar as high as I think it would need to be to justify their use. So, right now we have this thing called chronologic age. Um, I can look at your birth certificate. I can know how old you are and based on that I can make an estimate of how much longer you will live.

[00:00:25] Mhm. So if I look at a person who's 40 years old and I know nothing else about them and then I see another person who is 65 years old and I know nothing else about them, I can say with a high degree of confidence that the 65year-old person will live, you know, I'm making this up because I'm not an actuary, but somewhere between 20 and 30 more years and the 40year-old person I can say with a pretty high degree of confidence will live, you know, whatever somewhere between uh call it you know 30 to 50 more years or something like that.

[00:01:00] Um now to me that's a pretty good test. Mhm. Right. I know I know I know a me I know a knowable measurable thing about them. Um it's measurable by knowing their birth date. Right. Um and it predicts future life. Mhm. So, do you think biologic clocks will ever serve a purpose like that where I could um take two 50 year olds and one of them has a biologic age of 40 and one of them has a biologic age of 60 according to the clock and that those numbers will actually be better at predicting future life than their chronologic age of 50? Or do you put yourself in the camp that says, "No,

[00:01:45] Peter, that's a ridiculous standard that no biologic clock could ever come to, but it might tell me about their health." It might be yet another biomarker that says, "Hey, the guy at 40 is just healthier than the guy at 60." And somehow, by the way, it's picking that signal out of a data field that I can't pick out anywhere else because they otherwise look identical. We measured this recently uh because we uh uh collaborators of mine at N US uh uh

[00:02:15] Yan Gruber and Fun uh and I had this small role in this project. Um they decided Fun's a geriatrician. He sees people all the time uh frustrated you know what can the geriatricians have limited things they can do. they're seeing people that are already have multimorbidity and you know and he you know the clocks are not that useful and so he wanted to like how do we create a reliable clock that a doctor can understand and so we for what purpose for um biologic age I I'll tell you what

[00:02:48] I think the purpose is for it in a minute okay um and this build so they're first generation and second generation clocks the first generation clocks try to predict your chronologic age and the second ones predict some outcome So the question is we want to predict mortality. We don't want to predict your chronologic age.

[00:03:04] Yep. So intrinsically if it works it's going to do better than the than chronologic age for the second generation clocks. Um so we took in hannes you know data collected around 1999 2000 mortality data for 200 months and we just and and these parameters are nice and because you can actually do a consumer test of HBA1C. You know there are many labs that do that. It's reproducible to a large extent much better than DNA methylation and doctors use all these parameters. So the things that are in inhanes like LDL you know all the things in your book inflammatory markers you know u medical test uh you know some some cognitive self-reported stuff. So we took everything as a feature and used AI uh linear model to try to predict mortality. Um and uh they're on we're on the second generation of this clock now.

[00:04:00] Uh and it predicts mortality better than any other parameter in inhanes. It's way better than ASCVD. Uh there's cardiovascular disease measurement. Um and so recently the methylation data came out on inhanes. And so we could go back and compare the mortality prediction for methylation clocks. Some of the first generation clocks are worse than chronologic age.

[00:04:25] Your passport is better than they are at predicting mortality, which to me means that they're not useful because, you know, even if they're not designed to predict mortality, if they don't capture some element of that, what are they measuring? You know, the second generation clocks like grim age and pheno age, they do better job than chronologic age for sure at predicting mortality.

[00:04:46] Mortality. Yeah. And just to be clear, we've captured that out of the NHANES database. That's from Inhanes. That's the only thing we've looked at right now. Okay. Let me make sure I understand that by def you had 200 months Yeah. of forward-looking data. So anyway, you've got um uh 18 years of data and um you're saying we if we know the methylation of somebody at that time in the cohort 1999 to 2000 um we could predict their date of death better than the actuarial data of their age. Yeah.

[00:05:21] Okay. I wasn't aware of that. Well, it's just I'm not I don't think it's even it's been accepted for publication. I'm not even sure it's online yet. So Okay. Um It's not your fault. That's very interesting. Okay. Yeah, that cuz that so that basically answers a question that I've never seen answered. Yeah. But our clinical chemistry clock does better than that. Those

[00:05:38] Okay. And and what is included in that clinical clock? Well, there are about 50 parameters that we measure now. But see, complete blood count gives you about 30 of those parameters. So, it's not as elaborate as you think it would be. Yeah. Yeah. No, I believe. Um and then, you know, it's a lot of standard markers that you already measure. You probably measure all I guess that was going to be my question is it's about $300 in Singapore if you did it all denovo but anybody going to a doctor's office has most of those parameters measured anyway and if they're going to you know a wellness longevity center all of them are probably of course yeah and so the the question I suppose is this if you're met life you already like you are better at predicting mortality than anybody on the planet and I don't know if it's at life, by the way, but like pick the best life insurance company.

[00:06:28] Yeah. Like this is their business. They're so good at predicting mortality. It's frightening. And so, yeah, I I don't know how they're doing that, so I can't comment. And nobody does, right? But my point is they're looking at age. They're looking at a whole bunch of things in your medical history. They're looking at a whole bunch of blood tests, your blood pressure, your weight, your waist, your circumference, all those things. and they're coming up with an exceptional prediction of remaining years on life.

[00:06:54] The real question is do you believe that they will incorporate a second generation uh epigenetic clock or do you believe that they've already got that captured in their data set? They may. I don't know. It's an unanswerable question. I but again we're focusing on the clinical chemistry anyway. We're not doing any methylation.

[00:07:11] Y so um and what we're finding is hospitals want to use this now clinical chemistry or methylation? clinical chemistry and I I think it's because it resonates, you know, when you when you show them the list of parameters. Y a doctor doesn't have to be an expert in epigenetics to to figure out what's going on. And the other thing is they're all actionable. So we have principal components that we can break it down in and we can see smoking in one component and we can see metabolic disease and another one and obesity in another one and we find cases we find a few conclusions from this are really interesting. One is we find cases where nothing's out of the reference range.

[00:07:48] Okay. So, a doctor that's looking at things, especially if they have a few minutes to look at, they're not going to prescribe anything for this person. Yeah. But these four parameters in this principal component are increasing, you know, their their biologic age by four years, which means it's increasing their uh it's 50% increase in mortality risk.

[00:08:08] So, that's these are actionable things. you know, you can treat LDL, you can treat high blood pressure, you can treat these markers, right? And so clinicians are actually willing to then be a little bit more aggressive and try to prescribe something or lifestyle modification or something to treat these markers.

[00:08:26] So it's actionable. So yeah, exactly. That that makes sense. The reason that you prefer this is it it doesn't just give you an answer, it gives you a solution. If we if we just took a population of middle-aged healthy individuals Yeah. and we we could design an experiment where you had the placebo arm, the metformin arm, the rapamy arm, the SGLT2 inhibitor arm, and the GLP-1 agonist arm. What is your prediction in length of life or additional years of life given in that six arm study or whatever it is?
