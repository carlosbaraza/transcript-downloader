## Description

Original release date: 7/6/20

Lloyd Klickstein is the Chief Science Officer at resTORbio, a biopharmaceutical company that develops medications to target the biology of aging. In this episode, Lloyd discusses his company’s clinical application of rapamycin and its derivatives. He also elucidates details of his 2014 paper—a paper that greatly influenced Peter’s perspective of rapamycin in the context of longevity. Peter and Lloyd go on to discuss the dose-dependent effect of rapamycin on immune function and compare rapamycin, fasting, and caloric restriction.

We discuss:

00:18:00 - What prompted Lloyd to focus on mTOR inhibition?  
00:21:30 - Defining mTOR, TORC1, and TORC2, and the consequences of inhibiting them with rapamycin 
00:42:15 - Dose-dependent impact of rapamycin on immune function, mTOR inhibition, and toxicity  
00:53:00 - Lloyd’s 2014 experiment—mTOR inhibition improves immune function in the elderly  
01:13:00 - Insights into autophagy, antigen presentation, and the pleiotropic benefits of a rapalog, and how it compares to fasting  
01:18:45 - Lloyd’s 2018 experiment—TORC1 inhibition enhances immune function and reduces infections in the elderly 
01:29:00 - Creation of resTORbio, subsequent studies, and takeaways about dosing, TORC2 inhibition, and tissue selectivity  
01:40:00 - Comparing the longevity effect of rapamycin, fasting, and caloric restriction  
01:47:00 - Excitement around RTB101—resTORbio’s mTOR inhibiting molecule  
01:56:15 - Identifying rapalogs selective for TORC1  
02:00:00 - Treating depression with ketamine, an activator of mTOR  
02:03:30 - Epigenetic clocks, rapalogs, and metformin

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode with Lloyd Klickstein:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on mTOR inhibition, rapamycin, and their potential role in aging and immune function. Lloyd Klickstein, CSO of resTORbio, discussed groundbreaking research on using rapalogs (rapamycin analogs) to enhance immune function in elderly populations. The conversation centered around two key studies from 2014 and 2018 that demonstrated improved vaccine response and reduced respiratory tract infections in elderly subjects using different dosing strategies of mTOR inhibitors.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- mTOR is the master integrator of nutrient sensing and growth signals in cells [00:45:00]
- Rapamycin binds to FKBP proteins before binding to mTOR complex 1 [01:15:00]
- Different doses and timing of mTOR inhibition produce different effects on immunity [01:30:00]
- Older animals lose ability to suppress mTOR during fasting compared to young animals [01:45:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Intermittent dosing of mTOR inhibitors may be more beneficial than continuous dosing [01:20:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Lower doses of rapalogs may be more beneficial for immune function than higher doses [01:25:00]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- RAD001 (everolimus) at 0.5mg daily or 5mg weekly showed benefits [00:55:00]
- RTB101 (experimental compound) at 10mg daily showed promise [02:00:00]
- Rapamycin dosing considerations discussed [01:10:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Everything in me in my world comes down to just anthropomorphizing the immune system" - Peter Attia [01:35:00]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal cycling period for rapamycin/rapalogs?
2. How do tissue-specific effects of mTOR inhibition differ?
3. What is the relationship between fasting and mTOR inhibition in humans?
4. How do different rapalogs compare in terms of selective mTOR complex 1 inhibition?

The episode provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of mTOR inhibition and its potential therapeutic applications in aging and immune function. The discussion highlights both the progress made in understanding these pathways and the many questions that remain to be answered.
