## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not solutely nuts for so if i don't feel that way about something i don't know how i can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads i've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level it makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription I guess this week is my friend and legend Rick Rubin Rick is a Grammy award-winning recording producer he's the co-founder of Def Jam

[00:04:21] Records which if any of you grew up in the era I grew up in you're intimately familiar with the incredible breath of hip-hop that spun out of that the Beastie Boys LL Cool J Public Enemy Run DMC ghetto boys etc in thinking about doing an introduction for Rick I almost wonder if it's easier to mention the artists he has not produced or worked with but rather than that I'll rattle off I don't know a small fraction of those that he has ac/dc Adele Aerosmith Eminem jay-z

[00:04:53] Johnny Cash which we talked quite a bit about Justin Timberlake Kanye Kid Rock Lady Gaga Linkin Park Soundgarden Red Hot Chili Peppers Rage Against the Machine Tom Petty Smashing Pumpkins kind of you name it and he's worked with them MTV referred to Rick as quote the most important producer of the last 20 years and in 2007 he appeared on x 100 most influential people in the world this is one of those episodes where honestly we could have just spent the entire time talking about music and at some point I had to extract myself from the discussion on music which is probably about the first half of this interview we also did this interview in his legendary recording studio in Malibu so

[00:05:37] I think a lot of my interviews feel sort of personal because I do almost all of them in person this one I would say even more so because we basically did this in a recording studio sitting on couches with boom mics down in front of us so that you're barely even thinking about this as an interview and it was kind of just Rick and I talking like we would have been talking at his place or my place and I think that that allows us to get into some of the more intimate stuff about not just the music but the pain that sometimes drives music the cycle of addiction rick is certainly no stranger to seeing the downside of the creative genius phenotype that produces some of the most incredible music that all of us love and listen to we also get into his health many people know rick has lost a lot of weight and he was at one point morbidly obese and so we talked about that which he's talked about a little bit before and had this incredible transformation but we also talked about a really significant health scare that

[00:06:33] Rick had less than a year ago and for me this was actually very powerful because I lived this health scare with him as a friend but I don't think as it was folding I fully understood what he was going through because rick is such a sort of happy-go-lucky guy I didn't appreciate at the time the challenges that he was dealing with and I think being able to relive it through this discussion was helpful for me and I think it's gonna be helpful for many other people to understand the challenges that people are going through when they're confronting something that's quite frightening which it was we could have spent honestly another five hours talking but we had to get back to his place for dinner and I'm convinced that most people were really even if you're not a huge music fan you will really enjoy this episode so without any further delay here is my really fun discussion with Rick Rubin this is a huge honor not only do I get to talk with you but I get to do so in a kind of legendary place huh yes sir can you tell me a little bit about where we are and

[00:07:31] Eric gave me a tour that blew my mind but and I don't think that a listener could appreciate the physical beauty of what we're talking about but this is some I wouldn't when you said let's meet at the studio I didn't have this in mind yes how did this place get to be the band and Bob Dylan built it in 1974 and the house was already here they put the studio in before that they had been living in Woodstock and a place called big pink they made a famous album called big pink and then they all decided to move to California and this was the place and they built the studio and if you watch the last walls all of the scenes that are not the concert happened here and all the rehearsals happened here and all the interviews happened here and it's been rocking ever since 1974 the trailer out there was Bob

[00:08:22] Dylan's on that was his there's the tour in that trailer in theory that's one of the slits one of the stories associated with the studio so much of it is you know there's so much myth I don't know where the line is of what's real and what's that there's probably no average to this but how long does it take a band to actually produce a record in a place like this assuming that they're not distracted by other things or obligations but if a band says look Rick we want to come and we want to work you want to produce an album and we've written the music but you know it's still a little rough is that something that a typical band would be able to do in a month in two months I mean I don't even have a sense of that scale it could be a couple of weeks and it could be a couple of years it really is dependent on the project everyone has its own flow its own like creates its own rhythm so let's kind of go back to the beginning a little bit so you grew up in New York right yes Long Island Long Beach Long

[00:09:22] Island did you always love music always loved music and you went to NYU that's all what were you studying there started as a philosophy major and then after two years I switched to film and television and when did you first start producing music and what did that look like I was in a punk rock band and accorded a couple of things with my band that was my first experience of recording and I enjoyed it and then hip hop was just starting in New York City and it was a small underground form of music this is early eighties mid eighties 80 I'm gonna say 85 something like that I'm not sure exactly but it minutes and I would go to these clubs and hear this music and at the time there was very little recorded rap there would be maybe if he went to the stores where DJs would shop which would have 12-inch vinyl singles in those days that'd be the only place you'd find any anything rap related and it would it be a 12-inch single then that's all there was were these 12-inch singles and maybe every week one or two 12-inch singles would come out and that was all there was in rap music and I would go to the DJ store every week and listen to all the new music coming out and the energy when I went to a hip-hop club what I felt there was very different than what I was hearing on the records the records were more if they were less like hip-hop records and more like other kinds of records use eclis other than they may have somebody rapping on them but musically it could have been an R&B record so at the time where were the best clubs in New York for hip hop the only when I started listening to hip hop the only place you could hear hip hop downtown where where I was going to school there was a reggae club on was either in first evany or second Avenue down a flight of stairs a small little club called Nick grill and I think it was Tuesday nights at Negril they would invite the hip-hop DJs from the Bronx and queens to come there were some from

[00:11:50] Harlem as well and that would be the only place you could get that experience and then as I got deeper into the scene I would have to go to clubs in the Bronx or in Brooklyn or in Queens or in Harlem by mid-80s by 84 I mean Run DMC was already pretty well known yes and no they were well known in New York and 84 they were well known in New York but where did Krush groove come out I don't know we were already successful you know

[00:12:19] I mean they made a film about us yeah so we were already successful at that time okay so so prior to that so I'm trying to think like when would Run DMC and LL Cool J first have popped up on my radar which was before the Beastie Boys if I recall but maybe not but I mean I wouldn't have heard of them until their albums came out presumably right yeah well Run DMC's first album came out before I ever met them I think that's the last I'm Damian ladies first album came out did they self produce that like how did they actually a guy named Larry

[00:12:52] Smith was the main producer and Russell Simmons was the co-producer there were things on that album that were really revolutionary in terms of the first time we ever heard anything that truly sounded like hip-hop was on that album even though there had already been other records the other records again were more like an R&B record with somebody rapping on it but the rent Ren DMC's first record had a couple of glimpses of what was to come so ll came from what part of New York

[00:13:24] Ella was from Hollis Queens got it and he sent a demo tape to the dorm room where Def Jam was located in my room who did you found Def Jam with Russell was do you and Russell yeah actually started the first couple of releases were before I'd met Russell like the punk rock records I put out we're on Def Jam of my band and then the first single that I did in hip hop was on Def Jam and that's how I met Russell was because he heard that record he loved it and he was again

[00:13:58] I was kid in college he was already a big fish in this small pond of hip hop pretty much anyone who was doing hip hop was managed by Russell so LL sends a demo yes and ad-rock from the Beastie Boys found that he would listen to all the demos that came in so you already knew at Rock and mic and those guys yes okay yes AG rock found the demo played it for me we both really liked it like what song what song was on the demo you can't even remember oh no what was it about ll that struck you as distinctive at the time lyrical lyrical ability mm he really had a great vocabulary and a great great command of language and believable in his presentation and how old was he at that time like 16 16 Wow so what were the next step so how do you take this kid with all this raw talent and say okay like I mean how much money well I won me again he was 16 I was I was maybe 20 right yeah so so how much money did it take at that time to turn what he had in his head into an album that you could now put on a record store he has more than a single very little but we started with we started with a single first I think we maybe even did two singles we did two singles before we ever did an album and this the singles would have been I would program the the beats in my dorm room then we would go to the studio bring the drum machine and allow oh he would bring all of his books of lyrics I would go through the lyrics and kind of pick the stuff that I liked and then we would talk about how to form it into a song because in those days in the early days of hip-hop it was less about songwriting and more just about the the vocal style so typically at that time it wouldn't be unusual in those 12-inch single days for a song to be ten minutes long and be more like what we would think of as a dance remix of a song as opposed to the single version you'd hear on the radio there was no hip-hop on the radio that was not a thing this was more something that would be played in a club mm-hmm so one of the things that that because I grew up listening to the

[00:16:21] Beatles I had this affinity for traditional song structure so many rap records you'd hear before the ones that we made might just be a guy rapping for ten minutes without any song structure at all might just be along like a long monologue no chorus no no no chorus so you wanted to impose a bit of that structure yes just because that's the music I grew up on and liked it and thought it would I would like it better so we started doing that and we would chop up these long wraps in two or 16-bar verse and then create a hook so the first singles we may probably cost

[00:17:01] I'm gonna guess in the 3 to $500 range to record them and make them that's that's unbelievable yeah and how many would you typically make in a first print it depended on a lot of things but I'll just it could be like just a hundred or so or come on it'd be like a thousand between 1,000 and 5,000 got it because I was so young at the time and I wasn't really thinking about anything beyond listening to the music yeah it's hard for me to think about the logistics of it but you only had how many record stores in New York that could sell these or that had the people that would walk in they would know what to do with three or four so basically you're physically taking these records in stacks to these guys and the people who own the record stores like the music and they basically have two clientele that are gonna appreciate this yes there weren't really dedicated hip-hop radio stations at the time no so how were you getting this on the radio and how were you doing if you weren't you'd bring it to Negril and then later the Roxy which is as the scene at Negril grew big almost Tuesday nights it eventually moved over to a roller rink called the Roxy and I went to the

[00:18:09] Roxy and the first night that had opened for hip-hop and it was this giant roller rink with maybe 50 people in it and watched it slowly over the weeks and months become the hottest place in New York so my only goal was to get them to play it at the Roxy when the grill that was the only place that we would think about so at that moment like if you could put yourself back in where you were at the age of 20 making you know a thousand copies of LLS first single did you have a sense of the fact that you were a part of a new type of music Lou

[00:18:46] Jean Rey of music not really we didn't think about that at all and there's no expectation that anything was gonna happen the whole goal would be to sell enough records to be able to make another record that was the whole purpose it was not a nobody thought about this as a profitable venture at any point so you're still going to school while you're doing this yeah was the stuff you were learning at school applicable in some way no no so you're basically learning how to do this stuff I'm solidly absolutely the best thing about school was that it was uh just the location was that it happened to be in

[00:19:21] New York and that's happened to be where hip hop was happening so had I gone to University of Chicago my life would have been very different and that was a choice I almost made so yeah that's interesting isn't it to think about these things so you go to university Chicago you I can't imagine there was an underground hip-hop scene there was one arrival what was going on in New York No so Run DMC were basically the act of the of that era when you were starting correct yes the Hoopoe greater greatest and maybe for them it would have been Kurtis Blow okay first big ya big rapper who Russell managed and then Run DMC who run was

[00:19:57] Russell's brother and that was the next big band and he eventually eclipsed Kurtis yeah it's amazing and then of course by 86 Licensed to Ill came out which you produced as well didn't you yeah that's the second album that I ever made LL Cool J's first album was the first album I ever made and Licensed to

[00:20:23] Ill was the second album I ever made I had to have two copies of each of those that's how much I wore both of those album out and both of them were there like a handful of times in music when I can think about a huge step function in what I was hearing NWA was another big one in a from me as well exactly the same couldn't start a visionary with what am i hearing this this is yeah the only way to describe it is to think it's a step function it was nothing incremental absolutely but Licensed to

[00:20:55] Ill proudly even slightly more so what was ellos first album was it just south radio radio that's right though I mean they were both you couldn't stop listening to them like I mean I literally remember carrying around a boom box with the cassettes and it was like such a big deal 13 12 13 and so it was a really big deal when I could finally save up enough money to get a boom box that had two cassettes with one in Dolby that I could start making mixtapes like that was like a huge step forward in my evolution of being able to take my favorite of all the songs because then there was like also Run DMC at that point I think had two albums now if I can write yeah I played guitar and a couple of songs on the second album but

[00:21:40] I didn't produce them until the third album and to be able to make mix hip hop hip hip hop days then I had one of my best friends in eighth grade Mark sillas was his name and I probably seen him in a thousand years and I hope someone listening to this knows him and can yeah but mark was a DJ so he had these techniques 1,200 turntables in his basement and he had a heavy bag and at the time I was boxing right so boxing is my life and so we would go and I would just hit the heavy bag in the speed bag and he would take these albums and he was then making mixes of these and we were creating tapes out of these things and great it was pure I mean that was heaven yeah it's so much fun yeah Licensed to Ill was perhaps the single most I don't know important / influential piece of music I listen to as a kid amazing and it's really exciting because my daughter now

[00:22:35] I mean knows most of those songs I mean I remember the first time she heard no sleep till Brooklyn late and watching the video and it's like and now I look back at the videos and they seem more comical yeah like at the time they were they seemed very serious to me like wow this is but now I look back and I'm like oh my god they're kids but they weren't kids to me when I'm 13 they were older than me yeah it looked like grown-ups yes and now I'm like look at Mike D and

[00:23:03] I reckon I'm see like they really look young they are they were in high school so how did you meet these guys just hanging out and punk rock circles yeah so what was their influence like what because they also sort of they were really hip-hop punk I thought of as like Timmy ll was the pure embodiment of hip-hop yes and the Beastie Boys had this sort of Punk feel to them and in rock The Beastie Boys came from a punk rock background the band started as purely punk rock band they put out at least two punk rock only releases before

[00:23:41] I ever met them and then they made it a song called cookie puss before I met them that was the first sort of DJ based song and it was great and to perform that live they needed a DJ and they didn't have a DJ in the group because they were a band and I was invited to be their DJ and that's how we started working together how did you learn that skillet because I remember like going to

[00:24:05] Mark's my friend Mark's house and sitting there with I mean I could barely remember what I'm talking about now but you had the two turntables on either side you had this like cross fader the middle yes you could think I remember you'd always have one ear to be listening to this and I mean I was a Luddite like I could not do it like he would try to teach me how to make my own tapes but they suck so I have enormous respect for what a DJ is doing again is that the sort of thing where you just had a natural affinity for I think so I think comes pretty naturally let's like there's a lot that you can learn and then there's also parts like you can learn to be a very good boxer but to be the best boxer there probably has to be more to it than just the practice yeah for sure there's you know there's has both elements exactly a natural affinity and the capacity to practice relentlessly yes so everybody can get better at anything they're interested in I didn't know that until Laird Hamilton really changed my life because I lived my whole life with no physicality at all so for me everything was music but that was how

[00:25:12] I so you're mixing for these guys now you're the DJ yes how did Licensed to Ill come about in other words how many of those songs are they show up with how did you guys even think about stringing those songs together he wrote them almost all of them we wrote all together just hanging out like we would go out to dance teria every night which was a big nightclub just listening to the music watching the people dancing looking at the people and trying to make each other laugh and we would write rhymes with the idea of you know I would often me and a Drock would be together and I would say something try to make him laugh and then he would say something try to make me laugh and if it was good we would write him down it would collect all of these phrases and then eventually figured out how to put them together into things and then we one of the secrets of that records that we probably started it two years two years before and at that time people were making music in a shorter period of time especially in hip-hop might be you know a a month or two to make an album but we did we would only do a song when there was a song to do so so it wasn't like we built up this big catalogue of materia and then went in to record it was like we would stew on a song idea for a while and then when it was written then we'd go in and do that one song and then we would start from scratch again and just go to the club and make each other laugh and eventually do another song over a long period of time so your day job at the time was still going to school what were the Beastie Boys doing on the side or what was there what was there were they same ages you or they were a year a year younger and maybe two years younger I think Adam Yauch was one year younger I think Mike and Adam might have been two years younger so they were out of high school obviously at this point I don't even know if that's true I think they might have been going high school

[00:27:09] I'm not sure so did your parents like think this was awesome were they so happy to see how passionate you were about something or where they sort of like look you know whatever this is just another thing that you're doing on the side and my parents were pretty supportive in general of whatever I did that said there was no hope that this would be any anything more than this fun hobby that's what it that's really what it was it was a fun hobby my plan was to go to law school and if I went to law school the plan was to have a job and to be able to make music as my hobby I never thought you didn't even think I'm gonna go to law school so I could manage musicians well I might have thought maybe there's a way to be involved in the entertainment business as a lawyer because that's I want to be involved in this world but I don't I don't know anything about this world I don't know any of the jobs or it just didn't seem like a realistic thing to aspire to do so I had a more grounded plan and then life took over and dictated the rest of it so when when radio came out which I think was 85 that sound about right sounds about right what allowed that to become such a hit or am i applying a bit of revisionist history to it and it did come a hit after the fact like did it immediately take off or did it take off only after Krush groove no he took off right did okay yeah yeah so what how do you how does that happen when there's no radio stations that are organically playing this and if you're not in New

[00:28:51] York in that Club scene like how is it that a kid in Toronto could become it was well the music was starting to spread virally already it was good it was new and it was already starting to spread most of the music up until that time had been put out by independent labels who didn't have so much of a river distribution No and the first 712 inches we put out we put out as an independent label where again we didn't have so much of a reach week we found independent distributors I think there were 12 of them around the country that we would work with so we would ship records to Texas and ship records to LA and ship records to

[00:29:32] Seattle there were there were few hubs but it was still very baby underground business but those 712 inches were created enough interest in the industry that Columbia Records came to us and offered to become our partners and they were the biggest record company in the world so the first release through our relationship with Columbia was radio ll so you're 20 21 20 so how are you negotiating a deal with the big you're a minnow and the shark comes along to negotiate a deal yes how did you not get squash we got squashed did you did you yeah absolutely what kind of legal counsel do you need to help you evil my partner was five years older than me and experienced in the business so he pretty much be mean hassle Russell you handled most of the negotiations but then as time went on our visions sort of parted ways this is a couple years later now and then as our visions parted I started getting a little more involved in some business stuff and then decided it was better for us to just go our separate ways and and I asked I remember gonna have to lunch with him I remember the restaurant before it was and I said I don't think we should do this together anymore do you want to leave the company and he said no and I said ok I guess I'll leave and that was how we parted and is that more because you and Russell were seeing things differently or you and Columbia were seeing things do it was it was both there were two things going on it's like

[00:31:13] I went to the label with a list of concerns on behalf of our artists really we had Russ and I had did our first trip to the UK because Russell managed other acts that were not on Def Jam we got to meet with people at all different record companies in England and all these different people were so excited by this stuff we were doing they just said you know any opportunity to work with any of your artists anything we can do we want to be in business with you and your deal with Columbia a worldwide was worldwide exclusive yes ok so then we went to our last meeting was with Columbia who owned our work

[00:31:50] I remember the guys name I won't say it here but um sitting in his and I don't remember anything but I remember this but we're sitting in this dark little office and the guy said you were signed by the New York company and we view the New York company Columbia as an albatross so you're in LA having this discussion is this is in London Oh in

[00:32:15] London our first trip to London meeting the guy who controls our destiny in London which is the gateway to the rest of the world yeah after having all these meetings of people who are desperate to be involved in any way in a positive way the person who's in control of our stuff said we look at Columbia Records in New

[00:32:37] York as an albatross and this is nothing against you personally but because you come from them we're just not interested and I just like my eyes got why it's like okay now I know what I ignore fect yeah I need to just go back but but the beauty of it was I went back and met with the people in New York we have a problem and it's not our problem it's your problem but there's a way we can fix it we met with all these labels everybody wants our stuff

[00:33:03] Columbia is not interested why don't we together I'm not saying let's take it away from you New York let's together find the best home for each of these artists around the world and share everything as if you were putting it out but let's do what's right for the artists and I was told that Columbia has a policy that they would rather see the works die than have someone else have success with them so uh wonderful palaces into a 20 or 21 year old kid that's not a reasonable I mean - it wouldn't be reasonable to me now but then it seemed so far-fetched and so counterproductive when there was an opportunity to be had that they could participate in yeah - turn that off because of the corporate policy that was one of my first experiences of that so

[00:33:58] Russell he didn't want to rock that boat well they wrote a check to the company which satisfied Russell but didn't satisfy me because I was not concerned with I wasn't concerned with the check I was concerned with what happened to these this music this is what year this is late 80s I mean maybe 80 probably eighty eight either 88 or 89 okay so now you're you're sort of you've experienced pretty amazing success for 22 year old doesn't believe it was unbelievable and

[00:34:34] I still want to come back to actually understanding how this music blew up I want to get a little bit more on that but I mean talk about that more first if you want yeah well I'll forget this question I guess my point is you you basically risk giving everything up because in theory I mean you could argue you had the artists the artists cared about you because they saw your honesty and they saw that your heart was with the music and not the money as evidenced by what you just did yeah but they didn't necessarily see that but yes nobody really knew what was opening so I can't say that they they saw that or knew that got it so were you scared when you made that decision did you now think did you second-guess it no it may not have been the best decision but it felt very natural to me and it felt like I'm making things that

[00:35:24] I really feel good about and I know that I'm gonna keep doing this and if I have a partnership with this big company that's doesn't want to do what we want to do I need to find a different way to do this and did Russell understand that by taking the check but you leaving that the artists were more likely to go with you then stay with Def Jam no and they didn't that wasn't even an option because we had contracts so you know we're walking away from everything absolutely we tell you yeah okay so we'll come back to that in a second but I want to come back to this point of what is it that lit up license

[00:36:01] Dale well one thing it's crazy that this is the case but it's the case it's a little bit why Elvis is Elvis even though Chuck Berry and Little Richard came before him the Beastie Boys were white and this was an underground black music and in terms of maybe in the city it didn't matter but in terms of deeply penetrating into the rest of the country the fact that the Beastie Boys were white played a huge difference I didn't see it so much then but now in retrospect it's clear hmm by 87 I mean the Beastie Boys are one of the most popular acts in hip-hop yes how many copies did licence ale sell ten million something like that and I I can never keep these things straight the colors that go with numbers and I hear multiclad and also I forget what all that stuff means so plat a platinum album means what 1,500,000 is gold 1 million is platinum it doesn't happen often but the 10 million mark called diamonds they're not so many of them so this was a diamond I guess they're close to it it was but I don't even know if they counted diamonds then it's like it's so it was such a random event there were there very few things that sold that many how did the success of that album change your life and how did it change theirs in the immediate aftermath of that because that's really that success is happening in the course of like 12 months right yes it drove a wedge in our relationship in in not a great way and what it had to do with was

[00:37:52] I usually presented a pretty clear vision of the things that I thought that we could accomplish and in success a lot of people started surrounding the artists who were more concerned with placating the artists then doing what was best for the artists and I would always fight for what was best and when there are other voices who are saying whatever you you know whatever you want and you're then it's easier to tune out the voice of the person who's not going along with everything because it wasn't always good so you're only a couple years older than these guys is there a manager also in the mix at this point or were you sort of acting as a de-facto manager no Russell really was their manager and then Leah Cohen came in to work with Russell as their manager so their next album was Paul's Boutique yes and I know you did not produce that no at that point they left Def Jam they left Russell as well they left Russell well I was already gone yeah I think we may left yeah I'm not sure if that's right I can't really remember but either way we left similar times yeah yeah so what do you do the morning after you wake up and you've walked away from Def

[00:39:20] Jam the label you've co-founded you left all the money behind and you left behind artists who had already been signed with an organization that you now know didn't even really care that much about them did you think at that point you know what maybe I'm just gonna go back go to law school and just make music on the side or did you what was the internal dialogue to sort of make the next decision I thought that it was the

[00:39:47] Deaf GM experiment had worked so I thought I could continue doing what I was doing just that the framework that that was set up was not the best framework so the goal was to start a new framework which I did immediately and what was that called at first it was called deaf American and then it became American which is what it's called to this day and at that point what were the most important lessons you learned from

[00:40:10] Def Jam that you instituted and kept in plays I mean was it basically we're not gonna partner with another major record label or no it was we have to partner with the major the record company who's gonna support what we want to do because again the reason you knew about these artists living in Toronto was because of the reach of the major labels of combination of how good the music well is this if this had stayed independent I probably would have never know walk me through the economics of a record in a moment so you've got again it's so hard today let's answer this question through the lens of nine times we don't even know if I'm gonna be able answer the question because I never really looked at you know like I'm trying to think about how rent gets split right like when I went into a record store and I paid $10 for a cassette or a record album I'm guessing that Columbia is getting like seven of those $10 be half half okay and the artists when everybody else gets paid the artists are getting what two or three typically in those days the record deal would be the artist would get in the let's say a twelve percent royalty of the retail price so whatever that would be would be it not unusual that would be typical a bigger artist it would be a bigger number like maybe Michael Jackson might get 20% but 20% of the retail not of the whole sale yeah yeah and also the retail number was a little fictitious because it would let's say be $14.99 list but then you might be able to buy it in the store for $11 and they're getting it off the $14.99 whatever the list for the truth is yeah not the sale price yeah and that's of course change and I'd love to understand better how the world works today because you can you think about the big disruptions I mean it's sort of weird to think I don't know the last time I went into a record store no they're not so many - going - well I still passed like in New York you still see them and every once in a while you'll go in and you'll find a place that's just got this incredible vinyl yeah but the funny thing is I don't have a place to even play it anymore yeah like I probably still have a turntable at my parents house techniques you're the norm that's not unusual so who was the next artist who was the first next artist that you discovered when you went out on your own probably Danzig Slayer and Danzig were the next two both of whom I think I signed when I was still at Def Jam but I signed them and when I left they they did come with me because they hadn't put out any music yet anyone would put out music was kind of obligated to say anything man so now we're in the late 80s you're still in New York when did you come out to California probably maybe 1990 around the 89 90 something like that so as far as other huge seismic or tectonic shifts in music I think Nirvana would have to be viewed as another one how much was that on your radar it wasn't the music you were producing but what were you thinking about it at the time I wasn't thinking about it so much when the grunge movement happened the people who were excited by it it was newer to them and it was to me it felt more like a continuation of

[00:43:34] Aerosmith and Black Sabbath and the heavy metal I grew up on so it didn't feel as revolutionary as it ended up feeling to others so I didn't get as excited about it as other people did then of all the bands the band that most spoke to me from that world with Sam garden mm-hmm you worked with Chris you work with Soundgarden yeah I worked with Chris in Audioslave uh-huh yeah cuz it was sort of like that's one of those things where at the time I feel like Metallica and Guns N'Roses were the biggest bands in rock and roll yes and then overnight Nirvana showed up in this album that he smells like teen spirit was the first one if it is oh I don't know if it was the first one but that's the one that changed everything okay yeah yeah and then Pearl Jam right on the heels of that they put out records on some pop before that was their first major label you know album it's just so interesting to contemplate all these things so you come out to LA for what reason besides the weather I never really thought I would live in LA I thought I would live in New York my whole life I came out here to work on a soundtrack for a movie and I was out here for eight or nine months eventually I got tired of living in a hotel which I was living on the month at the Mondrian on Sunset and I would always drive through the Hollywood

[00:45:04] Hills looking at houses because where I come from everything is flat so seeing these houses built into mountains was unbelievable so every weekend or late nights I had a friend who lived locally and we would drive the hills together and eventually I found a little house that I liked so I bought this house thinking okay when I come to LA this will be the place I stay instead of staying in the hotel and then ended up never really going back to New York and maybe five years later I eventually took the things out of my apartment because I realized that wasn't going back but it was never like a decision to move here same thing happened moving to Malibu I I got a place to come on weekends I came the first weekend never went back I can see why you weren't interested in taking me up on my offer to come and live with me in my guest house you're like I don't do San Diego but maybe I'm in some deep down level you're like there's a there's at least a 1% chance I might get stuck there so when did you first connect with the Red Hot Chili Peppers asked me to produce an album maybe their third album which is called maybe uplift mofo party I think yeah so this would have been like 93 you know no I first met them probably 89 90 mother's milk was their first album right and there's no no that met but this milk might have been their fourth really yeah at least third maybe fourth we have to check okay yeah cuz mother's milk I feel like that's the that's the first album that I that was a tension challenge was like first that was their first brilliant 89 yeah but they had I want to say three maybe two maybe possibly three before that you know we're gonna talk about exercise in a moment but I do Tabata workouts once a week and they're really really miserable but it's like this four minutes once a week where you're gonna go as close as you could go to dying doing an exercise and so the musical selection for that four minutes really matters like I put a lot of time into what song am I going to be listening to at a 97 decibels when I go to the point of puking so for Monday's workout it was for Mother's Milk it was knocked me down oh great it's a good song amazing song and as I was laying on the floor afterwards trying not to vomit which is generally like most of my effort is going into not puking after I'm on the ground like listening to this song being about you know knocking me down and I'm like this perfect yeah it's like really great it's actually a great song I posted something on Instagram about it like a couple of months ago because it's one of those songs like where I don't listen to it that often anymore but it son shuffle like if I it'll come up through my iTunes and it actually means much more to me today than it did when I was 17 or 16 or whatever age I was when it first came out when I first listened to it it really speaks to me more as like a struggle of like the grandiosity that we experienced as we get older and experience success more and it's like I was really moved by it actually in a way that and I guess maybe that's something about music in general that's just very special it can mean totally different things not just to different people which is I think of more obvious but to the same individual at different points in their life absolutely absolutely it's the poetic nature of it that allows it's like if you it's harder for that to happen when you see a movie a movie is more face value that's right it takes it takes some of the imagination of ways whereas books and music the the reader or the listener is making the the mental images that you associate with it you may be nudged in a direction by the artist but the story that you make up is your story yep and and that can change over time

[00:48:58] I've become more cognizant of this in the past year especially when I hear a song that I haven't heard in five years ten years I'm on a huge Chili Peppers kick right now I mean I keep forwarding you songs I'm like dude this is unbelievable yeah like I remember once I sent email I was like what is the world record for most times listening to this song I don't remember which song that has but it was like it was on I remember which album it was it was on

[00:49:24] Californication you were like dude how many times did you lift my thumb I'm like I think I've done 53 straight without stop 14 years later it means something a little different yeah there are a lot different yeah that's great so the first time I met them I went with Adam Horovitz from the Beastie Boys we went to a rehearsal

[00:49:43] I remember it was on Sunset they were signed to EMI at the time he was in a place on the south side of Sunset Boulevard I think it was like an EMI rehearsal studio and the vibe was not good and it didn't have anything to do with the music it was just uh the energy between the guys and the band was something I didn't understand and it just felt like I don't really want to be in this room hmm it's like a dark energy and I ended up not working with him and then I didn't end up working with them until two albums later when I met with them again and it was like they were different people and it turns out was this part of through their addiction cycle yeah so the first time I met them there were a lot of drugs involved now I not done drugs and I hadn't really been around a lot of people who do a lot of drugs so I don't really know even what what it was but you could feel this sort of lack of trust in the room between the members that didn't feel it didn't feel healthy again not knowing what it was it just felt like whatever is happening here is not for me and then again I met them maybe four or five years later and it was different everything was different and then we made a blood sugar sex Magik was the first album we made together okay so that was 91 I remember that pretty well that that had to be 91 yeah so then I probably bet them in 1888 I'll guess yeah so yeah so that that makes sense so Mother's Milk would have come out just after you guys met I think I met with them for the album before

[00:51:31] Mother's Milk I think yeah and then then Mother's Milk and then so uh so which could be three years 18 months ago a mess what's your favorite Chili Peppers album no idea and their I never listened back so I don't really yeah cuz that's funny a lot of times I'll text you and I'll be like dude this song it's a song you produced and you'll like it which one is that again yeah I don't know songs by title that's awesome and it's the effort that goes into making these things is so grueling and in the process of making it I might give this all a thousand times and by the time it's done and signed off I'm good it's like I've had my fill of that song so I don't feel a need to go back and there's so much music to listen to I'd rather listen to something that doesn't make me think of the process of making it or just so eul's like you listen to music and you have this wonder right

[00:52:24] I like that experience too and I don't have that for the things I worked on yeah yeah so you like to eat the sausage but you certainly don't want to see the sausage you don't eat the sausage you made not often I mean I think it's great sausage I mean I love the music we make I don't feel the need to listen to it if

[00:52:40] I go the fact little coffee shop in a song that I produced comes on it's a good feeling hmm and I wondered does time heal that not heal heals the wrong word it makes it sound like there's some problem there but does time change that for example if you go back and listen to something you produce 30 years you know if there was a reason to listen to it I'll listen to it but I wouldn't choose I wouldn't out of the vast catalog of music available to me I can't imagine choosing something that I worked on to listen to for fun which artist of the last 20 years that you've had no formal relationship with are you most impressed by our artists first thing that comes to mind is there's a D'Angelo album called voodoo that is pretty much of a perfect album for me usually when I listen to now maybe when I like it I think about what

[00:53:32] I would do differently mmm and that's an album when I hear and I just wish I was in the room to watch cuz it's so beautiful - tell me why it goes against so many of the things we come to expect in music for one D'Angelo's really great Center with a beautiful voice so you'd expect that voice to be any the solo artist so you expect his voice to be front and center in the star of the show was instead his voices almost buried and his performance is so understated that it almost sounds like he's dreaming it as opposed to performing it the first thing about it's interesting is it doesn't work the way other R&B records work that's the first one the next one is usually record sound I'll say perfect everything is played as good as it could be played and put together in a way that is seamless whereas this album purposely always sounds like it's on the verge of falling apart and it makes it thrilling and I hadn't really heard music like that before it like like it almost sounds like musicians who aren't really playing together but somehow it manages to hang together so just interesting doesn't sound like anything else that's the first one that comes now before we leave that example who produced that I think it might have been D'Angelo himself I'm not sure whose credit is the producer but Questlove was involved Questlove was the drummer on the project and I'm sure had a hand in it I've had to talk to anybody involved in that about how deliberate that decision was and how they did it a little bit a little bit and I hope to do more actually I started doing this podcast with Malcolm glass yeah yeah called broken record and one of the episodes I want to do which we have not yet recorded is the deep dive into the Voodoo album talking to as many of the people who were involved and understand the story of it again any time it's an album that stands alone it's interesting to me there's another album where we did record I recorded three interviews so far relating to an album by a group called love called

[00:56:07] Forever Changes which is one of my favorite albums and it's another album where it doesn't sound like any of Love's other albums and no other album sound like it by anybody else it's a real moment in time so that's exciting to me so you're still basically a student I mean everything your value is all my learning have to be a funny line that I look pro-wrestling and there's a funny line that a pro wrestler once said that you can't call yourself a professor unless you two are a student and he was talking about wrestling but it applies to everything yes yeah for sure so you're about to say something else there's another album you were gonna refer to more artists I think the question was music that you have not produced that you are enamored with yes a more recent one would have been James

[00:57:02] Blake's first album hmm beautiful doesn't sound like anything else very original really touches me that's how many kind of blanking on the time is that like 10 years ago or less with us maybe 8 yeah I'm not sure I'm not good with that I'm not good time yeah so let's go back to the Chili Peppers for a moment just because it was the foray into this but drugs are forever a huge part of rock and roll right it's sort of like I don't know that anybody's ever done the actuarial analysis on it but when I was in high school and I really like all kinds of music and so as much as I loved what was happening currently you know Beastie Boys etc I loved

[00:57:53] Hendrix I love the doors yeah and I remember at the time maybe naively thinking like why do these guys keep dying like I couldn't understand the self harm that was going on I just didn't have enough of a sense and I don't know that I have a sense today although it makes you wonder right is there a pain that's leading to this incredible creativity that's along there's the collateral damage along the way is the soothing that's coming from the drug use or do you think it's less about that and more about the culture of

[00:58:29] I'm a rock star I'm supposed to be doing this it's the first its self medicating people who make music tend to be very sensitive if you think of Kurt Cobain as a raw nerve he's going through this world feeling things that other people who have the same experiences don't feel hmm it's painful he can put it into the music's why he is who he is but it makes it hard to survive in life no one around him is savvy enough to understand what's happening because people don't look at that stuff and this goes for most musicians but it's always the case of the musician just trying to find a way to exist in a world where they feel like they don't really fit

[00:59:18] I don't think that's something I appreciated until kind of recently I remember with my daughter about a year ago maybe two years ago watching and I can't believe I'm even blanking on the name of it but it was the documentary about Michael Jackson's preparation for his last tour yes you know what I'm talking about ever seen it but I know you're talking yeah so I'm blanking on the name but we'll link to it in the show notes I'm sure that many folks have seen it so you're watching this documentary and it's really funny when I was growing up although Michael Jackson

[00:59:50] Madonna you know Beastie Boys were epic for whatever reason I didn't gravitate towards Michael Jackson so even the hit songs like beaded Thriller Billie Jean like I didn't dislike them but I can't even think I owned those albums put it that way like it just wasn't on my radar for some reason so I think Michael

[01:00:10] Jackson is not someone I paid any attention to and even when all of the you know the scandals were going on and all of the oh he how many times is he gonna have plastic surgery and he's changing his skin colour and and then of course all of the the sexual abuse stuff like it just you know just wasn't something I was reading about or particularly pain into and I think I knew most of the fact it's like I knew that you know he was part of a band when he was a boy and all of these other things but some things struck me when watching that documentary which is like what a fragile soul and given what I understand now about pharmacology to imagine that this is a guy who all he wanted to numb and soothe was like to have this doctor come to his house and give him a general anesthetic

[01:00:59] I mean propofol is not I mean that is not really what we would think of in that in the even the mainstream of recreational drugs yes again notwithstanding all of his faults right which are numerous enough that we could spend a whole day talking about them but I also sort of realized wow talk about a traumatised kid yeah like here's a boy who never stopped being traumatized by something yes and ultimately that trauma he passed that on to other kids yes and again you talk about the Red Hot

[01:01:33] Chili Peppers and flea has been pretty open about his struggles and Anthony and stuff I mean these guys make unbelievable music but you get the sense that there's like there's something tormenting these people it almost makes you feel as a pat like someone like me who's just a consumer of music right like there's nothing I do at all to contribute to the world of music other than consume it you feel a little bit guilty in the sense that I'm profiting for lack of a better word at the expense of someone's pain now of course they're profiting - everybody's getting something in this transaction I'm not even talking about money of course yes you seem to have picked up on this sooner I mean I remember reading something a long time ago it was actually before Mac Miller died that you you really tried to help him when he relapsed mm-hmm I'm guessing that's not the first artist you had to try to help no it's as much of the part of the job as the music part is helping a sensitive soul work through this life and this business where there there are a lot of voices who again are more concerned with getting the next record out and cashing in and less concerned with the health of the artists a mutual friend of ours who shall remain nameless until we're having dinner tonight and then I can rat him out he said something to me once about you that I thought was really interesting he said you know Rick has a superpower and I don't know where he got it from but he has the ability to take really creative people and somehow disarm them enough to I'm paraphrasing he said it much more eloquently but disarmed them enough to do their best work creatively but still do it within the confines of a business structure that allows you know a product to be made like there's a balance between the business and the art and you've managed to sort of create this environment that fosters both optimally and it's not exactly true my feeling has always been that if you get the art right the commerce side of it works itself out so maybe in that I can help an artist to refocus to just pay attention to the art instead of overthinking what comes next and what other people are gonna say about it or what their managers gonna think of what the labels gonna think or what a radio station might think or what's gonna be the first single or any of those thoughts which tend to lower the vibration of the entire project so we try to get to this pure art place and in doing so it benefits them in all areas but there's very little thought of the business side I think what he meant and I'm probably not articulating it is exactly that but what you're doing ultimately though it's not your primary aim happens to be in service of also making something amazing commercially like it's almost like it happens yeah it happens as a you haven't diluted that you haven't reduced the ability to be successful no but it happens more through the purity of it instead of through aiming at it yeah I can totally imagine that right it's sort of like meditation if you're if you're meditating with the goal of becoming the best meditator it's very hard to if you're meditating with the objective of

[01:05:18] I'm gonna sit here for the next thirty minutes and that's all I'm gonna do yeah at the end of that thirty minutes you've succeeded yeah there was no more to it than that so hip hop in New York seemed just like a different vibe from the hip hop that came out of LA and I don't know if part of it was that they were just temporarily off set but is it a surprise to you that gangster rap came out of LA and not New York not really because there's more of a gang culture in LA in real life so the gangsta rap sprung out of the gang culture that really cysts there's there some gang culture in

[01:05:55] New York but it was less and I never really ran into it in my New York time so were you here in LA when NWA's first album came out and I went to visit them in the studio while they were making Straight Outta Compton yeah and what was your impression of not just the music but what was feeding this beast and where was this gonna go and how was this gonna change the industry I never think about any of those things I knew that like like when you said it was it felt like a a tectonic shift in music that was my experience just like as a fan it got me excited about hip hop again by that time after doing the stuff that we had done at Def Jam and having left hip hop was not so exciting to me for that window between after Public Enemy and before NWA there was this window of rap where I wasn't really paying so much attention NWA got me excited about hip hop again that's so interesting because through your lens you see see I never consider there to be a window between

[01:07:07] Public Enemy and NWA like when I think about I just think Public Enemy just like ran into the pack of NWA like there were a few years in between there see for me it was just like Public Enemy was everything at that point where's Chuck D from he's from Long Island I mean he strikes me as like lyrically one of the most cerebral gifted hip-hop artists of all time brilliant guy yeah I can't imagine and how much of an act is Flavor Flav like what what is he like when the mic is off or the same he's the same exactly the same he is a living cartoon character that is comical yeah see that's the thing about fun to be around well as I said that's the thing about music that sort of interesting is these personalities have to coexist sometimes it's a miracle to me that bands can actually stay together as long as they can many don't you it's there's a survivor bias that we might befall absolutely imagine think of how often marriages work right and that's between two people now you have a marriage between four people often younger with substance abuse problems it's hard for that to maintain yeah I was joking with my wife the other day we were watching this movie on motley crue and how is it by the way I haven't seen it yet I mean it's okay it depends like for me it's awesome because I love

[01:08:35] Motley Crue and so even though the acting is not that great or anything like that it's like and they're lip-syncing all the songs like it was I really enjoyed it because it's again it's taking me back to my childhood like I'm these were the songs that I was listening to in my basement doing the workouts that define my existence as an adolescent right yeah and for my wife like you know Motley Crue was not even on the radar maybe recognized a couple of songs off dr. feelgood but nothing before that and so we're watching this and I'm already knowing what's happening right like so I know in 84 you know like the accident and I know all of the details and at the other movie she asks kind of a logical question which is like how are these guys alive like how do they not just die 17 lives earlier to which I said my guess is there's just a strong selection bias in this the only reason we know about motley crew is that they didn't die and there are probably 20 bands that could have been Motley

[01:09:39] Crue but they just they died physically and/or blew up relationship-wise along the way and so you're sort of seeing the ones the one survivor is the one that sticks around it's sort of like in football right like half of being Tom Brady is not just being the greatest quarterback it's like not getting injured for that many years is sort of what allows you to you know you earn the right to play the game so when did you fully internalize that your role was not about making music as much as it was about curating a person's soul and helping them express this because I think the analogy you gave with kurt cobain is great right that is a beautiful image of a totally raw nerve that he's seeing the world in 4k color to what everybody else is seeing in black and white yes and there's good to that yes there's also bad to that absolutely did you realize that even when you were 20 years old no for me it started when I was 33 I got very depressed and I would say that

[01:10:50] I tend on the depressed side anyway which is part of where the sensitivity comes from to do what I do musically but at 33 it was crippling wasn't able to get on bed it took about two years for that to change and I had a much greater understanding of the artists pain after that experience do you know what precipitated that yes it was a phone call with the person who took over the company that I was partnered with the the major label so I had been in a good relationship with this company the person who I had made the deal with was politically forced out of the company after you know years and this new person came in and we had a phone call and he said several things that just sort of to anyone else this phone call would have been non-controversial okay see you back in LA and we'll talk about it then so you got wounded not because someone threw a spear deliberately at you no no no not at all I got wounded because I was so vulnerable having never really dealt with any controversy other than the one that I told you about earlier with the the guy in the UK who was not supporting our artists yes so this was another situation like that except this one was personally to me instead about the artist this was just and was this person saying something to you like sort of off the cuff like off the cuff you know Rick the way you did such and did you remember what it even was yeah I do but what it wouldn't help to yeah they wouldn't so something relatively minor that was credited with me as he said I this is the guy so the person just became the chairman of the most loved record company in the world it would be considered the top job in the music business and he calls me and he said I just looked at your deal and I'm jealous I don't really like it when you come back we should talk about it that was the whole call so help me understand will sent me in to test fitness the first time because you were worried that now there's this business thing that you don't want to have to think about and you have to go back and negotiate a deal or something well I my parents as I said earlier we're always very supportive of me then while still going to college we have this tremendous success with Def

[01:13:38] Jam so there's maybe been a from 33 there's been a 12 year run of nothing but success I mean there's all kinds of little little issues along the way match regular stuff but for the most part I have led pretty much a charmed life until I'm 33 and now this phone call it just like felt like a pin that burst the balloon and honestly truthfully I'm still not the person I was before that phone call that's how radical get affect how radically it affected me and I can tell you that it was I know that it was a tiny thing I know that anyone else would have not even read it would have not even registered and this thing that was catastrophic in my world then led to a much better situation that would not have happened that not happened so everything about it in retrospect was it only everything worked out for the best yet still the person who I was before was different and it just somehow triggered some vulnerability in me that

[01:15:03] I'd never felt before so interesting I didn't know this about you actually this is amazing that this has never come up before this is a this is profound and what's interesting to me in trying to imagine what possibly could have triggered that the first thing is well was there economic and security but that strikes me as highly improbable because one you'd already been successful into you were never even motivated by the economics of it it was it was the feeling of the rug being pulled out from under me is it because you'd already been through something with Columbia where you had seen that a big corporation can change their mind and that can jeopardize your music I think it was more I had always had the trust of the people I worked with even if they hadn't liked the choices I made I always felt like these people have my back big they get me and it was a sense of like not being seen that's what it felt like so you said for the next two years you had a hard time getting out of bed yes so what did you do during that period of time I went to I probably had two therapeutic treatments a day of different kinds I would go to see psychiatrists I would go to seek psychologists I would do acupuncture I would do herbal remedies I would do massage I changed my diet to be one that would better support my the brain chemicals I did I did everything that I could do short of taking drugs because that was a non drug taker until eventually I found a woman who was a psychiatrist who wrote prescriptions but who was also a psychic and I thought well if she's a psychic

[01:17:12] I'll go see her because I don't like doctors and I don't trust doctors but a psychic I could I think I'm at and I had another friend in the music business who who had started taking Prozac and he told me the wonders of Prozac as it related to him he said meaning the good or good that had blunted him and for him he said I will never not take this drug for the rest of my life it changed my life everything is better hmm which it still didn't feel like this is right for me but I'm really suffering I'm doing everything I possibly can to feel better nothing's working I was doing at that point I was only doing guided meditations because I wasn't able to do a self directed meditation but if I was being instructed I could do that and I would still show up to work Osho you were still able to sort of get through work at this time windows I remember engineers would come and bring me mixes and I'd be laying in bed and they would play the music for me and I would say what I would hear so what broke that cycle well the psychic woman prescribed paxil mm-hmm and I took it the first night I did exactly what she said I took its first night and it was the worst night of my life because she said well you'll take this you're not gonna feel anything it takes about six six weeks to two two months before you'll feel anything but it has to build up in your system we'll see what happens I took it the first night and went to sleep I woke up an hour later and it felt like there was a a race going on in my body like I felt tremendous energy rushing through my body and it felt terrible and I remember just wanting to be able to make it to 8 a.m. to be able to call her but like they just hang on and suffer through this feeling until 8 a.m. and then I called and eventually got her and she said okay don't take that anymore so that was a good good advice but then eventually started on this journey of looking for the right antidepressant and I tried many and it took a long time and every one of them made me sick in different ways usually more often had to do it nauseousness that first experience was different than the others you know all the others would just make me sick nauseous until I finally found the magic drug which was called Remeron mm-hmm and I took Remeron and again so each of these drugs I'm taking knowing they don't start working for six weeks and the first night I took a Remeron I could remember the room I could remember what was going on I took the Remeron and a half hour later it felt like all the light in the room turned to candle light and I felt like I was being cradled like what everyone has some really great sleep properties yeah that's interesting yeah and then what I didn't know I always had a weight problem with my whole life yeah what I found quickly was that on REM Ron ended up gaining yeah it drives you out 60 pounds in three months something like that a tremendous amount of weight but it helped me get through that period and you sort of had to break that cycle yes and part of that I think is at the risk of stating the obvious it's psychological like you have to get through the cycle to know you can get through the cycle to know that you're okay yes and the idea of getting off the drug which I always wanted to do was really scary because now I'm finally feeling okay how am I gonna ever stop taking this drug but then I did stop taking the drug and was able to manage and you're still impacted by this you still look back and see a different guy against 33 before that phone call absolutely what's better about Rick today than that Rick more empathic hmm you don't strike me as one who would have ever lacked empathy it's different than it was then I would say before that I felt more like Superman and I'd never felt like Superman since hmm interesting I can't say that that Superman feeling before was rational or correct sure but that's what it felt like you've worked with many artists who have died which one do you feel I don't want to say the saddest about because I it's hard to I don't think you can compare it in that way but is there one artist where a piece of you died with them or you felt like how could this have happened where you were most caught off guard or was there is there anything that just stood out because I mean I as I look through the list of all the artists you've worked with there are there are some tombstones there yeah it's I would say every one of them had a jarring effect in a different way in the moment obviously the younger the artist is the the more surreal it feels like the most recent one was Mac

[01:22:46] Miller that that wasn't even a year I was like last fall wasn't a sin and it just seemed like impossible it seemed impossible and I can remember when Chris Cornell passed I couldn't couldn't believe could not believe it when was the last time you spoke with Chris before he died how probably within within a year I would say did you work with Chester as well yeah produce three or four albums of Linkin Park so I can't even keep track like at this point it's easier for me to think of artists you haven't pretty but I couldn't believe it when I don't know why I would have any reason to believe or not believe I don't know any of these people but like

[01:23:25] Winchester died like that was really heartbreaking in a way that even in a way that I didn't feel heartbroken with with with Chris or Kurt Cobain even though that was such a big deal but I don't know why that one just like that was and I think also from a personal level I remember being really rocked when Johnny Cash died which doesn't make sense because he'd been sick for a long time right he's the one guy who dies of some chronic disease like the rest of us schlubs it really shocked me why why do you think that was well I was talking to him on the phone every day and he had been getting better and better there's that there's a you know who fill methadone is of course okay yeah so I sent film acetone to live with Johnny for a while and Phil helped you talk about yeah you helped me a lot yeah and after he helped me I send him to see

[01:24:20] Johnny and when Phil showed up at Johnny's house johnny was in a wheelchair and blind and Phil got him to walk and to see miraculously so I got to see that happen so I saw Johnny going from very sick to only getting better and better and better there was the setback when June died that was terrible and he really because

[01:24:45] June died pretty close to his death he didn't live much longer than I want to say it was within the year yeah I want to say I I'm pretty sure it was with an amputee but we continued he started recording every day after Jim died because that was his reason to be alive he wanted to he said to me he said you have to keep me very busy because if you don't I can't do this I can't I can't continue the movie walked the line with

[01:25:14] Joaquin Phoenix in it I love that movie and again I don't know how accurate it is and you always run the risk when you fall in love with these Hollywood movies that you're sort of but there are parts of that that you just know are true factually just based on what you've read including the loss of his brother and the sort of jarring effect that had on him and there's yet another example of we love this guy like we love his music and to me it only got better as he got older like his the gospel stuffs not nearly as interesting to me as

[01:25:48] Payne stuff and of course that's why we love it right like we love that this person can articulate something that is so deep inside of us that we don't want to think about or talk about and yet he can create a scaffolding upon which we can write our own narrative yes and feel understood but it comes back to this thing of like if only he couldn't have suffered so much like I can't help but wonder how much of the pain of his childhood and the loss of his brother and the shame with his father and like did any of that get fixed as he got older you know I just know it sort of makes me sad well it some of it got his relationship to it changed through his spirituality he was a very devout

[01:26:37] Christian and he found great solace in his religion but then like from the time I met him what year did you meet him I don't know years roughly like and here's a yeah the last 10 years of his life we worked together what was the last time probably met him probably so 12 12 years before he died we probably met the what was the last song he did he did they cover for Nine

[01:27:00] Inch Nails that was like is that that's got any one of the last songs no that was on the fourth album when we made six although you know what literally five and six I think came out after he died but we had been working on those maybe that's why I feel like that was the last album or one of Awesome's he did but I might have been the last one that came out while he was alive I feel like I remember reading at some point like he didn't even talk to Trent about this right he just and that always amazes me like when I hear of one megastar doing a cover of another megastar like I've always assumed like there's this hey you call the guy up and hey I love your song you mind if I do a cover no and and I remember you telling me once cuz I think

[01:27:44] I asked you like this last year and you said no any artists can do anything for any artist as long as they don't and then you said something that amazed me which was the key is they can't change the words like if they produce it exact a if they sing it exactly as the original artist did it they'll pay a royalty presumably but they they're allowed to do it whether the second artists rise doctor member if you told me this where I read this but originally Trent was not psyched on it right correct and this changed when he heard it it changed when he saw the video when he heard it he wasn't that sight he wasn't okay now but when he saw the video he got it

[01:28:18] I I would put that in the if I were gonna have sort of top ten songs that speak to life I think that has to be I don't know how that's not in it right yeah it's it's a beautiful song it's a beautiful song where did you guys do that just do it here we recording at my Houston in town did you realize what was happening when you were making that like what what did he come to you and share like I want to do this and here's why or how did it evolve that one we would pitch each other songs I would send him

[01:28:56] CDs filled with possible songs to try and I remember putting it at the top of the list it was the first one on the first on one of the CDs I sent and when he called he reacted to several of the songs but he didn't react to that one and then I remember on the next compilation I sent him I sent it again with the note I really think this first song could be special and he listened to it

[01:29:22] I think part of it also is I can't remember what I was sending him if I was sending him the the Nine Inch Nails version it would have been hard for him to hear that and know what it could be do you know what I'm saying it's like you know if you know the Nine Inch Nails version it doesn't sound very much like the Johnny Cash version and the funny thing is I loved the Nine Inch Nails surgery loved it great but I liked his more yeah and that I think again speaks to aging let's context also it's like when you're in your 20s and you're singing about regret it has a certain weight to it now if you're 70 and you're singing about a life filled with regret by 70 you're supposed to figured it out looking back with regret is a young man's game so hearing Johnny sing these words is shocking and there's a reality to it that's different or a gravity to it that's different than when Tran saying it just do two is eight has nothing to do with the individual pain they were feeling it it just has to do with the age really does change the way you understand these words do you remember when he called you after listening to it and finally saying like I got it or I'm willing to give it a try like what was it that that spoke to him about that what did he hear and there he just agreed that if it was important to me he was willing to try I see but he wasn't really attached to that so when when it was all said and done though he loved it yeah do you have a sense of what song he was most proud over what two or three songs he was most proud of over his career I don't know his career but I know of the stuff that we worked together there were a handful that he would remark that really meant a lot to him one was there's a Nick Cave song called the mercy seat and that was on one of the album's we did and I remember him thinking that was very special and and it is very special but that was one that really resonated with him there was a Sheryl Crow song on one of the album's called Redemption day you know you know and he said I forgot about

[01:31:31] I remember him saying I would give up all of the other songs just for this song when it was all said and done what a Cheryl what a Trent what do they think of this once he has put his his hand on it are they moved by that are they that they Cheryl was definitely moved Bono was moved by Johnny's version of one I think Don Henley really liked Johnny's desperado most of the ones where I've talked to the artist they liked it you know I have a huge picture of Johnny

[01:32:02] Cash in my office I should had to send you a picture of it I don't know if it's Folsom and it's a sketch so it's like it's a sketch off the very famous photo when he's on the stage and he's given the finger down but it's like this beautiful sketch that I was able to find great I remembered saying my wife I'm like I got to get this on a t-shirt and she's like don't be an idiot like why do you want that on a t-shirt like I don't know it's just so awesome like rationalize all the reasons why like don't you understand what he was saying and you know this is why he was in prison and this is what he was fighting it's like she said she didn't want to hear it she's like alright settle down over there I actually don't know if any of the things that you just said were actually true because what he was thinking was this photographer is a pain in the ass oh that's with you I'm totally sure and appreciation like I'm applying my own ridiculous filter of all but that's how what we all do all the time to your point right that's music I think you know this but do you know my son thinks

[01:33:00] I'm Tom Morello you've told me it's really funny yeah so the reason this all came up because there is an awesome video of Bruce Springsteen and Tom Morello doing the ghost of Tom Joad circa 2009 Madison Square Garden and so midst of the recession or you know like beginning of the recession I guess in some ways and I feel like Tom Morello isn't like a blue shirt or blue hat or something and I like with my daughter and we're like sitting there and we're watching this and we're just watching it over and over again cuz you know my daughter's so musical and I I love her getting to see these things and my son who's like four at the time comes in and he's like Daddy I didn't know you could play the guitar and I was like what is he talking about I can't you use you know Reese I can't play anything he's like no no that's you're playing the guitar and I was like oh no that's not me that's a name's Tom Morello and I started trying to explain to him he's not having any of it he's really like perplexed by the fact that like all these years Olivia's been playing the drums and you play the guitar and you've never played the guitar for us and I'm like okay Reese sit on my lap we're gonna watch this he looks a little like me but we're really different but for whatever reason on that night on that stage he was really I really do look like him and this took like a month of me having to show him this video to realize like that's actually not Daddy and [Music] yeah rage is another one of those bands like how how do they do that and and how did you see your role in curating is the wrong word like foster ring or providing the creative space to do what they're doing I mean talk about hyper intelligence anger all of these things I mean when you first came into contact with them and I don't even know enough about the history of the band like Zak and Tom were what were they doing before how did they merge tom was in a band that was signed to Geffen that had I think they put out a record that kind of came and went mm-hmm so of the guys in the band Tom was the most experienced mm-hm and Timmy and Zak grew up together

[01:35:26] I can't remember exactly how they found each other but the four magic guys ended up claiming each other and and how when did you get invoked on involved later I mean I knew them I went to see them I went see them play at the place called coconut teaser on Sunset Boulevard before their first album came out so this is late 80s at this point that maybe early 90s yeah and there were maybe 40 people there that was the first time I stand and did you at the time think this is I thought it was good but it was it was not a great way to see them it was a not a good place to see a show it was hard to hear it it was hard to hear what the music was actually doing it just seemed kind of like a din mm-hmm and a Perry Farrell from Jane's

[01:36:17] Addiction was the person who recommended I go see them he loved them and I went see them in it and it was again it was not the greatest show that show that I saw it probably was but there's so many things that go into what makes something work and it could have even had to do with my own emotional state at the time there's so much goes into it I'm really careful with the way I when people send me new music to listen to it can take me a long time to listen to because I have to be in the right frame of mind to be able to be present and open and feeling well enough to not let what's going on inside of me affect the music that I'm listening to it's not like I could just turn on all the time yeah so it may have been me it may have been the fact that the sound was bad in the room but my first experience of it was it was interesting but I didn't really understand what it was and then they made either two or three albums and then they asked me to make they wanted to do an album of covers they wanted to do a live album and an album of covers and we did both of those things we did a live from the Olympic auditorium and the album of covers which has the cover says are a GE kind of like the Gary Indiana love poster accepts as rage yeah yeah

[01:37:45] Robert Indiana I'm sorry during the Enna's place one of the things that happens when you start to digitalize your music collection is I've started to forget what album covers look like and it sounds crazy but one of the artifacts of being a kid making mixtapes is you knew the name of every single song yes all the time because you were writing them out and back then you had albums and you had lyric jackets and so you knew the words to every song and the name of every song in the album and you knew the cover in Beauvoir and it's like these days it's actually the exception when I can remember like again going back to the Beastie Boys like I remember exactly what the cover of Paul's

[01:38:25] Boutique looked like I remember everything about the jacket remember it was that crazy colors no like out of control like that like I don't know how they packed it all into that CD right and and of course I mean the picture I used to sketch I would sit there in eighth grade sketching out the airplane on Licensed to Ill and getting in trouble for not paying attention in class like I did you know and I feel bad that we don't do that anymore like I don't know maybe I shouldn't care that kids don't get that experience anymore but there really is something so cool about the anticipation of a new album and physically going there taking your lawn cutting money to buy said album to bring it home to listen and yeah I mean I know I just sound like an old guy like lamenting the past or something but it's a give and take I mean it's definitely the experience of getting new music is less special than it was but now you can listen to anything you want anytime you want you know there's no friction between you and the music which as a fan of music that's really great too is it different today so so I keep trying to you know like with my daughter again we listen to so much music and we I love to talk about this stuff with her and but I also realized that for example like Zeppelin is something that we are really really obsessed with and her drum teacher who's an awesome guy huge fan of John Bonham and you know we're talking about like you know what parts of this could she start to learn to play and blow LA and I

[01:40:02] I don't know why but it only occurred to me a couple of years ago then you know Zeppelin were only around for ten years like whereas when I was a kid it's like they were around forever these both hum I got into them they were already you know Bonham had already died in 1980 so I wasn't following them when they were alive but that was my first first CD when I fern ein teen the summer of 91 when I bought a CD player

[01:40:27] I bought the Zeppelin box set which was a 5 disc set it cost a hundred bucks like staggering sum of money it's really good though oh my yeah so so first CD I buy is this five disc Zeppelin Zeppelin box set the next one I buy is Rush chronicles I mean like only going with the best of the best is it a survivor bias again when we look back at the 70s and think of the great music of the 70s or the great music of the 80s or the 90s for that matter whereas today I just think like I can't tell the noise from the like I don't know what is it that my daughter listens to today that will mean as much to her in her mid 40s as the music we're talking about is it going to be the same or has this frictionless system that you've described changed the way she will list like will she look at Taylor Swift in 35 years the way I look at the Beastie Boys she might it's hard to know it's impossible to know and there is an argument that the music in the 60s and 70s was probably the best music ever made because of the barriers to make it and get it to fit like that you just concentrated more on the nation of all those things and the fact that the technology was such that unless you really good you didn't even get to make a record yeah yeah just a pure selection bias so that it's much easier to make anybody can make a wreck anybody can make anything now yeah which is great but but you just lowered the signal-to-noise ratio exactly that is my intuition as well the signal-to-noise ratio has changed the barrier to listening has gone away I love her telling me stuff that she's hearing that

[01:42:18] I would have never heard otherwise it's and trying to think like well this song be relevant you know five years let alone thirty five years yeah yeah it's hard to know it's hard to know even if we look back at music from the 60s or 70s and if you look at the things that really were popular them then some of them we still talked about and others that were equally popular then we don't talk about anymore so it really does there's so there's so much to it it's hard to know why or impossible to predict why yeah yeah for sure you know earlier you talked about the impact that

[01:42:57] Laird has had on you in terms of introducing a new dimension to your life which is the dimension of physicality so we go back to this period of your life when you were in the throes of depression Remeron comes along and gives you some hope in the process you gain 60 pounds remind me at your peak what was your weight the heaviest I got was 318 pounds and if I recall it was really film a

[01:43:29] Fatone or was it Barry Sears or film Afrin one of those guys was kind of the first guy that got you to make dietary changes and exercise changes that began the process of well phil was the first to do that but I will say my whole life fighting weight issues was part of my world and I would do everything I could to try to lose weight from the time I was a child my mom was obese so she had a stigma against weight issues because she had it and it's so funny now there are some people who are overweight and they think oh everybody who's overweight is beautiful and there are some people who are overweight and they think I don't like fat people because it's just their experience of the world so my mom was one of the people who did not like fat people who was that so how did that impact you if you were chubby as a kid well I always felt sort of ashamed of my weight and her mom my grandmother was very hard on my mom about her weight so it was sort of this generational generational chain when college were you trying different diets what were you doing - yeah even before college I can remember as a kid going to Weight

[01:44:50] Watchers that's a little kid so I tried many different things over the years and for whatever reason nothing really worked and then at the time that I became my heaviest I was vegan and I was vegan for 20-something years thinking I was eating the healthiest diet I possibly could and I just kept gaining weight was your foray into veganism like was it an ethical issue as well with killing meat or with killing animals or was it mostly through the lens of this will be the best way to manage my weight mostly with the eyes of health although there's the compassion side too but I would say the primary goal was to take care of myself and be held how old were you roughly when you reached nearly 320 pounds in my 40s somewhere in my 40s and it's sort of one of those things right where you think that's what lesser extent but I certainly remember when I was finally like at my absolute heaviest and I look back at pictures and things like that it's not like there's a day that you wake up and you're at that weight I mean it's been going on incrementally incrementally incrementally and I look at pictures over this span of probably five six years and I'm like I wonder what I was thinking at that moment like clearly I realized I was much heavier than I ought to have been what was your aha moment which was like I have to do something different well I was always looking for something different to do and my first aha moment was film a photo and I read there was a book by a guy named Stu Mittleman who ran a thousand miles in 11 days and I'm thinking I don't know how someone can run a thousand miles in 11 days when I can't walk to the corner without feeling like

[01:46:44] I'm gonna pass out how is this it just seemed like so unrealistic like what does he know that I don't know and I read his book and somewhere in the middle of the book he talks about him then I met this guy film a Fatone and he changed my life and I started to do training the way that Phil recommended so I researched and this was early days of online for me I don't even think I had a computer yet it might have been when TV something like that but I somehow found a contact for Phil math tone and I sent him an email and where was he at this time like Arizona Florida

[01:47:18] Florida and I asked if I could become a patient and he said he was giving up his medical practice and wasn't taking any new patients and you stopping being a doctor he didn't know who I was at all and he mentioned in the email that he was giving up his medical practice to become a songwriter and you couldn't make that I think that's unbelievable and I said I'm s

[01:47:45] I said well I got a deal five minute yeah I'm involved with songwriters and maybe you can help me with my health and I can help you with the song right as best I can and he was open to that so we see the first time we met was in New York City he was gonna be in New York something else and I was going to New

[01:48:05] York for something else and we happened to work out the timing where we could meet and he treated me in a hotel room and we became friends I started doing he would recommend programs for me to do and eventually and how much of it was nutrition related and exercise related oath he was both and and what were sort of those first steps that were being made you recall well I was still a vegan at the time and it was hard and he was frustrated clearly by me maintaining my veganism but he had me cut out all carbs carbohydrate restriction is very challenging with vegans it's not as challenging if you're a vegetarian but when you're vegan it becomes a lot of soy well and you just have to sort of like embrace a lot of plant fats and which are by themselves not I mean no fat by itself is particularly palatable but so you're going through this and when was the first kind of glimmer also had me get a heart rate monitor and had me start walking at my target heart rate for maybe the first 10 minutes and working my way up to eventually and do you remember at the time what your maximum heart rate was or at what heart rate you would begin to feel gassed well my heart rate would immediately go over my target immediately yeah just walking to the bathroom yeah yeah so it took time to kind of train myself down even just to be able to go for a long walk in those days on a treadmill because the place that I lived was not so great to walk outside I would do walk on the treadmill and at first it was snailed space walk and then it was able to get faster and faster and faster and still be in that target zone eventually Phil ended up coming and living in my house with me for a couple of years he came out here in LA yeah then he started having me doing stairs and I lived in the house that had one two three it was a three flight you could put together three flights mm-hmm and he would have me walk up the three flights and walk down three flights but always watching the heart rate so that and what was your target zone back then

[01:50:12] I mean Phil is a pretty big proponent of who's what a long slow zone too yeah yeah those probably I want to say it was 156 maybe was the target originally oh that high yeah interesting okay they don't my age that's what it was when did you start to include animal products in your diet well he convinced me to add fish and eggs which were two things that

[01:50:41] I never ate even when I was a meat-eater I never ate fish and I never ate eggs never liked them and he said those would be the best things for you to start on and don't think of them as food think of it as medicine and you need this medicine we'd find ways to mask it so we would do like a blueberry shake with three whole eggs in it mm-hmm and I eventually was able to find you know one or two maybe sea bass and halibut where the only you know mildest whitefish to this day those are the only fish that and even now I don't even know how they'd sea bass anymore pretty much just eat halibut just because it's so they don't need salmon no it's too fishy

[01:51:22] I'm gonna make you a salmon that you'll eat if I promise you okay I take pride in making salmon that most people don't even recognize who don't like fish so that my highest point my highest accomplishment of my life certainly top three is getting my sister to not just eat the salmon that I made but love it wowthat's and my sister is she's always been a picky eater as a kid and like just wouldn't eat fish if her life depended on it and a couple years ago her and her husband and kids were over at our place and I was making salmon and

[01:51:54] I was making something else for her because I knew she wasn't gonna eat this ham and she tried and she was like son believe I couldn't lose the irony of this course I learned how to do this from my dad so she grew up with my dad and making that salmon but she would never try it amazing if I thought of this I would have brought some salmon I'm tired and made it tonight hey we're gonna have a feast tonight my booty else she's does the reason I didn't have lunch today all in my red meat it and that's unusual for me I usually I mean I intermittent fast but yeah you yeah you don't you skip the first meal so you introduce the eggs you introduce the fish you're now doing the exercise what is the pace with which that weight is coming off it's not I would say over the two years of doing everything feel sad with him watching me do it yeah yeah I may be lost five pounds yes yes and he's and he was befuddled and he said I see what you're doing I watch it every day i watch everything you eat ninety-nine out of a hundred people who are doing what you're doing all the weight would fall off something else is going on I would love to go back in time and look at your blood work from that era I have a hypothesis about patients in your situation I've seen four or five people where that has been the case so that's probably more than 1% by the way and in my experience it's so interesting because I think I didn't have the luxury of being able to watch those patients as closely as Phil is watching you but I tell you I was a hundred percent convinced that they were also doing everything like it didn't even cross my mind that they're not doing it or they're lying to me like I knew that they were no and I and I know and I would trust anyone by what they say cuz

[01:53:40] I know I'm a disciplined person I just had bad information and now I finally had good information from Phil but I wasn't willing to fully embrace it because I'm in my head I'm a vegan I'm eating fish and eggs as a as medicine but you hadn't really gotta still be carbohydrates and I'm still a vegan no but I I gave up carbohydrates so so what do you think I mean that's pretty amazing by the way that you could stick to something for two years losing five pounds

[01:54:07] I mean you've gone from 318 to 313 well it was easy cuz who was there so I was like well you might have been feeling I felt a million times better and it changed my whole life he also changed my circadian rhythm I used to work all night and sleep all day he got me to change to normal hours he changed a lot of stuff and my vitality change yeah

[01:54:31] I definitely got healthier felt better I was just still big yeah so what was the next step the next step then he started having me add more animal protein through other masked ways like first one was we would make this vegetarian chili which didn't have beans but we would try to grind turkey and mix it in so it would still be like vegan chili but it would sneak in the protein that I was that he wanted at this point like I was vegan for six months I didn't experiment and in just six months of giving up all animal product when I went back to eating and this was a plan six months so

[01:55:14] I was like I'm gonna do this from January 1st to June 30th and I remember on July 1st when I went to the steak house to get the biggest steak I could eat one I couldn't finish it and two it tasted disgusting to know I had really in just six months lost my taste for meat I assume for you it was even more profound it was impossible impossible again it was always these masked foods you know for a while and then it was I think red meat was the last thing to go back in which was it was my birthday and me and moody L had gone out to a restaurant that makes a great steak although that was not something that I would usually go there any fish and we both ordered fish she was vegetarian and the plan was we would go if we would order a normal dinner but we would also order a steak so that if you want you could have one piece of it yeah which is what we do we had one bite and it was it felt like we were eating human flesh it was disgusting mm-hmm and we did that every maybe two weeks fur I would say it would have ended up being maybe four times where we would get through a couple bites of meat and then by around the fifth time back we just ordered steak it took adding a little more adding a little more adding a little more it's a bit of a tangent but two nights ago I made a venison stew and this is you know from venison that I had had shot with my bow and arrow hunting which I've become obsessed with by the way so we'll have to talk about this over dinner tonight

[01:56:50] I'm gonna get you on to this incredible wild venison that is like nothing I've ever consumed but whatever two days ago I'm making the stew I mean I just happen to like I can't like I've got so much meat in the freezer that I brought back but I can't always tell what's in the bag so they're in these huge yep locked bag so I'll just take one bag out and thought and that becomes the stew well I didn't do a great job of packaging I swear I didn't do a great job of thinking about it because it had like three hearts in there and kidneys which is fine because I'm gonna eat the organs but I was like I didn't want to eat them all at once so you know I thought these things out so I'm preparing it and I'm like my first thought is oh I'm gonna wait told like the kids get home so I can show them how to dissect the heart because the deers heart looks just like a human heart like it is the organ that is identical like their kidneys are much smaller their livers look a little bit and their livers are similar spleens a bit bigger but their heart is a human heart like it's indistinguishable so then I like yeah maybe that's not a good idea I don't know that might be one that might be one bit too far so so I'm just going through the heart and chopping it up to put it in the stew and it kind of like it comes over me I'm like god this is like this is a little weird because the other times I'd eaten deer heart it was in the field where it was fresh and this reminded me much more of an anatomy class because it had come out of his freezer and even though it didn't smell like the chlorophyll Laden hearts that you dissected in anatomy class it was firm in a way that wasn't natural and so it made the stew and I didn't tell anybody what was in it

[01:58:30] I didn't tell I told my wife I said just so you know you're eating a bunch of heart and kidneys and stuff tonight everybody loved it they were like dad this is better than any stew you've ever made because always make venison stew but I'm usually using like more muscle meat so they love that it was a huge hip and it occurred to me like it sort of made me think like it's upsetting to me to think that I could have eaten that on some level because doesn't this mean I could eat a human like if I was a cannibal that could have been a human heart that I would have dissected like it just weirded me out in a way that I don't really know what to think about actually but I was thinking about it today for some reason because I don't know I was carrying like trash out and something made me think like it must've been some leftovers or something I was like are they so weird that I just like my family just ate three hearts and three kidneys in the last couple of days and of course on the one hand you realize like that's actually the healthiest meat in the animal is the organs and that's you know when you look at our carnivorous ancestors they were only eating those meats they were actually giving the muscle meat to their dogs and to things like that they were going for these nutrient-dense organs that were incredible but everything becomes acquired and even that this is my first time putting a heart into a stew because other times I fried it but you're taking different cuts to it and I was like The Vow I don't want to eat the valve you know I got to cut that part out and stuff like that the hole and the atria are not particularly interesting I mean it's all about the ventricles so I can only imagine and I'm someone who's pretty used to eating meat so I yeah it's amazing to think what you would have thought yes eating a piece of steak and how disgusting that must have been yeah unbelievable unbelievable it seemed like how does anybody eat this stuff because even smelling meat cooking would have made me nauseous mm-hmm so you're feeling a lot better but obviously on some level you're sort of thinking gosh

[02:00:23] I I'd still love to lose a hundred pounds here I mean it's for no other reason that is difficulty on your joint instance I was so happy with the change in the way I was feeling that even though my main purpose was to lose weight the change that I got was not that but it was great yet I loved it and I assumed that maybe it's just a genetic thing and you know because my mom and it'll it'll always be mm-hmm always be an issue but at least I feel healthy now and then I was having lunch with Mo Austin who's a guy who ran

[02:01:01] Warner Brothers Records for 35 years he worked for Frank Sinatra he signed Jimi Hendrix he signed with Sex Pistols he signed Black Sabbath he's an unbelievable guy I went out to lunch with him one day we would see each other probably once every two months and he said you know Rick you're really getting big and I'm really worried about you and

[02:01:27] I know that you you know I know you walk every day and I know that you're strict about what you eat but something's wrong and I'm gonna get a nutritionist for you and I want you to go to see my nutritionist I want you to do everything he says I listen okay and I knew it wouldn't work but I was happy to do it's like I've nothing to lose like I'll do it but I've done everything and nothing has worked my whole life yeah so I don't know why that would change now but I'm I love this person and he's cares about me and if he's got an idea I'm open and I go to see his name is dr. Hebert at you UCLA and he hooked me up to a machine like body fat

[02:02:12] Hayden's here and he told me how many calories I burn every day and he told me what are the foods that I was allowed to eat and not allowed to eat and said you know you you burn twenty three hundred calories a day I'm gonna put you on a 1400 calorie a day diet and you'll lose and he said you'll lose this many pounds over this period of time just like psy is like no like hundred percent this out of this war and I didn't believe it at all and he also had me shift my diet to be based around protein shake so he wanted me to have six or seven protein shakes a day every two hours and then I could have dinner at night which would be fish soup salad out like a light dinner a low-calorie dinner with no carbs sir so this isn't amazed you could have that many shakes and that low that and any still eat a dinner and be under 1,400 calorie yeah because the shakes were a hundred and twenty calories each because while it was was

[02:03:26] Jay robbed egg protein powder and water yeah there's no nothing else in it hmm it wasn't so bad it wasn't so bad the first three days I felt really dizzy doing this and after three days it was no problem and and how was your appetite after three days fine because the the protein and the shakes was so satisfying and I had had them I had one as soon as

[02:03:55] I woke up in the morning and then every two hours and never really had a chance to get hungry and then I would have again this light dinner and I would spread out my dinner through the night so I would have first I would have the fish and some cooked vegetables and then an hour later I would have a vegetable broth or a chicken broth and then an hour later I would have a decel cyant salad but with just a little bit of oil a little bit of lemon maybe and I did that I was eating one piece of fruit and at that time too because it seemed really restrictive and I remember saying to him can I have like an apple a day and he said it'll slow things down but you can and I had an apple a day and really savor in the Apple so then the weight starts coming off yeah and then in 14 months I lost 135 pounds now that's also a testament I think to your being able to stick to it how did you manage you know the social side of things going out for dinners I mean certainly it was fine it was fun you would just order appropriately when you would go absolutely yeah who's who's pretty easy to do are you a disciplined person yes like with everything do you there any things where you like I I don't consider myself a very disciplined person even though I get accused of being one all the time because in I would say in some ways very much so and in other ways less so uh-huh but my feeling haha quite disciplined I would say I'm diligent so I don't like to settle I'll continue I have on the unhealthy side I can be a perfectionist and that can really slow things down so you lose some unbelievable on awaits you're down to you're below 200 at this list I met

[02:05:50] Laird when I had lost 90 pounds and there was a friend of ours named Don Wildmon who was at that time in his 70s super fit bicycle racer unbelievable unbelievable guy and jacked to give you an idea he was I think he was maybe when he was 80 he did 23 pull-ups on the beach at 80 years old Wow and looked like a bodybuilder his until he pet he passed recently maybe between a year in two years he passed away but anyway he was with Lehren and he was he owned

[02:06:26] Bally's fitness and built Bally's Fitness he was very impressed with the weight loss he just said units being in the gym business he said this doesn't happen often this is really remarkable and you might want to start training with us because at this period of time is Phil still living with you at this point those not living with me and all

[02:06:47] I'm doing is walking for an hour day oh now I'm up distorted jogging uh-huh Mike now I can on an often jog and stay mostly a trainer our day at my target heart rate yes and but you haven't started to lift weights yet or do anything so you're also kind of probably you've lost a lot of weight but you probably haven't you've lost muscle as well as fat oh absolutely although that was one of the things that that doctor

[02:07:11] Heber said about the the key to the diet is you want to have and he told me what the grams were I can't remember now it's like you want to have 200 grams of protein oh I can remember he said your target weight the first time he tested me he said your target weight you 2:35 coming from though the 3:18 and each time I'd see him the target number would go down but just making progress faster than he'd anticipated or the stats changed based on the stats where he wanted to see my it kept moving so it first was 235 that so it was 230 or so I said he was targeting you at one gram per pound of target by and he said if you do that you're gonna lose mostly fat and much less muscle diets like that have gotten people into a lot of trouble and unfortunately that created an enormous backlash against carbohydrate restriction because you know carbohydrate restriction is a pretty vague and broad concept right it can be anything from a ketogenic diet which is you know say a four to one ketogenic diet which is what you would give kids that have epilepsy where you're pretty much they're pretty much just eating fat

[02:08:32] I mean there's virtually no protein and certainly no carbohydrate in their diet and at the other end of the spectrum a low carbohydrate diet could be what you were consuming it's very high protein and you know there were some patients that got into trouble with these high liquid protein diets and like with anything you know you get you see one or two complications because the wrong person is consuming this when their kidney function can't handle or something and all of a sudden it you know the world isn't smart enough to appreciate nuance so it turns into anytime you restrict carbohydrates you're gonna kill yourself so when did you start reintroducing food because at some point let me say this another piece of this it's really important which is had I not done the work that I do with film yeah the diet wouldn't worked it was the combination of Phil getting getting my body working again you know and then actually the high protein and calorie restriction really changed everything for me because in the phil was a believer in you don't count calories you don't think about that so I might eat half the jar of almond butter every day better was healthy but half a jar mom but it might be 2000 calories just an almond butter forgetting all the rest of the food I was eating yeah yeah my guess is if we could have gone back in time and looked at you I would suspect that

[02:09:59] Phil fixed a lot of your fuel partitioning issues so when you probably met Phil my hunch is you were glycogen overloaded hyperinsulinemic glucose dependent I definitely was because I would get frantic if I didn't mean like really crazed yeah I aspirin I think what you're saying makes a ton of sense actually I would suspect that Phil fixed your fuel partitioning yes and probably fixed a lot of the hyperinsulinemia yes but to take in the next level you just had to restrict calories because when you restrict those calories you're going to deplete glycogen levels and you have to basically get you have to see it to take like a gin off the table yeah I'm actually convinced now I don't think I was convinced of this even two years ago or a year ago I don't think one can lose weight when the liver and the muscles are full of glycogen that has to be depleted and the two quickest things that you can do to deplete glycogen in the liver and the muscle are to exercise and to restrict calories above all else but within the calories carbohydrates are probably the most important to restrict so so when did the doc at UCLA when did you guys decide okay you're at a goal it's now it's time to start losing windows when I came to see him one time he's just like you you're at your target which was you know as I said like 187 I think just but you were already training at this point now because you'd already that started yeah when I'd lost 90 pounds so probably had another 50 50 ish pounds to lose but I started training at that point and I can remember showing up at Larry's house the first day and I could not do one pushup and and he said no don't say you can't do it so you haven't done it yet and then he would and did you know a lot about layer before you get on a not much other then he just knew he was some star surfer but you yeah and I'd seen riding giants which is a movie that yeah awesome user yeah and he just seemed like the most incredible person in the world and he is you know he's really he lives up to the hype you know he is that guy so I didn't go there to exercise with the idea of wanting the exercise I went there with the idea of I just it's interesting to be around people who are really good at what they do and him and the group of athletes that we train there were so different than anyone I've ever met in my life that it was interesting and where I would think of exercise as this sort of tuning out grunt work what I learned with him was that it was as mentally challenging as it was physically challenging because everything was like doing doing two exercises at the same time while you're balancing but it was very focus intensive which suited my same thing I do with music so it didn't feel like of now I'm giving up my focus to goof off in the gym right right this was a cerebral with certain things the first thing to give out was the concentration concentration or the I could only balance for so long before I would lose the ability to do the exercise so different things started coming into play that were fascinating and fun and with him it was everyday would be you do an entirely different thing and sometimes it would be weight training sometimes would be we're gonna do a hundred of each of these moves some days it was we're gonna do one rep of every exercise super slow or we're gonna just hold the weights in this for as long as we can or we're gonna get into horse pose and hold it for five minutes or just all different kinds of things different machines different and then the pool training started happening and I watched that evolve yeah what was the exercise I remember you telling me about that you would do underwater with a dumbbell there's a whole it started originally when he started it it was carrying heavy weights from the shallow end of the pool into the deep ah yes this is the one and then coming back you know doing a circle yeah underwater in the pool and that's hot started that was the only exercise and were you comfortable enough in the water to do that because for some halo being in

[02:14:51] Minooka that I felt best in the water and I was I really a politicked to get to where we started doing pool training as a regular they would do it sometimes for fun and when you say they who else was there was it mostly professional surfers I know - all different kinds of athletes it might be uh so this with like Laird's running at boot camp at his house he's running a boot camp but it's just friends coming to exercise because it's all anybody wants to do so you'll see a football player and a basketball player and a hockey player and just some guys from around town who were jacked and like the lift weights so it started it was Monday Wednesday and Friday was weightlifting and then on occasion we would do this pool workout and then we started making the pool workout a regular Tuesday Thursday and

[02:15:44] Saturday so Monday Wednesday Friday was weights Tuesday Thursday and Saturday was pool and I remember the day one day it was the time for the pool workout and land came down he said I had a dream last night and he said another part of the exercise was so let's say you have a forty pound dumbbells fifty pound dumbbells sorry the first exercise was the walk then you would go to the deep end of the pool he would leave the 50s he would swim up you would catch your breath and then when you felt strong you would swim down and do as many as many curls as you could underwater holding your breath and then you would swim up to get a breath go down and do another set and then you do as many shoulder presses as you could a lot of things are interesting about it you're in cold water it's not freezing cold but it's still cold enough to change things there's no lactic acid buildup at all your whole body's under tremendous pressure because you're deep underwater so how deep was this pool it's like 14 feet oh wow so you feel very safe lifting weights that would feel scarier to lift on land because you there was so much support from the water and also Archimedes principle I mean you're technically moving less relative weight because the water is lifting part of it yeah yeah we were lifting heavy weights and swimming up to get air and you can only do so many reps and even so many sets because you just got fried really fast doing that yeah and then he had this dream and he said I had a dream last night if we use lighter weight it would be heavy enough to hold us down but light enough whoo we could get up and get air holding the weight holding the weight so then we started with 10 pound dumbbells doing jumps like and it would be one breath per move because it was so did started taking on this yoga like practice and then one day is like let's try doing backflips so he'd come up get a breath and do a backflip and then land and then the next one was like now we're gonna and it became into their like 50 different exercises now is the period of time from which your first workout at

[02:18:13] Laird's house till you're doing back flips underwater with dumbbells is that a year maybe two I mean it'd be to that that it might have been two more because those exercises didn't exist two years earlier with him it's always up finding a new challenge and then learning to do it I don't know what's a more remarkable transformation the losing a hundred and forty pounds which is remarkable or the physicality as you put it of going from a guy who you know has a hard time walking to his car or walking up a flight of stairs to a guy who's hanging out with pro athletes doing pretty hard stuff I mean

[02:19:00] I don't know that I could do any of the stuff you're describing now actually I don't know if you could do it the first time but you could definitely learn to do it it's complicated you know ask up but that's kind of what makes it fun right it feels good it's not a I wouldn't say it's grueling it's fun yeah being in the pool is fun I mean if you're not just swimming laps could you know what I'm saying it's like the variety involved and the potential for new ideas it's really fun super fun and I even find it fun to just swim laps really yeah I get I get I guess I get in a good mood doing it but the first half and for me my goal would be to swim a mile and the first half of it would be pretty grueling but then the second half would be kind of like the downhill when

[02:19:48] I was training for a swim in Hawaii the time I lived in San Francisco I had to do the swim in June that was sort of my window to do it so you know you know what the water is like in June in Hawaii it's pretty warm it's about 80 degrees so I couldn't do my long long swims in the ocean in the bay because it was it's reverse acclimating I actually had to learn to do long swims in the heat yeah so a different yeah totally different you know there's a sweet spot like 70 degrees is perfect there you know sort of 66 to 72 is really the right temperature for marathon swimming so if you're you know if you're doing a swim in the 60s you actually actually have to train in the 60s and this was just the reverse it was training the 80 so I had to do all these long swims in a pool and that was one of the tougher swims to train for because in the ocean it's it's completely different yeah it's just well there's nothing to do with each other yeah it's it's mentally a lot easier to swim ten miles in the ocean than to ten miles in a 25 yard pool and you know so swimming a marathon is no different from running a marathon you have a very similar periodization of training where you know you'll I forgot I think I was on I was on a three-week cycle so each three weeks I was taking a step forward of you know 20% additional volume and then you would cycle up down up down with these three week Peaks or two weeks

[02:21:09] I can't even remember but I do remember the day very clearly when I had to do my longest pool swim which was not gonna be my longest swim I was gonna do one ocean swim in cold water just to get the really long swim in but it had to be I want to say like 28,000 yards in the pool without stopping which was about as long as the pool was open on this particular Saturday afternoon and the thing that I had learned doing these long swims is there's two options one you're gonna get in the water and actually feel good you're gonna just be having a good day and you'll know 1500 yards into this like it's gonna be a good day and the good news is if that's the case at least you're not gonna suffer for the next eight hours the bad news is you didn't build the mental toughness that you actually want for the real swim when it hurts conversely you're gonna get in some days and that first 1,500 is gonna feel horrible and it's only gonna get worse and you're gonna it's gonna be the worst eight hours of your life relatively speaking when you finish it'll be incredible because you'll have no you persevered through it and you didn't know which of those two you wanted in the short term you sort of wanted the good day of course so on this one day when I had to do my you know 28,000 yards or whatever

[02:22:28] I mean five hundred yards into that swim I couldn't believe how much pain I was in Wow and then a thousand I'm like oh my god this is gonna be bad and by the only way you can keep track of those swims is on the splits on your watch so I basically knew exactly how many strokes I would take per length and I knew to the second how long each lap was taking and I was struggling to hold that pace even at 1,500 yards where as the first 16 thousand yards generally you could turn your brain off and do it and so sure enough that ended up being one of most difficult swims of my life from a training perspective in the pool swimming the laps in the heat but when it was done I was like all right well you got through and so you you the benefit is on the other side of that so that was that was the one of the few times when swimming laps was unbearable but I can see what you're saying there's an athleticism that Laird who I don't know by the way but just he writes a column in a men's magazine that

[02:23:24] I love and you can tell like there's this interface between play and work and functionality sure and he's very creative right like he seems to be one of the most creative athletes I've ever read about yes and it's not just in his sport but it's also in how he's sort of revolutionized the way he trains it's the reason he does what he does in his sport is because the way he thinks he's very out-of-the-box problem-solving he sees something that no one's ever done before and thinks about okay how do we do this it's very different then we know how it's done and we're gonna just grind it out yep he's not he's not to grind it out he'll he'll grind it out if that's the job but what excites him the most from my perspective seems like is no one's ever done this before let's figure out the problem and then let's train to be able to do this thing that's amazing so this journey you've just described sounds like it took about five six years to go from the guy who can't walk to his car to the guy who's you know frankly I remember even seeing the magazine I don't know if story was six seven years ago with you and Laird working out and it was I mean a total transformation total transformation like I said the first day I went there I couldn't do one pushup I got to the point where I could do 100 consecutive push-ups which was you know crazy for for me that seemed insane how did this impact your work so to think for a moment that you're doing this incredible work with physical limitations I mean at some point not having energy to walk to your car must be impacting the energy you could bring to a studio or the duration with which you could studio I'm not sure I don't know that that's the case interesting I think it's almost like a different if anything I was just in a better mood I feel like I came alive through that process in a different way and I was already alive in the studio but maybe that was the only place I was alive before but through the exercise I became alive more in life so let's fast forward to last summer okay so we're sitting down to have a coffee in New York and you had stopped off on the way home from Italy the story just makes me laugh to this day because I can't believe it right you had called me and said hey I was once told I might have a or text enosis the ask was like what do you think or something like that and I think I just basically said you know Rick echocardiogram you know is pretty good but really cardiac MRI is really the way we want to do this and

[02:26:08] I'm sure there's a great place to do it in LA but I know I know the best place to get it in New York and since you're in Italy why don't you just stop by and we'll do it so great so you stop by you get the cardiac MRI and then we met for coffee around the corner and my phone is ringing right and it's like I looked done and it's it's Bob Peters who's the radiologist and I'm like I know why

[02:26:30] Bob's calling me it can't be that important I don't even think to put the two and two together that he's calling because he's looking at the scan you had if I remember correctly he called like 10 times he called 10 times and at which point like you know my spidey sense goes off and I'm like great I'm sorry to be rude let me just go see what this guy wants yeah and I call him and he goes are you nearby and I was like yeah dude

[02:26:51] I'm like a hundred feet away from he goes are you with Rick I said yeah he goes can you can you guys come by and I was like okay sure now I told you hey Rick this is Bob calling tech for us to come and look at this did you what did you think at that moment no I had no preconceived idea okay so it didn't seem odd to you because this is just well it seemed odd but I didn't know what to expect I can give you another odd look up just a little odd piece that happened before this which is when I did the last echo out here after I was in Hawaii and before I was in Italy yeah the reason that I had to do this this new test I do the test everything's fine I'm leaving the test and the woman who does the test says how are you feeling yes I'm feeling pretty good and she's like that's good like all things considered - something like that like like or in your condition okay like I have no idea what she's talking about and there was there a follow-up to that discussion with her leave you leave everything's fine so it's two months and

[02:28:07] I'm doing at this at that point in time Olympic deadlifts and squatting with as heavy weight as possible in this new experience of like the last 18 months have been devoted to just deadlifts and squats heavy oh and that's the other part of the story that Vermont that makes me laugh Wow bob is ringing me off the hook we are discussing a new deadlift protocol yes and I'm like all right you know I'll come up to LA and we'll do I want to really fix your deadlift and blah blah blah blah blah yeah okay so now three minutes later we're sitting inside and Bob pulls up this scan and again it's I'm more interested in your point of view because

[02:28:52] I don't need him to say anything because I've looked at a million scans so I can see it but of course if you haven't looked at one of these MRIs like what would you know it needs nothing what was your first recollection that something was wrong just the conversation that - you were having I was just sort of watching you you guys were comparing notes on what you were seeing right and and we're but we were also probably not even making an effort either deliberately or not to communicate with you I think we were just talking in the normal shorthand we would have spoken if you weren't there yeah again I don't really remember much about like what was said but yeah it's like nothing I've ever seen before is nothing Bob had ever seen before yeah but I remember the conversation where you guys together said you're gonna need open-heart surgery as soon as possible and I remember saying as soon as possible within the next year and you're like no yeah I said in the next six months and you're like no as soon as possible but not emergency because we want to find the right doctor right and

[02:29:59] I remember what I remember as you and I walked out of there I said oh by the way Rick all that stuff I was saying about the dead lifting scratch that you are not lifting a heavy weight until we get this resolved yes and you are very good I think at not demonstrating or maybe you don't even experience it but you never seemed stressed or panicked and sometimes you would just have to tell me that you were stressed but you never displayed this right like so so in some ways I don't think I understood what you were going through at that time I'm not sure that I did either and and I don't know that I was planning on acting on the information that we had gathered and

[02:30:49] I guess just for the listener I should explain what's happening since you've already nigh had asked you before this is this what the listener understands us I would not have brought this up if Rick hadn't been willing to talk about it so Rick you have something called congenital bicuspid aortic valve I was you were born that's right so so the aortic valve normally has three leaflets and this is you know embryo you know this is this is from the way you're born and a small subset of people are born with two leaflets and hence the term bicuspid as opposed to tricuspid and one of the real problems of a bicuspid aortic valve and I have two patients with bicuspid aortic valves who we just follow you know because we know at some point they're probably going to need surgery in fact I think Arnold

[02:31:32] Schwarzenegger had a bicuspid aortic valve and that's ultimately why he needed to have a similar operation but one of the drawbacks is it is more prone to calcification so it basically the valve starts to act like a piece of bone and it models itself like bone the problem with that is it becomes harder and harder to open and that is that that is known as stenosis so people with a bicuspid aortic valve are much much more likely to develop something called aortic stenosis and the aortic valve is what empties the biggest most powerful chamber in the heart called the left ventricle and so several things are happening one is as the heart is pumping the the ventricle is pumping its pumping against a greater and greater force of resistance and for transient periods that's wonderful it's great for the heart to have resistance but the heart being the most important muscle in the body has great adaptation and one of the adaptations is it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger and more muscular and more muscular as it goes against that so among the things that really stood out to me looking at your cardiac MRI was how thick the muscles of your left ventricle and your septum which is the muscle wall that separates the left and right ventricle they were without exaggeration twice the normal thickness of a man your size and that in and of itself becomes problematic for reasons that I won't bore you with but you can get an outflow obstruction in other words the the wall of the heart itself can begin to impede outflow so if that's one problem the second problem is you're now having a harder and harder time getting blood out past the aortic valve so you can actually have sudden death with something called critical aortic stenosis which you have and there's a threshold we use to define that based on the gradient and the pressure across the valve and the size of what's left so the amount of room in an area we just we say how many square centimeters of opening is there and once you're below a certain level it's called critical and once you reach that the probability of sudden death goes up significantly but there was a third problem that was probably even more frightening on the MRA which is the portion of the study that looks at the vasculature which was the size of your aortic root was very dilated and this also tends to go hand-in-hand with a

[02:33:59] Genesis and it turns out it's not entirely clear why one thought is the higher pressure gradient going across just stretches it out but I actually think the literature is pointing to the fact that whatever congenital factors lead to the remodeling or the defective valve leaflets and the remodeling also speak to not having the right collagen mixture or matrix within the a sending aorta because it goes up like an arch if the normal a or duck died ammeter there is about three and a half centimeters and there are adjustments you can do based on a person's size if you were even twice your size you the allowance would be about three point nine centimeters thank you we're like six point six or six point seven centimeters

[02:34:46] I mean it was again one of those things where we have these nomograms that predict the risk of a sudden dissection so a dissection would mean that that thing tears and unfortunately that comes with a mortality of I want to say two to four percent per hour that it's untreated which for many people means if it died sex you die and so we left and we went back and you were gonna fly back the next day and I was gonna fly back the next day to California and then the plan was we're gonna find you you know who is really the best surgeon to do this today because the last time I had looked into who's gonna be the best surgeon to do this it had been a couple of years and you know you want to go with the best person so what did you go home and talk about that night like again I guess I I feel like I wasn't being very sensitive to what that news must have been like to you I was sort of in business my the the from leaving that meeting with you until the moment the surgery happened those were the most difficult probably six weeks of my life mm-hmm terrified and my nature is not to intervene in medical certainly not in a surgical way and not even in a drug my instinct is always to follow nature not to do an intervention and I think I told you that 20 or so years ago my appendix burst and I never had it removed Brent and I remember I had a second version of an appendicitis maybe less than two years less than two years after the first one my doctor called the pharmacy to get the same prescription antibiotics that I took the first time that had happened and the pharmacist said well he had appendicitis two years ago he had his appendix out and the doctor said no he didn't have it out and this the pharmacist said well if he didn't have it out he'd be dead and you're probably not a real doctor and

[02:37:08] I'm not gonna prescribe I won't give him the drugs by the way it's so untrue it's it's in fact actually I may even told you this it's actually come around full circle today so we learned about the non-surgical management of appendicitis through you know the days of when sailors were going back and forth because appendicitis does have a very high mortality if left untreated yes but they learned that if you put a person on their right side with the pelvis down you could contain the rupture because the appendix is on the right lower he told me that no no and and so you you put somebody in that position they can abscess it off and it doesn't you know as long as it forms an abscess you're you're okay it's like when it becomes systemic and nowadays the approach to appendicitis is much less surgical it is a much more aggressive antibiotic routine but that said you are still very fortunate to have survived because the odds are not in your favor no and and my the only way was able to do it was my osteopath who's really my main doctor said I did a CT scan I think the guy who did the CT scan said okay you're gonna leave here you gotta go straight to Cedars I'm gonna call them and you're gonna get an emergency appendectomy and I said well what are my options and he said you have no options and I said well what if what else can I do and he said if you were my son I would say you leave here right now go to Cedars and get an emergency appendectomy that's what you have to do and then my osteopaths office was right around the corner I went to see him I showed him the pictures and he's like looks like you mean surgery and I said no way around it it's like I don't think so he says too bad were not in Europe so what are you talking about he said in Europe they probably would give you a bunch of antibiotics and tell you to go home I said well I wouldn't do the European style and he said well I'll help you do this but I want you to see a surgeon and

[02:39:08] I want you to do it under his supervision and we did that and I ended up coming here and what do you think was your aversion to surgery I mean it-it's obviously frightening under any servant having Neal I won't I have a needle phobia so any anything in any intervention like that and it all stems back it's funny you talked about the the heart dissection earlier yeah I can remember in fifth grade doing a frog dissection in biology class and it was one of the worst experiences of my life right so I've always been and I was afraid to go to the doctor as a kid I was I've always had a never felt right to me mm-hmm yeah I remember you saying that even just getting the MRI if they had to use a needle even if contrast it was gonna be yeah they said oh I'm happy to do any non-invasive anything whatever it takes and I can be very strict I just don't want it to have needles although

[02:40:08] I'm getting better at it now after this after what I've been through yeah well we ended up finding Joseph Wu who's the head of cardiovascular surgery at Stanford and you know in the process it was really great for me to get to know him and a good friend of mine Randy Greene who's a cardiac surgeon and with one of my mentors connected us with he did the heavy lifting he was like look because I was like well it's really this guy or this guy and he said you know those guys were the man five years ago ten years ago you want the guy who's the man today and it's you know with aortic surgery it's really about the reps like you want someone who's doing that operation constantly and he's doing that operation three times a week the average cardiac surgeon might be doing that operation five times a year yeah and I remember when you went up because you went to Stanford you went to you went to a bunch of places but I think you came back also realizing that it's not just the surgeon that makes it it's what is the what does the anesthesia team look like one of the nurses look like what does the ICU look like what is the step-down unit look like you have to have perfection across the entire spectrum yes now here's funny I'm gonna eat some crow the next six weeks were not only you going through what you were going through which again I don't think I realized until the day probably three or four days before the surgery that I realized how anxious you were because you mask it quite well and I was in New

[02:41:35] York and I was flying to San Francisco to see you the day after the surgery and it was a couple days before that that you called me but prior to that you are sending me emails and texts every day with cockamamie ideas to avoid doing this yes and I couldn't honestly at some point I was like I don't know if he's serious I was dead serious

[02:41:57] I was dead serious and I had something happen this was I don't think I ever got to tell you about this I got a call saying this is maybe three days before I'm supposed to go to Stanford and this is after you've gone up for your pre-op catheterization and everything this is oh that was I did that either the day of or the day before yeah okay same day yeah

[02:42:22] I've only met the doctor but I haven't done anything about it yet but I'm going in three days to do the surgery and I'm having I have a dinner plan with friends at the same restaurant where I had meet the first mm-hmm and a friend of mine calls me and he said I finally have found a cardiologist who might be able to help you he's not like the other cardiologist he speaks more your language and his name is dr. Junger or younger younger he wrote the book clean he's known more now for cleanses and nutrition but he is a trained heart surgeon and he also has an aortic stenosis personally I've pretty much given up hope at this point meaning you know if you've accepted the fact that you're gonna have this up likely I'm still thinking even the morning of the surgery was still 50/50 but I'm I'm more on the train of doing it than not I'd also seen a there was a Chinese healer who came to the house and did these ceremonies and she told me not to get the surgery and mu DL whose was very Pro surgery she's like well maybe she you know maybe you don't have to do it you know the healer says you're gonna be okay even then I was like I feel like I have to do it now I feel like I'm I'm past I'd lost hope at this point I call the doctor he's like I sent him all the reports everything history and current he looks at everything and he calls me back and he's like I have I think I have great news for you can you come see me it's like absolutely it's like the clouds have parted and there's a rod is speaking to you direct there's a miracle right and I say great I have a dinner in

[02:44:14] Santa Monica I'll cancel the dinner I'll come use it no no it's fine go to you dinner and then after dinner come and see me I'll be awake he was close by so I go to the dinner and I remember it was the greatest dinner of my life it was like the Last Supper I was oh no I was off the house it's like ah yeah this is where the world is like holders yeah unbelievable he was at the one moment of joy in my life was that dinner after these six weeks of after Sodexo's terror horror anticipation of yes and second-guessing because I still don't want to do it yeah and the guy has good news for me I go to see the guy and he said I looked at everything he had a heart model on his and he takes it apart he starts explaining everything me what's going on he's like this is great it's so lucky that they caught it they caught it in time and you're it's so great that they found this and that you can do this surgery like you're like good how does this he's like it's he said the fact that they caught this is the greatest news in the world if you would have just gone on doing your deadlifts without knowing this is going on there's a very good chance that you would not live long you know I look back at that and I'm sort of glad I didn't realize again I assumed you were definitely having the surgery but you were just sort of tweaking me by sending me text messages every day of funny ideas to avoid it yeah and I was like this is cute but he can't be serious and I don't know I feel like at some point I kind of read you the riot act about your son right at some point I said look yes you're being a little selfish right now you have a wife you have a son yes and you're way too young to die yes so you can't you have to I think I was trying to say like you have to do something that is really hard for you yes for them yeah I feel like you once you sort of got to that point it turned into okay how do I now hack the system and start doing things and I remember one of the ideas you had was I want to take methylene blue I want to have the anesthesiologist inject me with methylene blue and there and there I know you know why but for the listener the reason that this was of interest to you was you have to undergo what's called circulatory arrest so this is such a big operation this is a much bigger operation than even doing bypassing of the heart because you actually have to do a special type of cannulation to create another type of blood flow to the brain to make up for the fact that even the vessels on the top of the aorta are not supplying the brain anymore and this is a real reason why once I got to meet and talk with Joseph Lu I was really comfortable that this was the man because this is an area of surgery where speed is everything the human brain can only go so long without its natural perfusion from the heart and the difference between Joseph's doing this operation and somebody else was night and day and when he called me after by the way and we he read me all the stats

[02:47:36] I was blown away at how quickly he was able to do this it was literally in half the time I expected it would take at every step of the way so what the cross-clamp time was what the cannulation time was all these things your question was methylene blue can protect the brain I'm gonna have the anesthesiologist I'm gonna talk to him about doing this and that's funny I was really dismissive of this I would sort of like Rick you know yeah yeah I know methylene blue and theory could kind of work but don't rock the boat they're not even don't even ask them they're not gonna say yes Beauvoir well you ended up asking them and they said no but it was amazing it was two months later so the operation happens everything two months later I'm doing research for a podcast with a guy named Francisco Gonzalez Lima on Alzheimer's disease in the process of doing this I realize all of the work that he and his lab have done with methylene blue and I started going through all the studies and I'm like oh man I was I was really a jerk to be so dismissive of this to Rick I I didn't realize how much research was here and how much data existed on the neuro protective benefits of methylene blue and I would say to this day I'm actually one I feel bad that I was dismissive that but to I'm like I hope some anesthesiologists out there paying attention to this literature because I think there is actually an opportunity to reduce the morbidity and potentially mortality of these really really dangerous big big operations where it's unavoidable that you have to alter the perfusion of the brain yes and that idea came from dr. Jack that's right who's a neurosurgeon right and he said well he also said talk to your surgeon about this you don't want to piss off your surgeon you have to do what the surgeon says but as someone who's more focused on the brain than the heart while they're doing the heart surgery I would really like you to be have methylene blue in your brain yeah and again I I do

[02:49:43] I hope somebody out there listening to this whose cardiac anesthesiologist her cardiac surgeon is would consider doing a clinical trial on this beat and and again it's possible it's been done and I wasn't looking at that literature but it was I think it was actually a great idea and I remember I sent you a list

[02:49:59] I talked to Holloman you said any like I said any different long list of 50 things that I could do to sort of hack the system and I remember you said if you show this to dr. Lee he will not operate on you don't even show him this list you cannot do these well some of the things made sense right which were like I'll eat a certain way going into it if I showed up with more ketones in my blood would that be protective and I was like yes sure but you don't have to explain that to him right yes but the two things that I fought for which he said no to who are the methylene blue and to not use opiates post-surgery no no that made a lot of sense but they said no they said well they said we're not gonna manager they said no but then he he ologist well if you can handle you can do it that's right but his initial reaction was no I will not do this right and their reason in their defense that they would say that is if a patient is in tremendous pain postoperatively they are less likely to move they're less likely to take deep breaths their risks of infections are you know gonna go through the roof on complications but it turns out and this is a whole other issue post-operative pain management is a very poorly handled area and there are lots of things that you can manage pain with using a very good epidural you know a good epidural is the beginning of all great pain management following surgery and and liberal use of NSAIDs and

[02:51:23] Tylenol and things like that and you can get away with minimal opiate use if if not any in your case you know you've had as big operation as people get and to be able to get away with it it's huge there was one other thing that you were proposing that I thought in the theory made sense but I just thought there's no way they're gonna go for it which is just using exogenous ketones as well throughout oh and the other thing that you wanted which I again completely agreed with IV exactly

[02:51:46] I know dextrose instead of dextrous yes no dextrose and I'm like also because we'd be such a shock to my system because I'm already a no-carb person for you know two years and now I'm under the stress and now they're jamming a bunch of sugar into me that can't be good and I agreed with Jack on this that you know lactated ringers would have been the perfect intravenous solution and you could happily go days without glucose but in the end they were like look don't tell us how to do who said in his defense who was he said the reason you came to me is because of my success rate and the reason my success rate is what it is is because we do everything exactly the same way if we change any aspect of it I can't guarantee you the same results that you're coming here for so I forget I think I was either the second day after your operation your operation was a Wednesday and I got there on a Friday now I remember this I remember September 12th so um yeah I think that was a Wednesday so I feel like I got there two days post up and I thought you looked amazing but I could also see how frustrated you were that okay I did everything I was supposed to do I had this stupid operation but I think it was setting in that this was not you weren't going to be better in a week no and I think I even told you that so much of my frustration about it wasn't necessarily fear of dying although that that's that's a small part of it it was more this is just gonna suck for a long time yeah this is gonna be really uncomfortable for a really long time and it was yeah you know you developed atrial fibrillation post-op which as you can see when T percent of patients do a week's you know just couldn't get into a position comfortable enough to sleep when you look back at that and look at where you are today where do you think you are in terms of percent recovery I would say 90% so dr.

[02:53:59] Wu was pretty on the money right six months to recover yeah eighty to ninety percent yes that said had not picked up anything more than five pounds since the day we had lunch and went to see those pictures I do remember also when you got back to Malibu after the surgery I remember one day I called you and I was like how was your walk today and you're like I didn't walk and I said how come and you said it was too windy I was like what and you were like yeah I was just too windy I didn't want to go for a walk

[02:54:33] I was like Rick you gotta go for a walk man and you were like no no it's really windy and you send me a video showing me how windy it was I was like alright that was pretty good I'll give you that but I also sensed I mean did you struggle during that first month coming home like you know you're back home and your pain is okay thank God that the house didn't burn down until six weeks after the surgery because had it burned down two weeks after the surgery I don't know how would how I would have been able to handle it I mean as uncomfortable and terrible's the experience was at least the comfort of home got me through those first six weeks the first night after the surgery where I stayed in San

[02:55:17] Francisco that was my first night of not sleeping and I attributed it more - I need the comfort of home right and then when I got home I still couldn't sleep but I was definitely more comfortable being home and I remembered the you would send me the screenshots of your aura ring and it was it was pretty bad for a while yeah it really was and I can tell you this is one of those things that I think in medicine we don't get training on maybe it's changing today but certainly I don't remember ever once spending a moment not one second thinking about how is a patient going to sleep when they get home and when someone who's young and healthy like you they get over it but when you when you start operating on patients who are older or patients who already have even the slightest amount of cognitive impairment that sleep deprivation I've seen it on several occasions it precipitates a spiral that they never get out of yes looking back at that what's what is the most profound thing you learned about yourself I won't say this about myself but I'll say it about being a human that as humans we can really handle much more than we think it's interesting that the surgery would be something to point that out to you I would have thought that you figured that out just based on what you'd learn through your you know going from zero push-ups to a hundred push-ups to me would be an even more remarkable example but different that yeah that made me think you can train to do anything mmm which I do believe but it's different then you can't train to do a surgery that's just you just have to show up yeah it's again it's like something to overcome it's different your disposition makes it I think somewhat easier I think as an outsider looking in at you as a friend to go through these things but at the same time I guess it also the challenge is people don't always know what you're going through when you think back on that two years of depression with the people you are working with aware of what you were going through or were you able to do your job well enough that people weren't necessarily aware of that I can usually hold it together enough where people might not notice hmm what are you most interested in passing on to your son and maybe assuming you have other kids but in terms of lessons you've learned in life experiences both positive and negative I feel like one of the beauties of having kids I was talking with Eric before when we were just walking around and he was giving me a tour of the studio and there's that beautiful tree well there's a tree that's been cut down was true that just fell yeah yeah we could yeah yeah and I had to take a picture of it because the cross section of that tree is so beautiful and only because my middle son has become obsessed with counting the rings of trees did I even notice it and we went up then we were like talking I was like oh my god like look at this year versus this year versus this year you know we were agreeing that because he's got a young child as well but one of the cool things about having kids is you get to rediscover things that you once knew about that you've since forgotten about and now you get re reminded of it I also think another part of having kids that anyone listening to this who has kids appreciates is there's this desire to protect them from the things that hurt us so when you reflect on all of these things the successes the failures the fear the pain knowing that your son has to find his own way in this world what do you want to impart on him to try to have as much fun as possible to be prepared to work hard for the thing that you're interested in doing whatever it is knowing that anything that's worth doing is gonna take a commitment and you have to work hard and it and it feels good that it's not work isn't something to be avoided it's to be embraced but balanced with that idea of having fun which I did not have I had more of a workaholic side and I think so much of it has less to do with what we wish to impart and more to do with what we will really impart which is just based on how we live our lives yeah so it's not about what I can tell him it's about what you can show and living a loving relationship living in a loving household where we care about each other and making sure he always knows how much we love him and are there for him through demonstration

[03:00:16] Rick it's been awesome to sit down and have this discussion in what I'm willing to say is the greatest place I will ever sit down to record a podcast I'm willing to predict that already I will never again get to record a podcast in an environment so beautiful so until I next one yes there you go and above all else

[03:00:34] I want to say I was like partially worried that we were gonna do this in a sauna I like you did with Tim and I remember after I heard that because I was years ago right yeah yeah I was like Tim how did you not electrocute yourself like with the recording device getting just sweating all over the thing and he's like yeah I was tough and the real issue was that we were holding the microphones which were burning hot yeah that was that became the problem this was your idea okay there's no way this was Tim's idea that was my idea yeah thank you for not subjecting me to that as much as I do enjoy sauna I don't think I was kind of a one-time thing and it really was a case of having done a lot of saunas at that period of time I realized that the conversations that happen in the sauna are really good so it helps to turn off a part of your brain hmm that's maybe more guarded you're preoccupied in the sauna with survival yeah same as truth like with an ice bath you've done many ice baths yeah and you're experimenting with meditation now I know the best meditations you've had in your life I guarantee you were in the ice bath whether you knew it or not because it's a one pointed activity where the other problems of the world don't come with you into the ice that's a great point my

[03:02:02] IELTS is a forced meditation you don't have to do anything but survive but because of that you are very present and in the moment I look forward to giving that a try deliberately breath alright is it time for that awesome dinner I've been waiting for all day let's do it you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at
