## Description

Original release date: 7/2/2018

Rhonda Patrick, Ph.D. and I go on a Nerd Safari into the jungle of health, nutrition, fitness, performance, and longevity. We visit IGF-1 and whether there’s a tradeoff between having high or low levels. We discuss the PPARs (receptor proteins) and genetic polymorphisms. Does Rhonda think there’s any benefit in a NAD+ booster for health and longevity? Can saunas lower the risk of heart disease, dementia, and all-cause mortality? We dig into those questions…and a lot more.

We discuss:
-What Rhonda believes differently today than she did a few years ago;
-The paradox of GH/IGF-1 in performance and longevity;
-The role of PPAR in fat metabolism and ketogenic diets;
-The possible genetic explanations for why some patients don’t respond well to a ketogenic diet;
-The health benefits of heat and cold exposure;
-NAD+; and
-More.

About:
The Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking…and a few other things. With over 10 million episodes downloaded, it features topics including fasting, ketosis, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, mental health, and much more. 

Peter is the founder of Attia Medical, PC, a medical practice with offices in San Diego and New York City, focusing on the applied science of longevity. The practice applies nutritional biochemistry, exercise physiology, sleep physiology, techniques to increase distress tolerance, lipidology, pharmacology, and four-system endocrinology to increase lifespan (delaying the onset of chronic disease), while simultaneously improving healthspan (quality of life).

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive with Dr. Rhonda Patrick:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features an in-depth discussion between Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Rhonda Patrick, focusing on several key areas of longevity research. The conversation covers IGF-1 paradoxes, ketogenic diets, sauna benefits, and NAD+ metabolism. They explore how beliefs about certain interventions have evolved over time, particularly regarding caloric restriction and IGF-1's role in longevity. The discussion emphasizes the importance of cycling between different metabolic states rather than maintaining constant conditions.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- IGF-1 shows a U-shaped mortality curve, with optimal levels around the 70th percentile [48:19]
- Ketogenic diets can be obesogenic in rodents unless calorie restricted or time-restricted [09:49]
- Sauna use 4-7 times per week associated with 40% reduction in all-cause mortality [1:12:59]
- PPARα and PPARγ genetic variants may influence ketogenic diet response [1:18:19]
- DNA repair enzyme PARP acts as an NAD+ sink, potentially contributing to age-related decline [1:34:38]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Regular sauna use (20 minutes at 170-179°F) [1:18:46]
- Combining exercise with proper timing of cold exposure [1:25:12]
- Time-restricted eating within 9-10 hour window [1:28:48]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Ketogenic diet modifications based on genetic variants [1:32:06]
- Cold exposure timing post-exercise to avoid blunting hypertrophy [1:31:04]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Exogenous ketones can increase blood ketone levels to 6 mmol/L within one hour [1:37:39]
- NAD+ precursors may improve health span, particularly in muscle and brain tissue [1:37:29]
- Metformin's potential impact on NAD+/NADH ratio through Complex I inhibition [1:36:20]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
- High-intensity interval training can reverse decade of VO2 max decline in 24 sessions [1:03:41]
- Exercise timing relative to cold exposure impacts muscle hypertrophy [1:31:04]
- Strength training benefits extend beyond muscle to brain health [1:17:30]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Ketogenic diet requires careful protein limitation (100-110g) to maintain ketosis [18:59]
- Time-restricted feeding may enhance ketogenic diet benefits [09:49]
- Fasting may be more beneficial than chronic caloric restriction [06:28]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Blood ketone levels of 0.5-1.0 mmol/L considered therapeutic threshold [1:32:06]
- IGF-1 levels should be monitored relative to age and health goals [48:19]
- Inflammation markers may be most predictive of longevity [1:08:43]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Dr. Valter Longo's research on fasting and cancer [52:31]
- Dr. Eric Verdin's work on ketogenic diets [09:20]
- Nature study on lemurs and caloric restriction [06:28]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"The more we learn, the less we know" [1:02:00]
"Exercise is probably one of the best ways to increase mitochondrial biogenesis" [1:29:09]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Optimal frequency and duration of prolonged fasting for stem cell activation
- Impact of metformin on NAD+/NADH ratio and DNA repair
- Role of genetic variants in determining optimal dietary approaches
