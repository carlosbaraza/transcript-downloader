This clip is from episode Lower back pain: causes, treatment, and prevention of lower back injuries and pain | Stuart McGill, Ph.D. (#287 rebroadcast)

In this clip, they discuss:

- Understanding surgical context – Surgery should only be considered alongside identifying root causes and ensuring proper post-surgical correction
- Avoiding unnecessary surgery – In follow-ups, 95% of patients who were told they needed surgery successfully avoided it through alternative strategies
- “Virtual surgery” approach – Patients adopt behaviors mimicking post-surgical rest and gradual recovery to reset the body
- When patterns don’t fit – If symptoms do not match expected movement-based patterns, further investigation is required to rule out other causes

## AI Summary

I'll provide a comprehensive analysis based on the available transcript segment:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The discussion focuses on decision-making around back surgery, featuring Dr. Stuart McGill's expertise. The conversation centers on when surgery is necessary versus when conservative treatment might be more appropriate. A key insight is that 95% of patients who were told they needed surgery were able to avoid it through what McGill calls "virtual surgery" - a structured rest and rehabilitation approach.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- 95% success rate in helping patients avoid surgery through conservative treatment [00:00:58]
- Red flags requiring immediate surgical referral include:
  * Aortic aneurysm
  * Lung embolism
  * Metastasized cancerous tumors [00:02:50]
- Surgical indications include:
  * Heavy stenosis
  * Spondylolisthesis
  * Post-trauma cases requiring stabilization
  * Severe cervical spondylopathy [00:05:53]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Get proper medical screening before pursuing conservative treatment [00:02:50]
- Ensure pattern recognition fits before proceeding with treatment [00:03:58]

Context-specific recommendations:
- "Virtual surgery" approach: Mimicking post-surgical rest and gradual rehabilitation [00:01:38]
- Strategic desensitization of pain mechanisms [00:01:57]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:
Recovery Strategies:
- Limited mobility initially (e.g., "three bathroom trips per day") during virtual surgery [00:01:38]
- Strategic mobility and stability training [00:01:57]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"When I see a horrible scar on the outside of the skin, I think, man, if that's the pride that the surgeon took on the outside, what carnage is gone on the inside?" [00:05:09]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What specific protocols are used in the "virtual surgery" approach?
2. What are the detailed assessment methods used to determine if pain can be modified?
3. What are the specific rehabilitation protocols for post-surgical patients?
4. What are the long-term outcomes of patients who avoid surgery through conservative treatment?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Let's talk about the cases where you think surgery is really the best course of action. And again, I think it should always be stated that, you know, surgery without understanding how you got there and then making sure you correct it postsurgically is not what we're talking about. So, it should always be assumed that you want to understand what got you there. But what are the indications in your mind for where a patient is better off getting a surgical procedure and we could talk about the different you know whether you you know what do what do you think are the best indications for disquectctomy fusion etc. um versus when you think where would you take a contrarian approach where many people would say yes surgery and you would say let's push a little bit harder before wow a lot of elements there so I'll just uh start at the beginning and hope I can create a a logic story

[00:00:58] I did mention the followup that we did where 95% of people who were told they needed surgery in fact avoided it and what we did there was I anointed them and said there is your virtual surgery. This worked really well on people who I'll paint the picture of let's take a stay-at-home mom with two young kids uh every day has to go to the gym and ride the elliptical for 20 minutes, do something else as a stress reliever, otherwise she's going to murder her husb

[00:01:38] get your surgery. Are you going to do that tomorrow? No. You are going to lay in bed. You're going to behave like a post-surgical person. You're going to get out of bed and go for a pee three times. That is your total workload tomorrow. And slowly, you're going to build yourself back. In other words, surgery may work for you because it's forced rest.

[00:01:57] Now, I'm going to give you a tool that will mimic the forced rest. It's called virtual surgery. Tomorrow, here's the plan. Here's how you're going to behave. We are going to desensitize strategically the pain mechanism as we've measured it. And we're going to retune your body with strategic mobility and stability plus movement skill so we don't replicate the stress concentrations that caused your problem in the first place. Let's see how you are. Now, if they can do that, 95% will avoid surgery. So, there's my first little story for people in that uh category. just uh and and Stuart just to be clear are what are the patients who you would not offer that virtual surgery to? Give me an indication where you would say you know what we we this is too pressing.

[00:02:50] Obvious red flags which before we see a patient, we don't take patients uh off the street never. They always come through physician referral. So, I'm hoping they've been checked for red flags. Do you know how many have not? Even though we state in the referral directions to the referring medic, we've had cases of uh uh uh aortic aneurysm, lung embolism, cancerous tumors metastasized, um all sorts of things that somehow these poor people got through the system and we were the ones that found them and uh saved their lives. So I I wish that wasn't the case, but all of those obviously are surgery uh cases and they should never have come to us in the first place. So obvious red flags is number one. Number two is when the pattern doesn't fit. So I was smiling when you were telling your original story only because it was such a familiar spot-on pattern consistency.

[00:03:58] You fit the pattern. I knew exactly what it was. When the pattern doesn't fit, I'll say, "No, something's not right. I need you to go back to your doc and here's the reason why there is, you know, a targetedness under your liver. Uh we're not able to move that pain by moving stress concentrations around your spine. So, it's not a nerve. It's nothing vertebral or facet. the pattern doesn't fit. It's something else. So there is a person where we refer back and say something uh needs further investigation.

[00:04:37] But now the last part of your question was about the need or when we would say for a person you're not our person, you need to see a surgeon. surgeons. And by the way, we see far too many post-surgical patients who they went through. Maybe the surgery was botched. When I see a horrible scar on the outside of the skin, I think, man, if that's the pride that the surgeon took on the outside, what carnage is gone on the inside?

[00:05:09] Or sometimes it's a happens story. The nerve scarred in and adhered. Ah, that's that's rough, you know. or uh the postrehab was terrible. Here's a person. They went to a fabulous surgeon and the surgeon says, "Oh, well, go do PT. That's your rehab." And the PT goes and gives them toe touches or something after they've just had a micro disc surgery and guess what? They're reniated again and now we're seeing them. Um, but when would we say no, you're not for us here. here here the surgeons are at their best in cases of a real heavy stenosis.

[00:05:53] So there's not much room in the in the neural canal. The facet joints are thick in behind. So you got encroachment from behind. You've got a a calcified disc bulge coming from the front. Uh so a uh you know a a couple level aminctomy to give the the nerve some space that really is when the surgeons are at their best. Uh some of the spondyloalopathies that we'll see in the neck you know I think of a a lead lawyer in uh in the courtrooms and the judges would ask him sir are you drunk? And he said to us, "Well, when I I I stand, I start my presentation, I'm fine." He says, "But after 2 or 3 minutes, I'm losing my balance and falling over." And the judges think he's he's drunk. And then we found it. It was a cervical spondalomopathy that was also uh co-presenting with back pain, but no one had figured this out. Uh so that that was a uh a surgery case obviously. So, it's either uh post-t trauma and then that one's obvious. They they've got they need a little bit of hardware to stabilize their spine. Um but it may also be uh spondyolysis thesis. The lyssis or the sheer translation is just choking off the uh toquina or another nerve. Um it's it's best to uh and then now we we recommend surgeons who who we have really good luck with.

[00:07:26] What about what about nerve pain? What about patients who um are either having weakness such as a foot drop or significant uh pain like the pain I had where uh in the very first case where it was Yeah. Okay. So yeah, take take that away. Yeah, we we have them all the time, Peter. uh if I can get the nerve pain pain to move on the assessment uh please don't have surgery let us have a try at it most of the time they will be uh pleased wow and what you're basically doing is play with certain rules and give me give me an example of some of those. So let's say your assessment comes out that this person who's having intermittent sciatic pain um and um and and you do an assessment and you say look there is no doubt that you have a ruptured uh annulus here.

[00:08:21] You've got a protruding um segment of of disc and it is clearly at times depending on your activity getting nearer to the nerve root. It's driving that sciatic pain. But but during your assessment, I assume what you're getting at is through some of those positional things such as laying the person on their front, manipulating the legs, getting the uh the herniation to retreat into the annulus. If so, you're saying if you can demonstrate resolution under a changing movement pattern, that gives you enough confidence that this is this doesn't need to be removed surgically.
