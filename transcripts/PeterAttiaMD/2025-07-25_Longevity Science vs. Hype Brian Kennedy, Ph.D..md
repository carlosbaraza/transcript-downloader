This clip is from episode #357 ‒ A new era of longevity science: models of aging, human trials of rapamycin, biological clocks, promising compounds, and lifestyle interventions | Brian Kennedy, Ph.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Concerns Around Gene Therapy – While gene therapy is promising, it’s still early-stage, and the long-term data isn’t there yet to justify its cost or use
- Stem Cell Use: Potential & Pitfalls – Stem cells may help with injury repair, but there are major concerns about practitioner quality and safety standards in certain clinics
- Lack of Long-Term Data – Clinical trials on longevity therapies are limited by the need for long observation periods
- The Need for Better Oversight – The conversation highlights how hard it is for consumers to distinguish between reputable and dangerous clinics offering longevity interventions
- The Role of Scientists in Oversight – There’s a tension between academic researchers and longevity clinics, but collaboration may offer safer outcomes than isolation

The clip ends at [00:07:51], but focuses mainly on the discussion of various longevity interventions and their associated risks. Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this analysis?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] What are you seeing that you're worried about? What trends do you see that people are doing from a from a biohacking longevity standpoint that that have you concerned? Uh either and I'll put this in two buckets. The the higher bucket would be safety. The second bucket would be predatory behavior around basically people getting you know having having their money wasted even if the agents that are being sold are not necessarily harmful. >> Yeah. I I think the first one I I I'm excited about gene therapy. Don't get me wrong. I think it's interesting and it may really change the field going forward. I even kind of like phalistatin. Uh but I'm >> fostatin as a protein. >> Yeah. Yeah. But I think that those treatments are not very well proven yet and I would not do it. I I asked the question, would I do it myself? >> Spend $100,000 for folstatin gene therapy. >> I probably don't have to spend the money and I still haven't done it.

[00:00:52] Uh I I've done MSC's though IV to try that. And I think you know stem cells it's a it's a different question there. I think if you're repairing soft tissue damage or something like that and injecting them directly it probably works. Um for aging I have no idea. But I think it's probably safe if you have a somebody that's a good practitioner that knows what they're doing. But I think there's a lot of this is a problem with stem cells. you go places and you really don't know who you're working with and you know if they're really treating the cells correctly, if you're putting the right things in your system. And so there there's a safety concern there based on the practitioner I think. Um and so those are things that concern me.

[00:01:34] I I I'm gotten totally on board with growth hormone yet. I mean I think probably used correctly might be okay. The data is in interesting. Are you aware of human data that and I'm in your camp by the way which is I actually had a bunch of friends over for dinner last night and this came up and >> yeah I was sort of I said look I I I can't point to a study that tells you this is this is a bad idea >> and I've never spoken to a person who takes a modest judicious dose of growth hormone who doesn't tell me they feel better. >> So it's hard to believe it's not making people feel better. Um I also have never seen data to suggest it initiates cancer. >> Yeah. >> But it seems very biologically plausible that if you have cancer, small amounts of cancer, >> your probability that this becomes clinically significant is higher in that it um again I say that with no data. >> Yeah, me too. Uh, and so yeah, my view has just been despite my own interest in trying things, I I've I've I've left the growth hormone one off the list. >> Um, >> is that an answerable question, do you think? >> Yeah. And I I I think we could do clinical studies on this, you know, and some are being >> How would we address the safety concern, right? >> Because you really need to be able to try to track people for quite a long period of time with cancer susceptible >> and all of these things, right? We we don't know what the long term >> is and and I guess you know it's it's a gray area that you know this is a weird thing with these clinics right because you know there's I think from what I read in your book you're you're doing sort of validated stuff uh you're you're you're not really out there in the stratosphere doing crazy stuff that we don't know about >> some of that >> I would like to think I'm not but I'll tell you there are people who are very critical of my use of rapamy in in patients for for geroprotective reasons.

[00:03:31] There are people who might think I'm crazy for giving people SGLT2 inhibitors who don't have diabetes. So, so I think there's things that we do not not for all of our patients and I I again I fewer than 10% of our patients take Rapamy because my view is unless you're willing to have a very lengthy discussion about the pros, the cons, the risks, the uncertainties. >> And I don't give people an answer that says, "Oh, this is this stuff's amazing." My answer is I don't know. >> Yeah. >> Uh here's how I think about it probabilistically. Uh here are the tradeoffs. Um and >> again after after you can tell I'm not a good salesman if only 10% of the patients are taking it. >> Look, I I think that's perfectly reasonable. I but there's there clinics doing some really out there stuff and and uh how do we know the long-term safety on it? We just I think I think if you're going to go do that stuff, you need to go in with your eyes open. you're you're taking a risk. >> I've just seen so many horror stories of people that have come back from parts of the because you can't do this a lot of the stuff you can't even do in the

[00:04:34] United States. So they're coming back from South America or Mexico, places in Asia having done folstatin therapy or other um sort of very questionable stem cell therapies and >> I mean people that have had horrible infections like literally just artifacts of the treatment. That's a practitioner problem with this. >> Yeah, exactly. >> Um, >> yeah, I but you know there's some great stuff happening too. I work with

[00:04:57] Bumongrat Hospital in Thailand and they've got a longevity clinic now and they're very grounded and good science and so you but the problem is if you're a um consumer for these products, it's really hard to know. So ho how someone listening to us who's saying guys can you give me um give me some rules of thumb some heruristics for navigating the never uh neverending landscape of of uh longevity hacks that keep you know showing up on my Instagram feed, my Tik Tok feed and at cocktail parties. >> Yeah. I mean that could be new that could be diet books not just going to clinics in the around the world and I think it's really difficult to sort that out and uh >> because it's what I was going to say is it it's it's clinical practice and research at the same time it's a very unique situation right and and uh there aren't many examples of that that I know of that are really maybe some functional medicine is a little bit like that too but it's uh it's interesting and and I feel like it's better for scientists to engage with, you know, where it's possible to engage with these clinics and try to help them than it is to just let people do things and, you know, and without if you can provide oversight that's helpful, you should be doing it.

[00:06:21] And so that's kind of how I feel about it. But it's uh a lot of a lot of academics don't even want to work with these clinics at all, too. So, and and so I I get criticized for working with them sometimes. So, it's a it's it's an interesting world right now. I'm Peter Aia.
