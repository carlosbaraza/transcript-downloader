## Description

Peter Hotez is an internationally recognized physician-scientist in neglected tropical diseases and vaccine development. In this episode, they first follow up on the podcast episode (#158) with Brian Deer (the investigative journalist who exposed the complex and disturbing story behind the infamous 1998 Lancet paper by Andrew Wakefield linking the MMR vaccine and autism) with a broader discussion about the origin and evolution of the anti-vaccine movement. They explore some of the specific claims being made around vaccine additives, the timing of when vaccines are given, and claims about issues with the HPV vaccine specifically. Next, Dr. Hotez shares his own journey as a parent of an autistic child and speaks of the challenges of diagnosing autism, what could account for the seeming increase in the prevalence, and whether there is any support for the notion that environmental triggers play a role. They close out with a discussion on the state of affairs with respect to COVID-19 vaccination, comparing the various vaccines as well as the challenges that emerging variants of the virus may present. This episode was originally recorded on April 2, 2021.

We discuss:

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:10] hey peter it's really great to have you back again every time you and i sit down whether it's on the podcast or just on the phone i get the sense we could go on for hours um i want to really talk about a bunch of things today but i want to start our discussion with a broader topic than just coronavirus or sarsko v2 covid things like that which i know is a topic you are still front lines on and uh i don't think a day goes by that you're not being uh sought after for your opinion on things and we will certainly get to many of those things later today but but again i want to start with a topic that was near and dear to your heart long before the coronavirus emerged in this fashion which is the topic of vaccines and vaccine safety now recently i had brian dear on the podcast and i think for many people it was an illuminating discussion um because you know brian himself is not particularly a vaccine advocate he's very clear about that he's just an advocate for good science and i think his his work uh uncovering the web of lies and uh deceit surrounding the work of uh andrew wakefield is is really unparalleled especially when one considers the depths to which it was scrutinized both scientifically and even in the court of law so i think the first thing i really want to understand peter is why is it that after the complete debunking of everything that andrew wakefield did said published etc why is this still an issue why is it that in a post andrew wakefield world most polls would suggest somewhere around the neighborhood correct me if i'm wrong 20 of uh americans still believe there's a relationship between vaccines and autism yeah i think what what's happened and it's actually a very profound question and and i agree brian's work was extremely important and and then the scientific community came in in a big way debunking all of the assertions and one of the things about the anti-vaccine lobby that it spawned or that it ignited at least in the modern sense is that they kept from then on they kept on moving the goal post so it began in its modern form uh in 1998 with the wakefield paper asserting that measles mumps rubella vaccine causes autism by replica live virus vaccine replicating in the colon the scientific community respond in a very vigorous robust way publishing multiple papers large cohort studies showing that kids who were autistic and i got involved because i have a daughter with autism and you know kids who are autistic are no more likely to have gotten the mmr vaccine than kids who are not and similarly kids who get the mmr vaccines are more likely to become autistic than kids who don't and really sound epidemiologic studies but then they switched they flipped they said okay well it's not really mmr vaccine they had robert f kennedy and a group of people saying it's the thimerosal preservative in vaccine and then it switched again to spacing vaccines too close together then switched again to aluminum vaccines and now what you're starting to see is even shifting away a bit from autism saying that vaccines cause something called chronic illness or looking at the hpv vaccine for cervical cancer and other cancers and and then seeing it causes infertility uh or miscarriages and and each time the scientific community responds and what they do is to to maintain momentum to re-energize they keep on shifting and and the concern for me now is they're not even looking at this from a pseudo-science point of view what they're now focusing on is the politization of it so with this and we'll talk more about it but it it it's starting around 2014 2015 they managed to glom onto the republican tea party and to make it a politicized movement around these concepts of health freedom and medical freedom and that's what we're dealing with today now and you know that's why you've got all the craziness on fox news the last four or five nights with tucker carlson going on this rant against vaccines and laura ingram going on this rant against me and tony fauci and and so this is this is a problem in that it's that they have this adaptability and they create these versions 1.0 2.0 3.0 uh of the anti-vaccine movement but the autism piece never entirely left that's still it's that's still its legacy uh legacy fake assertion that that still haunts us today well i i mean i think given how deep uh brian went into the discussion specifically of mmr and autism that relationship i don't think anything else needs to be said on that topic and obviously for anybody who's listening to this that still has questions around that i would highly recommend that they go back and watch that video listen to that podcast read the book and um you know truthfully and i don't say this to be um you know i i don't know how to say this delicately but i think if if after all of that work if after assimilating all of that work you still believe that there's a relationship between that vaccine and autism there's probably nothing that can be said that can dissuade you from that and and i would just leave it at that and agree to disagree but let's focus on some of the other things that you've brought up uh do you have a preference for where you'd like to begin would you like to start with thimerosal yeah i mean you can but it but it always comes down to the same same few things i mean what happens is each time the scientific and in the case of with brian deer and the mmr in addition to the scientific community refuting it on the basis of large cohort studies and prospective studies what he was able to do was show nefarious intent and which was extremely helpful because knowing that what's happened since then is the anti-vaccine movement has grown so much larger than than wakefield now you've got dedicated antivirus groups national anti-vaccine groups like children's health defense and and i can and those kinds of things but then you also have um you have local political action committees pacs that are linked to far-right-wing extremism so it's become this very complicated ecosystem or web and and now it's even gone beyond the united states so yeah i mean we could go into why thimerosal is not linked to autism and then we could go into why spacing vaccines is not related to autism or what autism is now it begins in early fetal brain development but it won't stop the momentum of the anti-vaccine movement because you know they they light a fire they cause damage and then they move on and and that's their modus operand yeah i i don't disagree with that peter i guess the way i think about the role i'd like us to play in this discussion is i don't think we're here to stop the anti-vaccine movement what i'd like to do is help parents who frankly are inundated with information and can't distinguish between signal and noise at least come to a place where we can have an honest discussion about it because i really do want to have that discussion and i think the order in which you actually just went through them is a very elegant way to talk about this right which is let's spend a few minutes on thimerosal let's spend a few minutes on some of these other claims and then let's actually talk about autism because there is no denying the fact that the incidence and prevalence of autism are increasing and we should talk about what some of the plausible reasons for that are and why the scientific community has been able to rule out these claims that are being put forth um because again i i have great empathy for the parent who's listening to this who is confused um you know and then that doesn't necessarily mean just the parents of children with autism but that's the the the parent who's trying to decide what am i supposed to do here am i am i supposed to get my kid vaccinated and am i supposed to get them vaccinated at this pace and does my kid really need three h you know or hep c probably have b vaccines in the span of six months uh and and so i think just having an open honest discussion about that is is by no means going to dissuade the 20 of people who are clearly in the camp that says uh vaccines are evil but i but i do believe that there's a very confused group of people in the middle and i hope we can we can talk about that so um is it safe to say that post wakefield because i'm trying to go back and remember the timeline it was around 2007 2008 that i mean every claim of wakefield had been pretty much debunked correct and to your point it wasn't just debunked scientifically but i mean it had been made clear that that he had lied and he had manipulated data as head o'leary and this was one big house of cards yeah the the the lancet paper was retracted i think in 2010 okay 2010 uh although although i think there was an expression of concern put out by the lancet a few years before then maybe 2004 i can't remember exactly so and the basis for the retraction um is they didn't really spell it out that much they basically said the results are no longer valid i don't think the retraction letter issued by the lancet uh went into um all of the investigation that the medical council had done and uh and for for wakefield to be struck off the register i don't think the retraction mentioned anything about the brian deere paper yeah i think it was dear's reporting and and frankly the most damning evidence was the lawsuits right it was the complete inability of wakefield to maintain any legal argument against the people who were accusing him of fraud and and that you know so so let's put that aside and let's move forward let's start by telling people what thimerosal is and what is it doing in a vaccine well first of all thimerosal is really not in childhood vaccines anymore no but what was it there is a flu vaccine and so what happens is if you're giving vaccines and multiple if if you have a multi-dose vial of vaccines whereby you've got a vial of vaccine that could be given to six or seven or 20 people each time you're introducing a needle into that vial through a rubber stopper potentially you're introducing bacteria and the worry is that if you do that enough that there could be some bacterial growth or overgrowth into the vial so you need to put some preservative in to um that's non-toxic that could be that will kill the bacteria and and when thimerosal was discovered it was considered quite an advance in terms of allowing you to vaccinate large populations and the bottom line was it was taken out the manufacturers uh took it out of the vials just because of all the all the bad publicity swarming around it it there was never evidence to show that it was a problem but i think the thinking was that we don't really need it we can give single dose vials instead let's just take it off the table and in fact that was done there still some of the flu vaccines still have thimerosal in the u.s but i think that that's about not all of them you can still get a single-dose vial for flu vaccine and take that as well but um but there was never ever any shown association between thimerosal and any untoward effect in terms of certainly in terms of autism now thimerosal was one of the one of the the big uh push uh one of the big pushes from from uh bobby kennedy jr correct wasn't this really um his his initial cause in his initial fight i think so i think he got into it because you know he's an environmental law attorney and you know looks at toxic waste and i think you know when he saw the mercury word he probably got a link to minamata disease which is remember back in japan several decades ago there was a lot of mercury exposure in fish and young kids who were exposed to what's called methyl mercury either during pregnancy i think was during pregnancy um and the the kids that were born were born with intellectual deficits and there was a syndrome associated with it was called minamata disease and so i think i think probably people in his camp put two and two together and they said well you know probably autism must be some form of minamata uh disease even though it's not the same maybe there's enough there there that could be due to thimerosal but again the large cohort study showed absolutely no linkage uh with with autism um and ultimately we know why it's because we know autism is associated with prenatal events that it's as we have well we can talk about it yeah we'll come to that but that's the um that's how he got involved and there were books about it um there were a couple of books making these assertions and it also and then once again it started gaining a lot of momentum very much like the way wakefield did a decade before and i think the first publication which i write about on my book vaccines did not cause rachel's autism kind of points that out i should get the book in front of me i could read it right to you hold on this this is the book uh the last not this book i published but the last one's called vaccines do not cause rachel's autism and it's and uh we i go into it a bit um and while you're looking for that peter i'll just clarify for listeners the difference between methylmercury organic mercury inorganic mercury because you made the point um that thimerosal is a form it's an organic mercury and there's sort of a difference between organic and inorganic mercury right that that's correct and most of the toxicity that we see when people are over consuming um you know fish that are high on the food chain such as large tuna swordfish shark is organic mercury it is methylmercury not inorganic mercury right so minamata disease which was named after a city in japan it resulted from a chemical plant's industrial release of methyl mercury which is different from thimerosal which is a totally different compound it's ethyl mercury and it was in wastewater and it accumulated in a bay where fish and shellfish lived and were consumed as seafood and large-scale methylmercury ingestions and pregnant mothers caused a congenital syndrome causing neurologic disease in the form of gate and motor disturbances in some cases even coma and death and so there was a paper that was published uh at that time in a journal called medical hypotheses that first proposed that maybe autism could be related to thimerosal because even though it's not ethel methyl mercury maybe the maybe it's ethyl mercury doing this and and that was um uh in 2001 that the paper got published with three years after um the wakefield assertion uh any and so this was a pretty common uh preservative uh but but then it was subsequently uh taken out and what was interesting is even after was taken out the rates of autism never went down um that that's pretty clear and there were again large cohort studies showing absolutely no link with with thimerosal and all of that said peter it's i i certainly wouldn't want to suggest that the paper in 2001 and even the work that followed was anything but reasonable i mean that's the purpose of medicine right i mean you know you see something like autism you look for plausible associations and you see a neurologic disease that is associated with mercury it's entirely reasonable to formulate a hypothesis that says this other thing that looks kind of like it could be it yeah and and the paper was published in a journal called medical hypothesis exactly i mean it's completely reasonable it's the stuff that follows that's that's challenging right it's after the scientific community goes to great lengths and great attempts to seek the truth and publishes you know paper after paper after paper in mainstream scientific journals that the anti-vaccine groups refuse to acknowledge it's cling to their debunked hypotheses and their only response is well the scientists must be paid off by the pharma companies or the journals this must be paid off by the pharma companies or the editors must be paid off by the pharma companies and so they resort to conspiracies rather than rather than okay i get it let's move on let's try to figure out what really causes autism and they've never shown that in intellectual curiosity about what really does cause autism and they continually discount um the massive amount of scientific work that's gone into really uncovering what autism is before we get into kind of the deeper why because that's a big part of what i want to understand and there's two deep why's here run around autism and one around this sort of latent distrust and the path that any two individuals can you know there's a fork in the road right where one person can be very influenced by data they can think sort of probabilistically they can think in terms of uncertainty they can accept and and reason their way through these things and then there's another person who's going to cling to a belief in the presence of emerging data that refute that hypothesis and they'll continue to come up with an excuse and i really want to try hard not to pass a moral judgment in either case but but there's clearly an anti-science sentiment uh that is that is growing and that is uh that is fostering this before we get to that let's go to the next point which is thimerosal i believe was electively removed in about two to like very early in the 2000s right it was i think it was actually removed two years before um the the medical hypothesis paper i think it was removed in 1999 actually or at least it was that process was started so it had already been underway so what was the next what was the next uh position of the goal post after thimerosal so then it was this concept of greening our vaccines or making them more i don't know why they use the word green i guess making them more eco-friendly and that the that the le the third high major hypothesis was that kids were becoming autistic because of antigen overload that somehow they were getting too many vaccines at once this was overwhelming the immune system and somehow that led to autism which again never made a lot of sense to me how something you know because in an and they say it's leading to inflammation and i always would point out that you know we've seen we've seen what the brains of kids on the autism spectrum look like i've seen my own daughter's you know ct and mri scans in her workup of autism and we know what inflammation looks like you can see inflammation honest or evidence of inflammation or at least blood on on a ct or mri and and we know what herpes encephalitis looks like and autism doesn't do that it's not an inflammatory state of of the brain and so that one never made any sense uh either then and then there were several other people who came into this people like um the the pediatrician dr bob sears started writing books about how we have to space vaccines further apart and had written a number of book books about that as well but again it well first it never had plausibility and and but that that's still out there today there's and if you go on amazon.com and look at books on vaccinations i think those books are still top sellers now in the case of um thimerosal at least there was a plausible explanation that was put forth as a hypothesis when the hypothesis for spacing was put force put forth was there some epidemiologic data that suggested this i i i'm not i'm not aware of it um and the problem was you know we didn't have clinical trial data to support the the spacing of the vaccines you know the the the the protocol the this the current vaccine regimen the schedule is based on years and years of studies confirming immunogenicity and protection uh it's also based on years and years of study showing that there's no immunological interference in other words if you give pair two vaccines together that one doesn't interfere with the other it's a very carefully orchestrated dance and then these guys come in with these wacko schedules without any scientific basis and then you know that it forces the scientific community to try to re-evaluate whether you're still getting the same immunogenicity uh or not and also the immunological interference so in addition so it's not just a matter of saying well what difference does it make because kids are getting the same vaccines it's unclear whether they're going to be just as effective or safe as as the as that very carefully orchestrated dance that was developed jointly by the fda and cdc that's a very interesting point peter and frankly not one i'd ever considered i get asked not infrequently by patients about vaccinating their children on the schedule and these are not people who think vaccines are causing autism but they do have some concern presumably just based on things that they've read heard etc that say hey does my kid really need to have all of these shots in the first nine months of life and their uh their belief which is not unreasonable is isn't this just a way to ensure kids get their vaccines because during the first year of life the parent is so much more likely to come in for well baby checks and you know they're going to have much more frequent contact with their pediatrician and that that's the reason that this schedule is being imposed on us as opposed to any really biologically necessary again i use the example of hep b which you know most kids are really not at risk of hep b right unless they're you know well let me let me let me give you a different h disease as an example so haemophilus influenza type b um it's a bacterial cause of meningitis back in the pleistocene era when i was a house officer i was a pediatric house officer at mass general uh in 87 88 i would be admitting a kid with haemophilus influenza type b meningitis to my service every couple of weeks and mass general was one of the oldest pediatric residencies they called it the children's service and back then you know the house officer did everything you had to do the lumbar puncture you had to look at the cerebral spinal fluid under the microscope you had to do the gram stain and eventually sent to the lab but to confirm it but you would basically make the diagnosis right then and there and when you did it your heart sank because you knew that there was a high likelihood that kid was going to have permanent neurologic injury or might not even survive and it took a big emotional toll on me and and my fellow house staff to have these young you know healthy infants now get hemophilus influenza type b uh meningitis and at that time we didn't have a vaccine that worked in infants there was the the capsule of the haemophilus influenza type be the polyribophosphate capsule but it was shown that it wasn't immunogenic in infants so it was still licensed as a vaccine for older kids to catch the few older kids that could still make an immune response but it didn't work in infants why is that by the way because you need it it turns out you need to haptenize it onto protein and that's what john robbins and rachel schneerson did at the national institute of child health and development nih they figured that out and developed a conjugate vaccine that now worked in infants which now you could start vaccinating but until at that time you didn't have anything that worked in young infants so all you could do at that time is to take a prophylactic antibiotic called rifampicin which had the um unpleasant effect of turning your urine orange and uh reddish orange and and at that time i had my our first son born matthew and we were living uh right right across the street from mass general and i was terrified that i was going to bring him off of this influenza type b home so i took rifampicin all the time and i peed orange for two years practically to the point where uh one of the first and only fights i've ever had with anne was my wife was um permanent she accused me of permanently staining the toilet bowl orange because i was taking that antimicrobial and then this miracle occurred the miracle was you know john robbins and raquel schneers and also david smith and porter anderson at in rochester um figured out that if they attach that polyrobophosphate capsule to protein and haptinize it now you get cell responses and infants and it works and that happened that vaccine was licensed in 1989 as i was finishing my household training by for infants for young infants and now it's part of that early vaccination schedule by the time i um finished my and then i went to yale for my pediatric infectious disease fellowship i had a lab there and then i was a junior attending at yale children's hospital by the time i started rounding as an attending two years later um the disease had gone was gone it basically i taught the house staff about it purely for historical interests just like you know the old guys at mass general taught me about diphtheria and and tetanus that's how dramatic it was because we added it to the infant schedule and i think that's that's a good example of you know these infant vaccines we you know we you know to to get a vaccine through to be licensed by the fda you know to file that biologics license application first so it's very expensive second it's a hot lots of review it has to go through the biologic license process of the fda it's got to go through the verpac committee of the fda for review it then goes to the centers for disease control and the icip the advisory committee and immunization practices there's a lot of smart people that are looking at all of this to say do we really need this what's the cost effectiveness what's the benefit to society what's the benefit to child health so it's these are not decisions that are made lightly or you know these are these are things which are carefully thought out so you don't think that there's um [Music] some consideration given to this is a window in which the probability of vaccination is is greater just due to exposure again i bring up hep b just because you know you and i didn't get our hep b vaccines until we were adults right and of course i don't know when you got yours but for me i think i got it in medical school it was just on just in time given our exposure to hep b is enormous once you're in in the medical system because it's you know it's transmitted just like hiv um and and depending on where you trained you might be in a population i think i first got mine when i was we were keeping a lab in shanghai and china for parasitic diseases and i think going off to china frequently there's a lot of hepatitis b i think that may have been when i got mine but uh but you're right back then you know we weren't giving it to infants and and so i guess my question is and again i'm just saying this to try to take the side of the parent right i'm trying to put myself in the shoes of the parent who says this is too much and and again to be clear this is not the parent who says vaccines are evil my kid will never get vaccinated this is the parent who's saying right is this a little too much too soon um does a child really need a happy vaccine as an infant what is the probability that a child will be exposed to hepatitis b the only example i can think of is a child whose parent is in the health care system or frankly in the you know is an iv drug user who is themself a high risk for hep b and who is not vaccinated but outside of that you you could certainly make the case that a person does not need a hep b vaccine until they're you know an adolescent or at least a you know a youngster in school correct right but let's take a step back let's look at that example of the homophilus influenza type b no doubt no question in your mind that that that's what we needed absolutely especially given the risk is highest to that patient i mean that's a that's that's an amazing example of that right right and that's why i bring this so so the vast majority of vaccines are not given for trivial reasons and no vaccine is given for a trivial no no and hep b would not be trivial the the need is the need is more apparent for some than the others the exact reason why uh hepatitis b was selected for young infants you know i wasn't i wasn't at the table when that decision was made it may be that there was enough at-risk populations that it's very hard to cherry-pick individuals when there's so many people who absolutely need it that that it just becomes easier to vaccinate the whole population rather than say okay well you're in a specific at-risk ethnic group or you're in a specific at-risk occupational hazard on the other hand when you look at what that vaccine is it you know it's it's a about as uh low risk of vaccine as you can imagine it's a recombinant and we we make vaccines like this all the time it's a recombinant protein vaccine produced in yeast it's been around almost four decades it's been given to hundreds of millions of children with a really fabulous safety record so you know is are you what are you losing i guess is the other way to put it right let's talk a little bit about hpv this is some people hailed this vaccine as a miracle given the relationship between the human papillomavirus at least three strains of the human papillomavirus and cervical cancer this is not an insignificant cancer for women sadly many of us know women who have either died as a result of this disease or have been uh who have lost their reproductive capacity as a result of this disease so uh and and furthermore i think many men might even know the anxiety that a that a pap smear has caused their partner if uh it has shown one of the high-risk strains you know 16 18 a number of these things so i i i think for many of us when the hp vaccine came along it was a really big deal i mean this was this was fantastic news um can you talk through some of the controversy surrounding it both from a scientific standpoint but also from a a moral ethical religious political standpoint because i think that to me hpv might be one of the best examples of the intersection of all of those forces yeah so it came you know was it was about preventing this so hpv induced cancers like cervical cancer laryngeal cancers are predominantly sexually transmitted cancers there so if you look at infectious causes of cancer roughly about 16 of all cancers are caused by infectious disease agents like hepatitis b like like hpv and the numbers go up all the time because we get better and better at discovering infectious agents that cause cancer so in africa about a third of the cancers are of infectious origin and and this was uh developed by a group at the national cancer institute including someone who's very dear to me doug lowry um and and uh they were able to show that vaccinating against this virus would can prevent infection of the virus and therefore will likely prevent cancer and now new studies have shown indeed it's borne out that indeed it does prevent cervical cancer and on that basis the australian government has now launched a program where they think they can eliminate cervical cancer from the continent of australia by 2030. so that's really exciting to actually eliminate a cancer through through the vaccination process the issue has come up you have to vaccinate originally it was mainly focused on cervical cancers rather than the cancers and that would develop in males and so the recommendation was you want to have those girls vaccinated before their sexual debut before they start having intercourse as they get to be teenagers or young adults and so you want to get them when they're nine or ten year old little girls in time to make certain that everybody gets that gets vaccinated and i think that um that did not go over well with a lot of people because they now realized you know their their nice little nine ten-year-old girl is one day gonna be a woman who is sexually active and i think that was that was hard for some people um but in fact it has a remarkable ability of saving lives and and preventing cervical cancer and that's why australia has been implementing that in the us in contrast what's happened is we've allowed we have we have well we have a couple of problems first of all we're a big country the the access to the vaccine is not everything we'd like in rural areas it's not uh everything we like especially among underrepresented minorities and and um so there's a there's an access issue but the other big thing is this has been targeted now by the anti-vaccine lobby and they have tried to come up with fake assertion after fake assertion that's not supported by the scientific data so they claimed it was causing autoimmunity they claimed it's causing mis they linked a lot of it to female reproductive health issues they said it was causing infertility it was causing miscarriage and again one by one the scientific community had to do those big cohort studies to refute all of those links i guess this is as good a time as any peter to ask the first of several meta questions which is why wait you didn't give me feedback so was that convincing or or or were you still unimpressed i mean i mean what do you think the issue is no i i i i think that's a great point and i say that as a father of a 12 year old right a 12 year old girl which again i i i was just sort of joking with my mom this morning i i you know how your iphone will give you it'll give you like a flashback picture or video from some time in the past and oh yeah right so this this morning it sent me a video of my daughter uh when she was well she would have been seven and her brother her young her the next guy would have been one so seven-year-old and one-year-old and they're at the beach playing and it's like the cutest thing on the face of the earth and i probably watched the video like seven times and then i sent it to my mom and i said i'll remember when she was this little you know my mom made some comment like yeah enjoy it now because you know five six years she's going to be in college and blah blah blah so i get that like there is nothing to me that is both simultaneously amazing and sad as the the the natural uh loss of a game of tug-of-war that goes on between a parent and a child right as my friend rick elias described it you're playing tug of war and you have to lose by the time the kid's about 18. it's slow but you gotta you know so so i can see that like i i i have i again i'm trying to put myself in the shoes of the person who thinks this doesn't make sense and i think there's an argument that they would make that would say well i don't want my child i don't want my daughter let's just again i think this this is an important issue that we should explain why both male and female it's relevant to both but if we're just taking it through the lens that i think it first came through which is my daughter is 12. i do not want her to be sexually active until she is and i come up with some arbitrary age like 18. therefore i am not going to have her vaccinated until she is 18. another point of view is in an ideal world i would prefer she's not sexually active until she's mature enough to handle that i don't know when that is but it sure as hell isn't 12. therefore i don't want her to i don't want her to have this vaccine at 12. but the downside of of not vaccinating her in time is she could be cursed with a lifetime of of of asymmetry right there's an asymmetric bet here and it's it's it's i i just i i can understand why some parents might struggle with that even though i tend to think in terms of risk and probabilities maybe more than the average person right right i totally agree with everything you've said i think the problem now is that you've got these anti-vaccine groups specifically targeting uh hpv including i think now you've got children's i forget which it is whether it's kennedy or his organization is now i i saw it on his twitter he's filing some big class action suit against merck and company um for the hpv vaccine what's the claim i i don't remember but you know again this is this is what what's going on right now and um with you know i'm not aware of any evidence to support all of these things like infertility or miscarriages or autoimmunity what's really interesting also is the anti-vaccine groups have now copy pasted those assertions onto the coven 19 vaccine so they could be pretty lazy so they're just basically saying the same thing they did with because i guess it works for them that in that periodic way so but but as a result of that our and i said it's not the only thing because you have access and rural and underrepresented minority groups but you know we're going the wrong way with hpv vaccine we're not even close to thinking about creating a cervical cancer elimination strategy you mentioned laryngeal cancer as well i don't think that enough people understand the threat of that frankly all upper um airway cancer right i mean you're talking about cancers of the soft palate you're talking about lots of head and neck cancers are on the rise i can't remember exactly the stat but i want to say like the second or third largest growing cancer in young men is head and neck cancer on account of sexually transmitted disease yeah and if you talk to you know the head and neck surgeons we're right next to md anderson cancer center and within this texas medical center it's devastating the the very aggressive surgeries that you have to do it's really heartbreaking by the way we never finished the one thing about the autism which was you made the statement autism's on the rise i think it's important to clarify that i think we're clearly getting better at diagnosing autism i'm not convinced that the incidence of autism is truly increasing it's it's yeah and we're gonna we'll we'll talk about it in detail i've got yeah there's a lot of when i come back to an autism we're not we're not abandoning that um but thank you for clarifying that um so so yeah coming back to this point i wanted to make which is meta question number one why do call it 20 of the population and an entire cottage industry of of lobbies you know lobbying groups pacs etc come out so hard against this one class of drug whereas we don't see it for antibiotics right where is the where are the 20 of people who think penicillin is evil and the companies that make zofran or you're not zofran but you know pick your favorite yeah anybody or similarly like where are the companies that are coming out against insulin exogenous insulin that that all these diabetics are using because look i'm gonna be a skeptic for a moment i don't think there's a greater mismatch between drug companies doing wrong and profiting and spending overcharging patients for a medication than insulin like i think i think the economics of insulin are an embarrassment to how pharma works where's the rage like where are the 20 percent of americans that aren't losing their mind over what nova nordisk is doing yeah so so what is it about vaccines in particular that brings out so much ire so much skepticism and so much anti-science rhetoric i think well i don't know that i have all the answers but i think part of it is the fact that you're giving vaccines to enough for all not in all cases but in most cases you're giving vaccines to well individuals to prevent them from getting sick so you're giving something that it that's not always intuitively obvious that they need because you know as opposed to insulin as opposed to penicillin somebody is sick and somebody needs a treatment so this is being so that you understand but for a vaccine you're preventing somebody from getting sick and i think that simple feature is a big component of it i think the other is the fact that so many vaccines are mandatory for school entry so there is that kind of loss of choice that that you feel it's being imposed on you and so those two things become pretty easy to exploit unless you've got really strong vaccine advocacy activities in your community it's it's pretty easy for an anti-vaccine group to cherry-pick those two things and then you know we when you have conditions like autism and people want to understand how did this happen particularly the regressive form where people where kids seem to be developing normally and have normal milestones and then regress this makes this is easy pickings for an anti-vaccine group to come along so as an example if so for instance back in the 1900s in the uk they started anti-compulsory vaccination leaks and this extended to the us so i think it's the demand i think it's it's a combination of the fact that they're preventative not not therapeutic and the the mandate component i think those two are a toxic mix that get people some people upset about vaccines particularly in this environment which now dominates the internet i mean in the past when you had an anti-compulsory vaccination leak you know you could go to your physician the physician would explain why that's all nonsense and why you should get vaccinated now we've got something called the internet now we've got something called social media that dominates our lives and you've got amazon now as the single largest promoter of fake anti-vaccine coveted conspiracy books so most of the information you're getting now on a daily basis is actually anti-vaccine anti-science information but again i still i'm still trying to understand why the disdain for science is so prevalent so so hear me out on another thought experiment if if if the president says i want to [Music] cr i'm using this because it's the current example right if the president says i you know i have a legislative agenda that's going to propose a multi-trillion dollar infrastructure bill you may not think that's the best idea right well you're going to oppose that through legislative action you're going to oppose that through lobbying maybe that's not a great example i guess what i'm trying to get at is why if you're opposed to vaccines i can at least understand the argument around medical freedom because that you could at least stand up and say look i'm opposed to being told i have to take a drug to prevent an illness i don't have and then you could at least argue the merits of the individual versus society like to me that's a more palatable argument but the complete anti-science part maybe because i'm a scientist is just harder for me to empathize with like it's harder for me to put my self in those footsteps because i can't think that way and i but i want to because i think it's important to be able to think that way and not be dismissive of it if that makes yeah so here's what here's what i think happened which is i think you know maybe part because of my activities and you know i'm not alone others were involved in this there was a lot of effort to debunk the links between vaccines and autism and and and hpv vaccine and all the craziness that they asserted it caused and and i think it was taking some steam out of the anti-vaccine movement and but you still had enough parents in places like orange county that were scared about vaccines the causing autism that it allowed a measles epidemic to erupt and uh and there was and it was a pretty bad epidemic in orange county 24 into 2014 2015 it was linked i think the origins may have been disneyland where the epidemic came from what happened was the california legislature responded appropriately i think and said you know what we're allowing these vaccine exemptions but it's getting out of hand and now it's causing a measles epidemic and measles is a bad actor right it's got a significant mortality and permanent disability deafness and other things and they shut down the vaccine exemption and and i think that helped reenergize the anti-vaccine movement because i think they were losing some steam around autism and they saw this as an opportunity to rebuild to reinvent themselves and they reinvented themselves as a political movement around health freedom medical freedom and that's and it really amplified in texas so it where i am and it took off with they created political action committees like texans for vaccine choice it started getting and the pacs started getting other pac money and they the packs were giving packs the other packs money and there was a lot of money flowing and it was very powerful and they were able to convince the republican tea party in texas which is a very powerful group to adopt this issue as a platform issue and that's when it really started to accelerate and you started to see pacs formed not only in texas but also in oklahoma other western states as well so it was more of a western state phenomenon than than anywhere else and and so your political allegiance your identity actually became tied to not vaccinating your kid or to be skeptical of vaccines and then it all really blew up last year because those same anti-vaccine groups then started going up against masks and social distancing again under this health freedom medical freedom banner and now it became a full-on anti-science movement and you really saw this happen starting around and last summer when the epidemic moved into the southern states and people showed their political allegiance to the republican party by defying mass and social distancing and then it went up in the upper midwest as well and then you had that story that awful story of the icu nurse in tears being interviewed you know talking about a one of our icu patients whose dying words were coven 19 is a hoax so you that's when you started to see this kind of mainstreaming of what was a fringe group around health freedom medical freedom in 2015 and now become a major platform of the republican party going up against science and then you saw the targeting of scientists that's when they began really going after tony to dr fauci they began going after bill gates they've been started going after me quite a bit and now we're on now this thing is is steamrolling i mean you had tucker carlson last week going on this whole rant about vaccines and questioning vaccines and laura ingraham at fox news went after me a couple of nights ago specifically saying what i mean you have to forgive me if i don't follow this stuff too closely yeah well it's it's pretty unpalatable stuff i mean they would say that you know we we misled the public that we got it wrong that we didn't understand the epidemic and then they would parade out all the great barrington stuff about um no lockdowns even though none of us ever said lockdowns they they create these straw men that say we're trying to lock everybody down and we're hurting our economy and along with that they're saying that what's going on with these vaccines and and so tying and again this is a throwback to 2015 when the um when it was first linked to political extremism on on the far right so what was started out as an anti-vaccine movement is now a movement against any kind of public health intervention and demonizing scientists and you know basically calling us the boogeyman and that and and and it's continuing now you've got this this was exported last summer to so to europe you had these anti-mask anti-vaccine protests which for the first time used that same american language in berlin and paris and trafalgar square in london you had the new york times reporting how it's linked to cubanon um and other far-right wing extremist groups and so this this really concerns me and then of course to make it all the more complicated is the fact that now you've got the u.s and british intelligence talking about putin's government has been lobbing this whole program of what's being called weaponized health communication on our internet in order to destabilize the country and destabilize other democracies and and so what was kind of a fringe group arising out of the tea party in texas is now i don't know what you want to call it whether it's a anti-science empire or confederacy that has lots of moving parts to it but i'm concerned about the direction that continues to and the fact that it continues to build do you think this is just a sort of very vocal part of the republican party or do you think this actually represents an entire political party i mean it seems hard to me that this could represent an entire political party um given given that given that given the heterogeneity of beliefs that would exist across that from you know fiscal conservatives social conservatives i mean all of these things uh yeah and and the fact that the republican party historically has not been anti-science right i mean the national academy of sciences was started in the lincoln administration you know eisenhower launched nasa george w bush launched pepfar so you know this seems new to me and and i don't know how how much it's uh pervasive uh in the republican party certainly it's become now a major component of fox news in the evening and and as recently as last year i was going on fox news almost every day on a pretty regular basis and you know i didn't and i didn't see it until the disinformation campaign came out of the out of the trump white house and when they said coveted with this around a year ago last year when they said kovit was a hoax or the flu and you know attributed the covet deaths to other causes or you had kaylee mcaney say you know the hospital is the hospitalizations were all elective catch up in elective surgeries and discrediting masks and then later on in the summer they brought out scott atlas so there was no question about it this very um deliberate disinformation campaign coming out of the trump white house and i was one of the first to call it out not because i'm so brilliant but because i've been going up against these anti-vaccine guys for years and they've become unfortunate by default an expert in anti-science disinformation campaigns that could recognize it but it's i i see it accelerating and whether you know i can't say whether it's across the whole republican party but it's a lot more pervasive now among republicans than it's ever been and and then what's the evidence well the evidence is now the um the pbs newshour and uh teamed up with npr and marist and they've now uh found that if you look at the single most vaccine hesitant group in the united states this was just last week um it's it's what's called white republicans so it's around four i think it was 41 percent of why a significant percentage of white republicans are saying they're not going to get vaccinated and that's not the first poll i mean we did one with tech group at texas a m i'm not a social scientist but we teamed up with a group of social scientists at texas a m led by tim callahan in the school of public health found the same thing i think we called them trump voters and and kaiser family foundation also found the same thing twice that it's so this is the number one vaccine now i've seen another poll that suggested and it didn't slice the data by race and party it sliced it by race and party separately and it found the greatest predictor was indeed republican party association but the second was african-american right what's what's the best explanation for that so that and and what's more now it's coming down so whereas it's still staying so what's happened that you're absolutely right so about three two three months ago african-american groups and white republicans were sort of neck and neck and who was the most vaccine hesitant and it stayed up among republicans but it's been coming down among in the african-american groups and and one of the things i've been going on lots of podcasts and radio shows that reach black and brown audiences and and i was on one last night um with a with a baptist church in in richmond virginia and i asked the the the pastor i said are you seeing less of it now he goes definitely it's coming down i said what do you think is happening well it goes well doc i think part of it is people like you you know reaching out to black and brown communities but the other is a lot of the clergy have created a sort of an informal network now and and we're really hitting hard on the need to get vaccinated so i think that that may be part of it but initially it was quite high and i think part of you know what the reasons why i don't entirely understand you know what's often said is it's around structural and historic racism and that horrible legacy of tuskegee i think the other thing that i've seen though is deliberate targeting of african-american groups by the anti-vaccine lobby and and now i just saw on the internet there's a new quote documentary where i you know clicked on the the trailer and it's got people getting the pfizer in tech vaccine then it switches right away to tuskegee experimentation so by it's kind of making that that links i think it could do a lot of damage so but it seems to be somewhat resolving but still really high among the those group of republicans and you saw it you know when coven 19 accelerated in the summer in uh in the southern states and in the upper midwest in the fall and so how so what's going on and and and and i'm and i'm worried that now you've got again people tying their allegiance to the republican party or their um their identity to being against scientists and science and this is not good for the country yeah there are a few things i want to say and one thing to add um the thing that we haven't mentioned yet that i think is worth mentioning is the enormous measles outbreak in minnesota that occurred in the somali community that i think that story doesn't get enough attention because i guess it's now been enough years but i've always found that to be an unbelievably sad story in some ways more sad than the orange county outbreak because this was this was really a deliberate targeting of a community of immigrants uh you know not facile with the language and um and the measles outbreak was terrible there and i guess that's the thing i've always struggled with if you just put your common sense hat on every time a community gets targeted to stop taking in this case the mmr vaccine a measles outbreak shows up yeah and measles is sort of the paul off it always calls it the canary in the coal mine and it's um and and i think he's right it's because it's got such a high reproductive number of 12 to 18. yeah it's crazy um as soon as the vaccination coverage goes down measles finds it um and that was really that was the first time i think that you saw the anti-vaccine groups targeting specific ethnic uh groups so um lena's son at the washington post back in 2017 reported that wakefield who had kind of disappeared for a while was town hall meetings i don't know if he organized them or if the somali immigrant community organized them but you know theory was piling on and um and brought down vaccine coverage to over from over 90 percent washington post reported to 40 guess what's going to happen it was and i think it was 21 kids that landed in the hospital and then it happened again in 2018 2019 they began targeting orthodox jewish groups uh in new york and new jersey and what they did was just so offensive you know they started parading around in these phony yellow jewish stars like the holocaust with the word vax written in it and vax was written like hebrew letters and started comparing vaccines to the holocaust and that caused this massive measles epidemic across both in in muncie new york by the tampa z bridge and then in brooklyn and i think there are 18 people in the icu because of that 50 hospitalizations so this has become the new modus opera and then in 2019 you saw these series of harlem vaccine forums that they organized and even held one in the riverside church which is on the upper west side of new york near columbia university it's one of the iconic churches in the history of the civil rights movement the reverend sloan coffin and somehow got access there and held held their rally there so all of that is caused a lot of damage now this new document quote documentary that's coming out so i'm very concerned so you've got these as i say these multiple facets you've got the health freedom component expanding now across the republican party now into western europe you've got the russians uh fueling this with their systematic weaponized health communication and now you've got the specific targeting of of racial or and ethnic groups and causing a lot of damage and and the problem is it it it's takes time to explain right you can't i can't give you a 30-second unicef commercial about this you know how long have we been talking a full hour now you kind of get it now but it you know it's it takes time to to unfold and explain and um and the problem is people it makes people very uncomfortable um it made me uncomfortable right i mean i you know when i was going on cnn and msnbc and in last year at this time i i didn't want to call out the white house for their disinformation campaign i mean you know the met you know what we're told as scientists is hey peter just stick to the science you know you're not a political guy you're not a you're not an expert in in in white house washington politics uh what are you doing you can't do that and but you know i i s being ha being an expert in anti-science disinformation campaigns by being targeted by these guys i mean robert f kennedy jr calls me the on his instagram called me the og villain the original gangster villain so that's who you're talking to today i had to look up what og meant um uh so i i i unfortunately became a bit of an expert in anti-science disinformation campaigns and could smell about a mile away and i saw this and i said i know what this is you know you saw peter navarro out there with all the chinese conspiracies i said you know that we're being we're being gaslighted here and i and i said to ann my wife i said i don't know what to do this is taking me to a very dark place you know i'm supposed to only talk about the science and she saw upset i was getting she said peter you know if you don't say anything and and all you find out all this massive loss of life from kovid and didn't do all you can to stop it you're gonna hate yourself and that's all i needed to hear and then i really went after it and it was it took me to a very dark place and in part because you didn't at that time you weren't getting a lot of backing i didn't get a lot of backing from the academic and professional societies because you know that's not what they do and and um and so i really felt out there alone later on i think when it became safe you know other people uh came to my support but in the beginning it was a very lonely kind of thing to do i mean i'm glad i did it but it took emotionally it really knocked the crap out of me it was very tough to to to do that because the truth is i'm not that ideologically driven politically i mean i you know i was in washington for 10 years and as chair of microbiology at gw and one thing i learned in washington if you want to get anything done you reach across the aisle so you know we got a lot of neglected tropical disease legislation passed and you know i would think nothing of going to sam brownback who is now he's the governor of kansas back then he was a very conservative senator from kansas he would hold a prayer breakfast meeting and i'd go to that and i would speak and then i'd grow across the way and talk to senator leahy's people who's you know this very liberal senator from vermont and back then nobody thought twice about those kinds of things but it's not happening anymore so um so to be able to have to you know tear into what was going on with the trump white house and and it was often perceived as i was just being uh somebody in in in the democratic camp which wasn't the case but you know i understand why it was perceived that way and and now it's interesting is i um you know whenever i have something with the bind administration i think is not quite right um then i get then i get beat up a lot from my colleagues on the left and there's a lot more of those who say you know what are you doing after well we've been through how can you criticize the buy and wind up i'm really criticizing i think they're doing a good job but there are things that need to be changed as well so it's very tough to it's very tough not it's very tough to if your focus is only on saving lives and doing whatever you can to save lives that that's very tough because it means if you're sincere about that you go on newsmax and you go on fox news which i've been doing or and you go on a radio podcasts and that reach black and brown audiences that's what i've been doing so and hopefully at the end of it all i'll i'll be okay but it's it's not easy doing this peter is there a um historical precedent for um such a distrust of science i mean that you know given that the scientific method has only been around for call it 400 years that doesn't give us a great opportunity to look for such things but even in the last century or two have we ever seen such massive distrust for the establishment of science i haven't seen this distrust systematically certainly there's been a lot of pushback or anger around certain things scientists have said like for instance with um during colonial times when uh when cotton mather uh tried to vaccinate the the massachusetts colony against smallpox uh people were very aggressive with him and they actually threw a firebomb into his window around that particular issue so yeah that's that's gone up and down in american history but i've just not seen this systematic distrust of science and scientists and the targeting of scientists and and the mainstreaming of of anti-science that that's kind of worrisome and of course a lot of this is because now we have this new era of the internet and social media and and amazon and all those kinds of things doing a lot of damage so kind of want to pivot a little bit to something very personal for you um how old is rachel now now she's 28 to 28. so so let's go back in time 28 years tell me what you remember about her birth and the the first few years of her life so when she was so by the time rachel was born i had already had two other kids and i remember ann saying always feeling that something was off that you know she wasn't as huggy or clingy as the other kids were but didn't really come to medical attention until around 19 months of age that's when the pediatrician clearly saw developmental delays and referred us to special services and ultimately i was at yale which is i was an assistant professor then running a lab and that was hard for me because i was going off to china and keeping a lab in china and and now having a child with with a medical issue was was really uh was really tough ultimately had to give up going to china and re reconfigure our our program but at yale there's that's also the home of the yell child study center which is you know the one of the big thought leader places for autism and she came she was referred eventually to the yell child study center where the world's experts on autism people like fred volkmar and uh donald cohen and linda mays and and we got there was a child psychiatry fell in wendy levine who you know really looked into this very carefully and she was clear that she was she was on the autism spectrum and and it's a little tougher to diagnose for girls than boys because girls tend to be more verbal so you know oftentimes boys was she verbal at 19 months was she appropriately verbal well she wasn't always appropriate but she was always verbal i mean she would repeat there was a lot of echolalia she would repeat things but um she you know she had reason to this day she's got reasonably normal language skills it's just her performance iq is really really low and and so that's and that's one of the big issues with rachel it's the um it's the uh intellectual disabilities that go without that in her case that go with autism and in fact that's a very interesting side story about rachel is the whole cis ecosystem of girls and women on the autism spectrum because you know the older literature says it was ten to one boys to girls and that's because boys are so floored in their their presentation and symptoms girls can camouflage it better they can mask it better they are often verbal but they have very high rates of comorbidities like obsessive compulsive disorder or adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or even a lot of the teenage girls with bulimia and eating disorders now many of them may be on the autism spectrum so we're getting better at it so it used to be ten to one now i think it's moving closer to three to one boys to girls and some say it may even approach parity or something close to parity like 1.5 but but it's it's it's way under diagnosed and alison singer heads the autism science foundation has been supporting efforts to really call great because she has a daughter on the autism spectrum to look at this in more detail because it is so under diagnosed and but in rachel's case it finally came to diagnosis at 19 months of age and i got very interested in that because when you look back then at the cdc definition of autism it's i don't think it's on the website anymore but i guess of a couple of years ago it was still there it said most kids on the autism spectrum were diagnosed between 18 or 24 months of age and and i got very interested in that because there was a research group at the university of north carolina chapel hill run by this guy named named piven p-i-v-e-n who was able to show that that clinical expression of autism coincided with the big increase in brain volume expansion so you could actually follow this on serial mri and that's important because a lot of parents will remember when their kid was diagnosed with autism especially the regressive form because that's so not just all slowing of milestones but actually loss of milestones they'll remember that their kid got vaccinated you know maybe with measles or or something else around that time and want to link the two but now this group at unc chapel hill can go back much earlier you know back to infancy and show that there's already those changes happening in the brain and now of course we can show prenatally so eric corchesney's group at ucsd um in multiple groups now the broad institute at harvard mit has identified about 100 genes linked to autism spectrum disorder all involved in early fetal brain development many of them involved in neuronal communication so a lot of neuronal cytoskeleton genes for instance so we did holexum sequencing on rachel and ann and i at the at baylor genetics and identified a neuronal cytoskeleton gene a non-red cell spectrum a neuronal spectrum which you know makes a lot more sense in terms of understanding neuronal communications and and that sort of thing so i think what happens is you see the activation of genes in early fetal brain brain development and that sets into motion of progression but that full clinical expression of it doesn't happen until around 18 19 months of age often and that's not unusual for neuropsychiatric conditions all right i mean look at schizophrenia for instance which um often time you know kids with schizophrenia are not diagnosed adolescents or even young adults and um so this is how the brain works i think i'm not a neuroscientist but that's that's my take on this um what i mean just on a personal level how how did you cope with this realization um and did it ever cause you to question anything that you were doing um or was it very clear like were you able to sort of distance it or think about it through kind of a scientific lens even though it was something very personal and and it you know it became it went from being you know this is the scientific literature in its entirety too this is my daughter yeah well back in the 90s we knew a lot less about autism than we know now and all the things that i told you about a lot of it has only come to light in the last few years and then the wakefield paper came out and i remember that because i think rachel was about five years old at the time and you know and it was all over the papers and of course anne was asking me about it and to me it never made sense and said how can it be that i mean i mean they called it pervasive developmental disorder back then for a reason because it was indeed pervasive and and you could see that you know a lot of these kids were macrocephalic they had enlarged heads and uh um and so this was clearly a neuroanatomical condition i mean you knew that there were shifts in purkinje fibers and and and and there were structural alterations in the brain of kids with autism how can it be that a vaccine you give it one year of age would would cause that it just never made any sense to me there was never any so for me there was never the plausibility but the full weight of scientific evidence wasn't there i mean that was my opinion more than any and it turns out more or less to be true and um and but so that's why i was one of the early adopters of saying there's no way in hell it's going to be mmr vaccine and and it just doesn't make any sense it's going to sound like a strange question but was there a part of you that almost wished it was so that you might be able to say this would be amazing if we knew this because again at the time wakefield proposed this he wasn't even saying that all vaccination was bad he was simply saying they should be separate vaccines don't put measles mumps rubella in one shot give them separately this was his first thesis and so even wearing your hat as an infectious disease physician if if you could have believed that the answer was mmr combined causes autism and while it won't save my daughter to know that i could spare every other parent because clearly you know you you you exude the ethos of wanting to help everyone all we have to do is separate these vaccines and we could solve it i mean was there was there a part of you that just wanted this to be true not necessarily i mean i i i you know if if it made sense to me and and um uh if if there was a logical explanation and yeah if we knew there was a simple intervention sure but it was just so outrageous at the time that it that wasn't even on my on on my radar screen at that time to think in that way i just knew that it had to be genetic or maybe an epigenetic basis and and by the way that's a real treat trying to explain epigenetics to uh lay audiences i started talking about micro rnas and histone deacetylation uh that one i'm still working on but you know so the epigenetic component is another one that's important but again all of that had to be prenatal and and i remember having some conversations with some of the anti-vaccine people um and then saying it had to be prenatal and then they said and i said and we yes we do give some prenatal vaccines like um flu vaccine and then they the immediate response was aha and i said no i mean you know again i don't see how uh an immunization during pregnancy could be linked to that and now the scientific data supports shows there's no link so let's let's talk a little bit about the autism is still such a complicated thing in terms of people even understanding what it means so the definition has it has morphed a little bit so today we talk about asd being a spectrum um right and and it's gotten very complicated because you know there's this whole concept after of neurodiversity and so there are many in in the autism community who bristle if you even try to describe it as a pathologic condition they say no this is just an example of neurodiversity people are are different and and and i understand that and so the what i try to emphasize with rachel it's it's the au not the autism per se that's incapacitating it's it's it's the in her case you know she's got clear and profound intellectual disability um she can barely read she can't count numbers she can't do simple math she can't you know when she goes to the store to buy something she will hand them a fistful of single dollar bills and say here because she doesn't know how to count the money she no matter how hard we've tried to train her to do that she doesn't understand the value of things and so she depends on the goodness of the you know merchants in our local mantras neighborhood have been great you know and they kind of know rachel um so it's in her case it's the intellect profound intellectual disabilities that make it tough and make us worry because you know the other piece to this is now she's an adult with autism and intellectual disabilities and the special services and all that kind of stuff really falls off the radar screen because we have no plan for her right now we don't know you know we've tried to uh have her in a residential facility which you know i think did an okay job but she was just too her her behavior was too uncooperative and finally they had to kind of kick her out and so now she's with us and what worries me is i don't know what is going to happen after you know ann and i are no are no longer here um we don't there's no road map for what you do with an adult with just with intellectual disabilities and that that really worries me especially in texas it's just not strong with services of those kind and maybe it's better up in the northeast and we've heard new york and massachusetts but trying to work that as a huge huge heavy burden on us how is the diagnosis made today so if if a parent today or a pediatrician today suspects that something is not normal you know whether it be language delay uh you know changes in behavior emotional regulation eye contact all the things that would you know flag someone what is the actual process by which a diagnosis is made and what does this something that shows up in the dsm i mean how what is the what is the criteria for diagnosis it's still in the dsm the dsm is still not as strong as it could be especially for girls especially for little girls but um presumably it you get the child gets referred to something called birth to three which is an early intervention uh program and at some point they get medical attention typically to a behavioral pediatrician maybe a child psychiatrist only there are only about six of them left in the planet there's a huge need for more child psychiatrists i tell all my medical students to go into child psychiatry with the hope that one of them goes goes into it there's a it's a that's a real crisis as well um but uh and and then the diagnosis is made along along the way of uh limited social interactions in some cases uh lack of speech although again with girls and women it's different so there are a list of criteria that you can look at what's on the differential diagnosis like what are what are they trying to is it a diagnosis of exclusion where they're just basically saying here are a bunch of things that could present with this pattern and we're going to rule them all out and that which remains is asd or or you know because when you think about so many things like it's not like down syndrome where there's such a clear phenotype and genotype right like it's unmistakable uh this is much more nuanced well i think in in out years in future years you know we'll make whole exome sequencing so much more available that i think anytime you have a child like that you'll get whole exome sequencing and will actually be able to potentially target it to a specific gene in some cases that may be useful because there's could be pharmacological intervention in case there's something that is impairing abilities and and could be can be targeted can you explain why that's important why whole exome sequencing is relevant versus just quote unquote a genetic sequence well because with whole exome sequencing you're getting the gene of every you're getting the full sequence of every expressed gene and what that does for you is identifies rare mutations that you wouldn't pick up just by looking at at chromosomes and so it's a very powerful technology at this point it only picks up around 40 percent of so if you're have autism and you do whole exome sequencing my understanding is you'll only see a mutation maybe 30 40 percent of the time because there's other things going on including the non-expressed genes so exome sequencing just looks at the expressed genes but if you do the whole genome potentially you could pick up additional ones as well so we're still in the early stages of that what's very interesting in that was some children's hospitals are looking at the possibility of doing whole exome sequencing and every child they admit for whatever cause because we're learning so much about the genetics and epigenetics not only of autism but but so many other conditions right now you're left with what i consider to be somewhat rudimentary list of criteria from the dsm and i'll i'll never forget peter i once had a a lecture from a from a child psychiatrist and when i was in medical school at cornell and and i remember him saying you know we're gonna look upon the dsm is such a uh anachronistic or out of touch document for child psychiatry it just doesn't cut it's just really falls down for child psychiatric disorders and that was you know in the 1980s you know maybe it's moved on since then i'd be curious to hear from a child psychiatrist today what they think about the dsm but that i'll never forget that that comment and and when you look at the dsm criteria they're just not really robust for so many uh childhood conditions and again this whole concept of neurodiversity is not reflected in the dsm like like it needs to be it'll get refined and i think that combining with holexum sequencing and that combining with all the developments in neuropsychiatric medications i think this things will look very different 10 years from now and then 10 years again from from then do you have a sense ballpark how many children that are born today what what will be the incidence of autism in the cohort of kids born in 2021 well i think one is you know the the number that's thrown out there now what is it one in 62 i can't remember the latest surprise number yeah i mean it's it's it seems remarkably high well remember it could come close to doubling because we're not we're way under counting all the girls with girls and women with autism so it wouldn't surprise me that it would go down to something like 1 in 30 or now what do we think that was in 1980 for example yeah i don't even know but very rare because you know the criteria change you know before there was a very um strict criteria about non-verbal boys with certain repetitive behaviors and we've enlarged it so much and then it's going to get very murky right because we're going to go you know now with this whole picture of neurodiversity at what point is it a condition that warrants criteria under d and the dsm and what is it just being neurodiverse and and i don't know that there's going to be a cut off right it's always going to be that that gray zone so i talked to my my oldest daughter a lot who's an assistant professor at ucla she has a emily she's got a phd in developmental uh psychology and works at the center for disabilities and this is this is a real struggle in a and uh and difficult to get your arms around but i think we still need a lot of brilliance around the around these points at what point is it something that you diagnose in the dsm at what point is it not and and i don't have the answers to that right now when you consider something like alzheimer's disease and you look at the change in prevalence over the last 50 years it's you know there are many factors involved right people are living longer the diagnosis is much more we have many more tools to make the diagnosis and then there are also factors that many of us myself included believe are actually increasing the incidence so the prevalence is higher because people live longer because we diagnose more but because the true incidence is increasing and and why do you think and by that i'm just curious why do you why do you think that is uh because i think many of the risk factors for alzheimer's disease are increasing dramatically so vascular disease uh media metabolic disease being the two among them oh okay obesity yeah yeah as we see insulin resistance increase as we see dyslipidemia increase and all of the things that accompany it i think we're actually creating more neuropathology we're actually working with a group at baylor because you know we make vaccines there's a group at baylor uh college of medicine run by david corey who also has a collaboration with europeans that have shown some evidence of fungal involvement even candida because there are some of the some of the plaques that you see in the beta amyloid has got fungal fungal sequences as well and so you know what is the role of aspergillus and another and and yeast forming fungi fungi and this is getting very interesting yeah i i i i think that alzheimer's disease is probably the the for lack of a better word the final common pathway of many there are many roads right many different yeah yeah right and i do think that there's absolutely a sort of toxic version of it as well that may actually include infectious agents or environmental toxins and things like that so well well the hope you know with fungal disease you could do something about that you could vaccinate for instance again fungal disease could would that could a fungal vaccine become a you know help with reducing neurodegenerative disease so that's one of the things that we're starting to look at so using that as a model for thought how do you now think about autism right is it that hey we're clearly more attuned to this so we're making we're making the diagnosis more but do you also think there's an increase in the incidence in other words is there an environmental trigger that is either triggering this with or without manipulating the genome so now we're going to have to talk about what epigenetics means so people understand that you can have an environmental trigger that comes along triggers a condition for which there's a genetic susceptibility that does not alter the genome or one that does so and alters the genome so what do you think is actually happening and what are some of the plausible explanations well before i answer that let me just say just because this isn't complicated enough to make it even more complicated there's a there's a group at the geisinger in pennsylvania that's been looking at a number of psychiatric conditions and they've identified groups of people who families that have the same genetic mutation yet one individual has been diagnosed with autism another schizophrenia and another some other condition i forget it was addictive behavior or something along those lines so so you're right it it you know genetics is dominant but i think there are epigenetic factors that that could have some influencing role and most likely it's it's going on in pregnancy so so when you talk about epigenetics that doesn't discount entirely environmental factors but but if it is it's environmental factors happening in pregnancy so explain why it has to be an environmental factor in pregnancy versus an environmental factor post utero because i think and and again i'm not a neuroscientist but i think that the structural changes in the brain and and is are already well underway by the time the baby's born so that their processes that are set into mo when you look at all the work coming out of you know eric corchesney's lab and other labs there it's clearly showing that this is going on pretty early fetal early on in fetal brain development may be as late as the second trimester but but but happening in utero and and that's where all the action is occurring so that if it is an environmental if there is environmental influences it's most likely something happening in pregnancy so if if if you're a parent or a soon-to-be parent and you're listening to this you're terrified right i mean it's terrifying enough to think that during the first six months of your pregnancy the first and second trimester so many things can go wrong i mean obviously during the first trimester you're mostly just thinking about not miscarrying and then once you sort of get through call it week 8 9 10 and you're thinking okay well we're almost halfway to the point of knowing we're not gonna being confident we're not gonna miscarry then you start to think about big structural stuff is the heart okay does this thing you know have four chambers is the brain of normal size you know to think that there's some environmental trigger that could take a genetically susceptible fetus and render them autistic um [Music] i can't imagine how that doesn't produce an incredible amount of speculation uh and consternation right but but i think you have to be careful with your language so it's not just genetically susceptible i mean the genes are there and they're are these deterministic they're that they're causing autism there might be some environmental influences that could that could affect expression through epigenetics but uh it's not so simple as to say genetic susceptibility i don't think it's it's quite i don't think it's quite that straightforward how deterministic do we think these genes are then i can't i can't give you uh i can't get i know you're what you're looking for you're looking for an 80 20 90 10 70 30 i uh and i don't i i don't think we i don't think we know that i mean it's polygenic presumably what do we think here well in rachel's case it seemed to be as so far as what we know it's a single gene and i think that's true but but they're not all the same genes so the point is the broad institute at harvard mit paper which i think was in cell and identified about a hundred genes um but the common denominator was they seem to be all involved in early fetal brain development all and all except for one in the cortex of the brain most involved in early excitatory and inhibitory neurons and a lot of them in the neuronal cytoskeleton so so there's a lot there there i mean it's it's clearly um the the genes are dominant whether or not there's some epigenetic influences that can affect you know whether it's full-on expression of autism or whether there's schizophrenic components to it i think that that that may be likely as well but it's not as simple as saying just genetic susceptibility and it's overwhelming the environmental factor i think it's the other way around i think it's overwhelmingly the genetics is the dominant factor and yes deterministic and maybe there are some epigenetic influences so if that's the case then there would be really two reasonable explanations for the for an increase in the incidence of autism i mean do you believe that there has been an increase in the incidence of autism over the last 40 or 50 years a true increase in incidence not diagnosis no i i've not seen any evidence for that um um but i can you know i concede it's it's tough to prove given you know you know and and i and i get different some of the things i ask are teachers you know are you seeing more autism and most teachers will say yeah i'm seeing a lot more autism but i think a lot of that is due to more awareness um i think a lot of things that we now call call autism we didn't call autism back then i mean we use the r word a lot right they're mentally or they're this or that and now we realize they're on the autism spectrum there's also this component and some teachers have told me you've said well if you want to get special services for your kid you have to label it as autism otherwise they're not eligible for special services and you know how much of that is going on it's hard for me to know either but i think overall and again as i point out as we get better with diagnosing girls and women with autism those numbers are going to go through the roof yet again so how how how heritable uh do you believe the transmission of this is is this something where um you know it's sort of like eye color where a child can be born with green eyes to a parent of blue and brown eyes how how do the genes transmit uh what's the best guess yeah again not an expert i mean in some cases i think there's spontaneous mutations i think others you know i remember when rachel was diagnosed with autism um you know ann said you know well clearly it's your side of the family and i said what do you mean what about your what about your uncle so and so and so there was those kinds of discussions um so yeah hard to know i mean i think i think clearly you see um autism in in parents of kids with autism and and they may not be fully diagnosed but you definitely see that a lot of times um and i think that that's quite common ann has a theory that um autism is more common among uh people of intellectual accomplishment and and maybe there's some truth to that but i think it's just bias on the basis of people that and you know i've been at a university my whole life and anne is always running into academics so i can understand why she thinks that but i don't think that's been well established that's really interesting peter i actually took it as uh i guess i took it as a given that there was a true increase in the incidence of autism though not as significant as what the perception is because this was also the perception is also being driven by as you say just a tremendous increase in awareness diagnostic criteria becoming broader uh more things being included right so for example what used to be called asperger's is now technically a part of asd right right but i guess the question is how would you ever sort it out that's the that's the other problem i think it's you know you know i guess what you could look if you had specific genetic markers that you could look at that would be something you can hang on to and say is the increase in certain genetic markers going up and but that's not trivial to look at either but i've always felt that there's been no true increase but there may be some evidence for it so let's pivot to a little bit of um the current around uh covid um as we stand here today peter we're well on the path to most americans who want to be vaccinated are getting pretty close to being vaccinated by the way what's the latest on the vaccination of children um where is the cdc on that what do we know about the vaccine how many of the um current vaccines as we stand here today really there are three that are used in the u.s correct uh i think the astrazeneca one is not used in the united states that's right it hasn't uh gone through emergencies they haven't applied for emergency use authorization i'm worried about that vaccine for reasons that we can talk about but um then there's the the nova vaxx vaccine so and there could be as many as five but by the spring um the in terms of kids pfizer just released data uh showing high levels of efficacy in adolescence 12 to 15. um but there were small numbers there was around 1200 and the vaccine grew 1200 in the control group uh and there were 18 cases of covet in the in the control group none in the vaccinated group and on that basis and their press releases had 100 efficacy i'm sure that won't hold up i mean yeah it's too small a number one of the interesting things about the about the kids though in those those adolescents the virus neutralizing antibody titers are really high like 1200 so higher than older adults so that may be a factor as well and there we're now starting to get our arms around correlates of protection that really high levels of virus neutralizing the antibody seem roughly to correlate with efficacy is that consistent with your belief peter that this would be more b-cell mediated than t-cell mediated well i think t-cells have a role i mean i think in virus-neutralizing antibody may not be everything but if you don't have high levels of virus neutralizing antibody you're not going to get protection and the problem with look comparing those virus neutralizing antibodies is uh is when you look at the actual papers they compare it with convalescent serum titers and they're all over the map and so so now there's a paper up on met archive that does something very simple which is rather than just give the absolute value for the geometric mean titers whether it's against pseudovirus or whether it whether it's against plaque reduction neutralization titers what they do is they do a ratio of the virus neutralizing antibody titers against the vaccine versus the virus neutralizing antibody tires on the convalescent to kind of normalize it and there's this very nice curve that's been generated that shows you need to get it that the level of virus neutralizing the antibodies has to be at least as high as the convalescent and preferably about 1.5 or 2 [Music] to get really high levels of protection and i think that's probably what we're looking at so it's not quite a a true correlator of protection but i think we're moving in that direction and the adolescents get really high levels of virus neutralizing the antibody and did that pfizer study give two shots or one i think it was two okay it was two so now that we're out of the gate and millions of people have been vaccinated do you [Music] have any preference or concern over any of the vaccines you obviously mentioned astrazeneca which i want to hear about but let's start with the u.s vaccines any reason to believe that one is better than the other in fact i'll share with you something that i found very interesting which was the j and j vaccine which is a single uh vaccine and that um [Music] that vaccine well the headline is lower efficacy if you actually look at the absolute risk reduction as opposed to the relative risk reduction is at least as efficacious as pfizer and moderna i found that to be very interesting and i'm surprised how that was sort of omitted from all the press yeah and i and i also think it's hard to compare because it's a single dose it's being given a single dose versus the two doses and i'm and it wouldn't surprise me if that jnj vaccine ultimately becomes a two dose vaccine down the line because you may want to give a booster for one of the variants as well and in two doses the virus neutralizing antibody titers is really really high and it'll be as good or um in terms of protection as as pfizer moderna certainly i think the single to me the single dose j j looks better than the single dose pfizer and badaran and not by much the bottom line is they're all good they're all good vaccines and i also think don't be surprised if later on we're going to need a boost for all of them so there'll be a third dose of the maduro pfizer vaccine or a second dose of the jnj and what that will do is it'll uh elevate virus neutralizing the antibody tighters higher it'll create more durability of protection uh i think um and that boost will be reconfigured for the south african or the and the brazilian variant which are not here in a big way in the us but may become a bigger problem down the line right now it's the uk variant the b117 variant that's accelerating all of the operational warp speed vaccines work really well against the uk variant that's because that variant has not mutated through its spike protein well it has so the uk variant has a single amino acid substitution um in in in an aromatic amino acid creating an aromatic amino acid and that seems to reduce the level of virus neutralizing antibodies i don't know if i have a mechanism to show you pictures yeah do you know how to share a screen on zoom yeah i have a really cool graphic it's a little bit of molecular biology but not but not much i i just showed this at a at a pediatric grand rounds at columbia this morning and to me it it ex it helps people understand it but it's you know as i often like to say it's not a 30 second unicef commercial so this is a a paper that's up in bioarchive a pre-print server and looking at the b117 variant and so looking and what and in the spike protein what there is there's an amino acid substitution in the 501 position or went from an asparagine to a tyrosine and a tyrosine is an aromatic amino acid it has a ring to it and they're able to show model it with the receptor the angiotensin-converting enzyme it's got a nice strong bond there yeah there's a ring-ring interaction so it's these pi pile these pi electrons that circulate in aromatic rings that are interacting with each other in addition there's a hydrogen bond and the reason i love this so much is um you know all of all we're talking about with this big acceleration of cases going up in michigan and affecting younger people and higher mortality and morbidity it's a bit of a simplification but then again it's not it's all coming down to pi pi interactions between um between two aromatic um rings in in in two tyrosines right it's it's actually kind of let's just make sure people understand this because not everybody understands biochemistry right each amino acid um is coded for um by it basically there's a code right so you have three nucleotides that code for an amino acid and um if you you know so it sounds like one of those gets changed and it changed the amino acid uh and i can't remember did you say it started at threonine or which would yeah it was so this is the wild type or the original lineages now it's switching over to a tyrosine and it's basically yeah so it went it went from from from threonine to tyrosine and then all of a sudden that changes literally changes the shape but also creates kind of an electrochemical attraction that wasn't there before and so all of a sudden the spike protein has a greater um basically a greater uh attraction to the ace2 receptor right which which which presumably translates into better virus entry and maybe more virus replication and that's why you're getting more severe disease and and it's affecting younger younger people are getting sicker as as well the good news is the virus neutralizing antibodies to the original spike protein seems to still work well against this b117 variant so we're going to take this picture now and zoom out a bit so now this is this is the spike protein which is a trimer actually let me show you a real picture of it so you so you can see what it looks like this is what this is the trimeric spike protein so these are these little purple pink flowers on top each one is a trimeric spike protein and now we're going to show it again here and they've got each one has its own receptor binding domain and now what's going to happen is only one of the receptor binding domains flips up and binds to the receptor to the ac2 receptor and here's that one amino acid substitution again that i blew up on on on the previous slide and and so if you had the wild type on here peter it would show it would look the same but it would look the same you would just have a lower affinity there yeah and you wouldn't see this this it wouldn't be marked as having this mutation but the point is the antibodies to all of the original lineages from the vaccines seem to work just as well and can still neutralize this interaction the problem comes in now with the other variants that are coming up from south africa and in brazil the p1 variant from brazil and the b1351 that's got a second amino acid substitution over here which is going uh which is creating a lysine and that i think is creating extra levels of electrostatic interaction so the binding potentially is even tighter and this now is interfering with the ability of antibodies to neutralize so the virus neutralizing antibody titer goes down and that translates to decreased and efficacy so when you look at the published numbers these are some of the numbers here the level of efficacy against the original i'll call that original slash uk which is probably roughly about the same versus za the south african variant that's why you see it going down wow so this is interesting let's digest this for a second so pfizer and moderna take an enormous reduction against that variant well no no let's let's be careful so the so the nova vaccine j j that's actual efficacy published efficacy data okay in the case of pfizer and moderna what you're looking at here is declines in levels of virus neutralizing antibody in vitro ah thanks for clarifying that so these are in vitro studies and and that yeah that's very important and it's still because the level of virus neutralizing antibodies so high to begin with there's enough residual that is you're still getting good protection and i but we don't yet have the clinical data to see well now pfizer's issued a press release yesterday saying they think in a very small set it seems to work really well against the south african variant and which makes sense given the high levels of virus neutralizing the antibody to begin with um tell me why you think the astrazeneca takes the biggest hit here then yeah so the astrazeneca started out with you know in some cases not as high levels of virus neutralizing antibody and the a study was done in south africa showing only 10 basically ineffective against south the south african variant but you know talking to the oxford people one of the things they say is it's a little unfair because they only tested it against moderate and mild disease and they feel that if you were to test against severe illness it would still be very effective and they counter that the j j results were mostly looking at severe illness and if they had if they if if they like j and j had looked at severe illness they would have come up with similar numbers but you know i guess we have to wait and see what happens with that the bigger issue with the astrazeneca vaccine is is just public perception around the cerebral thrombosis that is being reported out of europe and i think that's causing a lot of a lot of damage um you know and and it's in it and it goes back and forth you know the german government um through their polyrulic institute pointed out you had six i think was six cases of of sinus venous thrombosis which is a rare condition in the vaccinated group and they suspended it and then several other european countries did and that had big ramifications especially for africa you know francophone africa listens to what's going on in france and etc and i was going on a number of uh podcasts not podcasts but uh zoom conferences with groups in africa and they were very concerned about the astrazeneca because that was supposed to be a workhorse right vaccine for low in low and middle income countries the european medicine agencies came along said no no it looks okay it's you know it's we think you know this is not related to the vaccine but then uh in science magazine two excellent science journalist gretchen vogel and and kai cooper schmidt looked at this and you know have identified about you know they wrote about 31 cases of cerebral venous thrombosis and you know clearly you know more clearly showing it it could be linked to the vaccine as a very rare event but um but still that that can really alter public perception especially in light of all of the very aggressive anti-vaccine activities that are happening so i don't know what the us is going to do at this point i hope they do authorize it for emergency release even if they never use it in the u.s and the reason is if the u.s declines or if that derails i think it could have a chilling effect on latin america and africa because we don't have a lot of vaccines out there that's that's why we came along with our recombinant protein vaccine because they're not a lot of options the big issue is for um the astra you know if you look at what's going to be made for low and middle-income countries they're not a lot of choices out there i mean the two mrna vaccines it's still a new technology we're not going to be able to scale that up in a big way for africa and latin america yes i mean it's great they you know pfizer donated 230 000 doses to rwanda it was fantastic but look at the numbers there's 1.1 billion people in sub-saharan africa 650 million people in latin america we're going to need 4 billion doses of vaccines where's that going to come from it's not going to come from the mrna vaccines is the refrigeration also a problem yeah the fact that you have that onerous freezer requirement and then you know the j is having you know some issues in scaling up production you know part of the problem was when the science policy makers were looking at this they went so heavy on the innovation and they wound up producing a lot of really cool vaccines that are highly effective but in terms of durability for scale up to make 4 billion doses i don't think that was high enough on their radar screen and didn't realize that when you use a brand new technology it's really hard to move to 4 billion doses and that's why i'm hoping our vaccine comes along you know which is you know in part you know a couple of donors came to me after your after one of the podcasts i did with you and that was game changing for us because it allowed us to [Music] adapt our coronavirus program for vaccines we're making for sars and mares to this recombinant protein vaccine for coven 19. what's the what's the vehicle it's recombinant protein in yeast just like the hepatitis b vaccine and um you could produce a ton of it they could they have capacity for producing 100 million doses a day a month and it's looking really good in clinical trials and in non-human primate trials i i can't talk about it yet but it should be out soon um and hopefully that will come in and make a big difference because i'm really scared that we have nothing for africa and latin america i mean what's amazing is how i had to you know struggle for funding i mean i was spending you know a good part of last year just trying to keep the program going because it was so hard to get funds for what was so obviously needed which is a low-cost unfussy durable vaccine for low and middle-income countries and you know because of your podcast groups like you know the um uh tito's vodka came through with some funding and you know they're based in austin and an anonymous donor and and a couple of others so that and now the clayburgh foundation is helping us in a big way they're a texas foundation and um in the jpb foundation and a few others so that that was game changing so peter based on everything you're saying it sounds like the biggest concern right now would have to be brazil followed by africa um you didn't unless i missed it did you explain the mutation in brazil and the efficacy that any of the current vaccines would have against it notwithstanding the scale-up limitations yeah a couple of things so the p1 variant in brazil has those same two amino acid changes in the south africans so i kind of think of them as brother sister issues um so we're going to have so dealing with south africa will also have will will hopefully take care of brazil as well one other thing i wanted to mention is you know the the global policy makers did a good job of creating this kovac sharing facility it's really quite brilliant in its design i think that's not the issue you know because they were really worried about equity the equity issue i think was more of the fact that we didn't ensure there was enough vaccine available for the kovac sharing facility and that's that's really the problem right now and hopefully we can come in and address it and and um and and take care of this because if we don't figure out a way to vaccinate the rest of the world if we only vaccinate north america and europe it's going to be a catastrophe this virus is going to continue to circulate and cause tremendous humanitarian destruction but also who knows what other variants could evolve as well as a consequence of allowing that to go unfettered what what what drives the evolutionary pressure here of this of these mutations um is it's just standard darwinian behavior where enough mutations occur and they're escaping because these mutations like how does the mutagenicity of this virus compare to influenza it seems far less than influenza is that safe yeah and so a lot of us were surprised by by the variants we thought that we hadn't really seen this as much in coronaviruses what some people speculate is it happened because of an immunocompromised individual who uh you know had a lot more virus replication in their system and that combining even possibly with receiving plasma convalescent therapy that puts some kind of selective pressure on it and that's kind of a hypothesis that's out there but you know it's not strong i don't think we really know that for certain at this point the good news is the way i see it is a lot of the viruses are converging to the same mutations so my hope and it's only a hope and there's by no mean consensus in the scientific community is that if we make a booster to this south african slash p1 brazil varian um we might be done at that point that there won't be this continual evolution for totally something different but but i don't think we know that for certain so the good news also is it looks like our vaccine seems to give pretty good levels of virus neutralizing antibody to the south african variant as well so we're making the booster for it for the south african just in case but we may not need it we'll see and we don't know how often we would need the booster it could be every six months every 12 months every 18 months it's too soon to tell obviously until we have longitudinal data looking at the neutralizing antibodies yeah i mean my dream situation is we give this one boost beyond the original vaccine series later this year next year and then we're done that it won't have to be every year but like anything else we'll just have to monitor and follow it but you know people say it's going to be like flu where we have to vaccinate every year and at this point i don't think so but i can't say for certain because in the case of the flu that's driven more by the mutagenicity than the lack of b cell response isn't it well in the case of the flu you're getting these wholesale antigenic shifts so it's a really like a totally different virus and there's this careful carefully orchestrated dance where you that we have in place to monitor flu virus strains you know maybe coming out of asia and then quickly transmitting the message to the pharmaceutical manufacturers who make a whole different vaccine every year it's really quite extraordinary i don't think we're going to need to do that for coronavirus vaccines at least that's my hope but we'll see how this unfolds well one thing's for certain if you look at the uh if you look at what's available for africa and latin america right now it's it's not good and so i've been uh talking to a colleague patrick shin who's in in los angeles and he's really interested to see can we build out vaccine development capacity in in africa or maybe latin america because right now there's no vaccines made on the african continent and very not enough in latin not nearly enough in latin america not much in the middle east and we've learned that if you only rely on the multinational companies even with that great kovac sharing facility they're they're not going to make code they're not going to make new vaccines for the world at least in rapid time frame i mean they still it's amazing they do what they do i mean gavi the gavi alliance for vaccine the world's children depends heavily on the multinational companies they do a great job but we we need parallel mechanisms in place like new vaccine development production facilities in locally in africa and latin america and that's something i'm very that we've been working a lot in this concept of vaccine diplomacy and building that out well peter i know that we have a real hard stop in time because you've got another obligation but i'm really happy that we were able to spend a couple hours together um we covered a lot of ground and uh we actually got through half of what i wanted to talk about so i consider that a win it was it only half okay well i'm always happy to come back you know uh i lo i love uh being on your podcast one because i learned so much from you and and the thing i really appreciate is you you ask questions that i just never would have thought of on my own and you know after you ask it i say why don't i know that i should have i mean that's so obvious that's that i should know that because it's the right question to ask so you have this amazing talent for asking the right questions and i appreciate that all right well thanks very much again for everything peter
