Nir Barzilai, Director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, is back for his third appearance on The Drive. In this episode, Nir divulges insights into lifespan and healthspan through the lens of his extensive research on centenarians as well as the latest from the TAME trial (Targeting/Taming Aging with Metformin), a multi-center study investigating the concept that the multi-morbidities of aging can be delayed in humans. He discusses common gene variants found in centenarians, important pathways for longevity, and ultimately what we can learn from centenarians about extending lifespan while also trying to improve healthspan. Additionally, Nir goes into depth on metformin as a longevity tool for humans, including studies with positive and negative results. He discusses the impact metformin can have on exercise for both strength training and cardiovascular training, as well as future research facilitated by data from the TAME Trial. He also touches on epigenetic clocks and concludes with his take on the usefulness of NAD precursors as a potential gero-protective agent.

About:

The Peter Attia Drive is a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking…and a few other things. With over 40 million episodes downloaded, it features topics including fasting, ketosis, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, mental health, and much more.

Peter is a physician focusing on the applied science of longevity. His practice deals extensively with nutritional interventions, exercise physiology, sleep physiology, emotional and mental health, and pharmacology to increase lifespan (delay the onset of chronic disease), while simultaneously improving healthspan (quality of life).

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dr. Nir Barzilai:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on centenarian research, longevity genes, and potential geroprotective interventions. Dr. Barzilai discussed his extensive research on centenarians and their offspring, particularly focusing on genetic factors that contribute to exceptional longevity. The conversation also covered detailed discussion of metformin as a potential anti-aging drug and the TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) trial.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Centenarians have 5-6 "bad" genetic variants out of 15,000 possible variants, yet remain disease-free [15:00]
- 60% of centenarians have genes that impair growth hormone/IGF signaling pathway [45:00]
- High TSH levels (5-8 range) are common in long-lived individuals while maintaining normal thyroid hormones [1:05:00]
- Metformin's effects on longevity show 20-30% improvement across various studies [1:25:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Exercise and nutrition remain important for non-centenarians [2:10:00]
- Prevention of chronic disease should be ultra-primary, before any symptoms appear [1:55:00]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications discussed:
- Metformin: Detailed discussion of benefits and potential limitations [1:20:00]
- Rapamycin: Mentioned as one of the "three best drugs" along with metformin and statins [1:15:00]
- NAD precursors: Limited evidence for efficacy, concerns about bioavailability [2:15:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"The genetics of longevity in humans is exactly what we learned from animals - it's the insulin signaling pathway, it's the mTOR signaling pathway, it's the MAP kinase pathway." [1:45:00]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the optimal biomarkers for measuring biological age?
2. How does the sex difference in proteome stability affect longevity interventions?
3. What is the relationship between TSH levels and longevity in younger populations?
