1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Rachel Rubin, a urologist specializing in sexual medicine, discussing menopause, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and women's sexual health. The conversation covers the misinterpretation of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, which led to widespread fear of hormone therapy, and the current state of menopause treatment. Key focus areas include the safety and efficacy of different hormone therapies, the importance of vaginal health, and the systemic impact of hormone deficiency on women's health.

- Estrogen levels fluctuate dramatically during perimenopause, ranging from 50-900 pg/mL [00:07:58]
- Less than 4% of women are currently on hormone therapy [01:01:03]
- Vaginal estrogen can reduce UTI risk by more than 50% [01:50:39]
- Medicare could save $6-22 billion annually if eligible women used vaginal estrogen [01:50:39]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

- DHEA (vaginal) [02:01:24]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Use LCMS testing for estradiol measurements [01:32:04]

- Estradiol levels for dose adjustment [01:39:00]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"If a penis shriveled up at age 52, we'd probably have a vaccine sponsored by Pfizer" [00:46:40]

"We're killing women by trying to protect them" [01:46:40]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
