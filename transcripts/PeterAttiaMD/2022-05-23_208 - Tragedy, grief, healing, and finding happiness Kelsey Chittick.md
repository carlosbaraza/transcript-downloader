[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA hey Kelsey thanks so much for making the time to come all the way to Austin I really appreciate it although I'm not going to take credit for the fact that you came here for this I think this was an opportunistic time to sit down for sure I mean I I definitely did come here for this and there are some other great people here that um I get to visit it's perfect so thank you for having me yeah

[00:00:26] I know my wife is really upset that you don't live here you know it's funny because I went out with them last night and there's this draw to this place because there's a lot of good people here and I think during Co I I understood why everybody was leaving and I really couldn't stand LA and there was just a thousand Reasons the past couple years have been hard but all of a sudden suddenly I really love La again so I'm going to hold and and V just visit you guys every month very well that's the plan so where didd you grow up I grew up in Winter Park Florida got it okay and when did you start swimming

[00:01:00] I was probably four and I probably raced in my first race at six wow so when did you realize you were a good enough swimmer to be a Collegiate swimmer you know it's funny we talk about this with sports and kids these days it just wasn't on our radar the way it is for kids now um I lived in Florida you wanted to be outside you wanted to be with your friends so we swam and uh little by little I you know I'd win a few races 25 butterfly something on backstroke and it was just something fun to do with your friends so I don't even remember thinking about college until maybe 9th grade when I won I I think we got second at State and then my sophomore year I won State and in what event 100 back and 100 fly um did you swim I am as well I didn't I was terrible at breastroke horrible there's a bunch of jokes about that we could go into but I won't right now yeah I don't I remember thinking like oh wow that's great like I just won

[00:01:56] Florida's you know state championships but I also remember just loving my team and that like Winter Park High School W and at that point you really didn't talk to coaches that you didn't know recruiting especially female athletes it wasn't huge back then to get a SCH title n or what I'm trying to think I've got to look that up because I I messed that fact up all the time I feel like there weren't a lot of people I'd ever met that had a scholarship that were girls um and so it wasn't until maybe my junior year that my coach said you know a couple coaches have called and said that you know you could get a scholar ship and my family wasn't into sports they just didn't even I mean they came to my swim Meats but not really a lot of um they just weren't everybody did their own thing in our family it was not how parents are now that are driving their kids and doing Special coaches and meets and stuff like that so all I remember it was just I have a lot of energy to burn off and swimming was the one thing that after I was done I felt like I burned that jet fuel off that's all I remember really and then it just got better and then coaches started to talk to me um and then the rest is kind of History so what do you remember about getting to

[00:03:06] UNC you went right obviously remember I went to to a basketball game with one of my girlfriends whose dad had gone there maybe this was my junior year and long story short but he his her brother dated the swim coach's daughter and so at the basketball game which is huge in Chapel Hill it might have been a Duke Carolina game I don't know but I remember it was a big deal and someone said oh

[00:03:27] Carolina's impossible to get in out of state and I thought well then I'm definitely going to try to get in out of state um and so I I met the swim coach and he said you know call me when you're the end of your junior year when you're a senior and I tried to get in I don't think I got into Carolina at first and they had already given a scholarship to a girl from Ohio she was going to swim 200 backstroke 100 backstroke so I got an offer for Miami FSU and I think

[00:03:56] Florida but I I wanted to get out of Florida so badly cuz I everybody I knew was going there and I was like I want to have a new experience and so I just held and then that spring the girl uh decided to go somewhere else and so they gave me a did you turn down those other scholarships I did wow I did they were in state schools and I was I I didn't want to I just didn't want to go there and if I I was I didn't want to swim it was all because we were swimming against all the same people I grew up with I just knew I needed a new experience and

[00:04:23] I was kind of set on Chapel Hill and somewhere deep in my soul I knew it would work out which I have no idea why how and I remember coming home and we had answer machines then and I hit my answer machine and it was Coach Frank comfort and he was like girl we got a spot for you we'll give you a partial scholarship and if you make nc2a we'll give you a full and so I spent the first two years with just tuition and then my parents paid room and board and then once you made nc2a you got a full scholarship so my Junior and Senior year so you swam fly and back yep both distances 100 back 200 back 100 fly those are were my three yeah didn't want to do that 200 fly God my arms would like kill myself I wanted every that third 50 I just be like why am I doing this did you is a brutal race what did you swim well I I just swim like long distance swimming like ultra distance swimming of course but when I swim in the pool the only thing I could swim was breast stroke okay yeah yeah yeah so I I was decent breast stroker right but horrible couldn't swim backstroke if my life depended on it that funny and okay at butterfly so short AIS Strokes were fine pretty bad freestyler despite the fact that I could swiming for a long pretty time but not fast right right interesting but I loved IM that's why you I bet you would have been a decent imer even if your breast stroke wasn't no I would I would burn it out butterfly for fre and they would just pass me I had I had something left for free but I wasn't good I just I wasn't I wasn't I guess that's true I think with IM I think having a strong breast stroke is valuable because it's late in the race everybody's tired and it takes up the most time of the race so if you can I remember swimming like at a master's meet if I could take six seconds out of somebody in a breastroke right they could be faster than me in the other nobody's going to take anything out of you in the fly because it's the beginning of the race like you just everybody's sort of conserving energy yeah yeah that that's a fair point but what year did you matriculate I graduated from high school in '95 and Chapel Hill in 99 okay so what year did you meet Nate so I met Nate in 1990 98 so the summer so you were kind of a junior I was going into my junior year okay I think I and I I met him this

[00:06:32] Summer of 1998 and I had just finished my sophore year swimming and I was just kind of a hot mess I'd gained a ton of weight I ate like cream cheese and croissant sandwiches because we had like um what's it called Training Table I just really let it fly with Penny draft and just nights out just my face and my body was just not not primed for winning anything um started dating a guy who had a a weed problem and you know I kind of dabbled in that very little but I I was I was running with a crowd that wasn't conducive to being excellent well so you didn't hang with most of the swimmers I did he was on the swim he on okay I was going to say I I would assume the swimmers would date a lot each other because you have the same schedules training and and at Caroline at the time you couldn't Rush a sorority or fraternity if you were on a swim if you were on a athletic team so basically they had you that was your group um so I was really kind of insul with the swim team I I didn't love it so much as I did in high school I didn't love that I felt like my that my scholarship was depending on it that all of my friends did the same thing because in high school we all had 12 girlfriends but everybody was different I was the swimmer one was the nerd one was the smart one one was the party one and once

[00:07:45] I got to Chapel Hill we were all fighting for n2a or for the spot on the relay so it was just a different experience so I dated this guy for a while and then my summer before my junior year I met Nate at a bar and had was Nate a senior at that point he was going into his fifth year senior year because he red shirted his first yeah okay he was going into his fifth year and I met him at a bar and um I just remember him walking in and just a absolute enormous man with more confidence than you've ever seen in your life more Swagger for a huge fat guy that you could I mean unbelievable and I met him that night and he he gave me this napkin that said if you want the best say goodbye to the rest go home with me and I'll make you happy and I mean I was like what but the funny part is years later I met a girl at a wedding and she's like you won't believe it I know you're married to Nate hob good shig but he left me a napkin one time in college and I was like Mother of

[00:08:43] God um but yeah I met him that night and then we didn't really we didn't see each other for a while um but it turned out one of my roommates was dating a guy on the offensive line named Ryan and so a couple months later we had a house party where we watched xfiles which is a great thing and just everybody partied and got drunk and danced and Nate was there and at some point that night a guy called that I was dating and Nate just walked over and took the phone and was like she's with me now and and and that was it wow so what is it that you liked about him in that moment because on the one hand it sounds like you were kind of amused but but I mean what did you see at that moment I mean from the minute I met him if I'm honest like I knew there was something and he was nothing I grew up been a my father's a lawyer my mom was very politically active a country club you know very kind of rigid you know very lots of um my town was very

[00:09:40] Southern and Christian and um when I met Nate he was so different he was like a poor kid from Allentown just a a guy that hustled and I just felt he was different he was connected like when he'd sit and listen to you you felt like you were the most important person in the world and he did it with everybody I could see how he interacted there was a way when he walked into a room that you could tell everybody loved him and he loved them um so I knew that first night something was different about him and then the the night that we kind of started dating there was just a joy to Nate that was different and a extreme way of living which was concerning then and concerned me my entire life with him but he was here for the moment he was here to have a good time and feel it all experience it all um most loving human being you'll ever meet truthfully so I couldn't understand how

[00:10:33] I was attracted to him because it just didn't match anything that I had imagined um but when we started talking the things he was talking about were the same thing as me like what do you want to do with your life who do you want to be what books have you read um what type of spiritual practices do you have and we were you know 19 and 22 and I remember he was on this deep search for meaning and purpose and how do we serve how do we get the most out of this life um and so we kind of both started on a spiritual journey at a very young age and that's what I loved about him always so married a really fat 300 lb amazing defensive tackle what year did you guys get married we got married in 2002 we got engaged at the World Trade Center in 2001 in July yeah a couple months before 911 at the top of the tower the yep and

[00:11:23] I remember Nate being like do you think that's a good sign or a bad sign and for a long time I was like I think it's a good sign and then after everything happened I was like maybe it was a bad sign but um yeah we loved living in New York he played for the Giants and so we lived there for a while and then we got married in 2002 in Florida so you know

[00:11:41] Nate was not the guy who was going to get drafted in the first round so what was your thinking as you were saying okay I'm really serious about this guy and he wanted to play in the NFL like who doesn't play college football and wants to play in the NFL so what were you thinking about um his chances and you know obviously he had anazing aming work ethic how far did you think that that was you know did you actually think that could get him out of college football I I actually can hear him laughing I I was like you'll never make it which was always what I'd say to him like the worst I would be like you don't have a shot in hell like you haven't started and he was like I'll just work my way if I can just get a shot he was always like if I can just get a shot and so truthfully when the draft came I had never I had seen him play in college but he wasn't a starter he started he almost lost his scholarship didn't he yeah he almost lost it and uh m brown was the coach and he was like listen buddy this isn't going to work for you he was like fourth on the depth chart or something yeah he was behind like Vonnie holiday and some of the I can't remember Dre BL it was just a big year at Chapel Hill we'd beat FSU and I remember just thinking like it's not going to happen but we were young and I didn't you know

[00:12:43] I still had a year and a half of school and so I remember he went to the combine and he he had a really fast 40 and he he had a good combine and Caroline had had a great year so he was back up to some guys that were going first and second round um but truthfully the day of the draft I didn't even understand it and our familyes his family too not into football my family not into football actually thought it was an archaic sport both sides academics on both sides um and Nate was like if I could just get a chance on a practice squad then I could make it and then we could save a little bit of money and then we could maybe buy a house someday I mean that was pretty much the way we thought of it um so when he got called by the Giants to be on the practice squad everybody was shocked but also knew that there was nobody that made the good guys try harder than a guy like Nate cuz he would just literally go until he couldn't so I think I was surprised and it was more just we were young I was like good luck like I hope you make the team but we I wasn't ever that invested in his career um I just wanted him to do it and get out safe and then make some money so that we could start our real life so did you know Jeff

[00:13:52] Saturday when they were roommates like you yeah oh yeah I mean Jeff's still one of my best friends and his wife so we all live together and Nate lived together from freshman year and I mean the story about Jeff is yeah tell that story I mean that's just it's an amazing story especially in light of what Jeff

[00:14:08] Saturday went on to become right one of the greatest centers of the game and to think that he got overlooked and yeah so tell people how that happened so Jeff and Nate were roommates freshman year and Jeff tells this great story about when he first met Nate um he he went to introduce himself but Nate was sobbing hugging his parents and he was like wait

[00:14:27] I'm I'm like going to be rooming with this like baby like what's happening Jeff's a guy from Georgia grew up kind of a rough life very tough and they ended up being best friends they played together along with Chris korf who was up for the Heisman there was a group of them and when we all were waiting for the draft Chris had been the quarterback and Jeff was the center and we were certain they were going to go in fourth round fifth round and we all just sat there and you kind of just sit around back then and just wait for the phone to ring and there's no cell phones or anything and nobody called nobody called nobody called and then the only only person that got called was Nate so Nate went on to the Giants and got on the practice squad and barely made it through that first cut but he made it and then he got released by the Giants and the Colts picked him up right away so Nate moved to Indianapolis and at that time Jeff was wasn't sure he I think he got a shot at Baltimore on a practice squad but didn't make it so he came back to North Carolina and started working like a pet boys and they didn't think he had a shot it was kind of over he was too short I mean Nate used to always tell him and Jeff if you're listening they said you know he has short arms he'll never make it as a sinner and they wrote all these awful things about him and Nate just always went up against him in practice for four years and he was like he's the best guy I've ever played against so at some point Nate was still barely making the Colts trying to just get you know you only get paid week by week if you make the team and if you play so it's not how people think and so at one point Nate said he had a really tough practice and the guys that he played against he's like I just walked away being like those guys aren't even close to what Jeff did so he walked into poon's office in like dirty sweats poan doesn't even know who he is he has no clue he's like who is this guy because he's just like a guy trying to make the team and he said there's a guy in

[00:16:09] Raleigh North Carolina that's working at an auto part store right now his name's Jeff Saturday and he get kick all those guys asses that I just played and coach said well if you want him to come live with you I'll give him a shot and then that was it and the rest is history six Pro bowls or whatever it is Super Bowl he'll be a Hall of Famer and I still get mad because and I like and he got us a comforter for our wedding like we're like hey buddy like we kind of started your whole career and all we got was like all we got this lousy comforter looking for more we're looking for more yeah just one of the greatest guys biggest heart um it has gone on to have an exceptional career for sure so let's go back to let's start at 99 right so you were the Rams you're in St Louis I remember this year very well because I mean CT Warner of course you whole so at the beginning of that playoff run did you think this is really going to happen were you yeah it was really fun for the first time I was like oh this is fun and we were winning um I was still in college so I would fly oh that's right you this would have been your senior year so I was still in college and it was it was just fun and we were winning and we were winning and Kurt was an exceptional leader spiritually emotionally everything and the team just had a bunch of really good guys on it and it was fun to be a part of that team and I think I've always felt like the energy matters the most there was something that was telling us the energy on this team is good so every time they won you just now it gets more you're like please win please win then you're like really because you know that this this may never come again and most of the time it doesn't and we had dick verile as a coach who's still probably one of the greatest humans to me and still continues to come to my house twice a year to see the kids and just have dinner with us just an exceptional advocate for his players as human beings way past you know their football um um

[00:17:59] Nate loved him and he was the one that gave Nate a shot multiple times just because of his character because it dicks like he's not that good but he really makes the other good guys better um so that year was just exceptional and it was fun and St Louis was on fire and that that City needed it and I remember when we made it to the last I'm the worst about football the last playoff game whatever happened last night that we all just watch the divisional championship um I was like oh my God we could we could win the Super Bowl but I was young and I so I got there and I was wearing some like nerd outfit and all the other NFL wives were like smoking hot and looking so cool and I think I had like my backpack but I just didn't know we didn't we weren't into it like that and I remember the last play came and it was that big play where Mike

[00:18:44] Jones was tackled I forget who I forget I don't remember anyways it was at last second and I remember thinking and I told Nate this and he was very offended I was like whatever you do don't put Nate in like please don't put him in because I didn't want him to be the guy that if they lost you they lost I was like I can't live with it but they tackled the guy before he got in the end zone and the Rams won and it was just exceptional it was an exceptional experience and there's I don't know if you know this but they have two parties for both the teams just one's a lot more fun they're identical so each team has a hotel and each team has the same exact party ready but one's just yeah the real the party that's the better one it's CU they all both have the t-shirts ready as if they're going to use it right yeah yeah yeah yeah you're NFC champion or not yeah exactly yeah so I just remember it was fun we danced we we had a great time we never took any of it for granted we loved all of it and Nate was in a ton of pain always yeah you you wrote about that a lot in the book and um it's sort of interesting when you think about how early in his career he was I mean he was in pain before he made it to the NFL which is something that we would assume well you know God if a guy's been in the

[00:19:57] NFL for 15 years I can sort of see why he wouldn't have toes anymore and why he wouldn't be able to feel his hands but you don't think of a guy who's 22 trying to get into the NFL already under that type of discomfort yeah he was banged up because first of all when you play on the line that's a whole another ball game and when you are not a starter that kind of gets to take breaks so Nate was the

[00:20:21] Workhorse and so he took so many hits and when he got to college I don't I don't want to mess up the the weight but he was skinny not SK any but he was a basketball player in high school and in order to play the position that he was welcomed to play at North Carolina he had to gain a ton of weight so he by the

[00:20:36] I think when we got married he was 300 lb and maybe he was like 220 when he got to Carolina so he force fed so I think the weight he put on his body put to to move that amount of weight around that fast and that often took a toll pretty early his neck was a 21 could that be right yeah it was enormous and I remember the first night I slept with him not literally but maybe I don't know you know you know what I mean but I I remember being like this snoring won't work this will this is this is a game changer like we're going to have to make a move and when he got to the Giants within a couple weeks they gave him a sleep apum mask at 22 so for the our entire time together for 21 years I never have slept with a man that didn't have a sleep apnea mask which is awful to look at but it has this wonderful

[00:21:21] White Noise sound and your husband doesn't sleep too and it helps him sleep and I remember he used to say like I could die without this I'm like no you couldn't so early on I think he was just too big to do what he was doing without paying a price quite often um and he was but he wasn't a complainer he's like I choose this but you could just tell he spent a lot of time just managing where to put the pain which was out of his mind and just accepting it's it's what it is to get us where we want to get to which again was always save some money and then then go start the life that I wanted to do to serve people or do whatever what did you think at the time not knowing necessarily what you know today because I think today you have much more perspective on that but when he was 23 24 years old what did you imagine he was going to be like at 50 as a result of the injuries he already had like did you think did you did you have a vision in your mind of when we're 60 we're going to be just we're going to be hiking in

[00:22:22] Peru you know backpacking with our grandkids like did you did you think that it was all this was all going to be okay okay and these injuries are going to go away well he was always into Health he was always into um learning about his body he took great care he had great people Mike Clark great great people that were doing good things taking care of his body he was always very well there's double side tonight he was always very aware of what he put in his body and taking care of him through

[00:22:48] PT and Ice baths and all that stuff but he also loved like wings and beer and partying so I don't know which is which but I definitely thought that when he was done he would lose the weight and he would become hot and skinny and we would live a happy life I mean I never thought that I never he thought he would stay so big and that's kind of a side note I think when those guys get really big it's part of it's part of what they love about themselves there's a respect that they get when they walk into a room they don't actually want to get that much smaller um one of our best friends Tony is but he was always fit but he really and Jack um Jeff did too they both got really skinny I think Nate secretly loved being big um cuz he would lose weight but he never really loved himself at 235 he loved himself around 260 and I think that was still too much weight so as the years went by that would be a fight that we had quite often like when are you going to start like when are you going to start doing what you promised you would do which was lose all the weight and stop dipping and you know just don't drink as many beers and don't eat chicken wings and nachos and it just he would have spurts of it but the

[00:23:57] Allentown in him just couldn't couldn't be stopped so you guys married in ' 02 married in ' 02 and then he retired in 02 or 03 he retired um right before my son was born so I think 04 oh okay all right so was that a happy day for you it was mixed it was um well he didn't have a job he didn't have a lot of life skills emails had just started we had just started technology was not Nate's

[00:24:26] Jam um he lived in a in this in a world way up in way up in the sky he lived in Big Dreams and big hopes and I was like we have a baby on the way and like what are you going to do for a living I was a pharmaceutical sales rep which was not my ideal job but it was a great job to have coming out of college I didn't know what he was going to do and I think a lot of guys when they transition out of football most of them only play three to four or five years you kind of just get dropped into the world again and all your friends that you went to college with they've been working for five or six years and you now are starting at an entry L jobble like maybe 40,000 a year you're used to making that a week you're used to everyone worshiping you it's a huge transition to for these guys yeah people it's very easy if you're not mindful of it to lose sight of what the median experience is like in the NFL right right not the mean right because the mean gets dragged up by the Tom Brady

[00:25:26] Aaron roders you know the guys that have remarkable longevity remarkable skill make a remarkable amount of money but if you talk median like what's the guy right in the middle the 50th percentile guy yeah he might be in the league for three years maybe right he might have made a million or two over three years before taxes before paying agents and then the other thing is what did that do to his life expectancy statistically just how many years did he pay for that um um and when you look at it that way you know it's sort of like any sport right I mean I shouldn't say any sport I think football is one of the worst boxing would be another example right it's very easy to see the guys at the top of that but the pyramid that those guys stand on is a base this wide that's getting crushed yeah and I think and I mean obviously last the last four games that we've watched the past two weeks have given me this this dual experience that I continue to have around football um that it is this great unifier and this great Community Builder and this this wonderful thing that brings people together and brings a bunch of people joy and brings the players a lot of opportunities and a lot of gifts and gives their families a ton of things and then there's this whole other side that we don't see a ton of which is the guys that played three years and are still beat up or they don't have any money or they couldn't transition um I don't know I I don't know how to and especially after the past two weeks weekends watching these playoff games they were so fun and it it made you love football and it made you see this is a great thing and I would never let my kid play and you know I would never have a kid in a helmet but I don't I I used to think I had all the answers about certain things and that I had you know a really strong opinion one way or the other and I'm probably more conflicted about a lot of things in life than I ever was and maybe that's a good thing um but I feel icted about football and I I can't speak for Nate because he's not here but I would love to hear what he has to say what his perspective was um I know what his buddy's per perspective is and I I do think that it's that a lot of them it's it's a great honor to play that Sport and it's like the you're like the king of of of what everybody wants to do you know you you get this opportunity that kids dream of but there is a price and we don't really show that side of it we don't tell kids like what's that guy doing 10 years later we don't do ESPN um spotlights on that right remember when

[00:28:02] MTV used to always do that where are they now where are they now oh my God this was my roommate in med school this was our this is the only thing we would watch on TV every single week we would never miss it and what we loved about it was it was always the same story you could just plug in a new name of a band like this week it's mle crew right this week's it's Guns and Roses but guess what it's the same story that's actually an interesting just idea like where are these people that were so amazing three years ago or five years ago what do they do now where do they live what do their crib what is their crib look like today how are they financially how's their relationship with their children with their kids um I've obviously been surrounded by guys like Tony Gonzalez and Jeff Saturday who are exceptional men husbands friends um but I know that is not always the case so I don't know these discussions have been had at length um the book has brought out uh very strong opinions on both sides I'd like to come back to that because I think um I too feel conflicted about a lot of this stuff so what city were you guys living in when Ned retired so basically when he got released by Kansas

[00:29:13] City we went out to visit a friend that lived in Manhattan Beach California and he said you got to come to this little town it's so great and so we went out there and then while we were there he got picked back up by I don't remember what team maybe the Rams again verm always grabbed him again when he could just a good man and I said I'm just going to stay I'm not going to keep bouncing around I'm going to get a job because someone's got to get a job someone's got to take care of this family I said he was like please so I stayed and he played about another year and a half and then he his last team was the Cardinals they gave him a shot but he was done I mean he was emotionally done you have to really want it and he was so tired of sitting in the me there's a lot of sitting in football there's a lot of film and watching and

[00:29:52] Nate was like after a while this is just like this cannot be my life can't just be watching like run X and O's I like he had Big Dreams to change the world and so once he got cut we moved back and we moved into Elsa gundo pretty quickly after that we got pregnant and he went back both of you both of us got pregnant

[00:30:12] Nate Nate looked pregnant I I I looked really pregnant so we lived in eligendo he went back and got his masters in social work yeah did that did that surprise you that um I mean in a way I'm sure it didn't because of how much he loved the world and wanted to help people but did dis you that that was the chosen path so he comes to his dad was a minister at Harvard and his mom was a professor at Holy Cross um so he comes from an academic kind of service oriented family that was if like some kids are told to be Bankers he was told to serve so that was pretty much in his soul so I don't know and he didn't have a ton of skill sets I I don't what did he study in college like every he studied football no he studied

[00:30:53] Communications like we all did along with the help of many people um that's back in the day so yeah I mean we didn't he didn't have any he didn't he hadn't had an email everything when you're in NFL by the way that runs me a funny story I I'm GNA try not to name names here because it's not please just make up a student name yeah yeah yeah but so so about the I don't know I won't even tell what year because then you could figure out who it was but years ago a few years ago um I was helping out a buddy who wanted me to come and do some work with the kids who were going to be probably the top 10 picks out of college so had the potential to be so meaning they all went in the first two rounds including Heisman Trophy winner so there's 10 of us there the guy who brings me in to help me and then there's these 10 kids some of whom are playing right now and are the best in the NFL right and so the guy who had me come in talk to them he's like hey look you know we did some blood work on them we want to talk about nutrition we want to talk about you know like what can they do to optimize their performance so he he brings me to this conference room it's beautiful and it's in Petco

[00:32:02] Park in San Diego which is where everyone was meeting and you know I'm starting to try to explain like some of the biochemistry but and I'm keeping it I'm not believe me I'm not going all in on this right I'm just doing like you know glucose you know glucose right and oh God what did the guy say so one of the guys goes he's so bad the guy who won the

[00:32:23] Heisman was like I don't know which I I don't understand any of this and one of the other guys who I think honestly I could probably say is the single most successful one that came out of that class he's like dude did you not take biology and he goes well I took it yeah I I mean what do you what do you call taking what's your definition of taking yeah I mean I just don't know and this was 25 years ago right am I that old yeah um this was it was it was just different it was different back then and he didn't have it I don't know what a lot of these guys do you know I didn't know so I wasn't surprised I was just glad that he I thought I remember thinking because I managed a lot of his life cuz he was up you know in a marriage they say someone's the balloon and someone's The Rock he was like the biggest goodye blimp on the planet Earth and I was the most uptight neurotic best rock you could I mean there was no fun no joy no nothing and he would just float around and so I was like I mean I think I probably said like you need to go back to school cuz we needed a transition we need did something where like he learned how to type cuz remember we have tutors and stuff in college and so and they we have lots of practices and we need a lot of help and so I just remember thinking I don't think he can go get a job like that would just be a a disaster like he'd be like and also your ego has to adjust to being nothing from being like signing autographs as a Super

[00:33:49] Bowl champion to being like an assistant to I don't know whatever you get when you're 24 25 so School seemed like the best way to slowly modulate back to a normal life like have things responsible and you have due dates and deadlines so and he had this he had a dream to help people but he had no idea what it meant to be a social worker how much you made and he couldn't comprehend and I remember when he finished he graduated valid dictorian which was exceptional because he barely got out of Chapel

[00:34:18] Hill and he went to an interview and he's like they said it's $50,000 for the year he said I don't even know that is slavery I was like that's a wrong word he's he was like he's like and you know every time I want to take a vacation I have to ask somebody with a sheet and put the dates down I mean what are they I mean he was he the TPM forms or whatever they're called yeah he was just like what are you talking about he's like I get 10 days and I was like welcome to the world buddy but it was so he couldn't believe it he was just flored that's kind of amazing isn't it he was floored he's like this is outrageous because football you have like a good four months off to do whatever and you've got money the bank and you people high-fiving you and life is good and then you go back to and they're like you could I remember listening him talk to HR and he's like so what if I don't want to what if I want more vacation days and they're like nope he was like this is he was just blown away by it so he was pretty depressed during that period of our life and I remember I remember early on being like listen I didn't sign up for I I need to know can you do this are we going to make this because you already had Jack right I had Jack and I said I don't know what you have to do to make I didn't need him to be happy but I I was like with this transition it we we knew going into it that this was a problem most most guys I think 70% end up broke and divorced after they're done that's a really big number that's staggering of people that just fall apart and the average year years you play is three so

[00:35:50] I mean that's a lot of people that are literally falling off a cliff after they do professional football in their mid 20s mid 20s with and and they're probably the heroes so they go home and they like work at a bar in their High School town because they they they want to feel good again um so we were just determined to find a new way but it was bumpy it was bumpy um he was sad he was sad and Nate was always very aware when he I don't know if he had anxiety but I know he had depression and I know that um he didn't want to feel bad and he hated that he didn't he didn't know why and he worked really hard I mean he was well read and he would try everything um and so after a while once he kind of started to find some purpose in the social work it got better and then at a certain point he's like I can't live on the salary and like every good athlete does he decided to go into Financial advising because there's nobody you want to manage your money more than a football player no but he was great and he really he felt that he'd seen so many guys lose a bunch of money to the wrong people so he loved Finance he loved

[00:36:54] Investments he's he loved gambling so that's kind of what the stock market is in its own way and so he moved into that at Morgan Stanley and loved it and ended up starting helping guys that were in unions like just line workers and Verizon guys just like blue class Blue Collar guys that just needed help with the money that they' saved making sure it was invested well so he kind of felt like he got the allent town and the finance stuff and was able to serve and so that ended up being his career that he took on for the rest of his life and when did you guys start to have those discussions about Hey where's the 230 PB version of you who's kind of getting back into what you know you had sort of imagined life post NFL would look like I mean day one I mean I rode that man so hard for his whole life he could take more beatings from me verbally and from coaches and teams I just I was tough I I was like you you're this is not going to work you you don't look good you're not healthy and he would he was always he wanted to be better and so he would have times when he would get really shape and he was probably the guy in our neighborhood that everybody listened to healthwise because he had all the information there was just certain things he he you know he would he would always do like sober January February and then was when the sun would come out again get a little dicey March April by the summer he was full Bor just having a ball and then forget about it once the

[00:38:16] Yankees started Wheels were off and we would cycle through that did he ever go visit a doctor during this period of time so the NFL has a program where you go once a year so I I don't know the details on this don't hold me on this but you either you sign something where you either say you'll never sue them again and we'll give you care like you go every year to an NFL um some type of physical or you can do your own thing but we're not going to take care I I don't know the details but we chose the one where we we took some money you take a lump sum of something and and then you can't ever sue them about certain things and then they kind of put you in a program where they check in with you every year mentally physically and so he would do that but I now looking back I actually found his records from his last year and he had told me like everything was fine and then I everything was fine except for this one page that was so not fine um which was his heart and his cholesterol and his weight and we didn't really talk about that I mean one thing

[00:39:16] I think if I could go back and do different things in my marriage I would have had a different tactic because I think I I was so scared that I was mean and then it didn't feel safe for him to tell me the truth so he just put it aside and was like I'll I'll deal with that I'll take care of it but I'm not going to get into it with her um but I always wanted him to be skinnier and his mom I mean it was the biggest thing that his mom used to say to him was like please lose the weight please lose the weight but it was really hard for him was he still exercising lifting weights and things like that he always worked out very physical very athletic I mean he was he was still really good we played football every Thanksgiving in elag gundo and he was great fast talented strong yeah people don't appreciate you'd think well what's a defensive lineman or defensive tackle like they're so big but they can't be that fast they are so fast he was the most athletic man I've ever seen he could he was the strongest man I've ever seen and he had a work ethic physically that he he would just he could go forever he could also rest forever too he was extreme in every in every way good and bad so your daughter was born in what year 2008 got it okay so fast forward to November of 2017 yeah you had some premonitions that something wasn't right I mean how how much of that do you think you now look back at and think I I can only appreciate this now through the retrospectoscope versus at the time did you think there's something wrong with me like I'm really losing it mhm well there's two parts that my friends will tell you you were very vocal something was wrong so I have witnesses that remember for about two or three years like something's wrong with her she can't settle she's anxious and I would say I don't know what's wrong something's not right and I was so scared I was nervous um travel had become just really what were you doing at the time were you still working as I was working in chel Hill okay um no I was working in recruiting in medical recruiting and so the the team that I had in chap hill was a group of guys that I had gone to college with that played football and so I would go back every month cuz my team was there and for years I started in 2012 it was fine but then around 2014 15 I started just dreading leaving the family but it made no sense the kids were in a great age Nate was doing great but my anxiety was through the roof I'd wake up sweating I'd wake up and how long each month would you have to be gone maybe three or four days do you think you were anxious that Nate could couldn't handle getting them to school on time or what what what do you think was upsetting you I mean I don't know how woooo spiritual I can get here but I

[00:42:05] I felt like something was coming it's the best way I can describe it something's coming and the message to me was prepare like somehow something's coming that's big you don't know what it is I can't explain it but and there was something about Nate that was floating away and I was trying to get to him and

[00:42:25] I was also trying to manage this unexplained anxiety that had you ever experienced anxiety growing up like were you an anxious person by Nature not I mean I I wonder what my friends would say I wasn't anxious but I I needed to swim six hours a day so I don't know I don't know what that means I've always you know had energy yeah a lot of energy but

[00:42:44] I don't remember being nervous or fearful I wasn't a lot of fun like I wasn't the party girl I didn't do drugs I wasn't like let's stay out all night I was always like we need to get home and very responsible but I wasn't anxious but I never was I never was a let go I was never like let's just see where where the wind takes us um but I didn't have panic attacks and those you know the knights this the kns that are just you can't stop your brain going those became more and more and more the two years before he died um and I had the sensation did you ever talk with him about it all the time what would you say please don't die what would he say I promise I'm not going to I won't leave you don't worry I I'm here something I would say like I can't live without you like you're my best friend you're you're like the only person I know like you're the best dad in the world I'll cry thinking about it and he would be like

[00:43:37] I'm right here I'm never going to leave you um and fast forward I don't think he has but um in many ways but yeah and I I just was like Nate I can't I don't know what's wrong with me and he's like you just need to calm down you and his big thing was just stop being afraid what are you so afraid of you're so he used to say like you walk around so afraid of everything like what if you just knew everything was okay okay like he's like everything's okay babe like you're okay we're okay the kids are okay and that was always his message and there was nights that I would go to bed and he would be watching a show and he was always watching something really masculine like Oprah's you know final show and he'd just be sobbing you know and or Mr Holland's Opus or some like show that just like he just and he would just cry and and I would say what I'd come out and say like what's wrong he's like I just hope I I hope I have enough time I hope that I can make a difference in this world and there there came a point where

[00:44:33] I I would wake up and I couldn't find him and I felt like he was gone and I'd scream for him and he would be like I'm right here I'm in the other room but you'd literally scream literally would and the only reason I know this is all true is because I would tell my friends you guys I wake up and I scream and I feel like Nate's gone and he always comes in and he says I'm right here don't worry about it but so those things started to happen and and in conjunction with that I said well I need help so that's when I started to really dig into self-help in spiritual books and I was like where is there's got to be an answer here and it turns out there wasn't an answer but there was a huge toolkit I was about to be given for what

[00:45:06] I think I knew was coming and tell me more about that so I feel like every when I started reading um obviously vision's book the code of the extraordinary mind and and that's kind of a book that I talk about because it it it was pivotal for Nate and I we read it together and then we gave it to Tony and when we gave it to Tony he loved it so much and he's a big seeker of information and he then contacted visan who wrote the book and through a bunch of beautiful synchronicities I got an opportunity to go to this um event in Jamaica and it was I grew up in a spiritual family everybody you know Wayne Dyer Esther

[00:45:47] Perell we did course and miracles um very open-minded religiously everybody could believe what they wanted the idea was about love and God and being Fearless I come from a very fear-based family but we really believed in being Fearless just no one had mastered it quite yet um and so Nate kept saying like I don't you got to fix this I don't know what's going on with you but you can't keep living like this meanwhile

[00:46:10] Nate was just crushing life at this point he was starting a nonprofit in watts and he was doing great in his career and he was just really happy but there was something about him that I felt like he was I mean this is so cheesy but floating away I couldn't get to him the way I couldn't his eyes didn't seem he seemed um far away he would forget things um he like he was we were barbecuing and he put all the lighter fluid on the fence and then lit lit the match and the whole fence lit up that's not like where are my keys so what did you think about that I I just thought like I don't I don't I don't remember did you think he was being funny deliberately he because he felt terrible after he hated himself after he' bered himself like I don't know what's wrong with me I can't remember and he would forget his keys always and he would um he would make little mistakes so I don't know that he knew something was wrong with him too and I can tell because he started doing like mind exercises and he was trying to get going there he would just say like I don't know why I feel so down he felt really sad um the last year of his life he was just and it wasn't depression as much as it was just it wasn't him I don't I it's hard to describe but besides Tony and Jeff who who else was he still in touch with regularly closely from the NFL all of them all most I mean all the guys that coach for so they were retired by then as well how many of these guys could understand what he was talking about I don't know that he talked about it with a lot of people um his best friend Chris in the neighborhood was like he just won't share anything anymore he doesn't seem himself Tony will say that Nate was always Nate and I do think when Nate would get around his buddies and they're all drinking he would be much more normal it was more when we were at home and the hard part is Nate was always different so but he wasn't always so sad there was a sadness to Nate did the kids appreciate this they'll tell they don't remember this at all it was subtle and it was subtle in a way that sometimes I don't even know if it was I don't know what it was it was just everything in me said something wrong and I know everything in him I I got his like I found his journals after he passed and a lot of them were like you've got to be more connected you're going to find Joy again there's nothing wrong with you um keep going you know just try harder like very much self-talk um trying to get out of whatever he was in how long after he died did you find the the journal very soon did you read it right away mhm did you hesitate for a moment were you worried about what you would find no the one thing about Nate and I is like I never I didn't feel like he hid anything from me no not not he was hiding anything from you but were you afraid that you might see that he was in a pain that you didn't appreciate I feel that I didn't I wasn't worried about that then because I didn't know what I know now um I honestly didn't know how sick he was once I found out I was devastated because I was so mean I was mean I was I didn't I didn't know what was wrong with them and so I wish I could and I wish I could go back and be kinder but I had no no clue and he was somebody who just was like he wouldn't put it on me he would just deal with it on his own so I wish I could have if I had known he was so sick I would have been much Kinder much Kinder um so no I didn't I don't I don't really know what

[00:49:44] I felt at the time I would be making it up if I said it just felt like I was losing my husband and he seemed different from all the other husbands he seemed older and tireder quickly that's the thing like I remember Tony and he were it was Halloween right before he died and I remember thinking like why does Tony look so young and vibrant and Nate looks so tired and exhausted um and there's a thousand reasons why now that now we know but so you going to keep going with the Jamaica story yeah so it's it's early November of 2017 and you don't want to go on this trip right so we go to New York about a month before for a birthday and I have probably the biggest and the last Panic one of the last panic attacks that I've had of my life um and I just said Nate I can't go to

[00:50:28] Jamaica and and he takes his sleep apnea mask off and we're in Midtown you know and he's like listen you lunatic you're going on this trip you need to live you need to learn to live fearlessly like you have all these gifts and you are trapped in our house and in all this fear and it's time for you to go and I want you to go on that trip and I want you to come back changed and and and he's and he never told me what to do he was very supportive but he was like this is a non-negotiable if we're going to make it

[00:50:56] I cannot live with this anymore you are fine we are good I promise you everything's okay and he was serious like I he was very rarely serious but he's like you're going like I'm not we're not doing this and so the weekend November 8th I he took me to the airport and he never took me to the airport because a guy loved to sleep and so it was an early flight but he's like I want to drive you which was very out of character for him he don't he had no problem putting his wife in an

[00:51:24] Uber zero zero he'd be like good luck you're good so I remember we he could even call The Uber right yeah he would do everything jerk um so we were driving to the airport and I remember I was texting with Toby because she was we got so long story short we got invited to go to this event in Jamaica it was like a spiritual Retreat whim Hoff Steven

[00:51:45] Cutler um Marissa Pierce Jim quick great speakers people doing great things and Toby through their relationship Tony and Toby's with vision we got to go to this event called a F and it's a it's a three or 4 Day event twice a year where you go and you just talk to people that are doing great things and look into your stuff and hear great speakers so I I'm texting Toby and Nate grabs my hand and he never did this and he was like can you put your phone down can you just put your phone down this will break me and he said just I just want to be with you I just want to be with you for this next five minutes until we get out and then you can text her and so we just held hands and he drove you know he drove me to the terminal and he just said like you're the most amazing woman I've ever met in my life he's like I've never met anybody like you wow I'm really crying um he said but

[00:52:35] I just want you to know I love you more than anything and I hope you go have fun and that you come back a better person and ready to do what I know you're meant to do and I don't want you to worry about anything because we are going to be fine and you know I just I love you so much so go have fun and we kissed and

[00:52:53] I went on and of course because I'm always been very cheap I decided not to get the um Talk plan in Jamaica so we just texted for 4 days the most beautiful text you could ever imagine um just about what I was learning and how supportive he was and he was like you're doing so great this is awesome I was like I'm going to be different I'm going to move more during sex it's going to be great like you're going to love this and then it was the last day and I remember whim Hoff had just spoken and his wife had died when she was young and he was left with four kids and I remember thinking like that would suck that would suck so bad if your spouse left especially a good one you know so I went and I got in the water and I was swimming CU we had one more um event it was like a bike a boat a boat

[00:53:39] Excursion I remember I was swimming in the water and I felt like I felt the divine all around me and I remember thinking like Everything's changed like Everything's changed like I get it now like I don't need to be afraid I could breathe and I I I thought to myself I can't wait to tell Nate he's going to be so happy and if you knew the time I was swimming in the water and you knew what was happening in Los Angeles it would blow your mind so I got out of the water and I was still in my suit put on some jean shorts and I was getting ready to go smoke some Jamaican weed and get on a boat and just you know be the new Kelsey just like in the moment and my phone rang a couple times and it was a number

[00:54:15] I didn't know and I was like not today you know I'm I'm in Jamaica I'm doing the thing and then my best friend called and she said listen I don't want you to do the Kelsey I don't want you to freak out and she said but Nate was at um skyone trampoline park and he fell we don't really know what happened we're going to go your your brother-in-law is going to go get the kids and your mom's heading over to UCLA but everything's fine go onto the boat and I remember I just took a breath and I was like he's dead and she's like he's not dead and everything

[00:54:51] Peter in my body knew that man was gone like everything and so I felt like I was just waiting for the rest of the world to catch up to what I already knew which was this was the thing because I also when I got to Jamaica all my anxiety went away it was almost like sliding doors and once I made the decision to go on that trip this was this was what was going to happen and I assume that if

[00:55:14] Nate was smart he knows if I had been there I would have been like you don't die on me like I would have been crazy so on some level I think he waited till the last day because I had gotten all the information and I had met all the people and so many of the people from Jamaica have been super influential in my recovery and my grief work and some of the Psychedelic things and so I told Toby I was like we're going to the airport she's like this is ridiculous everything's fine and I was like I didn't even I wasn't even talking

[00:55:43] I was just like packing and I was like get me there was one one flight and I was like get us to the airport and so we were driving down this Jamaican road with like potholes and I was in a taxi and the phone rang and I knew it it was my mom and she said the doctor would like to speak with you and I took the phone and he said I'm so sorry Mrs chick we tried everything we worked on him for 50 minutes because he looks so young but um he didn't make it and I remember I said you know is he dead and he said your husband had a heart attack and I said is my husband dead and he said yes Nate is dead and then I just said to them with no emotion he's dead and Toby was like who's dead and I was like Nate's dead and she screamed and and then began what would be the most transformative painful and probably beautiful last four and a half years of my life so how long did it take you to get back to LA so there was one plane going back to the US that day so it was late

[00:56:45] Saturday night and I knew I had to get home to my kids because they didn't know and I really didn't even know what they'd seen and that's another discussion we'll get into because I didn't really know there's a million things around that but they thought that he had fallen but as they now we I know more about what they thought but there was one seat left and when I got to the airport they were like you there's not enough time it was like 20 minutes the door was shut and through a thousand Miracles and I will say and I tell this to people all the time in your biggest challenges and crisises there are angels literally all around you I I mean I I I Envision them just God gives you or whatever you believe that the people show up for you and and it is miraculous so this one baggage claim guy was like just hold on and somehow he talked to them and it's in Jamaica too people are a little more laidback and they open the door which I really didn't think was ever humanly possible I think it's like the one thing I've never seen happen in like they're like nope it's an

[00:57:43] FAA commandment something exactly so I got on the plane and I had the last seat I was in an aisle and I went into shock and you know much more about the brain than I do but I remember thinking oh this is like what you see on TV when the woman's kid dies and she like just falls apart and I felt like I was having a break with reality so I started throwing up in the little white bag and

[00:58:05] I was hyperventilating and I couldn't I couldn't come back to I I couldn't integrate it I never had had an experience where you you thought you were going crazy and so nobody talked to me at all which I wouldn't have talked to me now I always talk to people when I see them like that but I think they were like enjoying their honeymoon or their girls trip and they're like lunatic you know in aisle 7 like get away from her so I just I panicked for about 20 minutes and then the um the seat Bel sign went off and all of a sudden there's this beautiful Jamaican woman in this gorgeous dress and she's standing next to me in the roow in the aisle and she puts her hand on my shoulder and she puts a hand on my forehead and she says baby girl I don't know what you're going through or what awaits you on the other side of this plane but I want you to know that there are so many people praying for you and

[00:58:56] God loves you and I love you and you are stronger than you think and she said um she said slow your breathing down baby girl and decide who you want to be when you land when when this plane lands and I don't know what it was but I it it recalibrated my breathing and she kind of just patted my shoulder she left and then I actually spent the next four hours on that flight the layover in

[00:59:24] Texas and then the flight home deciding hopefully who I would be you know a week from now a month from now 5 years from now 10 years from now because on that plane ride I got really clear that they had just lost their dad but they weren't going to lose me and that kind of became my North Star from then on and I got home I went to my mother-in-law my mom picked me up probably the worst drive you could ever imagine from from LAX at about midnight and I went to my friend's house and um do you want me to go into this part yeah this is the part that you just you can't make it better but I got to my friend's house where my kids were they were 9 and 12 at the time and they had been waiting all day and I had lied to them and they said is Dad okay and I had said over FaceTime you know he's not doing well but you know let's just keep praying for him and I because I I I couldn't bear to tell them over the phone I had to be there and so now it's funny cuz we joke about that like you lied about really big things I'm like I know I did but I I've admitted to it so

[01:00:28] I got there and I gave them both a hug and I asked everybody to leave and I just said I said three things I said um your father would have never left us if we weren't going to be okay it just wasn't his style do you understand me and they nodded yes Mom and then I said um I need you to know that I'm enough I have no idea how

[01:00:54] I'm going to do this I don't know how to live life without your father I don't know how to raise you guys without your father but I'm certain I'm going to figure it out and we're going to have a great life and you guys need to stay being 9 and 12 and don't need to worry about anything because I've got this do you understand and I said yes Mom and then I said the most important thing I need you to know is that you are not victims that you had the best father for 9 and 12 years and he focused all of his energy on you he loved you with everything he had and he was the kindest most patient amazing human being I've ever met and some kids don't get that for a day so just always remember that you're the lucky ones do you understand and they were like yes Mom and then I asked them both and they were tiny and I said what do you guys need from me and they said if you're okay we're okay and so I mean

[01:01:42] I tell every mother like you would become okay too um and that's what we've done we kind of from that point on fought for Joy while acknowledging excruciating pain and doing it at the same time now the days got pretty dark still oh yeah the first two years were just brutal brutal tell me about the lowest lows I think the first night if you've ever lost someone suddenly you feel like you're you've been set on fire I I can't explain the physical pain of grief I always thought it was mental but um grief is grief and Trauma is very physical um you want to get out of your body you know I never understood why people cut I never understood why you I never understood suicide I never understood you know drive people driving into trees when the pain is so big you have no way to describe it and I had tons of resources and love and support and I still thought like this isn't going to work um the beginning was surreal and I just it's it's hard to imagine how you're going to live in a world that so quickly becomes a planet you've never been on um he was everything to us like he was he was he was the guy um I didn't even know an adult life without him in it and he was a much better parent than me in a thousand ways so I knew early on like we had a huge deficit when it came to honesty spirituality kindness service he was just exceptional I was great at like scheduling carpools and I was like well that's not going to lead to like a good kid you know that we've got problems here um and I think when the numbness wore off of like the the memorials over and there was a thousand hard times I think the morg was exceptionally awful to go see him and see him dead which you didn't want to do at all you fought like hell not to yeah I mean I remember thinking like what are you kidding me I'm not going to go see I'm not going to say goodbye to my husband dead like I thought it was insane that someone would offer that um by the grace of God and I this is I don't have much advice about anything but if people have been through it trust them they know this and I had another angel that was like you have to go say goodbye to your husband and I had probably one of the most beautiful experiences um because I

[01:04:08] I got some closure that I never thought I would get and I have a great story of when I went to the morg and and I you know it was an awful experience and there was police and there's nurses and they pulled him out of a freezer and he's just laying there and he has he's still intubated but somehow all that

[01:04:26] Fades away and I just started to talk to him and my best friend was there and I talked to him for about 10 or 15 minutes just told him how much I loved him and how grateful I was and how you know I would do the best for him and the kids and then when I got up my I asked my best friend like how'd it go and she's like reminded me a lot of real life you just talked at him for a long time and he just stared at you kindly and I was like that's so true um so the morg was tough the corners was awful death is such a business and there's the legality the do they ask you if you would like an autopsy given that no foul play it's your option no when you die in a public place in La you have to do a I see you have to do a autopsy so that was on the books from the beginning um I think the at about six months I thought this won't work and

[01:05:15] I've never had when you say this life yeah I I've never had Suicidal Thoughts I've been depressed I've been down I've been anxious but I never thought like how do we get out of here did you ever find yourself thinking like these kids now are the greatest thing I have and they're my anchor to him but they're also kind of the anchor that's holding me to this earth like it's a very different calculation to think about ending your life with kids versus without well my mom used to always tell you the one thing you lose once you have kids is the right to kill yourself she used to say that all the time she's like you know what else you can't even kill yourself once you have them because it wouldn't be fair to them and I remember thinking that but I also remember thinking I want want to take them with me I remember thinking like we got to get to him there was this a couple nights where I thought so this isn't going to work I've tried everything this doesn't work I feel lost I'm I'm so broken I'm so scared emotionally spiritually physically financially I didn't know how we were going to do it and so I I ended up I mean I I people talk about this in the chapter but I ended up just saying like I'm going to talk to my son because I knew he was 12 and I knew he was in a bad spot so when tell me about that tell me about like what you saw in both of them over that six-month period of time just like I mean if you have kids just especially

[01:06:39] I'm guessing like after Christmas right so my guess is it's a blur through Thanksgiving and Christmas it's hell Y and then January just so dark dark in every way like it's January's dark to begin with but when you've lost the person that you worshiped and the person that kind of was the light in our family like he was just he was great he was a great dad they were so sad and confused and just a different level of sad like the saddest like they just got screwed for their whole lives and they'll never be normal again and kids just want to be normal and they want to go to school and they don't want to be the person that's dealing with the great tragedy um they were embarrassed they were how do you know that they would say it's just like the worst to not have a dad it's so embarrassing embarassing not to have a dad you know like it's just awful and like nobody will talk to me Jack says no one he says no one makes fun of me anymore no one jokes with me parents look down when I walk past them he said everyone avoids me so because you don't know what to say and then there's always the kids who the parent was like you go say something to them and they were like sorry your dad died you know or something like that but we just I couldn't we' done a bunch of counseling counseling wasn't working at the time we couldn't find the right fit for everybody and I've learned a lot about trauma since then but I think it was a little early for the kids to be forced to talk about it and I don't know if you've read um what happened to you the

[01:08:01] Oprah Winfrey no book with um Bruce I don't know who I don't know but she talks about like kids it takes a while for them to be able to process what they saw and felt whereas adults we have enough life experience to to be able to talk about it but watching their dad die it wasn't something they could talk about but I kept trying to force them to do counseling and be like tell us about the day your dad died and they would just you know they would close their ears literally physically and rock and

[01:08:25] I'd be like I am not we are going to talk about this so I did a lot of things that I thought that's really interesting they would literally react that way like a baby like they would go like like I can't hear you I can't hear you and what did the therapist think of that did they recognize that as a sign that they just weren't ready to talk about this yet yeah I mean eventually eventually but they would do things like and I don't want to say stupid things but like my daughter didn't want to draw about it she didn't want to like take a crayon and show her dad dying at Sky Zone um she really needed to forget about it for for a bit to integrate what she saw my son's a little more mature and he really needed someone to talk to other than me like he needed someone who didn't have a dog in the fight to talk about what it felt like to lose his dad so he actually over time had a great relationship with a therapist for a year and then as The 40-Year-Old that he is inside at the end he was like I think I'm done for now thank you so much for your help and I'll call you if I need you again but Jack really had um a clear intention at that age of what he needed through this and he said it's just nice to go talk to a woman that will listen to me and that was a a dig at me cuz he's like all you do is talk to me um but there was just a night that I thought like we got to go

[01:09:35] Jack like we gotta we got to get to Dad and so I said You Know Jack I'm thinking about killing all of us in tongue and cheek which we use a lot of laughter and Jack was like tell me how we're going to die mom and I was like well there's so many different ways but I I think the best one is that I'm going to drown you guys in the tub he's like great he's how old at this point he's 13 1 13 and he's like four Ines taller than me um he's like but you only let us fill the you know there's a drought in La so you only let us fill it up like 2 inches and and he's like I'm so much stronger than you I'm like I know but it's I'm going to do the best I can he's like okay good luck and it the more we talked about the stuff and the more we laughed the better it got and then a couple weeks later Jack said you know Mom I I I if I had a gun I would kill myself and I said you know I totally get it I didn't say like that's awful don't do it cuz I

[01:10:21] I understood and I just remember thinking was well we just won't have guns in our house that's what and we never did but I I remember thinking I I know how to avoid this and I said just hang on for today and then tomorrow and little by little like he's like I don't think I want to kill myself anymore um so we navigated through that the first year was just the crying at night and the nights are really dark when you have grief and when you have little kids because they need so much because they are at night is when everybody whether you're an adult I don't know I mean I wake up in the middle of the night or I used to quite a bit with just terrible anxiety and their fear was so big and I just didn't think I had enough energy to be there for them on my own how were you sleeping I mean I don't remember I don't remember sleeping the first year very much because I was always somebody always needed something the first year at nights such as meaning the kids themselves somebody would be crying somebody would be losing it someone would be um not well and you slept in three different rooms mhm well a lot many times we slept together um my daughter slept with me for a long time after he died and just she wanted to C crawl back in my uterus like I would I thought to myself like I'll never be able to leave the house again like my life's over I'll never be able to have fun again I'll never be happy again but amongst all of that I also thought we're going to be okay like there was an there was a under there was a knowing somewhere that like this was just part of it but it wasn't always going to be this way but it felt like it was always going to be this way so I toggled through hopefulness and just

[01:12:01] Devastation but I knew we needed to hold on to the fact that this was appropriate and it wouldn't last forever like there we were built to last like humans are built to last we aren't the first people who lost their father I think our generation hasn't lost as many people as Generations before so it's just much more rare for us and it's more shocking but this has been happening yeah it's interesting you say that like you sort of

[01:12:27] Imagine let's just go back in time 10,000 years not that far but just 10,000 years perfect and it's basically the same thing it's you and Nate and the kids um you know you're hunter gatherers so it's a little different you don't have electricity and all that stuff but there's certainly a scenario in which n gets an infection and dies there's a scenario in which an animal attacks him

[01:12:45] I mean like as you said it's not that uncommon that this would happen how knowing what you know now I mean I've never thought about it this way but do you get the sense that the the Kelsey of 10,000 years ago would have had an easier time with this and if so would it have been because of expectations or would it been have been because of the community that you would have been stuck with like you wouldn't have had your own house for example um both I think the expectation that now everybody lives till their 90 happily ever after married with two kids and a mom and a dad um that expectation is set us up to be much much less resilient because there's this like one way and it it's um it's all about joy and fun whereas I think 10,000 years ago you saw people recover all the time from awful things babies died and people went to war and there was famine we have so much now that our anxiety is higher than ever before and I I felt that way before he died because when everything as opposed to being really joyful when you have everything it's so counterintuitive isn't it yeah yeah because now you have everything you don't want it to you don't want to fall apart whereas back then they were like well this is this isn't that good so whatever I can handle things we just don't handle things and we don't um we're not used to feeling extremely uncomfortable anymore life is so comfortable things are so easy not for everybody obviously for people with resources well I mean I think for everybody compared to 10,000 years ago 100% 100% yeah and this idea that pain is bad and death is bad and that's a whole discussion um you know now I have a completely different relationship with death um I have a completely different relationship with what it means for the physical body to leave and that Nate isn't gone and we didn't get screwed and um there wasn't a right time for him to leave or not so there's so many nuances that through the last four and a half years have changed the way I feel um I'm still toggling between all the different ideas around grief you know there's a whole like my mother-in-law believes like I will grieve forever I will grieve forever and that's just how it is and our country wants everyone to be happy and I'm not happy and I'm like that's fine and that's a choice I I personally now believe again I'm back to this the football analogy holding two beliefs at the same time um I can be grieving very deeply and very grateful at the same time they they don't have to be one you don't go through one stage at the other I miss

[01:15:10] Nate terribly and I am so happy I don't know what to tell you I'm happier than I've ever been in my life and I've been through the worst thing ever and then I had some medical stuff just I think that came up from grief and all the things that I was most afraid of I've made it through and I am so excited about life so I don't know so how long after Nate died did you get the autopsy results back so we got the Heart part which is so he died of cardiomyopathy of the left ventrical and the doctor called and just said we could tell right away he was a football player um his heart was so stretched out it was so big and he said listen Mrs ched you you want all big muscles just not a big heart nobody needs to have a big heart physically you can have it spiritually but you don't want a huge heart and he said when big men move that much weight around at that speed it just it's it it overuses it and the muscle just gives out he said big men and big animals die early and he said um he was 98% blocked in all of his arteries and um basically his left vcal just had no more give so he he explained it to me as a water balloon that had just been stretched out and there was just no pump anymore and he said big fat people can live a long time if they sit all day and watch TV but if you're out playing football at

[01:16:39] Thanksgiving and you know on the treadmill trampoline yeah and running he would run the beach and jump on the trampoline he's like your heart doesn't do that he said your your husband had a huge I mean I love on his autopsy it said he died of a enlarged heart which I just think is Beautiful cuz he had a really big heart put that on the tombstone exactly yeah that's true that's true so that was um about 3 months after he died and then and did they also look at his brain presumably they didn't and they did but they didn't have the right tools so they're like I don't we didn't see anything I'm like well what did you do I mean it's LA

[01:17:09] County morg her Corners I don't they don't think they have the equipment so when did it first occur to you to maybe get the people at Boston University involved we had just started to talk about this a couple years before and I'd gotten like the pamphlet from the NFL that said you know whatever the players benefit and there had been a lot of talk

[01:17:29] I hadn't watched um concussion yet with Will Smith I have since then but I I knew and I if I'm being completely honest I thought oh well maybe there'll be some compensation financially if he did have CT but I'm sure I don't know if he did or I don't know but I want to make sure because it would depend on whether I'd let Jack play because we he was going to lyola and he was going to play football most likely so I said I need to know if football had anything to do with it the heart thing pretty much sealed the deal but I was like I wonder what was going on with Nate's brain so Boston

[01:18:04] University was exceptional Dr mcke was exceptional Lisa the whole group there is phenomenal and so uh La Corners sent his brain tissue and they coordinated it with Boston and they went they said it'll be about a year because we're going to do a um we're going to I don't I'm using the wrong words we like pathological and do interview yeah the clinical clinical Y and so we're going to interview everybody and talk about it and his parents had an even more feeling of him floating away and being different as did his brother and I think I live day-to-day with him so it was harder to tell the the changes because they were so gradual where did his brother live he lives in La so we saw him a lot M and the irony is his brother is just an exceptional been sober 14 years but for so long we were trying to keep Luke alive and it was just the way that it switched and Nate was gone and Luke is still here in a huge huge part of our life but Luke said he felt the same way like there was a floating away and his mom especially was like he is not the son I knew five years how long did she feel that five years five years five years and his dad his dad's just a kind man he he just he he said um he doesn't really know how he felt or he doesn't remember but he knew that something was different about his son but he couldn't put his finger on it so about a year later um a little bit no maybe like nine months we got a call and um honestly I didn't know I didn't know what they were going to say but I didn't think they were going to say what they said and uh Dr mcke got on the phone and just said I'm I'm sorry to tell you but you know Nate had stage two almost stage three uh CTE he has lesions all over his brain and um I just want you to know that that would have been a really hard life so you know part of my ability to be in gratitude where a lot of other families that have football players aren't is that I don't have to live with a man that's slowly deteriorating before my eyes there are tons of people who have husbands that are healthy heartwise but not brain wise so that's where it gets tricky and that's where I continue to talk about it but again and you know for people to sort of understand what stage two and stage three is I mean Junior SE was stage two when he killed himself

[01:20:19] Aaron Hernandez was stage three when he killed himself um and you know if you looked at them from the outside notwithstanding sort of the criminal side of what was going on with there and you know they could tie their shoes and walk around so you wouldn't look at them and say Well they're you know they don't look like someone who's in the last stages of Alzheimer's disease but if you understand their behavior their moods and what people who are around them would say and of course in the case of Hernandez his behaviors leading up to everything um they weren't you know they were clearly not behaving the way they would have behaved if everything was to totally normal yeah I had seen Junior say I at a party about um cuz we used to live in San Diego and um there's a good friend of ours who was a very close friend of his and it was his 70th birthday and this was about a month before he killed himself and I remember like just he looked perfectly normal like everything was perfectly you know it's just great to see him and everything seemed totally fine and I couldn't believe it a month later yeah that's the thing about this disease and I think it's why it causes so much um discussion and disagreement ments and I mean I debate this with football guys all the time and then I debate it with the other side which is my mother and mother-in-law that are like it's football is the devil and then all the people that we love that are like listen it's the name of the game you know signing up for it um I don't it's again so although you know you could push back on that and say maybe that's true today was it true when they signed up for it yeah meaning Nate's generation yeah I don't think anybody talked about it I don't think everybody was lying about it for a really long time and and now it's interesting I mean just a fast forward there is no compensation anymore for CTE and I'm I'm making this up so don't seeme me but I I would think it's because anybody that dies that's played in the NFL probably has some level after the number of hits you take um I don't know what to do I I cannot imagine living with Nate the greatest man I ever knew with a severe brain disease that would either put us at risk or him at risk or at at at 42 I mean that's young that's very young I mean did the folks at be I don't know much about CTE um did the folks there say based on what we saw pathologically this was what the next 10 years would have looked like I mean or this was the next like could they tell you this is the rate at which this progresses and this is what you were in store for the next 5 years we never got into that but they said they would give you the list of symptoms of what it would look like and a lot of it was already there with Nate depression um increased drinking wanting to be alone fatigue um big outbursts you know anger me Nate never yelled at me in 21 years I mean he we we got after it in arguments but he never was mean and I remember I messed up like the internet or some Spectrum thing and he was like what the hell's wrong with you like I told you to fix Internet and

[01:23:13] I remember we both looked at each other and he was like sorry and I was like whoa I just had never heard him snap and that stuff I think what Dr mcke was saying is that would have inreased increase in frequency because if you look at their brain scans there's just dead spots or like the lesions look like they're just like sitting on that brain and nothing's firing there or it's firing incorrectly um it's not like CTE makes you nicer you know you know like some people have dimenstion they're

[01:23:40] Kinder it's not that way um this is one of the trickiest things how did you tell the kids about that I and was there solace in that I mean was that they do not find any solace in it which is interesting because you obviously do I do a ton they do not they go they'll be like Mom please like okay we know he at C but he's still dead we'd rather him be here they have no I my son always says like Mom please stop telling people we're lucky he hates it is it possible that he didn't witness what you witnessed in other words he never saw that his dad was deteriorating 100% And I think he was little I he worshiped his dad he was just 12 you know he was in sixth grade um

[01:24:25] I don't think any they he was their hero he they he he never did anything wrong in their eyes he was the best so they are like I don't know what what story you're making up about this CTE thing but that's I don't we can't even comprehend dad not being dad um so I tried to honor that now because yeah but

[01:24:42] I will say what Jack did honor was I'll never play football and there was something in my son's eyes that was grateful he didn't have to he won't admit that but I promise you when he's 40 he'll tell you I didn't want to go do that sport yeah he loves it I mean he was I've never seen a kid so happy last night as when the Rams won he loves being a part of football he loves football he loves watching it we have great discussions around this in our home um they just don't like when I say we're lucky because we didn't have to see him sick CU in their world they're like we would rather so how long after Nate died did you have a good night's sleep without medication that's interesting we'll talk about psychedelics at the same time but

[01:25:23] I you know the first couple weeks people like you need Xanax you need ambient I'd never taken anything and I remember I took them for about a week and I I woke up and I was like God I feel so far away from everything and that was the first experience I had of like traditional medicine taking you away from your pain and other things bringing you to it so you can work through it which we'll discuss but um the exact opposite right yeah the exact opposite which is mindblowing I remember maybe seven or eight months in sleep became a really safe place for me how long after Nate died would you wake up and not have that Nan of forgetting what had happened do do you know that experience where yeah like the next day you wake up and there's probably like two seconds when you don't know that that just happened and then it kind of comes crushing down and then at some point that goes away and there's never a moment when you don't know it didn't happen H maybe the last six months wow it I wouldn't have imagined it could last that long it was jarring it to be honest it's still gets me sometimes and sometimes I'll lay in my bed and be like

[01:26:27] Nate just to practice saying his name because it's it's a surreal experience because it's like um it's alter worlds there's just no sudden death I think it's just you know everyone has said oh would you rather him be sick or would you rather him you know di suddenly I love the games we play with people grieving which again do you think 10,000 years ago they sat around the fire ever playing have cancer or die in front of you would you rather get killed by a saber-tooth tiger immediately or fall out of the tree break your femur and ex sanguinate over the next 2 days then get an infection and then die a month later it's exactly what people ask me all the time yeah you know I don't I still I can believe it completely and I still can't believe it

[01:27:09] I don't wake up shocked anymore I don't have the pit in my stomach the Deep um shock and grief is gone it's probably been gone since around four years so I'm a couple months I maybe even three and a half there started to be some space that some type of new neurop Pathways that we lived in now were becoming not as worn but as comfortable as the old ones of the reality he lived in so for a while it felt like every neuro pathway ended with

[01:27:42] Nate every time the door would open I would think of Nate every time we would eat dinner I would think of Nate every time I put the kids to bed every time I'd get in the car he was everywhere he was like it was like a shadow and over time the more things we did the more traveling I did the more um new people I met things started firing differently people that didn't know Nate places that

[01:28:03] I hadn't gone with Nate and as that happened it's almost like my brain started to um adjust to a new world that didn't have them in it and then I could feel the stress go down you know today we live in a world where you probably have a billion videos on your phone of you and Nate and the kids did you ever have to make a decision about about the frequency with which you would indulge in watching those versus putting a limit on it or saying I'm going to put this in a box right I'm going to I'm going to allow myself to do this for an hour a day but I'm not for the other 23 hours

[01:28:34] I'm going to do something else I mean did you you're such a great question because I we we talk about that all the time in grief groups it's it's cutting you get your iPhone out and you just let it fly um a lot of what I've started to do recently and I I started early on in some of the practices from the Buddhist store is setting a time to feel my emotions were so big for so long and I still work on that like being aware that my emotion is not me but it's just coming through me but I actually get to close the door if I want and I can open it when I want that has been a practice that's changed my life the past two years which is okay Kelsey do you want to right now um feel really sad and really kind of get your eyes swelled up and put on some like Chicago and just like really go through some videos okay

[01:29:18] I'm going to give you seven minutes to do that and there were seven I know well because for a while like my girlriend would call at night and I would just be like it's been hours it's been hours I'm just going and you know I'd forward them to people and I just would want feedback like you remember this you remember this and I I would imagine your friends might not even know what to do because they'd be like wow I don't want to deny that this happened I don't want to deny that this is special but I also don't want to keep her head down and let her drown and they even get tired people that are supporting grieving people get tired of being there and being like I know you miss them I know so there's a dance of saying like and your good friends will be like enough like I think that's good like we've we've been down that road for about an hour now um and even now like I feel like I know sort of how to help people that are grieving because I've felt it but I still it's still a very tricky thing um I don't know how I feel about the videos I'm so grateful I have them my kids don't look at pictures they don't like it yes so I was want to ask you how did the kids participate in that kids are a great thing to have and they're EX in to have during grief when you have kids and you're going through grief they keep you going in a regular life and at the same time you can't really grieve until they're gone and they do not like to see you sad but I I talked to a ton of people um who had lost parents when they were younger and

[01:30:41] I remember all of them were like just please don't if if only my mom had been okay it would have been great but we lost my dad and then we lost my mom too because she never got happy again so I remembered that and in beginning I also felt like well my kids need to see that I'm really sad and show them how to grieve cuz there's that movement too but what I realiz it's a very fine line kids do not like to see their parents sobbing it scares them so if I'm in a if I'm over in the corner shaking and crying and being like I miss your father it's not it doesn't feel safe for a 9 and 12-year-old do you think that kids are innately wired to move on from this quicker one 100% my kids are exceptional and in talking to other parents parents who have lost a spouse do do you think that's true not just for your kids but in general do you think that's true for kids that they are in that sense more wired to move on because they live in the present moment they haven't played out a whole future they don't know that they missed the wedding they don't know that he missed their graduation because they've never had graduation that's all in our heads I think that if you this is just what's worked for me if you create a home that is joyful and the person is and the trauma is allowed to be spoken about when they want and that there is that it's not something bad that happened it's something that is we experienced and we get to to decide how we want to tell the story I think kids can survive amazing things much better than adults because they don't have preconceived ideas so yeah I think kids are I think kids live in the moment too and if you're lucky enough I hit it right at the right age because kids become so self-consumed around 12 that their whole world becomes their friends and so once my kids kicked into that parents are kind of in the background like you're there but you're in the background of their lives and Nate's alive in our house very much so so it's not something we talk about them all the time we do you still have pictures we have some I took down a lot because I realize too um it goes back to the videos you don't want to be you want to be careful with grief and pictures and videos that you let it in when it's the appropriate time cuz if not it can it can become all consuming so we defin defit have a a poster board of pictures but all the pictures in our house now mostly are of the kids and

[01:33:00] I H and there's some of Nate but it's not like and we have an area where we have a Super Bowl and we have a picture of the family where's his ring his ring is in the bank like the what's it called a deposit box yeah yeah you don't want to wear it around a necklace I don't want like a nose ring or something no um yeah I think talking about it too my kids he's we talk about him all the time

[01:33:23] I'm like your dad would say and they get really pissed if I'm like your dad would be let down and they're like you don't know that so don't say it you don't get to pull back card I was like I was just trying to get you um we laugh a lot about the way Nate died say more about that I mean who dies at Sky Zone during

[01:33:39] Toddler Time wearing orange sticky socks I mean that's just ridiculous like you couldn't make that up I think he's the first person to ever die I know I'm not supposed to say Sky Zone for legal reasons or whatever but that's what I would I mean who does that like he's the first person in history to jump jump die at during during Toddler Time playing basketball with his kids it's just it's so bad it's good at least for a comic and for me and then I I think in the story I talk a lot he died on 1111 at 11 which again I just was like thanks buddy like there's just a thousand nods to me it feels like that we're okay and that this thing's bigger than we think and that don't get your panties in a bunch like this is just death um it happens all the time I think that's the other thing the kids now we are we've been been to enough grief things and enough grief camps that we we think we're like people are dying all the time nobody else knows it but it is unbelievable how many people are dying every day so there's a acceptance of death in our house that is probably very different than in other houses so how long after Nate died did you have your first psychedelic experience so about 9 months after and what was the leadup to that like how did you think about going through that and what what were you afraid of what were you hoping to get out of it so I had gone to this um event in Estonia and the summer after Nate died and a bunch of people were talking about psychedelics and I for grief work and a lot of trauma work and I had I I really didn't have any I I got to a point where I was doing better but I I needed to access Nate like I had this de deep desire to have a relationship with him and rais the kids with him even if he wasn't in this realm and I remember I was having a conversation I was like I just need to get to him cuz I know I believe that like the body went away but I don't I don't know where he is and I I can talk to God I feel great with my relationship with God um I just don't know how to get to him but I need to get to him because

[01:35:42] I was kind of starting to go crazy and this one guy was like have you ever done mushrooms and I was like no but my brother did a lot in high school and I would never and I don't like druggies and I think you guys are a bunch I'm very tight and I have two glasses of wine and I'm not fun and don't even ask and and I'm going to keep judging you and I'm going to judge you because that's what I do best and I'm going to keep doing that because look where it got me um and then they were like have you ever tried MDMA and I was like this is all this is all Ridiculousness because you guys are all exactly the kids I did not want to hang out with in high school because my experience was my brother's an ad my brother-in-laws an addict um oxycotton and alcohol he's 14 years sober and then my my brother was just a party you know followed fish and the dead and I just remember him being like Gonzo a lot of high school and so at some point I was talking to this this guy who' done so many psychedelics I mean literally a guy was crazy he was like telling me about having sex in a thorn bush and I was like why am I even talking to this weirdo but I said you know I'm just not going to do I'm never going to try that stuff and he said why I said well I'm afraid I'm not I don't want to die like my kids just lost their dad I'm not they're not I'm not going to jump off of a a bridge after doing too many mushrooms and he's like but you're already dead because you're so afraid of everything and I was like o so I talked to a couple of our friends and I said listen I'll be ready when I'm ready and I mean there's this there's a saying in that community that says the plants you'll the plants will welcome you or you'll you'll know like it's not something you can force somebody to do you'll know when it's time and I got a call October and of after he had died so almost a year and they said we're going to do this group with these Shaman are are you interested and I remember it was very clear I could just hear it I was like I'm in and I would had probably a level 10 anxiety going into it because I had never done anything I mean I wasn't even a drinker really just always been a old-fashioned uptight fear-based neurotic person you know just classic and we get to this house and beforehand the Shaman's called and just kind of asked me what what I wanted to work through and I said you know I have these couple of events that were very traumatic the morg the corner telling my children um I couldn't remember anything from the time I'd gotten the call um until I'd landed until after the plant Journey so I had pretty much that whole story about getting on the airplane and the woman helping you I didn't know where I I don't I still can't remember where the layover was but

[01:38:11] I I couldn't remember a lot of that flight and so I knew there was some trauma there that had been blocked out and I thought well I better be able to access that so so she listened to it all and then we got together it was this beautiful group we talked about intention we talked about um you know what we hoped to get out of it everything opposite of what I thought it would be which was just like everyone popping pills and you know dancing to rave music and um just a good group of people I could just loving people supportive and I kind of shared what I was where I was at and I mean it's kind of a funny story so the first thing they gave me was well they gave me something and I took it and

[01:38:50] I had a full-blown panic attack and I raised my hand and I was like so I told you it's not working like I want it out and she came over and was like we gave you a placebo because we knew that you like this this the first hump was going to be a big one for you and she did kind of similar to what the woman on the plane did she put her hand on my head and I laid down and she actually breathed me through my panic attack and she said that wasn't anything now this is it and she said um just let it do its work and did you start with psilocybin or MDMA I don't I I I think I started with I don't know they won't tell me okay the exact they wouldn't tell me exactly what and what and where but what

[01:39:29] I do know is I dropped oh I remember we were all laying in a circle and everybody by then was kind of laying down and everyone someone said have you dropped in and I was like what what is a drop in like I don't know what does it mean to drop in and someone you're that annoying person that's like I was the worst no and our friend which you know but I we name nameless but he was like

[01:39:49] Jesus Christ like can we get this girl can you give her more but I was like when are we going to drop in everybody is anybody else dropped in and somebody was like you'll know when you drop in and I remember like 3 minutes later I was like I'm in it was just so ridiculous um it was just so embarrassing and he was like oh

[01:40:12] God here we go babysit her all night um but within like 3 minutes I was back on the plane and I was but this time yeah I was back on the plane right then and I started to cry and I started to I was loud I mean my friend will tell me I was loud our friends were like you were loud the whole time um but all of a sudden everybody in the journey space kind of came and sat next to me and we kind of did the flight together and so I felt supported and so I cried and cried and I said this is so scary he's dead you know I went through the whole thing and they were like we're right here with you you're not alone we're right here you're safe look how strong you are you're going to your babies and it felt like 6 hours from what I know now that you know we've talked about it it was probably like five or six minutes I did the whole flight again but with support and it was like that first thing was over and I had peace about it I remembered the whole thing I remembered what seat I was in I remembered you know transferring planes all that stuff and then I got up I got some water and I was like oh my God I'm not I thought I was going to be like drunk and crazy I was just regular again

[01:41:22] I woke up I got up I had I talked to some people I talked to the shamans and I remember they were like would you like are you going to go in again and I saides and all I did was lay down again and this this whole process was insane to me that it was I could modulate my experience safely by my intention and whether I close my eyes or not I mean I was like this is not what I thought so then I

[01:41:44] Revisited the morg and I was really angry I had ton of anger that he' left me that I had never accessed I mean rage like you left me at 40 you promised you wouldn't you're a liar you left me with a 9 and 12-year-old you bastard I told you to lose weight and I was Furious I mean I remember just a rage I had never felt and you had never really gone through that stage of grief never in the previous year never been angry at him I just felt sad for him scared for him where is he hope he's okay terribly worried about my dead husband and everyone's like he's good focus on the people that are alive and at that moment I had all the anger I'd ever had for him for 20 years but mostly for leaving me cuz he had promised he wouldn't um Furious to the point where my friend was like when you're done with it I think we're good like You' like we got it and you're also disrupting the whole group um did they take you to another so he took me up and then one of the facilitators came with me and I said would you mind oh cuz my friend had said why don't you go find Nate like you've done the work you've gone through a bunch of things we're hours in at this point he said go go find Nate see what he has to tell you because you wanted to find him and Peter know I went up there I laid down and one of the facilitators came in I said can you just remember whatever I say because I think it's going to be good and I need you to write it all down and fast forward at the in the next day the integration he's like it was too beautiful I couldn't remember anything I just sat there and listened I'm like oh my God but I remembered most so I laid down on the couch up by myself and I called for Nate and I promise you he was just in front of my face and I know everybody's listening to this if you know me you think this is insane but this is exactly my experience Nate was right there he's like I've never left and I said where did you go he's like I'm still here I just um my body wasn't serving me anymore and I said what do you mean he goes well look at this and he just took his whole body and just like threw it on the ground like it was clothes and he's like I'm right here and the first thing he did was he showed me my kids and he said we all chose this they were born for this and he the kids were kind of on a mountain um like Game of Thrones and he's like they called for this we all agreed to this they're stronger than you think um and then he gave me some like tips like he would have if he was here about how to kind of raise them and what they needed from me and he's like you need to slow down with Addison or you need to um just spend time oneon-one with Jack like only things he would know and then he said the biggest thing is you've got to live fearlessly and he said I'm going to show you what it feels like and then we blue like around the universe and it was probably the first time in my life I felt um free and he's like there's it's it's all okay we're all okay and you have a choice right now to just have the best life and I want you to go live it and I'm I'm right here you can access me at any time just call for me and we from that point on um we have a great relationship and I I feel him he sends me songs and birds and hummingbirds and if I pay attention he's everywhere and I totally

[01:45:03] I don't know where you go or what happens but I am very clear that if we're made of energy and if I can talk to God why wouldn't I be able to talk to Nate and so now it's this kind of um I mean I like I said it's just like it's even better than our marriage because I talk all the time he just listens even more and he doesn't even he and then he just tells me things in very quick um two or three words like you're fine yes slow down stop talking that's a lot of stop talking did you ask him anything in particular that you had never asked him before in that Journey there I asked him why did you play football and he said because it was the easiest way for people to respect me and listen to me so

[01:45:47] I could share with them about love he said I never really loved playing football but I love that it gave me a um access to people so I could talk to them about the stuff I really wanted to talk about which was never about football he didn't talk much about football when he was done he hated it he hated to talk about it did he still watch it yeah he loved because he loved to put some money on the game and be with his buddies and just scream at a TV and have fun um he just he was like Kelsey this is this this is what you've been waiting for this is what you've you knew this was coming you knew this was coming you're fine this was my time's over like this was I did my part don't don't um don't worry about me he's like it's exceptional where I am it was just it was beautiful and I mean I it would I I mean maybe it's the top one of the top three experiences of my life probably certainly something that most people who have experienced it would would say yeah and I um you know I also and we talked about this but Xanax and ambian and the things that give you for grief work just put you black you out and you have no idea what happened or I used to wake up and be like why is everyone sad like you know and what what the mushrooms and the whole plant experience gave me was an ability to go towards it and understand it and and walk through it and come out of it being like okay like we're all okay and for me

[01:47:18] I think I I probably was most afraid of death most of us are but that was the biggest fear of my life is I didn't want anybody I love to die and I didn't want to die and now of course I'm not like looking forward to it but I have great peace that this is so much bigger and I've seen it and I've felt it and so I don't know people get tired because I'm so fired up about plant medicine now from someone who's like you know I've probably done five or six since then nothing quite as mindblowing as that first one what have the subsequent trips been like do you go into them with a a much more um focused intention I've done both I've gone in with a focused intention like

[01:47:58] I'm looking for some answers and I've also gone in being like just tell me what is for me it feels like a download of information of um it feels like a connection that is so much bigger than anything I could have just in my day-to-day the biggest thing about plants this this is important I I really need a lot of approval and I've spent my life trying to be great at everything and have people give me add a girls and when I did that first experience and it's been subsequent in all my experiences is my ego completely goes away and I don't I'm the biggest judgment I'm a comic I try to make fun of everybody I like use everything against people and when I'm in those experiences I have no judgments on anybody and I have no desire to be liked and no judgments on yourself yeah

[01:48:43] I don't I don't I there's this like it's this 10 or 11 hours where I'm not worried about what people think of me or what I think of them which it's such a relief you know so for me that's probably that's the biggest thing I get out of those experiences is this what would it look like if my ego just got out of the way and I just was present with what is and with what who is and you just see good and I didn't ever feel like messed up I mean I literally tell my friends who are still so against it you're none of it was scary and obviously I haven't done any iasa and I

[01:49:18] I'm not called to that at all right now currently in my life um but man it's a lot better than getting drunk and crying you know I stopped drinking pretty pretty soon after he died because I drink tequila and just sob and so I'm real clear now that alcohol is a depressant even to this day yeah I I drink red wine now but I any type of alcohol cues anxiety because the sugar makes my heart race and then if I can't sleep then it gets then once this thing starts my brain starts going it can be not a safe place so alcohol just doesn't really work for me anymore did you talk with your kids after the Civil cybin experience and tell them about it yeah no I haven't yet meaning as of yet as of yet so they they might watch this and yeah they might or actually I had some notes when I had I left some notes at home and I was like

[01:50:06] Jack can you take a picture of these notes and I was like oh well there you go you're gonna if you read it um he's just now he's 16 now so he would understand it but they are both they hate drunk people they hate my my brother-in-law is actually I mean obviously sober so there's been a connotation around drugs in our family that it's it's really not good um so this will have to be a longer discussion and I don't really know I mean I don't what do you think when do you talk to your kids about it have you talked to your 13-year-old no not about psychadelics yeah me neither but um actually that's not true

[01:50:43] I've talked about it once with her through the lens of drugs okay and um sort of trying to explain that um you know um the legality of a drug is a second order consideration I mean it's an important consideration obviously if you're trying to abide by the law but the the you want to think about this first through the lens of the molecule and and I've shared with her this framework that I've borrowed from somebody else that I think is very valuable right which is um because I talk about this all the time with patients right so you know one of the questions you ask a patient during an intake with them is you know tell me how many drinks you have in an average week tell me which Recreation drugs you use um and this is not a judgmental discussion but it's you really want to understand this and look a lot of times people say yep I use Coke once a month I do this I do that I do this one that and so the the thing I discussed with them and this is sort of what I explained to

[01:51:36] Olivia once was you know there are certain drugs alcohol being a drug as well where they change your state I love I've heard this podcast you did love yes but they don't change traits and then there are others that change your state and if you use them correctly they can change your traits Y and so I said and by the way there are legal and illegal molecules in both of those camps and that's worth noting and respecting but really the things in this Camp you have to really ask yourself how often am I doing this and why am I doing this and so you know I put cocaine very clearly in this Camp right it clearly changes your state and I've never done cocaine but the people I talk to who love it tell me how great they feel when they do it but they can't make a compelling case for me that it makes them better when they're not on cocaine 100% um and the same is true for alcohol in reality so so one you know you have to be careful about the use of those things and obviously the things we're talking about psilocybian and MDMA at least have the potential if done correctly to make you a better version of you long after that medicine is gone yeah I remember you I listened to that podcast of yours and I that's exactly it like I am a different person because of those experiences and

[01:52:51] I'm I'm better and the only reason I know that is because I'm I'm more um I'm less afraid I'm more patient I think I have less answers I'm more open I mean all the things that you you hope to get in therapy but it's very hard to get your brain to change and I feel like tell me from a physician standpoint it opens up a pathway that was like blocked like it had a blockade and you it was always there you just hadn't gone down it and so when I took psilocybin it it like moved that blockade and there there was a I never knew that was just ease and love and fearlessness and after I was done I started to walk down that road more often in my day-to-day life because for so long it wasn't even accessible to me and now it's a road that I choose quite often um and same thing with MDMA for me I've done that very rarely but it it's shown me fun how to just be connected and and not again not judging and just um and if Mom and you're listening I know you guys had no idea I was so edgy but it gave me so now even if I don't do it I remember the feeling I can access that that that narrow pathway and I can go oh Kelsey you know what it feels like to be at a party and be calm and not worrying about getting home and worried about the Uber and and just like be here and I can almost get myself to that new road that

[01:54:15] I always had but it just always had a huge blockade in front of it yeah and and I mean I think I think those are two good examples of how those molecules work and I mean I think MDMA really has this ability to you know so create this empathy that is very difficult for most people to access um on command or or frankly not under the influence of that medication and that's to me if you if you can craft the intention around that it's um you know it can really do an amazing thing for a relationship as well yourself but also with somebody else especially if there has been something that's gone really wrong sure yeah I mean it's probably been there's been a ton of gifts of grief and I talk about them all the time but I think that that those experiences have been and everyone hates me for it because once I get excited about something I get really excited so I came out of the I came just blazing hot on uh plant Journeys and now I kind of understand that you have to be ready and have to want it and have to be ready to be open to it but I am and the other thing I I I I do think that um at least in my limited experience um I think that the Best of Both Worlds is when you combine that work with the traditional work of therapy and I do think that if there's one thing about the the new appreciation people have of psychedelics that I think is dangerous it's that people believe that the plant or the molecule by itself can do all the work like all I have to do is do soloc cybin once a month or once a quarter and and it's all good and it's like no those are incredible lubricants to allow you to do very difficult things when you're long off the influence of those medications so I I also think like again it's impossible to say what fraction of your recovery has been predicated on that experience versus all that came before it and after it and around it um so that's kind of the one thing that I I tend to remind that's smart people of yeah done a ton of work

[01:56:23] I've I've read a bunch and I I think the other big thing that I do that has supported all of that is just I have a I'm militant about meditation militant and were you before I had started on the path but maybe 20 minutes a day here and there maybe insight timer um once Nate died it became a must and to this day and I I saw you guys just got the sauna bag but I will sit in with dispens I think dispensa probably dispensa's work has probably changed my life the most in terms of a daily practice so changing a thought or watching a thought or um knowing that my feelings are transient and that I can change a feeling through a changing a thought or I can say change or I can say stop and um it doesn't mean they're not going to come but I do have some agency in how I feel and what I feel which I never believed before um so I think if you if you like you said if you do the the psychedelics in conjunction with a very deep meditation and you know a committed spiritual practice that gives you peace whatever that might be you you have a great shot at coming out of pretty much everything yeah it's I I've always found it sad I guess I'm only saying something that I'm sure a billion other people have thought or said um but it's remarkable that this isn't taught along side English science math to kids coming up in school like you you could play the thought experiment of what if from the moment kids entered kindergarten we had an emotional health class as well that was part of the Core

[01:58:05] Curriculum where you learned to distance yourself from your thoughts and right like and you know we're going to spend 30 minutes a day on this course throughout you know K to 12 yeah um how many different habits could we develop and how could we equip ourselves um you mentioned something in your book that resonates deeply with me which is radical acceptance when did you first encounter that term um with Tera

[01:58:36] Brock I probably read it my mom was into this stuff for a long time so this was always in the background noise of my life my dad left when I was 15 and my mom really went on this like Journey so these books and these people were a part of it but I the idea of radical acceptance that that that something wasn't good or bad probably happened I mean after Nate died

[01:59:00] I mean I don't think I think I knew of it in practice but when everything's good seems good it's hard to you're like oh yeah good luck to those people that you know have a sick kid or whatever I hope they just accept what is um and I always thought that before I really experienced it that it is what it is was an annoying statement and it was kind of just like a throwaway like oh well it is it it life so just accept it and now I'm like no it's beautiful it is what it is how wonderful is that like C can you just be with whatever without doesn't mean it won't feel hard it doesn't mean it's not miserable it just means it is exactly what you are going through and the resistance to that and the wishing it was different is what kills you so a lot of people say how are you doing so well and I say because I don't wish it was different that's pretty much it do you think your kids understand that

[01:59:52] I don't know I don't they're still they were so young and they you know I'm I'm really working on understanding that they have their own path to this and their own journey and we all have different relationships to Nate and different stories that we tell in our head I would say they are surprised at how great life is compared to what they thought it would be when he first died sometimes they'll say I mean isn't it great we're so happy again isn't it great that we we have fun again um look look at how look at how good our life is and so that's their way of saying like we made it in some way we we accepted what is and we continue to build a life that was beautiful we talk a lot in our house about what would Nate want us to do and Nate would want us to be joyful so if you want to honor your dead person the best way to do it is live the life they would want you to live if they were here so in that sense the kids you know we can't even take it out anymore he's gone and so our life is this and um we miss him and we're happy and we accept it and we miss them but yeah radical acceptance I think it gets easier the more you do it so I and I mean little things you know you practice at the stoplight you're like and the light isn't moving and it's all the things we've all read but until you have to practice it because you're in such a dark spot um I don't know that you you can and people always say like oh can you transform without going through something big I don't know if you can I don't know because I I had a I I read it all and I intellectually knew it all but until I had to really dig into those practices it didn't it I was glad I I would say prepare with them but until you get to that point there is Magic in that transformation when you do the work um but I don't know what are your thoughts you think you have to go through hard things I don't think I'm equipped to answer the way you are yeah I suspect so but I mean I was hoping not or at least in near miss you know I I have a good friend Rick Elias who was actually on the podcast and um he was on that United or uh US Air flight that uh was going to crash and somehow made the miraculous Landing in the Hudson River in 2009 and so in that sense you know nothing bad happened to him but there was a two-minute period where he really thought no no no this is it I am dead he went through all of that and Rick is a you know that was 13 years ago this month and Rick is still living the life of the guy who was given a second chance

[02:02:30] I agree so you know could Rick have come to this same set of principles that guide his life today without that I just don't know my guess is there's maybe somebody that could I don't know that I could yeah it's it's just interesting and I there's just a real relief when you stop wishing it was different whatever it is when you stop wishing whatever you're going through wasn't and you just go like let's roll like what what I what I what I've got to learn what's on the other side of this um what will it feel like when it's transformed into something different what can I get excited about it's I just

[02:03:07] I think that the the practices work that's what I believe now I believe that you can get through things and I I've got a lot of easy easy ways because my situation is fairly easy if you look at it the way we can spin some of it it's better that he's not here I was left with resources I always think too about grief like if a woman has resources it's a very different experience than if you don't so you know um there's a thousand things that interact to make your experience what it is but internally the stoics and the and the

[02:03:40] Buddhists and believing in something bigger than you those are kind of key pillars at least for me what would you say to a man or woman or child listening to this right now who's three months out from that tragedy based on everything you've learned to start just hang on just hang on for now um I think like I said humans are are built to last we're meant to we're we're built to make it through things um and and do the work whatever that work is for you whatever wherever you're trying to go do the work and the work will eventually support you um you know you get like I think of it if you're over here and you're trying to get over here and there's a there's you got to build a bridge if once you build the bridge you'll get over there but you got to go to work um the bridge isn't there yet and that's where the meditation and the reading and the

[02:04:34] Gratitude and the changing your brain that's those are each plank that you're building to get over to the other side and if you do the work you're going to look back and be like damn like I never thought I could build that bridge and you're going to be more confident and more joyful because you just saw you did something you never thought you could do so life just got sweeter how hard was it to write the book you know I didn't have any pressure around it and I know I think you're writing a book um I didn't have any pressure on it because it was just not why I asked by the way no no no um no but I I remember um Jill talking about that you were writing one for me I had to get the story out it was very personal because I wanted my kids to remember and I wanted to remember because I knew I was going to love again and I knew I was going to date and I knew I was going to have other relationships and time is a miracle when it comes to life because as time goes on the pain just it does gradually get better and so I thought I better make sure that the story of this great man is down so that my grandchildren and my great-grandchildren will know where they came from and who he was and how this all happened somewhere in the middle you think this is such that I it's embarrassing to like I

[02:05:42] I shouldn't even show it to my worst enemy because this is just blabber of nothing and I'm so bored with what I wrote It's so dumb and it's so ridiculous that well I mean just stop now because this is torture for you and nobody's this is horrible and then you get to a point where you've written enough and then it gets to an editor and they make it a little better and they give you some feedback and you just start cutting stuff out and that's kind of then it got fun because I was like just cut out all the junk that you tried to make and just tell it like it is and don't worry about what people think and I'm so glad I did it I can't imagine doing it again and know I want to but I don't even know where you start it it feels surreal now you forget you forget sitting there looking at your computer being like this possibly the boringest paragraph I've ever written like just like you just it's a unique experience writing a book because the internal um dialogue and anxiety and just disgust with what you're putting out is really epic just because you're just you're you're reading what you already hated that you wrote and it's just double flogging you know um but I I would tell people write it down because man it it helps somebody like somebody is is going to be helped by it or get inspired by it and just go easy on yourself with a book what's the most surprising thing that you've received as a as a way of feedback there's there's been so many people that have written that I said thank you for showing um thank you for being honest and I think what that means is the good and the bad like not trying to play grief either way like that there is a duality to everything in life and people like thank you for letting us know that it was awful and you felt like you were on fire and you couldn't wait to have sex with other people like thank you for knowing that like you know that you lost the man of your dreams and you also get to meet other people and have a new experience and that's going to that's that might be exactly what was meant to be this sense that everything isn't good or bad either way so there's a whole life I'm going to have that I never even knew possible and there was one that I really Lov that got taken away so people say like thank you for giving it a multifaceted approach to this experience

[02:08:03] I'm having did your kids read it before you published it no have they read it now no they don't want to either they are terribly embarrassed by it and secretly proud they don't want it out and then Jack's like uh Mom I'm taking your book to the my school counselor cuz well she asked what your job was and I didn't know what to tell her I said she's she wrote a book and I was like so he they're proud of it but they're also way more private than me I'm the least private person on the planet so I'm learning to understand that they'll tell it in their time and they'll read it in their time and they'll read it in their time and their experience will be very different from what I wrote I'm fairly certain that they'll read chapters and go that's not how it went like I didn't do that I didn't say that um but we'll see I don't know I don't know how they'll be well Kelsey I um I I can't thank you enough you know um this is just such a beautiful story and thanks um I I think people are going to be infinitely enriched um whether they've experienced something like this or whether they will um because I think you know we all will yeah might not be as sudden it might not be as tragic with a capital T but um The
