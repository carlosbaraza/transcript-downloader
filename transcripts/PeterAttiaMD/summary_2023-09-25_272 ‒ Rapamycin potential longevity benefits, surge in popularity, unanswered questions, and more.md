Peter welcomes guests David Sabatini & Matt Kaeberlein, two world-leading experts on rapamycin & mTOR. David & Matt begin by telling the fascinating story of the discovery of rapamycin & its brief history as a pharmacological agent in humans. They then unravel the function of mTOR, a central regulator of numerous biological processes, & they discuss the pathways through which rapamycin exerts its potential benefits on lifespan. They touch upon initial studies that suggested rapamycin may have geroprotective effects & the ongoing research that continues to shed light on this unique molecule. Furthermore, they discuss the elusive details surrounding the frequency & dosing of rapamycin use in humans, & Peter emphasizes his reservations about indiscriminately prescribing rapamycin as a longevity drug for patients.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode features a detailed discussion about rapamycin and mTOR with two world-leading experts: David Sabatini and Matt Kaeberlein. The conversation covers the discovery of rapamycin, its mechanisms of action, current research, and potential applications in longevity medicine. Key topics include the drug's effects on immune function, aging processes, and ongoing clinical trials in both humans and companion animals.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Rapamycin was discovered from soil samples on Easter Island in the 1960s [00:13:22]
- mTOR is a master regulator of nutrient sensing and cellular growth [00:04:29]
- Rapamycin works by partially inhibiting mTOR complex 1 and eventually mTOR complex 2 [00:48:14]
- The drug shows consistent life-extension properties across multiple species [00:07:10]
- Weekly dosing may have different effects than daily dosing [02:42:40]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Consider rapamycin's effects on inflammation and immune function [01:37:03]
- Weekly dosing may be preferable to daily dosing for some applications [02:40:33]

Risk/benefit considerations:
- Mouth sores are the most common side effect [01:52:23]
- Blood-brain barrier penetration may be limited [01:14:10]
- Different effects in different tissues [02:25:22]

**4. Supplements & Medications**:
Rapamycin dosing:
- Typical weekly doses range from 3-6mg in humans [02:45:19]
