[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD comm

[00:00:41] everyone welcome to this week's edition of the drive I'm your host purity ax our guest this week is Sam Harris someone I consider a friend a mentor a teacher I met Sam about four years ago and I suspect many of you already know about Sam or familiar with his work but in case you're not let me say a few words on that Sam trained in neuroscience he has a PhD in neuroscience but in many ways I consider him a philosopher and frankly just one of the greatest minds that I know he's an author of some extraordinary books the end of faith being his first the moral landscape lying free will and probably my favorite which you've also probably heard me talk about is waking up a book that I've read

[00:01:18] I think three times now and I'm almost at the point where I understand half of it Sam is also the host of arguably I would say the most important podcast to me the waking up podcast and he is also the creator of an app for meditation called appropriately waking up I had the privilege of beta testing it for about nine months before it went live and it is now officially live for anyone who meditates I would consider this an essential part of your meditation app routine you've probably heard me talk a lot about this in the past few months the importance of distress tolerance mindfulness the ability to understand what's going on inside our own heads as a tool to be less unhappy and that might sound kind of blah but the reality of it is I've never spent more time thinking about this than I have in probably the last 12 to 18 and Sam has been such an important part of helping me think about that and this podcast is pretty long it's almost three hours and that time we go into a lot of this stuff I'm pretty open about how much Sam has helped me and though I think at times it turns into more of a discussion than an interview I think we always sort of veer back to the place where you as the listener are gonna get something out of this if you're not familiar with Sam I can't encourage you enough to listen to this podcast and if it piques your curiosity dig a little bit deeper into this a couple of housekeeping items obviously we're gonna release this today instead of the day before Christmas so this is kind of coming out of it early and over the next week or so we haven't quite figured the schedule yet but don't worry we'll be back to kind of our regular schedule in

[00:02:58] January if you haven't already done so and you're interested please sign up for our weekly email that's on the site WWBT AMD calm and somewhere on there there'll be a little place to prompt you to sign up for that and if you don't like it just unsubscribe we also have great show notes which everybody keeps raving about and I'm really proud of our team for the work they do I to be clear don't do any of that work but I like that people are spending time on them especially when it comes to following up on all of the nuances and detail that we go into finally if you're enjoying this podcast please go to Apple podcast reviews and leave the favorable review and if you are not enjoying it and you feel so inclined to leave a review please do so but try to be as constructive as possible because it's a lot easier to course-correct if it's constructive than if you just tell me it sucks without anything further to say here is my guest

[00:03:46] Sam Harris [Music] well Sam thanks so much for making time today yeah first for me I'm coming to someone else's studio to record yeah well let's get in the game long enough this is the way it happens well I really appreciate it there's so much I want to talk about today but I also want to be thoughtful about pulling out threads that I think are most valuable to people I take care of in many ways that's sort of an undercurrent of what I like to talk about on podcast is things that I can then share with my patients and things like that I don't know if you remember this but almost a year ago I called you or I emailed you and said hey man do you have time to talk and you said yeah and it was like actually I know when it was it was right after Christmas it was like the day after Christmas mm-hmm yeah it was the 26th of December and I said I want to talk with you about mindfulness meditation and you said great and we hopped on I call do you remember this discussion yeah I think I think I remember the one you you're referencing so I had had a very profound experience and prior to that I had been you know somewhat familiar I think would be the the most generous way of saying it but somewhat familiar with meditation primarily focusing on concentration based meditations like mantra based practice but I just come back from basically a rehab facility where you were sort of out in the middle of nowhere you had no electronics you weren't even allowed to have books or anything like that and you were really sort of stripped down into I guess what could only be viewed as sort of your most fundamental basic elements of self and

[00:05:19] I had an epiphany about 10 days into that which was I realized at the time what must be the first moment in my life that I was present and it's weird to be almost 45 at the time and to think wow Here I am 10 days of having every stimulus removed from my life plus going through this very rigorous sort of therapeutic stuff and I remember exactly where I was sitting I was sitting in the common room of this place at the edge of a couch and in a moment the only thing that mattered was exactly what I was perceiving around me so the light coming in through the window and the you know the way in which it made the room sort of light up this the the the faint scent of you know something that was being cooked in the kitchen you know a few you know yards away or whatever and I don't know why I just felt like wow this is the first time I actually really think I'm not thinking about something that has happened or worrying about something that was going to happen mm-hmm and [Music] the other thing it was odd that that entire time I was was there was it was that they allowed us to exercise which was a big deal I was really pleased that

[00:06:27] I was still permitted to exercise but you couldn't have music you didn't have a phone or anything so it's also the first time in my life I exercised only being able to listen to the sound of my breath yeah so every morning I would run in the woods and you just heard the sound of the wind blowing by you and you heard your breath and when I was you know doing push-ups or whatever is the same sort of thing and of course I'd already read so much of your work but the reason I wanted to speak with you that day is I wanted to understand hey am I getting a glimpse of what one might get if they meditate if they move to a mindfulness based practice and what you said was well there's good news and bad news the good news is I've got this app that's gonna be coming out soon and it's gonna help you with this how the bad news is it's only in beta yet but you can start right away there's only you know I think at the time there may be a dozen meditations and the very bad news it's going to take years for me to produce this thing I'm completely incompetent no but come on the thing actually is out now yeah it's finally it was a little longer than you wanted but yeah and I very quickly put as many of my patients who were interested on the beta version you guys were so gracious and let all of my my my folks on this thing and in many ways I view that as one of the most important transitions of my life I think of you know life is a handful of Direction changes that you know some of them that you look back at the past and say wow that was sort of a meaningful insight that came to me so you've talked about this idea of noticing what is a rising versus not noticing at all mmm-hmm can you elaborate on this yeah well so I guess I should define mindfulness which is really that the target state that one is trying to cultivate in at least this probably what's the most popular type of meditation now and that there are different as you alluded to they're different types there are two basic types of meditation where the distinction is between being lost and thought and being clearly aware of whatever the object of meditation is so that that's true for all types of meditation thought really is the the obstacle one is overcoming when one is learning to meditate pigs are natural our default mode is to just be lost and thought we're telling ourselves a story all day long and we're not aware of it so once one begins to meditate one is trying to pay attention to something and this is where the two different types diverge first that you alluded to the like a mantra based or a concentration based object of focus is the attempt to pay attention to one thing to the exclusion of everything else right you want your attention to be absorbed in that object and in many of those practices the explicit goal is to do that so well that thoughts no longer arise right so you're really trying to get rid of thought in some basic sense the the arising of thought in that context is a sign that you're not meditating hard enough or one pointedly enough those types of practices can produce extraordinarily positive states of mind that you can feel bliss and rapture and and you can actually use as an object of meditation specific states of mind like loving-kindness which is called meta in the Buddhist tradition or sympathetic joy or compassion or equanimity you can cultivate specific attitudes which if you can focus on them to the exclusion of anything else you're inhabiting that state to a degree that you know most people would find unrecognizable but the second type of meditation which is the type I have spent much more time doing and is almost universally considered the more fundamental or the deeper practice is often described as mindfulness because that's the that's the the state you're using in the Buddhist tradition to cultivated mindfulness comes from a a practice called the piscina which which is Insight Meditation and there you are you're not trying to selectively notice one thing or another you are trying to break the spell of being distracted by thought so you're trying to be aware of everything without perceiving things through this discursivity or this conceptual lens in each moment but your attention can be much more choiceless and you can just notice whatever in fact you notice you're noticing things all the time sounds and sensations and moods and and thoughts but you're not noticing them clearly because you're you are thinking every moment of the day mindfulness Begins for most people as a training on one object like the breath but very quickly it becomes something that you apply to the full range of your experience and what's nice about it apart from all the the benefits of doing it and all the things that can be realized by doing it this type of meditation is clearly coincident with any experience you can have and there's nothing that is excluded in principle from the meditation you're not you can be working out or watching a movie or I mean there's no there's no there's no thing that in principle does not admit of mindfulness and that's not true of other types of practice yeah just sharing one example because the other thing that I remember you said at the time I said you know Sam I want to really shift this practice and sort of I want to figure out a way to experience that a you know more and more and you actually said look there are a bunch of apps that are already out though that are all pretty good I mean obviously you're producing yours because you think it's gonna offer something additional and I'll just make my plug for it here I've used every one of the apps out there and I do find yours the best but I also realize that there's no one thing that's the best it's the way you explain things just resonates with me and it might not resonate with the next person but the other app that I really liked that you recommended was 10% happier which is Daniel Harris his app no no no relation of course and even within Dan's app there are many teachers but there were a couple that I really like Jeff Warren and Joe Joseph and

[00:12:43] Joseph Goldstein Joe sikozu yam and Jeff Warren has I believe a series of walking meditations that he refers to a sort of informal meditations and I remember the first time I did this maybe it wasn't the first time it might've been the second time there was pretty early I realized for the first time that when you walk if you're paying attention to it you can feel the wind going past your finger so if you're walking with your hands in a position such that your thumbs are facing forward and your arms are swinging lightly and in that in a normal gait you can actually feel the air moving past the leading edge of your hand yeah I remember thinking how have I been walking for 45 years and I've never once felt this sensation and now when I pay attention to it it's so noticeable I don't know how it hasn't been distracting me for at forty five years yeah yeah and but one might wonder why one would want to notice such a thing but what you discover when you begin practicing meditation especially intensively on retreat is that there's no such thing as a boring object of attention what boredom is is simply a lack of attention we get into these situations where we are convinced that we are bored because we haven't found something compelling enough in our experience to capture our attention but what our attention is is so blunt and instrument normally that we when we need something that's you know thrilling or terrifying or something to fully get us to commit but what you discover when you learn to meditate is that what pleases us most in those moments when we are fully captured by experience is the state of complete attention to the present and if you can muster that on your own if you can actually guide attention irrespective of the object you're attending to then anything any arbitrary object the feeling of wind on your hand as you walk can be an exquisitely pleasurable thing to notice this is why in that first type of meditation practice concentration practice it doesn't matter what you pay attention to you can pick an arbitrary object it can be a random sound it can be a mantra and it doesn't matter what the mantra is it can be a candle flame it can be a color on a piece of paper it can be a random sound in the environment it can be in the this sensation of a a fly walking across the back of your hand right to anything that you can pay attention to to the exclusion of anything else can suddenly disclose what it's like to have a very concentrated mind and concentration is intrinsically pleasurable and this is why meditation can have the character of a kind of drug experienced mates and and this is a kind of a superficial character I mean you can you can get kind of addicted to the changes in state you experience in meditation and you can be misled by these experiences you can think that it's about these changes rather than something more fundamental because there any anything you experience by way of newfound pleasure that is based on having a very concentrated mind you will lose because it's an impermanent state of your physiology and attention and it's not the deepest practice but yeah it's it's amazing that concentration itself regardless of the object is incredibly pleasant you know sort of going back to the why which you've you've started to allude to and I can I can't remember if I'm I know you've said this I think many have said this so I don't you know I think many have come to this observation which is virtually all negatively valence to motions are not rooted in the present and that sort of becomes the the corollary of being present therefore being able to concentrate on something in the moment can be quite pleasurable and I guess that was sort of what I recognized that first moment I experienced it which was Wow when you're when you're fully fully you know engaged in or envelope twith in this present sensation what you're seeing what you're hearing what you're feeling it becomes very difficult to be anxious or depressed or angry or any of these other things and for me that was the most interesting part of this which yes you know taking us a very big step back I'm trying to devote my life to figuring out this problem of how to live longer but if you asked me how did I think about that problem five years ago versus how do I think about it today there have been two fundamentally significant differences there are two things today that I said occupy much more of my energy with respect to longevity than they did you know four or five years ago and the first of those two is this notion of being happy would you again I think five years ago I would have dismissed that as sort of a an afterthought like it is what it is and as long as the all those other things happen you'll be happy you know if you can figure out how to not die and how to be stronger and have better cognitive powers but you'll be happy as a result of that but of course that seems to be not the case the second though we're not gonna get into it is a much greater appreciation for the type of physical body that is necessary to age well and how radically that differs from necessarily the the physical body that we want to perform well when we're in our 30s or 40s or even our 50s mhm but going back to the former which to me is in many ways your work and the work of people like you has had such a great influence on me is this realization like none of the stuff matters if you're miserable it doesn't matter if you can live to a hundred it doesn't matter if you can delay the onset of heart disease and stroke and cancer an Alzheimer's disease if you're too miserable to appreciate it or if you're constantly in some sort of tormented

[00:18:35] State you might as well be dead I mean that sounds dream but that's you know that's really how I started to feel about this yeah and I think we also have inaccurate associations with terms like happiness and we haven't distinguished terms that are different like pain and suffering there's nothing about meditation that gets rid of physical pain pain is just something that you're going to experience and you can actually experience surprising degrees of pain while meditating if you just resolve not to move your body it doesn't matter how comfortable your chair is eventually paying this kind of rise and you have a guided meditation that takes us through that exercise yeah that is I feel like within two minutes it's unbearable there people have sit for hours and hours and

[00:19:22] I mean you know 12 hours you know and it's excruciating and yet when you get up you haven't hurt yourself it's not synonymous with injury right now obviously they're there ways you could injure yourself if you don't move but there can be a strange magnification of pain if you resolve to sit still for a very long time but one thing you discover there which is useful to discover is that there is a difference between pain and suffering you can feel intensely negative sensory experience and you can you can feel intensely negative emotions even you can feel anger and depression and sadness and if you can be tend to simply be aware of those sensations or those moods or emotions if you can recognize that consciousness is this the prior condition in which all of those things are appearing and you're you are simply that which is aware of these changing phenomenon if you can become interested in the character of a mood like sadness or a pain in the knee it's actually possible to experience these states with total equanimity and one of the features is as you said not being focused at all by thought on the past or the future so I mean one thing with physical pain we all experience is this sense that some sensation is intolerable but there's this paradox because in that moment you've already tolerated it right

[00:21:01] I mean it's fully arrived it's merely as Berry said hey yeah of will default you're worried about the future you're worried about how long this is gonna go on and it's certainly good to practice finding a place of equanimity with pain I'm not saying you know obviously there are pains that that are conceivable that even the best meditator might find it difficult to find equanimity with but there really is an immense amount of growth one can have in this area where you just you can notice this difference between reacting to pain contracting around it resisting it trying to make it go away wishing it away worrying about how long it'll be there and all of this happens is there's this cascade it's just it happens so quickly that it says you don't even notice the mechanics of it it's just you right it's just you suffering but the moment you can pick apart the mechanics of it because you can pay attention to what is arising the the feeling of resistance the fear about what what's gonna happen in the next moment and keep dropping back into a position of merely witnessing all of these things arise and pass away their experiences I've had and many have had in meditation where an excruciating sensation become so intense that you actually don't know whether or not you're experiencing agony or ecstasy like it like the valence of the intense mental state is it just gets kind of wiped out it's just you know sheer intensity and there is a fundamental cancellation of suffering in those moments and this goes back to what we were just saying about the pleasures of concentration nothing concentrates your mind more easily than pain right and so if you're willing if you can get past your fear and just go into it you can experience a lot of mental pleasure I mean this is you know I mean I'm not I don't think

[00:23:02] I've ever met somebody who who claimed to be a masochist but I can imagine that if masochism is possible there's some reason why this is the case this would be this would be a reason why this was this would be the case that there is I can only imagine their experience in intense concentration in you know various states that most people would find you know physically intolerable but back to the idea of happiness and and other states that are commonly associated with it I think we all have this sense that happiness is a matter of being joyful all the time and this is a very common idea is sort of the misconception that yeah many of us think that well that's not desirable because if I were joyful every minute of every day I wouldn't have the drive to do X Y & Z or I wouldn't be quote unquote real in some way but but or if it is a matter of securing some durable source of joy then it can't absorb any of the other things in life for which joy would be inappropriate you know people die and there's just there are their ups and downs in life and I don't talk about or think about happiness very much I think about well-being and then flourishing more and those concepts for me can embrace all of the assist attunes of life for you if you experience some serious loss in your life there's a resiliency and a way of embracing that which is which brings out that the wisest and most compassionate and most expansive parts of yourself that is another that is another component of well-being then the narrow conception of happiness that most of us have by default it's something that we that we are always trying to defend and shore up against all of the other things in life that are threatening to undermine it and the one obvious point is that it's just not it's not a safe play it is perpetually under threat and any joy you can feel by virtue of its having arisen based on some causes and conditions it's going to pass away you know you just can't keep any emotion going for days or even hours at a time and one thing you discover when you learn to meditate is that you know negative emotion in particular has a very short half-life you know many of us imagine that we can stay angry or sad for some people would imagine days I think almost everyone thinks hours at a time it's actually impossible if you are no longer lost and thought about all the reasons why you should be angry or sad so this was one of the earlier I can't remember if this was one of the lessons in your meditation app early on or it was just a discussion you and I had but

[00:26:02] I got to put it to the test shortly after it was in New York and obviously in New York it's everything's a hustle right it's you're you're running around people are rude you're gonna get bumped into and one of my pet peeves in New York is when you see somebody walking towards you and they're for a moment lost in whatever they're doing they're usually down looking at their phone or something like that I always think it's a reasonable courtesy to just not walk into them even if they're in your line of sight you still sort of go out of your way to not bump into them but right for whatever reason there's just a subset of people who love that opportunity to almost knock you off your feet so sure enough one day I am about to turn a corner and this guy is walking and it was clear that he could see me and I had looked down so my bad but this guy plows right into me and I

[00:26:55] I had just had either had this discussion with you or just heard you know this lesson about how long can you actually stay angry and so this happens and I immediately sort of observed this emotion this rise of anger in me right which was like the desire to turn around and walk up to the guy and say something serves our purpose of course but instead I decided we'll just watch this watch this emotion how long does it last mm-hmm you know I remember I was walking somewhere that I was gonna be in ten minutes and I was like do you think this will last ten more minutes could you be angry for the next ten minutes if you just observe this feeling and the answer is no I mean it was gone actually

[00:27:33] I felt like within seconds yeah and to me that was like a really big aha moment for especially for someone like me who's so easily prone to anger to think that by simply being observant of that emotional state I could have some control over it which has always felt like the opposite right it's always felt like that emotional state has control over me right and it does I mean the important point to never forget is that it has complete control over you as long as you're identified with the next angry thought that's arising in consciousness if you have no perspective on the fact that you are thinking right well then you simply become that thought for the period that it's it's captivating and you are pushed in whatever direction it's aimed right so if it is getting you to say the angry thing or physically assault the the person you need some level of metacognition in order to pull the brakes otherwise you're just it's exactly like being asleep and dreaming and not knowing that you're dreaming this happens to us all of us every night we can we get into bed and then suddenly a movie starts playing that we're totally identified with or one of the characters in it and we're completely unaware of this change right and we're and that the most surprising thing about dreams is that we're not surprised when they arise right like there's no you know we didn't have the expectation that we would stay in our beds apparently we're not surprised that the laws of physics are being violated for our amusement and we're suddenly in these situations where we are fully captive to a completely illusory seemingly sensory experience but you know all of this is some kind of hallucination and identification with thought in the waking State has that character to some degrees it's thought to be totally normal psychologically right because it is our default state but once you learn the alternative which is to be mindful you then have a very different sense of what optimal mental health would be and so when I find myself lost and thought and just you know suddenly angry or anxious or frustrated or whatever it is and I wake up from that experience it is a little bit like waking up from a dream or a hallucination or it's hard to shake the sense that it's pathological I was stuck in something about which I had no awareness right and it was forcing me to say and do and think and feel things that were given my now current awareness were completely unnecessary he is he to me what's so interesting about this

[00:30:35] David Foster Wallace in his commencement speech in 2005 at Kenyon College the this is water which is one of my favorite mm-hmm yeah his fans to listen to I burned a copy off YouTube and now it sits on my phone and I try to listen to it at least once a month if not more and it did like I even though I almost know it off by heart it doesn't matter like I still get some benefit every time

[00:30:55] I hear it and when he talks about this he speaks specifically about the problem with this is that it is our default and that's the part that makes this so challenging so do we have evidence of other species like are we the only ones that are blessed slash cursed with this ability for rumination and constant thought I mean do we do we have any evidence that a dog is spending any percentage of his or her time thinking about what happened the day before or the next meal where do we as humans stack up in this space well it's important to acknowledge that we're blessed and cursed by this because this capacity for linguistic abstract complex thought is what has given us everything that is recognizably human right it's given us culture it has given us civilization it's it's allowed us to place all of the learning of our ancestors in a strata that is accessible to all of us into every present generation so that we don't have to relearn everything from the ground up and just to just imagine what the alternative would be there was no active no progress in civilization yeah and and for the longest time that was true of humanity as well you know he'd go back fifty thousand years and then you've decided to go back sixty thousand years that the differences are impressively non-existent right you know in terms of the toolkit anyone was working with so that's interesting Sam so deep if we go back to I don't I know it's there some debate about when language was really codified but to pick a point in time when we're pretty sure there was no language we could say two hundred thousand years ago I think most neuroscientists would agree no language two hundred thousand years ago was the arrival of language the arrival of this capacity or you know when where did this show up yeah I think language is the the main variable there I mean it's the main variable with respect to being able to abstract to be being able to represent anything that's that's not currently present or not currently happening it's the basis for communicating anything of substance to anyone else and and storing a kind of cultural memory of anything whether it's just by virtue of an oral tradition or you know once writing came along so language is necessary for all that I'm interested to be able to articulate the concept of time you know the concept of a past where the causes of the present are stored and a future which is yet to arrive that needs to be planned for or that can be better or worse it's something that that I think other species probably have in a very primitive form that is not associated with with conscious thought I think that a dog for instance learns various associations with stimuli but I have low vien responses that these animals can experience yeah and then they and they recognize people obviously I mean they they recognize people arguably better than any other species other than than the human so they can have real relationships and there's no question they have emotions and they have preferences and all of that but in terms of forming a notion of the future or a notion of the way in which the world might be different it's one thing to recognize your friend record in the case of a dog recognize your owner and prefer that person to somebody else it's another thing to have any concept of having had a past with that person now the fact that you recognize them indicates a past right but all of that could be preconscious to a dog it's just there's just this kind of binary difference between recognition and and not so let's use an even more obvious example and I'll tell you where I'm going with this because then I want to understand this which is as I observe my three children there is a distinction in what I see in the younger ones that they seem to always be present mm-hmm so which isn't to say that they don't get upset I mean you only have to look at a toddler for 10 seconds to watch with that they can get upset yeah but I doubt that they're upset about anything other than what they're experiencing in the moment right there hungry their diapers dirty whatever they fell they hurt themselves something like that but if you look at you know a teenager or a 10 year old a preteen they are now starting to suffer from this quote-unquote disease of too much thinking too much distraction so somewhere from the moment you're born until let's just make it easy and say until you're 13 you acquire this capacity but yet an infant like the dog recognizes the parent there is some sense of a history with an individual yeah again I don't know even what the relevance is of this other than to say the inability to recognize how distracted we are seems to be one of the greatest drivers of misery you know there are three quotes I love and I love them because they're basically all saying the same thing across 1,700 years so in the first century Seneca said we suffer more in imagination than in reality in the 16th century Shakespeare wrote and Hamlet for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so I have that on a t-shirt that I love to remind myself and then of course in the 17th century Pascal said distraction is the only thing that consoles us from miseries yet it is itself the greatest of our miseries mmm Descartes says something very similar I mean this is something that's been acknowledged for so long yeah and yet so ingrained in us that strikes me is like is there some evolutionary basis for this or is it just that evolution wasn't even trying to optimize for this equanimity and instead the benefits as you've pointed out of being able to do these things the progress we've been able to make as a society our ability to leapfrog ahead of other species has more than made up for this difficulty or is it simply that look evolution wouldn't out select this because it is is not it's not interfering with your reproductive fitness yeah yeah I just don't understand why we suffer so much I guess the question the crucial point there is that evolution doesn't care about your well-being as long as you reproduce what you had care yeah and so if there's some path by which we survive and reproduce in a state of misery evolution is perfectly happy with that path right it's just if that were a more reliable algorithm for reproduction and survival then we would be getting we would be getting more and more miserable so so we want to slip the the logic of evolution because it just it simply doesn't care about us right and we have and virtually everything we want as a species now at some level is a matter of breaking the connection to many of our evolved tendencies and we have a very strong evolutionary capacity for tribal violence right but tribal violence is obviously something we want to outgrow as quickly as possible and there are many other examples of this I think that language is you could see it when you're raising your kids when you have a two and a half year old and a three year old where they they're talking to you but then they're talking to themselves as though they're talking to you speech becomes something where you're you're narrating your experience as though you're talking to a parent and this seems to get internalized so that the conversation you just you know enough to keep your mouth shut but you are really talking to someone who isn't there all the time I think that's probably the the origin of it for every individual that we languages is so useful it's so essential to everything we do that we just have this superfluous level of discursivity that from again from a survival advantage that there's no reason to ever turn it off but from a well-being point of view it's the character of it is almost universally unpleasant most of the time for most people I mean there's some people who are very lucky and they have an intrinsic level of happiness that is just kind of off the charts where they're just they're basically happy all the time they recover very very quickly from disappointments and losses and they just don't really see a problem and many of these people are not very reflective about you know the human condition right they're not living necessarily examine lives because they there's not much of a reason to but they're just you know they get up in the morning and they're just stoked to be alive and you can you can you know if you get enough of the the conditions for ordinary levels of happiness together and you're lucky enough to be able to maintain them fairly effortlessly right you you're wealthy and you're healthy and you're surrounded by happy creative people who want the best for you and you're just by dint of good luck people close to you haven't died and you have you know you haven't suffered any collision with reality then yet you can you can be conventionally very happy and still be talking to yourself all the time and not notice it but there's limitation even to that when you do develop this more refined way of noticing what it's like to be you which is what we're calling meditation it's not that learning this having insight into the mechanics of your own suffering and the mediocrity of kind of ordinary transient states of pleasure it's not that that is at bottom incompatible with living an ordinary fulfilled pleasure-seeking life I mean you can enjoy dinner just as much having learned to meditate as you know anyone who's gluttonously attached to sensory experience with that without any kind of metacognition about you know what's going on but the difference comes in how you respond to problems that arise it's actually both right I mean I think that mindfulness clearly makes it easier to endure unpleasant things so you know I I was late to come over here today because the to get to your place which should have been an hour took two hours and that is normally something that would drive me batshit crazy just by by way of process like why is it so inefficient like why are there so many cars on the road bla bla like I would get into a woe is me narrative about this which is of course ironic because like why am i more special than every other car on this road right like everyone is equally in the same situation of its taking two hours to get somewhere that it should take one hour and I actually I have used traffic because when you live in

[00:42:29] Southern California and split your time in New York you get plenty of exposure to traffic I've actually used this as an amazing tool for mindfulness and I no longer let it really get to me instead I just sort of observe oh look you're feeling a little bit self-important today like you're feeling like your time is more valuable than everybody else's time let's examine that is that really true not really okay what is happening in this exact moment the sun is shining this way or you know all these other things so so in many ways if nothing else it's simply a hack to allow me to be less miserable yeah yeah but on the flip side I actually do think there is a way to enjoy certain moments more and and I've certainly noticed this the most with my kids I think that you know I have a our middle son who's four you know he's just that's what 44 like a 4 year old boy is just gonna be more prone to chewing up the air in the room when it comes to doing bad stuff mmm and I find that and to be clear they're not all days that I can do this there are some days when he's acting crazy that it just drives me nuts but more often than not

[00:43:33] I'm sort of able to actually reflect on it pleasantly and think about like what's happening in this moment right okay he's he's yelling he's screaming he's throwing a temper tantrum he's hit his brother he's done this he's done that but in this moment is there anything that's really that bad about any of these things I mean like it's not like he's gonna be doing this when he goes to college like what am I really worried about here yeah and in fact I can turn that into a positive thing which is one day he will be in college and he won't be a cute little four year old who loves me so much you'll miss this mom yeah

[00:44:04] I'll miss this moment so I have found that again I use the word hack because I it's such an in elegant way to describe it but it's basically a tool to make me a little bit more aware of where I am in a given moment and whether that produces happiness or not I mean I sort of agree with you the semantics of happiness or too cumbersome for me to explain you know people have talked about the happiness is simply the difference between reality and expectation I mean that's a bit vague for me I'm not smart enough to fully understand what that means though I understand the concept but clearly there's some component of expecting the world to be a certain way and it not being that way producing an emotional state or a valence that is negative one way or the other and and and so I think well as wonderful as mindfulness is to offset that there is this moment at times of taking a bite of food and rather than thinking about the next bite or what you're gonna eat later like actually thinking you know or observing the sensations as they're occurring in that moment kind of slowing things down in a way yeah yeah yeah cuz

[00:45:08] I don't know why I just tend to always live in a fast forward mode that is my default is to be full fast forward well it's it's most people's default I always say it's everyone's default who's not being mindful because you're you're constantly even when you're getting what you want even when you're in the very act of gratifying a desire you're still subtly inclining toward the next moment you're not actually landing on each moment of experience with full attention and paradoxically you can discovered that many of the things you think you want you don't want all that much if you pay attention to what is actually like to gratify those desires maybe with food this is very clear so you can be eating something you can think you want dessert you can have a real sweet tooth and if you pay very close attention to what it's like to eat that sweet thing you're you know finally gorging on more often than not you discover it's just a little too sweet there's something about it that is unpleasant and your pleasure in that moment it's predicated on your being able to take a drink of water in the next right like if you have to bite a candy bar or something that's candy that's made for kids delivers this insight to me very clearly it's like the moment I I think I want something you know at the movies whatever it is a you know M&Ms are something that is hasn't changed his formula for the last 40 years and I'm eating it and I begin to notice that I'm eating more of it as a way of just getting rid of getting rid of the sense in your palate yeah the last moment of taste that is just too chemical Laden too sweet and you know if

[00:46:55] I didn't have a drink of water or you know this this would actually be an unpleasant experience and it's not what it seems when you're not paying attention and this is not to say that there's nothing that's truly pleasurable and there's all kinds of pleasure and again being able to really connect with the present moment delivers its own intrinsic pleasure but your sense of what matters can definitely change the moment you begin to pay closer attention to them to what experience is actually like

[00:47:27] I think it was in one of your lessons but it might have been in a podcast where you talk about imagine you're playing a video game and it's the same video game every time and you always get killed by the same monster at the same part of the maze or whatever is and I think about that a lot every time I falter at predictably you know known understood things that get under my skin and it's very discouraging right it's sort of like I there like a dozen things that I just know if they happen so I mean one of them is there's certain types of questions that if I'm asked really irking me you know when people ask questions that are to which the answer is very complicated but they ask through the lens of just give me the one-word answer that just irks me like I don't know why it just bugs the out of me and I know that and yet over and over again I find myself getting upset when that happens and I feel like the guy that you're describing video you're losing the boss fight at the same place every time every single time I know where the boogeyman is I know what weapon he's going to use to kill me I just walk over there and out comes the machete and I'm dead nothing and then

[00:48:41] I'm back to the starting block again and I'm one-one fewer lives in the game right what what but you can recover faster each time you lose getting angry is not the measure of having lost right now you you obviously you can aspire to a time where you never get angry again or you never get angry in certain circumstances again but the real practice is to notice as early as possible what's happening and to let go of it the difference between being angry for 10 minutes and 10 seconds and one second those factors of 10 are enormous right and

[00:49:22] I have the same thing going on where it's a anger is something that I very frequently feel and I also noticed that it totally contaminates the experience of people around me so I have my wife and my daughters and my anger for them is clearly toxic and I have this commitment to letting go of it at the moment I can let go of it and it's again it's not that anger is never warranted the energy of anger can be useful someone's attacking you on the sidewalk you know and you're in a self-defense situation that's not the moment where I would say get rid of all your anger as quickly as possible right at me there's situations where you want to use that energy but for the most part you want to let go of it very very quickly and then be in a position to decide what's what and whether or not it's appropriate to take some kind of you know confrontational path whatever it is by email or you know say the thing that that would convey your displeasure or whatever but now I have my my wife and my daughters as a kind of feedback mechanism for me because they they know my commitment they know I can let go of anger on demand and they know I want to and they don't like my anger right and they detect it in the subtlest way so like I mean it's not it's not even anger where a normal person would classically think he was and they don't have to wait till you raise your voice they can see the mannerisms in the way you might move or the way your answers become shorter or yeah yeah or it may just so but and like you know even mild frustration get scored as you know a kind of crazy level of anger right so like if I you know if

[00:51:07] I say wait a minute I thought the plumber was coming today that's like you know that you know that's a four-alarm fire right so one of my daughters will say ooh daddy's getting angry right and they'll say that's so early now and it's fantastic because it's I just let go of it way earlier than I used to but if you can't be mindful you actually have no choice you know you just you will be angry as long as you're angry and the people around you who don't like it just have to figure out some how to put up with you there's no other haxe and there are many other hacks and sometimes sometimes there it's important to have a hack that is more global than being simply being relentlessly mindful of everything that's coming up for you like a different understanding of a situation ken offer some kind of firmware update to the whole operating system and then you you just simply don't go there anymore so for instance I mean so you're driving in traffic there are many hacks for that but one hack is just you discover that you've got 400 hours of podcasts you want to listen to and you're listening to a great one and you you're just happy to be listening and the fact that your delay at an extra half-hour or whatever it's fine you know and that's a totally useful hack right it modulates your state you're just you're just discovering the Silver Line into something that's that would otherwise be negative I'll share with you another one because I agree with that completely that's a great one the other one that

[00:52:40] I've taken on in the past year that has had surprising efficacy is any customer service experience you have that is profoundly negative uh-huh and if you fly as much as I do you're pretty much guaranteed one of those a week my friend Jay Walker who knows a lot about the aviation industry said one out of six experiences with us

[00:53:02] Aviation is a customer service failure right so anyone who flies would agree with that but so the next time like the flight attendants rude to you or the TSA person is sweating you or being obnoxious or whatever if you instead take a view of empathy which is God this is a really hard job you know I mean yet

[00:53:23] I have the privilege of getting to be you know intellectually engaged and doing all of these things in boom-boom-boom but this a really hard job I mean most of the people that they're encountering are on some level dissatisfied he's showing up to to their world happy and so like simply taking that posture completely changes the way you interact with that system yeah and then it's interesting because it doesn't even really require a huge mindfulness insight it's just sort of uh but it's it's a condition you want to walk in the situation with right you want to be able to walk in with that in your mind yeah it's a frame in effect yeah yeah and it doesn't entail mindfulness at all you could get the benefit of that new framing without ever having heard of mindfulness so you know if you do get angry you'll be as angry as as you ever were but right so that you'll have a different way of thinking about it yeah the combination of these is powerful yeah when I think about one of the most difficult things to but there are two things in my life that I have learned that I think were very difficult and took a lot of time the first was in the year 2000 when I was finishing medical school I had a really bad back injury hmm and it's a long story but it basically for a a year of my life I was not able to move properly and for three months I was not able to move at all

[00:54:41] Wow how did that happen it's not clear how it happened but what happened was a pretty bad outcome and I ended up having surgery but the surgeon operated on the wrong side so it went from a very bad situation to a worse situation and a whole series of cascading events led to it being what it was I look back at that as I've described as before as the best worst experience of my life because having been in so much pain for so long I had to learn how to do everything from scratch so I had to learn how to be able to brush my teeth without putting stress on my back which most people wouldn't even think about you wouldn't think that there's a right and a wrong way to brush your teeth mmm you wouldn't think that there's a right and a wrong way to get out of your bed put your shoes on or get out of your car it turns out there is but you can only learn it when you are in such a fragile state that you've lost every ounce of strength in your back and because I experienced that for so long a year it allowed me to make this transition which

[00:55:43] I want to of course apply to meditation the transition is going from being unconsciously incompetent to then being consciously incompetent to then consciously competent and of course the goal is to one day get to a point where you were unconsciously competent hmm I don't think I'm unconscious ly competent at a single thing I do including movement but I'm now consciously competent at moving around and not hurting my back but I couldn't have got there if I didn't have that feedback loop that allowed me to go through it the other thing was learning how to swim as an adult you know you throw an adult in the water who never swum before they are so incompetent but they don't even really understand what it is and so the first act of learning how to swim is learning to feel what's making you sink figuring out what it is that is actually dropping you to the bottom of the pool and then of course you want to be able to correct that and with great effort over short periods of time exercise some capacity to fix that

[00:56:42] I would say those two experiences have been by far the most difficult but they pale in comparison to mindfulness hmm now I don't know if that just makes me a hard case but and and maybe it's you know the other thing I was thinking about when I was reflecting on this is having a back injury you don't get a time you don't get a time out from it you know it's every minute of every day you're immersed in that exposure that's stimulus and that feedback loop similarly once I dedicated myself to swimming I swam for hours a day and I think maybe the issue is because I don't meditate for four hours a day it's just gonna take a lot longer to do it and I know you and I've spoken about this and your belief is that something really happens when you go on a silent retreat and I remember once asking I said hey

[00:57:30] Sam I see this retreat it's four days do you think I should go and you actually said no I wouldn't go for a four-day retreat I'd wait till you can do 10 or 14 days yeah I guess I would modify that slightly out I think a week to ten days is the the shortest I can recommend without caveat I think the first three days or so of a retreat are more or less the hardest for for a retreat of any length so if you do if you do a three-day retreat or a four-day retreat you're almost guaranteed to have a lot of restlessness and just resistance to the whole project and may not touch anything on the other side of that you can just be kind of unhappy the whole time and then just relieved to be getting off retreat whereas if you have ten days just seems like an eternity once you put yourself on retreat and you're you've just shut down your connection to everything there's no talking there's no writing there's no reading it's just you and your attention in each moment 10 days seems like an eternity and so as you move through those first few days of resistance at day 3 you're still so far away from the day that you're going home that it's much more common to just surrender at that point and really get into it just decide that you could you just pick up your life as you left it when you get off retreat and that for this period there's just nothing worth thinking about you're just need to pay attention to whatever is appearing you know your breath sounds the movement of air on your hand as you walk your first experience in this was sort of comical the way you describe it right this was when you were 16 I believe oh no that was my first experience of solitude that would I guess it would have been a retreat but I was on an outward bound and the outward bound I assumed I still have it but back then they had something called the solo which was three it was a twenty three day period of you know camping and hiking and and they kind of outdoorsmen ship but maybe day 18 or so they put you in isolation for three full days where you would fast and do nothing right so you couldn't go hiking and do anything that would distract you and I think that the reason for that was not based on any meditative agenda that they had it was just they don't want a bunch of not fully trained people wandering around the wilderness well fasted so they just Park you in some place we were by this lake it may be 9,000 feet and you just camp with a water bottle and that's all you got you just have your sleeping bag your water bottle and you have a journal journal yeah you can write in your journal and I found the experience just intolerable it was just you were 16 yeah it was 16 hey yeah so I opened my book waking up with this story because it was the first moment in my life that I realized that I was on the wrong side of some understanding about the nature of my own mind and the possibility of finding a durable source of of happiness in this life I mean so I was I was alone in an absolutely beautiful spot and totally miserable on the fact that I didn't have any of the usual distractions and if you could have just swapped places with me and inhabited my consciousness I was spending all my time fantasizing about the things I was gonna do when I got off

[01:01:14] Google when I got out of those goddamn mountains and got back to my life in the world and you know the friends I would see and the foods I would eat and I would just it was just a continuous advertisement for everything that I missed you know it was just that it was like a meditation on loneliness and boredom and grief ultimately I just it was just to be separated from everyone I cared about and every fun thing I could do and every tasty thing I could eat it was just a source of perfect misery for me so when I came off the solo and met all of the other people who had also been on their solos I was astonished to discover that many of them had had profoundly happy experiences rayann that were you one of the youngest people on this yeah yes I was I think I was the youngest so it was I think the cutoff I don't know if this is still the case but the cutoff for outward-bound was 16 and a half and I was just 16 and a half so you know there were lots of people who were 10 years old or so and so they were in different places in their lives and many of them just had a kind of breakthrough experience I mean they just it was just some of the best time they'd ever spent alive and they were kind of radiantly happy you know for because we had just done 18 or so days of brutal hiking I'm interested in it kind of just 14-hour days of hiking with 60 pound packs and you know we had this full ordeal of learning how to to function in the in the backcountry and then it all stops and you're just alone by this alpine lake so many of them had come out of that and feeling that they had touched something profound and I had no idea what they were talking about it was like being told that you know I just got run over by a car and was the greatest thing that's ever happened to me it's like it made it I had come out of there having had a heroin experience so what happened when you went back home after that did you look back and reflect on that or does that basically just become a footnote into a broader story that really didn't factor into your your ultimate search for for you know call it enlightenment call it what you want it took a little time I strike it was probably a year and a half before I then had an experience with with psychedelics that put all of this in perspective for me so and was your first experience with psilocybin or LSD strangely I had taken psilocybin as a teenager [Music] before I had what really was that I kind of breakthrough experience for me on

[01:03:56] MDMA and when I was 18 yeah you wrote about that as well yeah yeah that was that's in waking up I taken psilocybin I smoked marijuana and I had taken mushrooms a few times as a teenager and they never they never signaled anything profound to me about the nature of the mind or they never indicated a path forward apart from just this sense that these drugs produced interesting experiences I had no framing for the what I experienced on these drugs you experience the altered state but there was no altered trait to borrow from the title of the same book yeah and and and also just no sense that there could be altered traits there was no project associated with changing your experience in that way it was just it was kind of fun so I guess some of the experiences had also been unpleasant on psilocybin but it's just these were drug experiences you know and it's like getting drunk like if you get drunk you don't come away from that experience thinking I wonder if this indicates that it's possible to feel kind of natively feel like I've had six beers and you know I can just be more that sort of person by some other method that has nothing to do with drinking beer all the time right but but with

[01:05:22] MDMA you know my first experience on ecstasy I had this epiphany that this is what consciousness was like when it was no longer encumbered by myself concern by my egocentricity by my and because you were 18 I mean was it so much about like I'm trying to reflect on what it was like to be an 18 year old boy but I think if I recall you wrote about just sort of the empathy that you had for your friend because it was you and another friend right yeah and was that the part that was so stunning to you which was oh my god like spent the last 18 years sort of not thinking about it through somebody else's eyes or what was it that you experienced if you can recall that at least showed you and perhaps was the thin end of the wedge that said there is now an altered state of consciousness that could exist outside of this state that I'm in that might be desirable it was cognition that what was changing for me while I was coming on to the drug was that I was losing my concern about myself right so that is I'm talking to my best friend some of somebody who's who I already love and and I'm connected to and have you know positive feelings for but what was happening is that I started to punch through to this level of connection with him that I had never felt before despite the fact that we were great friends and it had a kind of structure to it or it was it was dissecting a structure within my mind that I had never had any cause to notice which was my default state was normally that you know if I'm talking to him some amount of my attention is bound up in a concern about what he thinks about me right so there you know if I see some change and expression on his face based on what I just said I'm reading into those changes some message about me some message about how I'm doing and there are many other features to this I mean there's also a sense of a kind of zero-sum aspect to my own stature in the world and my you know feeling of well-being in light of other people's success and and Happiness so and it's something you can discover in yourself imagine those times where you have a friend who has some you know massive success right you know you're struggling in your life to be as successful as you want to be if you're like most people you haven't arrived yet and then you have a friend you know who's winning some version of the lottery and when this is being communicated to you you're asked to celebrate with them essentially and you can discover in yourself a kind of begrudging feeling whether it's Envy or there's a limitation on your capacity to experience what's called sympathetic joy and in Buddhism for that person and that's a ugly characteristic of the mind

[01:08:36] I mean here's someone who you sensibly really care about there's someone you really love this is someone who you think their windfall did not come at your expense right exactly and yet you there's something in you that can't actually celebrate for them fully because you're so bound up with who you are and what you want for yourself and you know how you think they may think about you and I mean this horror show of self reference and this miserly spirit with respect to the circumstance you're in with with everyone so what happened on for in this first MDMA trip is that I just punched through all of that right all that was just gone and there was no Associated inebriation I mean it was just my experience wasn't just that's the thing with MDMA that makes it sort of quite distinct and special from some of these other agents right is there is no sense of altered consciousness yeah it can be kind of speedy and it also depends on whether you're getting treated if you're talking about your mas is yeah of course when they come up with stimulants it's a different story but yeah but really pure

[01:09:44] MDMA doesn't seem to really alter your consciousness in any way yeah way that you know LSD would right yeah I mean there's no psychic it's not it's not considered really a psychedelic it doesn't have any of those visionary or hallucinatory yes doom or is it a pathogen verse yeah and theage incorrect yeah yeah so having lost all that I just I recognized that one just had how much I loved him and how that was synonymous with wanting him to be happy and in some basic sense his happiness would be my own right so that's the capacity for envy would just will completely went out the window there's just no way to feel a zero-sum contest with somebody who you love in that way and but then I recognized that if a stranger had walked into the room at that moment literally the mailman shows up I would have felt the same way about him it was not contingent upon having had a history with this person I was in a state where

[01:10:42] I wanted all beans to have their dreams realized I wish nothing but happiness on every conscious system right we have four laws for a moment so you can explain the neurobiology of that I've experienced that as well with MDMA and I find it to be the most joyous state I've ever experienced to have such I don't I don't possess

[01:11:11] I don't unlike you I don't have the vocabulary to even describe what it feels like other than to say you love everybody in obviously a very non-sexual way it's just a male/female are all the same it sort of becomes this you just want the best for everyone so so what is it about the neurobiology or neuro chemistry that can produce that state and I'll tell you what the follow-up question is going to be is there anything we can do outside of taking that drug to even get part of that well unfortunately I don't know the answer to the neurobiology I'm not sure it is known I think I think most of these drugs are serotonergic but but the subtle clearly are different subsets of the receptors their hitting is you don't exactly understand the causal relationship between the receptor being yeah I mean and I'm you know frankly I'm not up on the literature on MDMA so there may be some clues that I'm not aware of but and I would also add the caveat that some of these drugs I think they're there's reason to be concerned about in terms of the physical effects of taking them too often or emitted so

[01:12:24] MDMA is something that was profoundly useful for me I remain somewhat concerned that it is potentially neurotoxic I wouldn't want to take too much of it I haven't taken it for years and I have much less of a concern for other psychedelics I think LSD is I mean there's there's no evidence that it's neurotoxic for instance having spoken with people psychiatrists who have taken care of patients who have probably taken too much

[01:12:55] MDMA the two things that I have learned from them which echo what you're saying is yeah it's generally safe but it's very important like any drug I mean these aren't regulated compounds right so right you're always running a risk when you take these things of other things that the drug is cut with and there's no activity that can be amplified as a result of that and the second thing that I've been told is [Music] anything over a frequency of about every three months and you start to run a risk of these serotonergic toxicities down the line hmm so you know you can take that for what it's worth I mean I'm certainly not providing guidance on that other than to echo your point that I think one has to be very careful with these agents now at the same time I'm not following the work of maps that closely so I'm not sure what doses or frequencies they're using with the vets that they're studying yeah and I think literally they've worked out some of these kinks as well yeah but frankly it would be worth it even if it were neurotoxic to some degree in the right conditions for adverse if you had debilitating PTSD yeah maybe a little bit of long term consequence or short term toxicity is worth it to cure that but yeah you know so then back to the second question which is when you think about that profound empathy in that moment that you had at the age of eighteen has your meditative practice which is obviously evolved greatly since then allowed you to either transiently or otherwise experience or re experience that phenomenon yeah well there is a practice that targets that mental status actually you referred earlier yeah yeah

[01:14:37] Metta practice I met as the Pali word for loving-kindness and yeah there are people who do that practice almost exclusively or a little bit through the listener unlike mindfulness where you are letting go of any agenda you have for what your experience should be and you're just reconciling yourself to noticing however it is do that your experience does change in reliable ways many of which are quite pleasant they can be you know amazingly

[01:15:11] Pleasant but it's not about securing those changes or amplifying those changes or just because because that begin so far as that creeps in you're not being mindful you're doing something other than merely witnessing what's happening and doing that is an expression of your own desire and attachment and I mean you're trying to change your experience and that's that's different than then simply being mindful of it but with a practice like Metta you do have a goal you're trying to feel this feeling of loving kindness as intensely as you can feel it as durably as you can feel it and you're trying to you're trying to acquire a state change but you're also trying to acquire a trait change in that you know your default attitude toward other human beings or even other any other conscious system would be just well wishing and and you know good good vibes so there's no question you can train that attitude and it comes from both a framing effect and from an immersion in this change of state that you can Kindle in meditation and then keep humming along based on concentration so the same kind of constant the same Faculty of

[01:16:28] Mind they could become one pointedly focused on a mantra or a site like a candle flame can become one pointedly immersed in the feeling of love for all humanity and it's initiated by thinking thoughts about other people so you just imagine someone who you love and it's important that this not be contaminated with whether your notion of romantic love because so much of what we think of as love in a romantic context is desire and attachment and it's nice inappropriate yeah active that type of attention yeah a child a friend a parent but whoever in your life you can have just as uncomplicated an experience of wishing this person well wishing them to be free of suffering wishing them happiness and the usual progression is to start with someone like that who you know who someone who's close to you and then transition to a neutral person you know someone who you have know just a kind of a randomly picked person from the crowd or some public figure who you have no strong association with but who you can visualize and then you're wishing that person happiness wishing that they be free of suffering you're actually thinking these thoughts in your mind as the kind of almost as a kind of mantra but you're not it's not the sound of the the utterances it's the the import of them that you're trying to connect with so your thinking may you be happy may you be free from suffering you're reiterating this you could have you know three or four ways of saying it and you're saying it over and over again but then connecting with the actual and energetics of the wish that you really do wish that this person who you love be free from suffering and it can become this very deep feeling of basking in this well of good intentions for everybody right because and then you can you can include not only a neutral person but someone for whom you have a so-called enemy someone for whom you have a real negative association and then you begin to see the importance of framing around all these things so just like you said for the customer service situation it just takes a second to realize wait a minute here's a person who's been standing at this desk since six o'clock in the morning meeting one disgruntled person after the next and now she or he has just met me their experience is completely different from mine and which by the way is a beautiful cut to the sort of issue that David

[01:19:11] Foster Wallace talks about so much is every experience we have is only through our lens right yeah it's that insight alone which now you're giving a very tangible example of is so powerful just to be able to hit pause on that for a moment and say yeah what you just said right this person's been standing here for seven hours yeah seeing one pissed-off face after another what they're seeing now is totally different from what I'm seeing yeah yeah and your impatience isn't helping and you are so glad that you're not in their shoes right like you don't want their job you actually feel compassion for their experience right and there are many you know hacks of this kind where you know you're driving in traffic and someone cuts you off and you know your default experiences what an but it just takes a second to realize wait a minute you have no idea what's going on with this person you don't know if this person is in a rush because they have some real emergency you don't know if they're 90 years old now you just honked at some 90 year old man or woman right and who's the now there's so many changes of frame applied to the exact same experience which just fundamentally change your interpretation of it loving-kindness practice is based on a fundamental frame change for more or less everything you can encounter in human affairs which is everyone is suffering everyone was once a child condemned to now be the adult they now are right so like this there is no evil person who invented himself right there's no I get him this is something I've talked about with respect to Saddam Hussein in the past they usually talk about this in the context of talking about free will but let me just look at someone like the prototypical evil person you know Saddam

[01:21:10] Hussein is about as good as it gets right so you look at him as a as a 40 year old man he's just a terrifyingly evil sociopath who if you're in favor of the death penalty it definitely applies to him but you roll back his his life line by a few decades and at a certain point you say okay here's a 12 year old boy who could have well been a scary 12 year old boy but you know when he's four years old he's a four year old and he's a four year old who has every strike against him in the sense that he's guaranteed it seems to be a morally damaged human being he's living in a society riven by sectarian conflict the norms to which he's being pushed the aspirations he conformed in this context are barbaric by any standard you know ethical standard that we would form today right and the kind of person who can thrive in that context is someone who's morally damaged by our lights and he didn't pick his parents he didn't pick his genes he's not the author of himself and yet he's going to become this evil person who you know half the world or more will think is deserving of death at the end of it it's possible to feel compassion even for someone like Saddam Hussein I mean that's a reframing that may be hard for some people to get there but for someone who's practicing a state like Metta that's the frame and if you can get there you can recognize that there is this capacity for love and and well-wishing that really extends without limit to every conscious system I mean you want you want everyone to be relieved of all their problems on some basic level because the most badly behaved people in the world are for the most part expressing their problems even when you have a truly sadistic person who seems to be deriving pleasure from causing other people suffering and such people exist what you're witnessing there is someone for whom all these other sources of pleasure and well-being are basically unavailable right this this person on some level can't know what he's missing you know there's a person who's never going to have good relationships of the sort that you and I would demand for ourselves and everyone we love as the necessary ingredients of a life well-lived it's not to say you wouldn't want to put this person in jail because there is no cure for this problem I'm not recommending that we not protect ourselves from malevolent people but you don't actually have to hate them

[01:23:53] I mean feeling compassion for these people isn't incompatible with taking the steps we need to take to keep society orderly and safe you know one thing I would recommend to anybody who's interested in pulling a little more on this thread is to do a prison visit yeah I've never done that but I heard you and

[01:24:12] Tim did that right him and I did it and I had a I did a podcast we got inquiry McCarthy who himself was incarcerated for seven years for attempted murder and a bunch of other stuff and you know there's a group of three or four or five of us that actually went and spent a couple of days at a maximum-security prison and we played this game they're called step to the line which I'm sure you've heard of and it's you know it's a game that's played in many reasons but the purpose is always to basically highlight our similarities and our differences so on the one side of the line were all of these inmates now we're in a maximum-security prison in California so everybody in that room I don't remember the exact numbers I believe 70% of those men were serving life sentences [Music] some staggering number of these guys were in there because of you know homicide or you know some something more than like they were trafficking some marijuana right right and on the other side are all of us as volunteers and then the game begins of step four the line if and the differences are so humbling that it's it you can't be a you can't be a reasonable human being and be in that situation and not be moved by it you know step for the line if you had two parents in your household and amongst the volunteers you know maybe 60% step forward and amongst the inmates I think one step forward hmm you know yeah step to the line if someone close to you died before you were 10 you know and or died a violent death before you were 10 you know these sorts of things and you know step for the line if you grew up in a home that had more than five books and those of us as volunteers most of us step forward of the inmates you know five step forward out of 50 that can writing write and it's to your point right it's like we're we're not gonna excuse the mistakes that took place and there's you know society has said there's going to be a price that one has to pay for one mistakes but boy you realize pretty quickly the randomness that allows you or me to be standing on one side of that line and not the other oh yeah yeah no if you were in precisely that other person's situation genetically environmentally you would be that other person right there's just there is no daylight between all of those causes and conditions and the outcome and even if even add in randomness I mean it's no quantum mechanics doesn't get you out of this situation and I think of all the times

[01:26:40] I've been lucky like when I was in eighth grade there was a kid that was a year ahead who was like my hero you know he was the absolute toughest kid in the school I mean he was the bad the badass and he took me under his wing you know so I was like really lucky to be the 8th grader who this super tough badass kid really liked and two years later he wound up in jail for armed robbery mm-hmm and I've often thought to myself I was so impressionable that if I had been with him on that night and he said look we're gonna go hold up a liquor store

[01:27:15] I'm not sure I would have had the common sense the intestinal fortitude that whatever the courage to say do that's a bad idea I'm not gonna go it's so easy that I could have gone along for that yeah and as I learned later on once you get in that system like you know once you're 16 years old and you're pegged for armed robbery like it's very hard to recover to Stanford yeah yeah so so but that's it that's a moment's decision and then and the luck is like were you there or not there right and and I'm I have way more cards that are favorable in my deck than virtually all of these guys I met and I yet I still could have easily slipped over that you know into that abyss of that endless vicious cycle of one one one knock after another until before you know it like you're 40 years old and you're in prison for life yeah I mean so the philosophical insight here goes by the name of moral luck and says

[01:28:12] I think it originates with an essay that the philosopher Thomas Nagel wrote probably thirty years ago we rarely recognize how morally significant differences in luck are and and just how lucky you need to be to live a good moral life any one of those things could have been marginally different and you'd be the guy who was an accessory to armed robbery right let me just think of how many times most of us have driven drunk or not a hundred percent and nothing bad happened the difference between nothing bad happening and killing somebody in a crosswalk is enormous and just a life - ranging stranger still because it's now it's not even classed for most people as a significant risk they're running texting while driving I mean I would say most of the people listening to this podcast have not totally shut down their texting while driving right they're not they're not even thinking of it as a grotesquely irresponsible thing to be doing right and because it's just it's too tempting you're at a red light but being at a red light migrates into the first hundred feet of your now responding to a green light and then there's the moments on the freeway and then and every day there's some totally normal responsible upstanding person like you or me who kills somebody's kid in a crosswalk because they were texting the significance of that difference in luck it's extraordinary and you know these are these are unrecoverable errors most of the time so the two sides of that one it can get you to to take more care in all the spots where more care massively increases your odds of living a happy fulfilling life but it also can give you this different framing that allows you to feel compassion for even the worst people on earth right you should recognize that if you change enough of the variables you would be playing the same game they're playing and this is I think this is so important

[01:30:21] Sam I don't think I understood how important this was until I read something you wrote which I'm paraphrasing so I'll be bastardizing it but the gist of it was it's really the the caliber quality of our thoughts that determine the quality of our life hmm and I so let's take a most extreme example I had a friend who was killed by a motorist who was texting so he was on his bike he couldn't have been in a safer spot actually and but woman you know got distracted for a moment and killed them and

[01:31:00] I was angry in a way that sort of felt like it was never gonna go away and truthfully a big part of it was selfish it was I don't want this to happen to me now you know I'm at the time I was a cyclist I was like I'm sick and tired of seeing cyclists get hit and some of the times they're getting killed but they're getting hit all the time right and it's all it always seems to be these not always but 90% of the time it's these distracted drivers sometimes the cyclists just does something stupid but for the most part if you get hit if a road if a cyclist in the road gets hit the drivers usually at fault interestingly unless alcohol is involved those drivers are never prosecuted right and I spent so much time being so pissed off and part of it was just my own grandiosity like my life is too valuable

[01:31:45] I'm not gonna die on the side of a road because some drivers too stupid to turn off their phone or bla bla bla bla bla but then I I had you know after kind of reading something you wrote I reflected on it years later and thought I've never once asked myself what that person is going through who killed Nick yeah yeah what had her life like today cuz there's no way she forgot that there's no way she doesn't go to bed at night and think about the fact that she it's such a tragic story not only did she kill a guy who's just a beautiful soul who had you know a bunch of children he was killed two days before his life insurance policy kicked in hmm he was killed on believe it was May 30th no it was May 31st and he had a policy that would didn't start until June 1st hmm I mean it's like you couldn't make this story up it's so tragic but it's too easy to not reflect on her pain yeah you could say well Peter that's ridiculous she doesn't deserve any empathy put all of that empathy towards Nick's family but it in the end if I'm really optimizing for my own quality of life no upside to just being upset about this like we're know some benefit

[01:32:59] I will accepting the fact that everybody here loses and if that makes me less angry and makes me hate that person less isn't that a good way to think about things well yeah but I would even put it more strongly because I can't she the driver was profoundly unlucky because she she was guilty of doing something that all of us everyone listening to this podcast has done and didn't pay that price war still she's guilty of doing something that most of the people is new this podcast will continue to do even after hearing this podcast this is a reset that I'm convinced most people are not quite ready for a certain point self-driving cars will come to the rescue but the difference between being someone who was texting and didn't even notice the danger because nothing bad happened and being someone who killed your friend is just luck you know and so yeah and you can only imagine how awful it has been to be the person who was irresponsibly texting and who killed somebody in the in the prime of their life just to hear the details and to have been the person who initiated that tsunami of suffering just imagine a website where you present the texts that were the proximate cause of death right how irrelevant they must have yet the juxtaposition between what people were felt couldn't wait another 30 seconds or thirty minutes and and what the tragedy offered in the loss yeah it would be astonishing I mean we can all predict what it would be but that's the idea but it had a pretty damn good idea yeah yeah again it's just if you imagine what that woman went through it's you would not want to trade places with her so want to shift gears for a moment and go back to the discussion I had a week ago with one of my friends who's a patient he's been really struggling the last few months he's he's a he's a father he's a wonderful guy he's got two kids three dogs and he's a guy with a really big heart so he's he's he's one of these guys who just

[01:35:15] I don't know you get the sense he could never be upset at anybody he could never you know not want to take care of somebody around him and but his one of the dogs which is the first dog he ever had died had cancer and they went through a bunch of treatments and and the dog ultimately died and I think for him losing that dog was was certainly on the spectrum of losing a child right I don't think it's the same but but I think for him it was very difficult and he's been unable to sort of get back in the in the saddle so to speak and it's it's reflected in frankly his cortisol levels I've never seen cortisol levels so high so his degree of hypercortisolism Sall secreting tumor actually it's so profound and we were talking about it and he confessed that he couldn't stop dreading the death of his other two dogs hmm who are you know aged six and seven or something like that so these aren't dogs that are gonna die tomorrow in fact these aren't even dogs that are you know sick in any way shape or form right but as he's three months out from the death of this dog that was probably 14 or 15 he's spending every moment now dreading the loss of these dogs that are gonna die in five years or something like that and it was very hard for me to try to console him because I didn't want to be dismissive of the pain but I also wanted to remind him that you know that's the antithesis of being present right it's like but your children and your two dogs are right here with you right now and they're perfect yeah and all the worrying you can do about when these two dogs die doesn't change the fact that they're going to die but you don't know when and you don't know how when you don't know any of these things how would you explain to someone like that in not necessarily the most technical sense but maybe in sort of an appeal to their emotion why this effort isn't going to pan out and why there needs to be a new strategy for getting over this loss well it depends on whether or not the person is living an examined life of the sort that we've been discussing so the if this is a person who has no meditation practice and it's not interested in that mode he is so I I've given him your books he has been going through the meditation course that you have is still having a real hard time like all of us and I think in taking it from you know I the example I use is like if you go to the gym and you sort of lift weights for 15-20 minutes a day you know that's that's great but the whole purpose of doing that is to take those new muscles and be able to use them in the other twenty three and a half hours right and so I think that's the transition is like I think the theory makes sense to him but it's now how does one actually bridge that gap so let's for the purpose of the discussion let's say he accepts conceptually right value of this yeah well so then to become sensitive to the actual mechanics of suffering I mean that the only way to suffer this dog's absence is to think about it and not know that you're thinking about it right so it is to be subsumed by this process of ideation and to have no perspective on it and framing can help here so you can omit you can say well there were many experiences he had would this dog alive where the dog wasn't physically present right the dog leaves the room there's no greater absence from a room than simply leaving it right now it's an additional operation to think well there's a big difference because

[01:39:08] I'll never see him again right but everyone you love in the world animals you're the only person I love who's in this race exactly right they're all out of this room so in principle you know what it's like to be content in moments where's the collab sit in the physical absence of everyone you love in this world it's possible and the only way to make it intolerable to be in a room without everyone you love is to meditate on how intolerable it is that they're not in the room with you right now and this is why meditation is such an amazing skill because and is as a point of contact with your prison story this is a point I make several places I think

[01:39:56] I make it my book waking up the amazing thing about meditation is that you know once you actually know how to meditate it's possible to be alone in a room for weeks and months and even years imagine them several teachers I studied with had spent literally years alone in caves where in most people's lives solitary confinement is considered a punishment even in a circumstance where to be outside of that room is to be surrounded by murderers and rapists who you might have to fight right so like even in prison people don't want to be in solitary confinement right because it's so intolerable to be left alone with your thoughts there's an evolutionary rationale for this I mean we are clearly evolved to be social primates and a circumstance where you find yourself alone more or less forever is not an optimum in evolutionary terms but it's just simply a fact of the human mind that it's possible to discover a form of well-being that is it not only survives contact with a solitude but it's just totally undiminished by solitude and if you can discover that even for moments at a time you can then enjoy the company of everyone you love without this feeling that your well-being is at its core predicated on being able to have them at any moment you you want or that or that is predicated on the totally forlorn hope that this circumstance is going to endure forever that no one will die that no one will leave you we know that's not in the cards and you know we need to find whatever form of well-being is possible given the fact that things are continually changing you know your thought experiment or not you mean it wasn't really a thought experiment but I would it made me think of something was think of all the people who are thrust into solitary confinement I mean tragically in this country it's it's an absolute epidemic and in the US prison system and for all of the realities of how inhumane that is especially for the length of time people fight find themselves in there do you think there's a subset of people who inadvertently stumble into mindfulness without being formally taught so that the analogy would be like if I threw sixteen-year-old Sam into a waiting room but I'd never shown him or forget a weight room into a basketball court you'd never seen basketball before there is a basketball there is a net and I said you know you're confined to this room for a year like at some point will you figure out picking up the ball bouncing it I wonder how hard it is to put that ball through that hoop over there shooting at all of those things I mean it seems unlikely right it seems like on some level you would have to at least be shown what to do and then even if you're left alone if you could come back to that lesson and so similarly you take a guy and let's say you put him in solitary confinement for a year he's had no exposure to mindfulness is there a chance he's gonna spontaneously figure out oh my god this is far less painful if I'm actually present in you know the sensations of my body versus the ruminations and thoughts that are gonna torment me or is that something that is just so counterintuitive to the ethos of who we are that no way like you know you're gonna have to have had some exposure to this to at least be able to be thrust in that environment it's definitely possible because it is just the way consciousness is if you're paying attention so it's there to be recognized in each moment but the odds are against anyone doing it I mean there are people who have spontaneously awakened to this

[01:43:55] I mean they're they're kind of famous you know adepts and certainly in the Eastern tradition er there are also the Western philosophers who have had intimations of this where jean-jacques Rousseau has a story about riding in a boat on a lake I think and and spontaneously falling into some very open and and non egocentric state of consciousness that we would recognize but the difference between having clear information and a clear map and not we're having an erroneous one it's just an enormous so I know I wouldn't have been I could have done it like you know

[01:44:31] I think about how counterintuitive how difficult it is to practice mindfulness to go through the practice yeah like I think if you'd put me in solitary confinement for a hundred years I would have never stumbled into that yeah fortunately I would have been confined to you know just been tortured also worse still is possible to be practicing mindfulness and to be on retreat and not recognize many of the things that you really do want to recognize about the nature of the mind because the way the mindful mindfulness has been taught to you is however subtly encouraging of a kind of goal seeking practice and in this Tamara I write about in in my book and talk about in in in my app it's possible to be practicing mindfulness in a way that is dualistic it's kind of Rama fine of the subject object perception and therefore the the goal of recognizing the selflessness of consciousness and being relieved of this the sense of you know ego at the center of it the sense that there's a meditator or a thinker of thoughts or an experience or of experience that that it can be posited as the ultimate goal of some incredibly laborious spiritual path that just has to be traversed by increments over years and that's it that's an error that's a mistake and that's just not true it's already true of consciousness that the ego is an illusion and that can be realized directly and the expectation that it can't be is in some basic sense self fulfilling for for most people so yeah you can be in the in the most auspicious circumstance having devoted a massive part of your life to just practicing mindfulness and still be in a kind of crucible of unnecessary seeking and suffering because you just you have a an erroneous understanding of what the path actually is I want there are a couple of sort of semantics I want to you've already alluded to a little but the the the relationship between

[01:46:50] Vipassana and mindfulness where does zou Chen fit into this and like if you were to try to draw a Venn diagram of these these these different concepts how would they overlap well so the pastina is the the name of the practice in tera vaada Buddhism the oldest tradition of Buddhism and this is the Buddhism of

[01:47:12] Thailand and Burma and sri lanka and the pasta as i said means insight and you're having insight into what are thought of as a fundament and the fundamental characteristics of all phenomenon and these are impermanence and selflessness and unsatisfactoriness it's often misleadingly translated as suffering rather than unsatisfactoriness so many people believe that the Buddha taught that life is suffering or that all experience contains some intrinsic suffering that's not quite the message it's it's that life is a circumstance where there is no unchanging fully satisfactory basis for one's happiness because everything is changing this by virtue of impermanence that the boat is always leaking right we're always bailing water we're always responding to some slow emergency really you know where our health is always put in question or there's always some new pain arise in the body because we're simply not moving right you always have to respond to something and our pleasures however hard-won are fleeting you know they're vanishing even in the act of acquiring them so there's no place to land that is secure and that's largely by virtue of the impermanence of sensory experience but the cell the selflessness component is separable from those two other characteristics and well I should say so that's that's the pasta the pasta is a practice whereby you would have insight into those three characteristics and mindfulness is the tool you use to have those insights mine the training and mindfulness is a training in a kind of awareness of experience which is non-judgmental nonreactive you're not seeking to maximize pleasure you're not trying to make pains go away you're just becoming interested in a very open and focused way on what just what the character of every experience is so if you're feeling Restless rather than try not to feel Restless you're becoming interested in an increasingly aware of the the actual characteristics moment a moment of restlessness how is it that you know you're Restless where is it what is it I mean this is we were talking about a pattern of energy in the body that you you can suddenly recognize as a rising totally on its own and changing based on its own dynamics and you are merely the witness of that change in state and so it is with any pleasant emotion or experience and you keep dropping back into merely witnessing and that is that is mindfulness when you can do it when you're when you're actually not trying to change anything you're not judging anything and you're not staying at the conceptual level oh you're not you're not thinking about experience your beer it's just experiencing experience more and more closely and so if you're if it's a matter of paying attention to sensations in the body you're not staying at the level where you you feel like oh I have my hands are sweaty right no you're actually you're feeling the temperature and the tingling and the pressure so closely that the concept of hands and sweat disappear right so you're just feeling the raw data of experience and these changes can be pleasant to me your sense of he even having a body can disappear while you're meditating and just it just resolves into a cloud of sensation so so chen is a Tibetan practice tradition which is explicitly non-dualistic and and what that means in this context is it goes after the selflessness of the mind very directly so there because the most of us start meditating where we are in our normal states of cognition with the sense that there's a there's a subject in the middle of experience there's a mind in the head and it is by definition separate from everything that it knows right so there's the subject that can be aware of sights and sounds and sensations and [Music] subject is also a thinker is he its producing it's in some sense the author of thoughts and it's me and I feel like

[01:51:52] I'm over here in my head behind my face you know almost where in my face is the kind of mask right I'm not identical to my face I'm behind my face and you're looking across space at me and your gaze has an implication for me because I can you know if I if I follow where you're looking I'm over here and not identical to my body right I'm in my body I'm a kind of passenger in my body I mean you and I I can say well you know my hand is

[01:52:20] I've got you know an injury to my hand and you and I can both look at my hand as a kind of object in space my hand is part of the world both of us yeah and you know obviously I care more about my hand then you do because it's my hand but if something's wrong with my hand I'm still over here up in my head behind my eyes some distance from the hand and

[01:52:40] I can imagine being without the hand right it could be no fail if I lost my hand in an accident well then I would have one less hand but I'd still be me up here in my head behind my eyes right that locus of knowing that sense of being located in the head as a self as a an ego is a starting point for everyone in meditation and you can do vApp asana from that starting point you can be taught the method of mindfulness meditation and you just begin to pay more and more attention to what it's like to be you and you can notice these three characteristics of impermanence and selflessness and unsatisfactoriness nepali is a nietzsche dukkha and anatta or niche hinata hyuga in that order and could start from wherever you are and who knows how long it will take you to have this insight a fundamental insight into the elusiveness of that starting point of being a subject in the head now with zou Chen you can't start until you've had that insight and so the path of Zosia entails becoming available to that insight in various ways it's usually a matter of actually forming a connection with a what's called a zouk shen master in the in the tibetan tradition as someone who can actually point this out to you in conversation and for most people meaning they can point out to you when you are falling to the illusion of ego meaning they can point out when you are defaulting back into that mode well know that that they can point out the intrinsic egolessness of consciousness in a way that you can recognize it and and then practice that right so cuz most people they start meditating they still feel like they're up in their heads paying attention you know it's that now I'm paying attention to the breath now I'm noticing the difference between being lost and thought and being mindful but it doesn't fundamentally cut through the sense that there is one who can be mindful right and [Music] you know you can have experiences where the distance the apparent distance between subject and object can collapse but they can come in a haphazard way where you you don't know how you had them and you don't know how you'll have them again right so you can come by virtue of paying closer and closer attention to sounds and sensations and things that are arising and you can suddenly feel like oh that we in that moment of hearing that bird there was no me and there was no bird that was just hearing that can collapse again and again and it did for me you know when I was spending time on retreat practicing the pasta but I always associated it with the intense concentration of retreat and it seemed unavailable to me in ordinary moments of consciousness you know off retreat you know I'm driving in traffic or you know working in my computer or whatever like there's no way I'm gonna touch that level of concentration you know I haven't been spending 14 hours a day meditating so this is a kind of a peak experience that isn't isn't available now well was ocean you discover that the reverse is true all the peak experiences are no more empty of self than ordinary waking consciousness is and you can recognize this about consciousness in any moment and it doesn't it doesn't actually require previous moments of building momentum a framing really counts for a lot here so I I spent a lot of time practicing with this one Burmese meditation master who puntito side out and the analogy he would often use is that progress in pop asana is like rubbing two sticks together to get fire the moment you stop the heat dissipates and you're back to zero right so it's like you'd have the sense if you'd be on retreat with him practicing for you know up to 20 hours a day and trying to make your mindfulness absolutely continuous so that's the the difference between sitting and walking meditation and every other moment I mean you're doing a ton of sitting and walking meditation it's like sixteen hours a day of that but every other moment when like you're going to meals or anything else you wake up and get out of bed in the morning every transitional moment getting a cup of tea you're trying to link every instant of conscious awareness together with mindfulness and whenever you would get distracted part of you would begin scouring that as a failure to build up enough momentum to get to the goal of the fundamental breakthrough that was on offer by that path so this framing this idea that you're rubbing two sticks together the moment you stop they're cooling off and you've made no progress right that's the opposite framing for zouk Jen the framing you need for zouk Jen is there's this something already true of consciousness you're not trying to produce this thing you're not trying to get rid of the ego you're not trying to change anything about what is you're trying to recognize a feature of consciousness that is already the case and it's actually nearer to you than you think it's not it's not a matter of going deep within and having some kind of breakthrough it's actually right on the surface of the most ordinary form of consciousness it doesn't require any pyrotechnic change in the in the contents of consciousness it's not you're not actually closer to it if you take acid and and all the colors begin to change or you feel a change in your energy such that you know you feel this kind of buzz of connectedness to all things as you know anyone who's taken acid can verify that's that's on offer but all of that's interesting all of that suit you know I'm not discounting the the power of those experiences but those experiences are no less empty of self than every state of consciousness means you said the precisely the state of consciousness that's compatible with reaching for a glass of water and drinking it without anything novel intruding you know there's no bliss there's no rapture there's no profound or spiritual change in state it's possible to recognize in that moment that there's no center to consciousness and so what's ocean is is the path of discovering that there's no center and then taking that insight as your only object of mindfulness so that what you're mindful of thereafter is that there's no Center to consciousness so whatever is appearing sights sounds sensations you are continually dropping the implied Center it's kind of a steep path because it's hard to start you can't you can't really start them everything you're doing before you have that insight and can notice it again on demand everything you're doing is by definition a preliminary practice to that because you need enough mindfulness to notice what is to be noticed and and to follow the instructions to start that path but it's you me certainly don't have to have spent years on retreat to start that path and so it's having good information as is certainly better than having misleading information there this practice as I said is it's challenging it's just not there's no two ways around it III think it's for some people it's probably as difficult as saying to someone who's 40 years old who's never exercised deliberately a day in their life okay it's time to start spending an hour a day in the gym and you're gonna be doing these new movements and they're gonna be very uncomfortable and for many people you know a few weeks or months into that exercise routine they're still not finding any great source of pleasure and and there are some of us who love exercising like we just get a again going back to the the lingo of States versus traits like the you know I worked out this morning before I saw you and I mean I was in a new gym for the first time and sometimes that is a little you're sort of like I don't know where all the equipment is or you know a lot but but regardless it's just the actual state of exercise to me is so pleasurable even if it didn't offer any traits that were advantageous outside of it of course the real reason we exercise is not for the hour that we're in the gym moving around these artificial pieces of iron it's because of the benefit that gives us both metabolically and structurally beyond the time we're exercising right for is it safe to say that for most people the experience of meditation doesn't produce a state that is necessarily as pleasurable as say the

[02:01:46] MDMA state was that you could describe and that really the the reason this ought to be considered by someone who is not meditating is more the traits that come outside of the act of meditating the act of the practice yes well so it's possible to have extremely pleasant states arise in meditation both ones that have a kind of ethical implications

[02:02:13] I love and kindness and ones that just are sort of the equivalent of you being on heroin right so it's not necessarily pointed in any auspicious or pro-social direction it's just you experiencing more pleasure than you've ever experienced but one of those experiences really can be the point because they're transitory when they're gone they really are gone I mean the demeaning analogy to drugs is not inaccurate like what's the point if it's just a matter of getting high and you're a no better person in the world as a result of having had that experience so it really is about having a fundamentally different relationship to experience in general all of the counter productive ways in which you grasp at the pleasant and push the unpleasant away I mean just said like I mean that is the this of a fairly Buddhist framing of it but I think it's it's appropriate basically it's about not suffering unnecessarily in the end right and then not broadcasting your suffering to the rest of humanity so can't be about having an experience that's extremely pleasant and become becoming more and more attached to that experience and so that's one of the things that's misleading and a potential downside of getting very good at so called concentration practices or absorption practices is that they don't have the power to give you a perspective that is a fundamental antidote to egocentricity and selfishness and even you know historically unethical instincts in other areas of your life and they really can be fundamentally no more interesting from a kind of a larger examined life perspective than a drug experience I mean to take some clear examples here they're they're they're been gurus who have behaved shockingly unethically in their lives and had you know the reputations ruined and just they just leave a wake of unhappy and and even destroyed people behind them who there was no doubt were meditative athletes and in many cases focused on concentration practices so I like if you had asked well what was it like to be these gurus when they were meditating certainly not all of them were frauds many of them were truly talented meditators but they were meditating in a way that was not it was a separate game they were playing right and again it was a game that was properly produced immense pleasure while they were doing it but it didn't fully under cut everything else about them that was going to be you know fairly monstrous in relationship to other human beings this is where framing or the the overall concept of what one is doing is pretty important because it's there are pathological states of pleasure they're even pathological states of spiritual pleasure and I think the suicide bomber before he detonates his bomb there in states of a kind of ecstasy I mean I have a religious ex back for what's about to happen which entails going to paradise and experiencing more pleasure than anyone can imagine and in almost every case that's sincere and deeply felt and these people are about to get whatever they want and they know the creator the universe is happy that they're gonna get it so that there's nothing about ecstasy per se that is good or even benign because it can be pointed in the wrong direction I think what was a missile that doesn't necessarily come with a guidance system yeah and I think what we're looking for to lead truly better lives across the board is something that is anchored to an ethics for lack of a better word where our spiritual or our contemplative tools are actually making us better people across the board and again there's some bright lines here that I think are useful to to draw I mean so for instance not lying is it as a major variable for me ethically it's just like like having formed a commitment to being honest in basically every situation that wasn't like a self-defense situation you mean I don't think you have to be honest to the person who's attacking you right or seems likely to attack you but to put dishonesty somewhere on the continuum of violence and only resort to it where things are broken down so much that you're just not dealing with another person as though they're irrational interlocutor that is massively simplifying of a person's life right now very few people have made that commitment but having made it when did you make that commitment I know you've spoken about this but what how old were you when you decided I was I was 18 I was freshman year in college I took a course taught by this great professor

[02:07:27] Ron Howard not to be confused with that Ron oh yeah no not not the former actor now director this course was just an examination of whether was ever ethical to lie virtually everyone goes into that course more or less not even knowing what their relationship to line is they haven't been sensitized to it as a significant variable in their lives in terms of you know maintaining their relationships or their reputations or yeah I lie sometimes and their white lies and you know sometimes it's just too awkward to tell the truth or and you don't know how often you do it but you know everybody does it and the world could be no other way and this course was just a machine for exposing the dysfunction of that and more or less it became as it was like a seminar where everyone was just kind of coming up with scenarios where it must be all right to lie I mean surely this is a white lie that is better told and the professor would shoot that down and most people left the course more or less certain that line was virtually always the wrong move for purely selfish reasons it was just like it was not creating the life you want and by not by campign committed to not not lying you were closing the door to all kinds of complexity and risk you know both interpersonally and reputationally that you absolutely want to close the door to them it's almost analogous to like texting while driving just decide not to text while driving you will not care about all those texts you don't have to worry about well I'll only text at intersections right war if I'm stuck in traffic but we're not going that fast or whatever yeah I can assure you that you will never really regret the texts you'd sent later when you when you finally arrived at your destination so how old were you when you met your wife your now wife 31 okay so you've had 13 years of this practice of not lying and now you meet the woman you're ultimately going to marry who presumably hasn't taken this course or made this commitment at some point does that become a discussion which is by the way I'm gonna be a little different than most guys that you've met in that you know if you ask me if you look good in that dress and I don't think you do I'm just going to say you don't right please don't interpret that as I'm an insensitive prick I just don't want to go down that like did you ever have that discussion that sort of prefaced or maybe your wife's the wrong example but like I mean I've been as you know waning this I'm thinking about all of the lies I tell no it what sort of you kind of stumble into it I mean you want up training the people around you to know what they're gonna get from you right and it's not not necessarily explicit it's just in that case yeah I didn't mean she it became very clear very quickly just what sort of importance I put on honesty and you know there there are a few hiccups in many relationships but the gain that people notice very very quickly which I don't think they would want to forfeit to smooth over any other possible awkwardness is they know you're never gonna lie to them right they know that you're being truthful and so like when you have said you know that you didn't like something in a spot where most other people would have just told some kind of white lie so it's not to have to communicate that then you're you're praised means that much more you know if you're a creative person who's often needs to get feedback from people you immediately discover this when I give a piece of writing to somebody and ask for feedback who do I value more the person who is just going to praise me because they think that's what I want to hear and because they they find it too awkward to deliver some bad news because they they know I've spent a lot of time right in this thing or do I want to hear from the person who is actually finding flaws in this thing I've written and well now because I'm going to them early well now it now has a chance to spare me the public embarrassment of broadcasting these flaws to all humanity clearly I value that the other reader more and once you see the alternative you realize you want the people who will be straight with you and then you meet me meet people who think they want feedback but they don't want feedback you can have a more or less grown-up relationship to the opinions of others the people who don't want feedback who just want to be told that what they did was fantastic well if they're surrounded by honest people they very very quickly feel the cramp of that right they just they want to be surrounded by liars and they'll curate there are connections as a result you won't ask that same person again if you're the sort of person who didn't want an honest opinion and pretended to ask for one is it possible for someone to let's pick an extreme example but could one go into public office and take that oath that I will never lie I mean is it is that is that compatible with politics for example is widely assumed that it's a deal-breaker right I think everything virtually everything is wrong with our politics is the result of the mismatch between interpersonal ethics of this sort and what works and what wouldn't work in the public sphere I think it should be compatible with politics I think dishonesty should exact a a massive reputational cost in politics but now we're in this strange you know mirror universe where the most dishonest person anyone has ever witnessed is the president of the country and suffering absolutely no reputational cost among those who love him for his dishonesty so

[02:13:39] I guess it's not a bug it's a feature in my view that is the most dysfunctional thing about the Trump phenomenon it's what it's done to the value of honesty in our public conversation about politics at least 1/2 of the electorate pointing out that he's lied yet again is completely ineffectual with the people who don't care that he's lied I mean they they just they just assume he's going to lie it's a very strange performance it's like not even about representing reality anymore it's not that the people who love Trump are reliably duped by him you know it's it's that they're not holding him to a standard of honesty at all right and his dishonesty however obvious is a different kind of performance it's almost like I mean there's been an analogy often drawn to professional wrestling it's a fake sport with fake violence the fact that it's fake is actually understood by basically everyone who enjoys it right it's not that it's not like they're taking in less you're five years old yeah time you're a teenager or whatever you sort of get that this is an act yeah they're still very athletic nothing noise away from this skill required to do oh yeah I mean ironically that what they're doing is more dangerous than MMA for the most part and they're getting a horrific injury sometimes but there's no illusion that these guys are just as tough as the people in the Octagon right it sounds like they're people who watch both or in or certainly aware of both and they clearly understand what reality is reality is what's going on in mixed martial arts right there's things that are honest at the level of the the language of violence and there are things that are pure fabrications they're their lies and something has happened in our conversation about facts in the political domain it's happened to some degree on the left for different reasons but yeah I didn't to come back to your question I think we're paying a massive price for not being able to tell when people are lying definitively like did not have a lie detector that forensic ly can be relied upon and you know analogous to you know like DNA evidence you know where you just know that someone's representing their state of knowledge erroneously and we're paying a massive price for the fact that so many millions of people don't actually care that there being life that's the bigger issue right I mean I think politicians have always lied I don't think that's what's new it's almost like a threshold has been crossed where it's so you go back to sort of Clinton's impeachment right I mean in the end I think the legal issue was less about whether he'd had an affair with Monica

[02:16:25] Lewinsky the bigger issue was that he lie under oath right many many ways that's what his impeachment came down to yeah it's quite clear he probably did right I mean we could get into the semantics have sexual relations but the I mean it's pretty clear he lied under oath but the point you're making is that now it's almost a feature like now it's almost

[02:16:46] I think it's gone beyond it that it's accepted and now it's almost like part of the theater but I think that is a uniquely trumpian phenomenon I don't know that anyone else will be able to play it quite that way I mean it is a it's a feature of politics that has been true in other countries for ever I mean it is a feature of authoritarian politics wait wait you mean Kim jong-un didn't really do that well in golf right yes several holes in one everal hope he doesn't defecate I heard yeah well yeah yeah in a democracy it should be harder to get away with with having one's lies exposed and it's got it when you look at what used to matter you know when you look at the fact that someone like Gary

[02:17:34] Hart his campaign where he said that he was faithful to his wife and encouraged journalists to keep a sharp eye on him and then was caught having an affair like that was the end right right there is nothing like that that's conceivable for Trump it doesn't matter how discordant his behavior is with his next utterance his opponents are keeping score relentlessly like his lies are being documented every day they're not thousands of them people are keeping score it doesn't matter with at least 40% of America so it might matter for another person for those forty percent it really is a kind of personality cult phenomenon where it's just free for

[02:18:20] Trump for whatever reason how he showed up what he represents he can get away with stuff that no one else can get away with and that is what is so dysfunctional about having him in that role from my point of view so you have two daughters right mm-hmm so we think so much about how do we prepare our kids for the world that's out there that we can only say one thing for certain about which is we don't know what it's gonna look like I mean I had this discussion with my daughter last night actually or two nights ago which was Olivia you're 10 years old today the only thing I can assure you of in eight years I have no idea what the world will look like yeah but there are a handful of traits that I think will help you in life and they might seem somewhat arbitrary and they might seem somewhat ridiculous or even unpleasant but the sooner you can figure out a way to put these traits in place the more well equipped you will be with whatever the future holds right so when I was 10 no one could have predicted that the internet was going to exist and that somehow that was going to have all of these implications right with respect to all the stuff we've been talking about today specifically with respect to choosing to live an examined life choosing to live a life where we are not constantly being lived by our thoughts how do you teach your daughters about what the future holds and I don't mean that in like a broad sense but I mean side from encouraging him to meditate and I'm sure it's some age kids can learn mindfulness meditation but how else do you try to influence your kids with respect to the lessons you've learned I mean they may never choose to go off on and you spent such a significant period of your life on retreats you've really devoted your entire life to this study if they choose not to do that you know they want to do something boring like go into medicine or whatever how will you still impart some of these lessons on them or will it be much more by osmosis than anything deliberate first kids can be taught to meditate and and actually my wife has done that work a lot his kids yeah she goes what age does she start like five six it's amazing I mean you can go very quickly you can go from just you know the first class which is just chaos to a room full of six-year-olds sitting in silence for 15 minutes so it's amazing it's like yeah and they get real benefit from it I mean they're not it's not quite the same as adults connecting with the practice but it's it can be pretty similar I mean they're they're becoming aware of their emotional lives in the way that in a way that kids often aren't do girls develop easier than boys at that age generally speaking I consider them separate species so yeah I mean they my my boys are nice boys are wild yeah yeah I don't

[02:21:32] I don't know how I could ever yeah yeah and I think boys have a harder time sitting still certainly earlier on so it's amazing to see kids connect with the practice because they definitely do in the end they just become aware of the the linkage between emotion and behavior or thought and emotion emotion and thought but on some level it just comes down to suffering and the end of suffering it's just like how much do you want to suffer people are suffering in reliable ways they spend time then explaining the nature of the suffering because yeah I would agree completely nobody wants to suffer I just think it takes many of us decades to even come to the realization of how much of our suffering is self-imposed yeah so is it is part of it just getting them to realize that sooner yeah and again to point out many of the things we've discussed here where it's like the power of framing right the patent the power of expectation so you know I'll often point out to my daughters even the youngest who's just turning five but for the for the most part the oldest is just turning ten the mismatch between her expectation of how something was gonna be and how it was right and it's usually a negative expectation she was worried about something happening they'll say if a doctor's visit or you know getting blood drawn or getting shot and the actual experience that was far less traumatic than she was worried that it was gonna be and to point out that all of the time spent suffering in anticipation of this negative thing was wasted right like there's a lesson to be learned here like the things she thought she was sure was gonna be awful turned out not to be so awful or not in some cases not awful at all right or even

[02:23:27] Net+ right because she she had the experience of overcoming a fear or actually she felt stronger as a result of that thing that just happened so like the expectation is so often not only a bad guide it's just it's no guide at all to what it's gonna happen and yet people suffer in advance over this thing that they're they're expecting to be negative even if even if it's going to be negative you can decide to suffer once or twice yeah right a quick kids can get lessons like that I think it's good to give them as early as they can get them a lot of it has to do with framing and just how one thinks about one's life but fulness for a kid can be at the first pass just more awareness over what they're feeling and thinking young kids can be sad and they don't know that they're sad or angry and they don't know that they're angry and just that level of awareness can be a major gain for a kid and then that's something to build on and then they as they get older then they can you know I think certainly is that once they're young teenagers can have a a more or less grown-up relationship to observing what's what's going on in their minds but I think about how much effort I put into worrying about whether my daughter is learning well enough the sort of standard metrics that we care about you know math and science and English and sports and all those things I feel like probably I'm not paying enough attention to those things as well especially for someone who has spent so much time suffering inside his own mind like I ought to know better right yeah there is there is no prison like the one between your ears yeah and yet yeah when you frame it that way boy it makes me think

[02:25:27] I really need to start investing a little bit more time in that that prep I want to be mindful your time so I kind of I know we both have to get somewhere this evening are you writing a book in him at the moment are you working or anything I'm the worst author a publisher can have at this point I keep pushing back my deadline I am supposed to be writing a book but I'm so busy podcasting and doing other things that what is the book about well I have actually have two books that I'm supposed to be right in one is just a digest of podcast conversations just you know because now

[02:25:59] I have so sort of like what Tim did we yeah I'm not quite sure what the format will be but something based on the podcast it's probably gonna be more like just updated transcripts of significant parts of the conversation but and then I have a book with a working title making sense which is just it was gonna be a kind of manifesto about intellectual honesty and how we have hard conversations about know all manner of topics whether it's race or gender or the opposition between science and religion or you know many of the topics

[02:26:33] I touch on my podcast we're paying a price for not being able to talk about the most consequential and taboo and dangerous and divisive things in a way that is conserving of good intentions and honesty and allows for compromise and allows for breakthroughs and changes of opinion and I'm it's like all the norms around talking about these things are askew so you just can't have a conversation about the differences between men and women say our men and women exactly the same no they're not what but what do we do it down that path generates ire like you can't imagine yeah and careers are lost over slight misstatements right and they're and they're people who say things that were ill-considered that they then subsequently apologised for they recognize that they all considered and yet the apology however heartfelt

[02:27:30] I'm however abject isn't sufficient to stop their career from being destroyed you had an example of this recently were you on your podcast where you talked about the she was a Dean at Claire McKenna yeah yeah Claremont McKenna called yeah well it is a more recent example which is even at a more amazing and its own way so like like Megyn

[02:27:51] Kelly's firing over her Halloween blackface comments right well so you know she obviously couldn't hear how the phrase blackface would land with many people it's easy to see that the way she spoke about it was a constituted a mistake it's pretty obvious it was not an expression of racism on her part right she's not saying african-americans haven't suffered a massive inequality in the past or she was just saying well you know if you're gonna dress up like Diana

[02:28:25] Ross why can't you put brown makeup on your face and essentially that was those weren't her words but that was the sentiment that's absolutely something we should be able to talk about yet she said the wrong thing and then clearly received a ton of pressure to apologize for it her apology I don't know if he saw her apology but her apology was that someone was joking on Twitter this is like on

[02:28:49] Twitter that said it was the closest thing you've ever seen to a hostage video - the newspaper right yes like just you got a hold up the newspaper is proof of life I didn't actually hear what she said or anything it was a by all signs it was this full an apology as as a person can muster it was complete if it didn't strike the right note for you well then I mean you have superhuman expectations for what someone should be able to muster in the context like that it did not seem in sincere at all right at least to my eye and yet still this was a a career wrecking event it seems and so now we're in a situation where people are calling for the destruction of other people and celebrating the effects of that when these people actually do lose their shows or suffer some massive penalty and yet I think it's true to say that most people who were calling for her to be fired would recognize that one her initial statement was not actually conveying her own racism who scoob's conveying her obliviousness to the significance of this phrase for other people but it was not conveying that she was somebody who wants to live in a society where there's where there's a lack of political equality right I mean that's there was zero evidence of that I don't think anyone even alleges that that's her view of the world but worse than that once she recognizes the mistake she's made no apology is sufficient right like so do we really want to live in a world where you miss speak on a fraught topic it is impossible to adequately apologize right you recognize that you know you use the word say right and then you writ then you get feedback that while people really find that offensive they're kids with mental disabilities you know and you like if you knew what it was like to be a parent of a kid who was suffering this you would recognize how offensive that term is and why would you ever use that term on a podcast right imagine it being impossible to apologize for that it's over for you right what's so interesting bringing it back to the prison stuff I remember when

[02:31:05] I spoke with Kat Hoch about this so Katherine Hoch is the woman that used to run this organization called 2phi ventures and now she's spinning up something that's gonna be even better actually to which i've suggested to her and and I don't think I'm unique in this a lot of people have suggested that this this idea ought not just be something that's sort of a non-profit like there is such a benefit to the volunteers to going into this experience that it almost needs to be sort of a corporate development program like people need to be paying to go and have this experience it's so profound right but it gets to this question of like can you be forget is there something for which you cannot be forgiven what is the crime what is the sin what is the moral defect for which there is no forgiveness and I don't know if you're familiar with any of this stuff she's she's spoken about but you know at some point she had to make a decision about whether or not people who were sexual predators would be permitted into the program hmm so if you'd rape somebody if you'd molested a child and you're now serving whatever term in prison could you be a part of this rehabilitative program and in the end she said yes I mean basically it really comes down to the degree of which a person person shows remorse and their willingness to change because the idea is like whether you choose to never forgive somebody and whether it's megyn kelly or this rapist it doesn't change the fact that something was said or something was done that is in some cases probably not really that ridiculous and in some cases is really tragic hmm but it's you have two choices as a society how you move forward from that yeah and it seems we're definitely caught in the place of an inability to reconcile the good that can come from moving on which means acknowledging mistakes that were made acknowledging remorse looking for ways to get better I mean we we really don't seem to like that that that that seems a bit too soft for people or so it's I don't know Savas right word but there's something about that process that people don't like yeah yeah and and in extreme cases they're forced to accept it I mean they're you know when one societies have just become completely riven by the sectarian violence of or political dysfunction of one kind or another then you need things like Truth and

[02:33:23] Reconciliation commissions in places like clean of South Africa or Rwanda where it's you know the then people who are guilty of objectively horrible things can get a pass essentially just by coming forward and telling the truth and apologizing yeah I think you know I actually I brought this up on my podcast not long ago I was thinking about this is this very problem in terms of like a an ethical event horizon I mean is there something so bad that you could do or say that no apology would be sufficient to to pull your reputation back out of that that singularity it is a kind of unrecoverable moral error and I don't think so I thought I think the the physics of an appropriate acceptable apology are that it be sincere and believable and that the measure of it being believable is that it has to be clear how you could have changed enough for it to be sincere so for an apology to be accepted you have to stand in relationship to that thing you did in the same place where the other people who are horrified by what you did stand and they have to be able to see how it is that you have come to stand where they are now in order to accept your apology so if that transformation isn't believable for some reason if there's no path by which you could have had this epiphany that contextualizes your prior bad behavior you know puts it in a box which you disavow well then it will seem it will seem insincere or opportunistic your sociopath is just trying to get out of prison and game the program and and those people exist there's no question that you know in an insincere apology for calculated reasons as you know that that's as old as we've been speaking to one another and that will continue for as long as people can get away with it so that's a genuine concern if you're talking about how to to operationalize these kinds of insights but I mean you just eat just again that the path out of that darkness has to be intelligible to people and I think this is what will stumble on this once we have breakthroughs in psychology and neuroscience that admit of real changes in people's emotional and ethical lives may they'll just take the narrow case if we ever understood psychopathy clearly enough that we could cure it right so you have someone who's from a very early age just torturing animals and and showing zero empathy for other people and they they grow up into the scary adult that one would predict and if we ever get to a place where there's a cure for that well then psychopathy would be will be viewed as a neurological condition it won't be a moral problem okay these are these are malfunctioning robots that need the new module and just imagine if we had that cure we'd be no more judgmental in how we applied it than we are when we cure any other disease I mean you're not thinking about when you're giving diabetics insulin you're not thinking well you you're lucky I'm giving you this insulin because you probably don't deserve it you will you're malfunctioning pancreas you're lucky that I'm so tolerant that

[02:36:49] I'm willing to give you this insulin there's zero culpability in having a bad pancreas if we actually understood the neurochemical neuroanatomical basis of even the worst behavior if it was discrete enough that it admitted of a of a cure we would sell we just got a we got to fix that problem I know that would be yeah and they hold out hope for that Samer is that sci-fi I mean you're a neuroscientist so you can you can speak to this with much more clarity or authority than that I could ever speak of it I hold that hope for it in certain specific cases yeah I mean we know it's true I mean we've already stumbled upon it in cases where you're talking about a brain tumor that is causing a problem but causing a problem which shows up as uncontrollable rage or pedophilia or I mean their cases were being that's likely the classic case is Charles

[02:37:46] Whitman who in 1964 killed 14 people at the University of Texas and he just had a glioblastoma pushing on his amygdala and the amazing thing is that you might know this story I've talked about it but I mean he suspected that he had something wrong with his brain and he he knew he was gonna be killed by the police and he recommended that they perform an autopsy to find out what was going on in his head and yeah he had a he had a tumor which was arguably totally sculpt Ettore and was just in precisely the place that you would think okay this he's got he can't control his impulses and he feeling you know uncontrollable rage and this tumor explains it

[02:38:29] I think there's virtually no one who hears the whole story who thinks Charles Whitman was evil he just seems profoundly unlucky and on some level a complete understanding of evil would reduce it to that same species of unluck that is an amazing thought it's hard for me to imagine because obviously the mass effects are the obvious ones right these engines versus much more diffuse neuro chemical processes we're gonna have dinner tonight so I know what we're gonna keep talking about man we got so much to keep going on yeah for folks who are listening to this on my podcast you might not know you as well as they ought to is Sam Harris org basically where they can find everything your podcast your blog your books all sorts of things yeah and as far as my meditation app it's just waking up calm but yeah both websites some of us like me are lucky enough to have got it for free because we were supporters of the podcast before it came out yeah yeah is it available for purchase now on both the Apple and on Android I think yeah androids not quite out yet no it's a tease out as of yesterday okay fantastic cuz I know I had a patient who went to search for it on Android a few weeks ago and it was coming soon no no we're born on both platforms okay well congratulations Sam it is I mean I just want to say I want to thank you personally for for the effect and the impact that your work has had on me

[02:40:00] I find myself like I said spending so much time thinking about how to help people delay the onset of diseases that kill them and in many ways you're doing the same thing but in in some ways a higher stakes arena which is how to prevent people from suffering so much which in some ways is just harder to measure we don't have the same stats on that right I can rattle off all the stats on the probability is that you're gonna get cancer by the time you're 70 and what's the likelihood you're gonna make it to 90 without a heart attack and ball I can rattle off all those things but we don't keep the same stats for how much we suffer and I I think of your work as among the most important things that have helped me and now by extension some of my patients who are willing to go down this path with me to reduce that burden of suffering nice eyes well glad to hear it thank you well thank you about making making so much time this afternoon yeah yeah it's a pleasure and congratulations on the podcast you are one of these few examples of somebody who goes from the conversation of you know I think maybe I want to start a podcast I should I should I start a podcast and then I turn around and three weeks later you have this amazing podcast that is more professionally produced than mine and people love so well you and your team deserve a lot of credit for that I know

[02:41:25] I've said this before but but it's always worth repeating I mean I think that you and Tim were probably among the two most vocal along with probably Patrick o Shaughnessy but I think you and Tim the most really because I honestly I was just so intimidated by the work I saw you and Tim doing I was looking well there's no goddamn way I can do that like that's that's just above my paygrade so I still think my podcast pales in comparison to yours and

[02:41:49] Tim's but I am happy to be in the arena and it it has turned out to be much more enjoyable than I would have ever predicted yeah and so I do regret having not done it two years sooner when you were harping on me and Tim harping on me but better late than never and it's an honor to have you as a guest on my little nice budding podcast well keep it up thanks man you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at
