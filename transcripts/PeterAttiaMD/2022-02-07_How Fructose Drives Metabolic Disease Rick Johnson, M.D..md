Rick Johnson, Professor of Nephrology at the University of Colorado and a previous guest on The Drive, returns for a follow-up about unique features of fructose metabolism, and how this system that aided the survival of human ancestors has become potentially hazardous based on our culture’s dietary norms. In this episode, Rick explains how the body can generate fructose from glucose and how circulating glucose and salt levels can activate this conversion. He discusses the decline in metabolic flexibility associated with aging, as well as how factors such as sugar intake or menopause-associated hormone changes can alter responses to sugar across a lifetime. In addition, Rick lays out strategies for combating the development of metabolic illness using dietary changes and pharmaceutical therapies, and he discusses the impact of fructose metabolism and uric acid on kidney function and blood pressure. He concludes with a discussion of vasopressin, a hormone that facilitates fructose’s effects on weight gain and insulin resistance.

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:10] hey rick great to see you again great to see you too peter um you know we had a lot of follow-up questions from our first podcast which actually was probably about two years ago so um in addition to kind of just the other topics that i wanted to follow up on um we sort of asked listeners you know hey we're gonna do another round two here what do you have so so so much of what we're gonna talk about today is a combination of things that i wanted to double click on coupled with that of what others did but i think a number of people have asked the question to you know hey can you explain again this whole why is it that fructose metabolism is kind of unique from a nutrient standpoint in terms of creating this transient intracellular energy deficit this is something that becomes very important and we get into sort of the metabolic effects of fructose absolutely so just to reiterate what you're saying all nutrients uh are there to produce energy you know so when when we eat any kind of food we're using it to generate energy or atp in our body and but there's a cost to producing energy and there you know and so some energy is used to digest foods and some energy is used to metabolize uh the foods it's the idea the old adage you have to spend money to make money so exactly you have to spend atp now you're going to get that atp back in spades if you just stay with the program that's absolutely true all right so let's talk now about fructose and and is is fructose unique in what you're about to describe well alcohol can also activate this process and so alcohol can cause rapid atp depletion as well but in terms of most nutrients you know fructose is pretty unique yes okay so how does that work yes so with fructose the very first enzyme in fructose metabolism is called fructokinase and this is going to become an important enzyme to remember it's nickname is keto hexokinase or khk but it turns out to be the the one of the key enzymes in fructose metabolism and it phosphorylates fructose it at the one position so it's fructose one phosphate that enzyme will literally phosphorylate the fructose as soon as it sees it and it doesn't have any negative feedback it just so if there if atp levels start to drop that's fine for the fructose metabolism that's what fructose metabolism is aimed at doing and um and so if you have a large concentration of fructose it's concentration dependent if the fructose concentration is very low you know there won't be as much atp depletion and it may actually go undetected if it's very a lot of fructose present the atp depletion will be quite severe so the the degree of atp depletion varies with the concentration of fructose and as we talked last time the fructose concentration relates to not just the amount of fructose but how rapidly it's absorbed so if you drink liquid fructose like a soft drink on an empty stomach that liquid fructose can get absorbed very quickly and and even more quickly for example with high fructose corn syrup probably i mean there's some debate on this but high fructose corn syrup the fructose and glucose are already separated so that it may be absorbed differently than sucrose where it's glucose and fructose bound together but they they're broken and they have to be degraded to the individual fructose and glucose in the gut before they're absorbed so anyway so so if you drink liquid fructose you get it will be absorbed very fast and and then the concentration will be higher when it hits the liver and delivers kind of the one of the key sites that drives this whole process so what happens is the when the fructose gets there the fructokinase phosphorylates it and the atp levels acutely fall but then there's a series of of reactions that try to help maintain the low atp state and that low atp state is maintained primarily by a drop in intracellular phosphate that accompanies this and that activates this enzyme system that removes uh the the breakdown of atp products it removes it so that the a uh that it the atp cannot be regenerated easily so the atp levels fall there's the accumulation of adp and amp and adesine monophosphate is is one of the key ones and then that is swept away so normally amp and adp get reformed to make more atp they're really important to make the atp but if they're if the amp is removed then it's hard to replenish the atp because you've removed a key building block for atp and that amp is removed by an enzyme called deaminase which turns out to be a very very important enzyme in this pathway and that can breaks down the amp stepwise until it produces uric acid which is the end product of purine metabolism and so atp is basically has purines in it the adenine and that gets broken down eventually to uric acid and then the uric acid inside the cell actually causes oxidative stress to the mitochondria and the mitochondria are also a really important in atp production and the oxidative stress causes uh affects the several ways first it um i don't know if you want to go into all the biochemistry or not no let's do it we're going to bring it back and summarize it but let's let's keep going deep so it inhibits an enzyme called econotase which is involved in the krebs cycle and it basically leads to citrate accumulation in the stimulation of fat production and it also blocks an enzyme called enol a hydratase sorry and that enzyme's involved in beta fatty acid oxidation so it blocks the ah the burning of fatty acids and so what happens is um it reduces the production of atp by blocking uh by and and shunts those the components to make fat and to block the burning of fat so what it's trying to do is it's trying to stimulate fat storage and a uric acid also inhibits this enzyme that's activated in starvation to help bring back it to raise energy levels called amp kinase amp-activated protein kinase or amp kinase and by inhibiting that it also blocks energy production so the whole thing is a brilliant i mean it's a brilliant system to set the energy levels down in a cell and it mimics the condition of starvation and that by by reducing the energy in the cell it triggers an alarm signal it's like a mayday and that is what leads to a survival response to try to gain you know makes the animal get hungry thirsty forage for food try to store fat try to store glycogen it it's like an alarm signal saying hey you're you're going to be in trouble and what we need to do is we need to store energy as a means to help you because winter's coming you know or you know you're going to be without food you're going to have to travel 2 000 miles and you know buy air by flying to a place and you're not going to be able to eat or anything when you're flying over that ocean you know and so uh it's a survival pathway all right so let's let's go back and summarize that because there's obviously a lot there that you you put out there so let's start from the beginning fructose enters a cell uh by the way is this typically a hepatocyte is this a liver cell that is doing the lion's share of this metabolism or is it an enterocyte a gut epithelial cell what type of cell is doing this type of metabolism typically okay so first off uh you know one step back fructose can be metabolized like glucose through some of the glucose enzymes so fructose can be metabolized by glucose enzymes but it prefers to be metabolized by fructokinase we would say it has a higher affinity and will preferentially be metabolized by fructokinase if the fructokinase is present normally fructokinase is present a little bit in the uh gut it's in the gut actually modest amounts actually fairly modest amount and it's also in the liver but it's also in the brain it's in the eyelets of the pancreas very important because that's where insulin and glucagon are produced it's also can be in the some of it is in the white fat uh it's pheromone is in the kidney and then it has the ability to be induced meaning that it's not normally present but it can be turned on and one place that can be turned on is whenever there is like injury tissue injury like a heart attack it can be turned on and produced in the heart during it following a heart attack or it can be produced in the kidney further or be activated further you know if you have kidney failure like from a covet infection so it can be induced in sites and it's probably trying to provide some quote survival mechanisms in these sites but what happens is it tends to be over activated and end up causing worse injury rather than protection from injury and this has been a common issue when when it's been studied in that it it was probably originally meant to be protective but when it's turned on big time and part of that is driven by our diet you know and so forth but it you know it can actually be injurious so its main sites are the liver you know the brain the eyelets the kidney and the intestine now where it causes the energy depletion seems to be in all those sites except the intestine and the intestine there's a tendency in during the metabolism to to use up well there's work done by dr joshua binowitz from princeton beautiful studies that has shown that the fructokinase in the gut probably at high concentrations you do get the energy depletion but when there's just small amounts of fructose it actually tends to to not cause the energy depletion and to actually convert the fructose more along the lines towards glucose like fructose can be converted to glucose and glucose can be converted to fructose and so it tends the intestine tends to be a shield that at low concentrations kind of just helps remove the fructose without it being a problem and this is one reason why fruits which have like four grams of fructose or vegetables that are have small amounts of fructose like two to five grams they actually are um protect they don't cause the energy depletion mainly because this intestinal fructokinase seems to inactivate small amounts but if you hit it with a large large dose of fructose the fructose gets through the intestine it probably causes atp injury to the intestine and we can talk about that because i've done some studies to show that it causes gut leak and that it can cause it may be responsible for anaphylaxis uh to certain foods for example food allergies so it's a good story to talk about that but but um but most of the fructose you know it gets ends up getting metabolized in the liver and the liver seems to be the primary place that drives the metabolic syndrome and obesity and diabetes and if we knock out fructokinase just in the liver we can protect animals from obesity and diabetes and high blood pressure so the liver is the king when it comes to metabolic syndrome the kidney is actually important for kidney disease and the brain is really important for diseases like alzheimer's and so forth that we can talk about but um but yeah fructose turns out to be have been meant to be this wonderful system for for survival but in our culture with the amount of sugar and foods that we are eating that that either provide sugar or can be turned into fructose uh it's it's this pathway has become hazardous so let me go back and make sure that folks are following along here rick so um as as you pointed out the the gut becomes the first place of contact right so you know you by definition we're pretty much all eating things through our mouth and so they're going to wind their way through the stomach into the duodenum and into the proximal part of what's called the jejunum you have these epithelial cells that line the gut and as you're saying at low doses of fructose so if you're you know eating a piece of fruit or some vegetables which you know have some amounts of fructose in them they can be absorbed there without creating that phenomenon you've described but when you override that system when you expose the gut to higher concentrations and presumably higher doses so there's really a dose concentration problem which we'll come back to it it basically manages to get through the gut without the gut doing the metabolism and then it's going to enter the portal system we didn't really explain that but the reason that it preferentially makes its way to the liver is that the venous system that drains the gut has a another very beautiful and unique to the body property almost unique to the body it occurs in one other place but um where the superior mesenteric vein inferior mesenteric vein join the splenic vlane vein these things become the portal vein and you now have a vein that becomes an inflowing conduit to the liver so now that's why the liver plays as you said such an important role in metabolism it has two incoming blood supplies the arterial supply which supplies its oxygen and its venous incoming supply which supplies these nutrients on first pass from the gut now they get into the liver and the first thing that happens is we need to phosphorylate fructose and by definition we're already in a high fructose state because we've already exceeded the gut's capacity to metabolize this and so now it's basically a free-for-all with unlimited fructose becoming fructose-1-phosphate and we're generating in the cell lots of adp so we need we start with atp which has three phosphates we rip off a phosphate to put it on our fructose in the number one carbon position that leaves us with adp adenosine diphosphate it's shy of one phosphate that that thing that reaction doesn't slow down adp further gives up a phosphate becoming amp adenosine monophosphate adp and amp are being shunted elsewhere in the further degradation of their adenosine component and that's being turned into uric acid so uric acid being the final breakdown product of these of adenosine and so you're doing two things which is you're taking away the base that you could rephosphorylate to repopulate atp you're running more and more fructose through this and if that weren't enough the uric acid goes on to be metabolized into other molecules that both increase the substrate for de novo lipogenesis in the form of citrate and also create other molecules that inhibit the process of beta oxidation which is the process by which we break down fatty acids to make atp do i have that right so far you're right on the money it's a fantastic uh review the the only difference the only thing i would correct is that when the uric acid is generated it actually doesn't further break down but rather i mean it does break down a little bit but the the way it works is it stimulates oxidative stress in the mitochondria and it does that by stimulating a specific enzyme called nadph oxidase which i hadn't mentioned and that enzyme produces oxidative stress and it actually translocates that enzyme to the mitochondria so the enzyme not only is activated but it's it's moves into the mitochondria that oxidative stress then inhibits different enzymes and that lead to fat synthesis and blocks of baby fatty acid oxidation so the uric acid uh accumulates in the cell and you can measure the uric acid and the levels go up in the cell and um and it's and it's the uric acid turning on these processes that seems to uh really drive this this whole mechanism one can view it um peter like there's two pathways for fructose metabolism one is the caloric pathway you know fructose gets metabolized to co2 and water in that sense the caloric pathway it's it's sort of similar to glucose but unlike glucose that it triggers another pathway in which the an atp degradation pathway and that is um not considered a caloric pathway it's not part of the calories but what it's uh but what it's doing is it's activating um metabolic processes that lead to the development of diabetes obesity um hypertension and all these things are driven by this side chain reaction so it's not the calories of fructose that are driving obesity it's not the calories from fructose it's the fact that fructose lowers the energy and keeps the energy levels low and this is due to this runaway renegade enzyme fructokinase that just takes all the atp it can i mean to phosphorylate the fructose as as its season yes so a couple things i would say there one is um going back to the why this is an amazingly engineered system in a food scarce environment because every one of those things that you said which is an enzyme that is by definition not telling the organism to stop eating it's not signaling that we have enough energy it's signaling the exact opposite which is the more of this you eat the more of this we want you to get and it's turning off your ability to oxidize fat and turning on your ability to store and make more fat out of the byproduct here those are really incredible valuable adaptations without which we wouldn't be having this discussion because we wouldn't exist exactly so it's like a very fundamental mechanism that developed in nature um uh you know it evolved it one could um it's like a process that is so key for survival that all animals use this pathway and what's interesting is that one of the breakthroughs was the discovery that it's not just the fructose we eat but that the body can make fructose and when the body makes enough fructose it can activate this pathway so though when we were originally studying this we said to ourselves okay you have it looks like it's fructose is the problem and so if we just go on a low fructose diet uh maybe this is how low carb diets work because low carb diets would be low fructose diets and we were originally thinking yeah we found this is the the pathway that's activated so let's just go on a low fructose diet i actually wrote a book the sugar fix where uh back in 2008 because i thought that was the solution just go on a low fructose diet but the problem is that the body can make fructose and and it turns out that the favorite way it makes glucose i'm sorry the favorite way it makes fructose is through high glucose levels and so high glucose like in you know the classic is diabetes is a high glucose state in diabetes it's been known for decades that there's the an enzyme that gets turned on in high glucose states called it's called the polyol pathway and that enzyme can convert glucose to sorbitol and sorbitol then gets converted to fructose by the way sorbitol is considered one of the artificial sugars so beware it actually gets turned into fructose in the body so glucose gets converted to sorbitol which converts converts to fructose and that occurs under high glucose conditions say more about what that means rick does that mean under high plasma glucose conditions so this was we always were thinking high plasma glucose conditions but then we thought to ourselves actually it's not the plasma that's so important it's what's going on in the liver that's so important so high glycogen conditions or high when glucose gets to the liver now remember that um when we eat carbs we're generating glucose and so uh you know if you eat you know broccoli you're going to generate some glucose because it's a vegetable that has carbohydrates in it but it doesn't produce a lot of glucose so the glucose concentrations in the liver and the blood don't go up with broccoli but if you eat bread or rice or potatoes chips cereals these are what we call high glycemic foods and which means that they re have a fair amount of uh starch that gets broken down to glucose in the gut uh so when you eat bread you actually generate a fair amount of glucose and if you have like a continuous glucose monitor or things like that you can actually see a rise in your blood glucose when you eat bread or rice or potatoes it will go up and it's also going up in your livers and do we know what the difference is in the portal vein so if you're wearing a continuous glucose monitor and it's showing before you eat your glucose is 90 milligrams per deciliter and after you eat it's 150 milligrams per deciliter do you have a sense of how high it is in the portal vein at that peak level you know we have not done those studies but it would be very very helpful to understand because there is this what we call first pass effect where food when it goes through the liver the liver uses up some of it before it gets into the blood so a lot of the glucose that enters the liver is quickly sequ sequestered in the liver cells and metabolized and some of it passes through so we the glucose in our blood is is like the tip of the iceberg you know there's the glucose levels in the liver are likely higher now the this enzyme that converts glucose to fructose is normally in when we're born it's it's very very little that's in the liver um and um and in fact but it but it gets induced over time and um and i would love to develop uh an assay for looking at peripheral blood for example to see you know if you've turned on your your aldos reductase is the name of the enzyme whether or not that enzyme is elevated in your liver or not because if it is bread is going to be much more fattening than if if you don't have that enzyme so and where would you where would you be measuring that rick do you think measuring that in the literally in the plasma would there be enough of it there or is this something that's particularly inducible in the liver well it's inducible in the liver but there you can measure so sorbitol is kind of a a good marker of the conversion of the activation of this pathway and and is it is this the enzyme that turns glucose into sorbitol or sorbitol into fructose yeah so the the rate limiting enzyme is the enzyme that converts glucose to sorbitol and that enzyme's called aldos reductase and uh it's normally low in the liver but it gets induced and it can be induced by high glucose it's induced by high uric acid so there's a positive feedback system because fructose is metabolized when fructose is metabolized you generate uric acid uric acid then goes back and tries to turn on the enzymes that can lead to more fructose metabolism what's the evidence for those two uh claims what's the evidence that glucose and uric acid both induce the enzyme that turns glucose into sorbitol is there human data for that or is that all in mice so the glucose can being con high glucose activating aldos reductase has been shown in humans as well as in animals as well as in cell culture and it's was the very basis for the original concerns about this pathway being important in diabetic complications and so this this has been known for 50 years the but the uric acid is a stimulus for aldos reductase was published by our group based on animal studies and cell culture studies but it was not based on human studies so it would have to be shown in humans but i i you know i believe it's very likely true based upon the animal data the cell culture data and at what levels of uric acid does it start to become clinically relevant meaning do you get enough um sorbitol production that it leads to meaningful amounts of fructose generated de novo you know it's a good question and the human most of our studies like when we do it um a high uric when we go from a normal uric acid to a high uric acid in a in a like a laboratory rat the levels of high versus low are different in humans but they seem to translate when we've done studies like in human cells versus rat cells um the correlation is beautiful so generally speaking i would say that a high uric acid the that levels of uric acid that might turn on this pathway or would probably be over seven milligrams per deciliter in a human and certainly that's what you see in metabolic syndrome what what's very common is um so in our in our studies when we gave glucose to animals you know originally i my theory was that uh that that would not cause obesity right because glucose will maintain the atp levels blah blah blah the fructose is activating this metabolic syndrome through dropping atp levels and so i did not think that glucose would really cause obesity um and and so when we gave it we found that the mice over time became very very fat and insulin resistant and and i was a little depressed but i was hoping that we would find that the glucose was being converted to fructose and when we looked in the livers we found that about you know maybe as much as 25 percent of the glucose was being converted to fructose and this helps me understand very nice rick just um i want to make sure we understand the conditions of which this experiments are being done are these animals being force-fed glucose and if so how much of a caloric surplus are they experiencing and what other macronutrients are factoring into this i mean are they literally just eating pure starch yeah so so the way we did this experiment was we gave glucose in the drinking water okay so it was like 10 glucose in the drinking water and we gave it to laboratory mice what strains uh i would have to look it up but um but um the the c57 i think it's called and it this this strains propensity for obesity is uh how how much compared to like the wild type behaves how here so the wild type mice the control mice they they get fat uh when you give them fructose in the water they get fat when you keep them glucose in the water it's pretty significant um and um so but it takes weeks to months uh and really to to see the effects of glucose or fructose to cause obesity it goes through a period of of time several months and what happens is initially when you put uh when you give glucose or fructose in the drinking water the animals like it so they drink a lot more water than they normally and they they're getting a fair amount of caloric intake from the water from the drinking water because it has sugar in it so what are the control animals drinking just um same access to the same chow but no glucose in the water right or we can do things like give artificial sugars we we can have done that like give splenda where they'll drink increased amounts of water similar to uh to glucose or fructose but but there's no they're getting an artificial sugar and what happens is that when an animal is getting calories in its water it will reduce how much food it eats and that's a normal process and it's true for sugar as well it's true for table sugar it's true for fructose and it's true for glucose but what happens is that over a period of a month or so suddenly they start eating more and more despite still drinking a lot so they they end up being in a high caloric state and that when we look at that it's because they they start developing leptin resistance and the leptin resistance um leptin is a hormone produced in the fat cells that um scent tells the brain that it's full so when when leptin levels go up they ten they ten say you know uh you you've eaten enough uh it's like a what they call a satiety signal it says okay you've eaten enough doesn't it work more in the reverse i mean isn't it really more that low levels of leptin tell you that you are sort of low in your fat stores but i mean in if you don't look at leptin receptor deficient animals i didn't realize that high leptin had a satiety component otherwise uh injections of leptin would curb appetite but i don't think they do in in normal mice but why does this not work in humans because people become when you become overweight you become resistant to leptin and the leptin resistance is at the hypothalamic level so people who are overweight almost always have very high leptin levels and the leptin is not signaling is not working and uh and we call this leptin resistance and it turns out that leptin resistance is what is how fructose causes animals to eat more because when you give animals fructose it takes like a month but eventually the animals become resistant to leptin then you can inject them with leptin and there's no they continue to eat so the way we test them is to actually inject them with leptin so we do those experiments so we normally animals are sensitive leptin and if you inject leptin the uh they'll reduce their intake if they're born with low leptin they're going to be hungry and they're going to eat more and if they become resistant to leptin they can have a high leptin level but they will not uh respond to it and so they'll eat more um and so so you diagnose leptin resistance based on the response to a leptin injection correct and we do that in all of our studies and then we also look for the evidence of left and resistance by studying the hypothalamus because there's a characteristic change that occurs that you can look for with leptin resistance it's good and so we we also test for that what is that change a stat it's i think stat 5 phosphorylation i'd have to look it up again but but but we do it um and so that helps determine if the animal is left in resistance and what's the mechanism of this rick what causes leptin resistance well it's not fully known but there's some evidence from some groups that it might be due to uric acid um and you can kind of induce a leptin resistance state uh by i think injecting uric acid in in the brains of animals there's a group from china uh that has done this experiment i um you know i i believe that that was what they they showed that it caused left and resistance but they definitely showed that it can cause inflammation in the hypothalamus and the inflammation the hypothalamus is thought to be the driver for leptin resistance so anyway so uh what what happens getting back to the experiment when we give glucose to animals initially they reduce their child intake over time they start increasing their child intake they become very fat they become insulin resistant they they develop all features of metabolic syndrome and when we look in their livers they're making fructose and they've turned on this enzyme this polyol pathway is high and so they are you know gaining weight and becoming fat related to fructose production and to prove that it was the fructose we gave glucose to animals that lack fructokinase these are genetically manipulated mice where we've removed the gene or knocked out the gene for fructokinase and so what happens is these animals cannot metabolize fructose through this atp depletion pathway and when we give them glucose they can drink the glucose they get a tiny bit of of they gain some weight and fat probably related to the effects of insulin but um because glucose stimulates insulin and insulin can decrease fat uh breakdown in the in the in the peripheral fat but what happens is these uh these animals do not uh develop insulin resistance they do not develop fatty liver they do not you know they're really protected from the metabolic syndrome and they and they gain much less weight and have less fat than a normal animal so it turns out that and just to be clear rick these are absolutely iso caloric these two animals yeah it's very close uh yeah it's it looks identical yeah it's super close i i i don't know if if each individual miles like can you do this and pair feed the animals so that you have a fructokinase knockout pair fed with a wild type and they're otherwise getting the same glucose in the water and the same chow and they're pear fed to match yeah well we do a lot of pear feeding studies in this case the the animals are drinking basically the same amount of glucose i mean i i think that it's uh you know within 5 or three percent uh difference i mean it was very very similar um and what's the difference in body weight or body fat at the end of this oh it's remarkable it's remarkable what percent is the difference i would have to go back to the study now we did it two different ways and we we did get slightly different results so when we gave just glucose alone the animals gained a little bit of weight they drank a lot of glucose and they still gained weight a little bit compared to a mouse that didn't get glucose uh even when the fructokinase was knocked out but it was uh probably you know significantly more weight gain in the uh than a mouse that got glucose i mean the amount a mouse that just gets glucose alone really gains weight a mouse that gets glucose in which they cannot metabolize fructose it's dramatically less but it's still a little bit more than normal so just again to make sure i understand this both animals are only getting glucose and they're getting it in liquid form and solid form though we could still child there's also right one animal has a functional fructokinase one does not now it's interesting that both animals presumably can make the same amount of fructose correct because you're not impairing the conversion of glucose to sorbitol to fructose you're just impairing in one animal the conversion of fructose to fructo one phosphate and therefore the metabolism of fructose that whole pathway we discussed at the outset yes that's correct so their fructose levels are still high in the fructokinase knockout it's just they can't metabolize it yes so are they experiencing fructose urea where is the excess fructose going in that animal yeah um but they do have fructose syria um uh so like the reason i'm where i'm going with this rig is i'm trying to understand from an energy balance perspective what accounts for this difference is it that the fructo kinase knockout is peeing out the excess energy and that explains the difference in weight or is there is the energy expenditure different in these animals and that explains the weight okay uh yes so what happens is uh when you block fructokinase animals regulate their weight regulate their caloric intake so as i mentioned if you give fructose and glucose to animals initially they reduce their chow so that they maintain the normal weight but after the leptin resistance kicks in they start eating more chow than they need and so they go into a positive energy balance where they're eating a lot more than they normally do and this is associated with weight gain when you give glucose to an animal that is a fructokinase knockout what happens is it continues to keep its ciao low so even though it's eating drinking a lot of glucose the the chow stays low so that the overall energy intake is only very so i misunderstood i thought these animals were iso caloric across the board but they're not the fructokinase knockout is eating less yes but they get the same exact amount of glucose the glucose they're drinking the same volumes of gluten right but they're eating different amounts of chow but they're eating exactly and the child the chow contains everything fat protein and glucose yes okay but then but we have done and in that experiment we did do an isochloric experiment too where we um compared mice that were that were getting glucose and eating child that was the same you know we did a lot of animals so we did we did parent we paired them up where the animals were actually eating the same total amount of calories and when you do that you still see a very dramatic difference in things like fatty liver and insulin resistance so and in fact we've done these studies so sorry just just make sure you understand you're saying when you do pair feed the animals so that you have fertile kinase knockouts and wild types and again i think the the whole liquid versus ciao thing complicates this experiment let's just keep it simple if you just are feeding them iso caloric amounts of food that contain glucose protein fat your hypothesis would be that the fructokinase knockouts would be protected from the negative effects of fructose both the fructose that they're eating directly and the fructose that they will make from glucose in the event that they do so so just to really simplify it what we've identified is that fructose stimulates obesity and metabolic syndrome and it does it through two major ways one way is by encouraging an animal to eat more and it basically stimulates hunger and stimulates food intake part of that is through the brain and part of that is through this leptin resistance which is also kind of a brain effect and so the animals eat more and they also drop their resting energy metabolism so they're both metabolizing less and they're eating more and that causes the weight gain and what's the relative contribution of those this is very important to me because look i think rick there are a lot of people out there who will argue vociferously that calorie for calorie they're all the same it doesn't matter if you're eating a calorie of glucose a calorie of fructose a calorie of fatty acid if if you can regulate the intake it it's it's it's all the same so so when you look at what you just said which is fructose ingestion can lead to weight gain through two mechanisms one it can drive you to eat more so on the intake side of the ledger it's causing you to eat more but it can also lower your energy expenditure and i assume that could be both deliberate and non-deliberate right it could reduce if that's true resting energy expenditure and it could presumably even reduce uh drive energetic drive which would be spontaneous energy expenditure what's the contribution of these no so actually that is still the first mechanism the first mechanism is it makes you gain weight by increasing energy intake and dropping energy metabolism and and so what happens is a lot of weight gain from sugar is because you are eating more and exercising less or moving having less rest yeah moving less less resting energy metabolism so can you quantify those two i want to get a sense yeah how much is the increase in energy how much is the increase in intake so so the way the way you would do this i think in animals would be because you're pair feeding them uh or b sorry because you're letting them eat ad libitum in this case you'd have to let them eat ad lib you could quantify the difference in energy intake and you could say does that difference explain the weight gain fully if it does then none of it has to do with the decline of energy expenditure if it doesn't you would see what the gap is right right let me explain that very good question so most weight gain from sugar is due to eating more okay and some weight gain is due to a decrease in energy metabolism and uh and if you do isocaloric diet so all the animals you know the controls and the sugar fed animals are eating the exact same amount weight gain is hard to sh there's there's basically minimal difference in weight gain in the short term like if you go first two months and so if you give sugar versus starch after two months uh in in in animals there's very little difference in weight gain there's a little bit of weight gain because of the decreased energy metabolism in the fructose group but it can be hard to show and the high fructose corn syrup industry loves this so they say hey the problem is people are eating too much but if you control for how much sugar you're eating [Music] and we do isochloric studies and we look at short-term studies there's no difference in weight gain and they publish this like in the annals of internal medicine and they say sugar's safe but they miss the point that the sugar is actually causing hunger and by by forcing an isochloric diet the people are hungry but they're not able to eat because they're not allowed to eat and so if you do a short term study like several weeks to months you can't show a difference in weight gain if you went longer like a year you probably would show a difference in weight gain because of the difference in energy metabolism yeah just to put some numbers to that right if if feeding somebody a high fructose isocaloric diet compared to a high glucose diet it if the high fructose group was driven to eat an extra 300 calories per day while simultaneously experiencing a reduction of energy expenditure of 25 calories per day the increase in the drive to eat 300 calories a day would be readily apparent again this is very back of the envelope math no no you're totally right but and and this is overly some simplifying things because it it doesn't work out to be quite this straightforward in math but by the numbers i gave every 12 days you could gain a pound on the intake side but it would take months to show a gain of a pound on the energy expenditure side you're you're absolutely right and the other problem is like in the industry they'll compare fructose to glucose but we know that glucose some of the glucose is being converted to fructose so it's really not a fair comparison right that's right so so the but there's another major mechanism and the other major mechanism is that you even if you pair feed animals so that they're eating the exact same amount yes there may not be a difference in weight gain because they're all eating the exact same number of calories and even though these guys are left in resistant they can't eat what they want to eat so presumably they're less happy yes they're less happy they're hungry they're like feeling they're on a diet right and uh but even when you control the exact same diet all the other metabolic effects of fructose are still going on they're still becoming insulin resistant they're still getting fatty liver they're still getting hypertension and and you can see this um beautifully uh you know in animals it's very easy but you can actually i've seen clinical evidence of this in people too and and um a great example and i may have told this story last time when we were on but uh we we were doing a pair feeding study of 40 sugar versus starch and so the animals were getting the exact same amount of food and pear feeding means you take a group of animals let's say you have 10 animals in this group and 10 animals in this group and they all get um they all get the same amount they have to eat the same amount of food each day and what that means is that the animal that eats the least amount of food all the other animals have to eat that least amount of food so if you have one guy who's not who's got a problem and isn't eating a lot all the animals are forced to do that so we were doing this study carlos roncall and our group was doing the study to to look at pear feeding and he did not know that one of the animals had cancer and that animal was eating hardly anything so we had a an experiment that went for four months in which all the animals are eating like hardly anything they're all eating the exact same food they are on a severe diet but one group was on a 40 sugar diet and the other was on a starch diet and every everything was equal they're eating the exact same amount at the end of the four months the sugar fed animals tended to be more tended to be a higher weight but it wasn't significant but it was from that resting metabolism from the fact that they had a lower energy metabolism and it looked like it would have been significant we'd gone a little bit longer how long did you go uh four months i believe it might have been yeah four months okay so just to put that in perspective and give a sense of magnitude four months in mice is about 10 of their life it's it's more it's about fifteen percent of their life so that's it yeah they they live two and a half years okay yeah yeah so so that's like 15 years in a human yeah okay so that that that would suggest by the way that at least in a calorie controlled state excess fructose does not alter energy expenditure in any clinically relevant manner if well i mean if if if after 15 years which is about effectively what that was in humans after 15 years there was no difference in weight between the groups despite one main lining fructose and one knot you would say at least in the context of low calorie intake which is what they were they didn't energy expenditure is not a driver of adiposity yeah i i think over decades it is i don't know that's one and a half yeah that's one and a half decades that's a long time i mean maybe half uh you know uh maybe as much as a half a pound a year to a you know i would say could be from this half pound to a pound perhaps it just depends on the individual but you're right it probably by its you know we can't completely separate it from the increased food intake that accompanies this in in people because we're not pair feeding but you might be right um so what were the other differences between what was it but the other thing that happened is these animals that got sugar every one of them became diabetic every one of them had severe fatty liver i mean it was a very dramatic difference from the starch fed animals so what we and um and and they had uh eyelet their the islets of the pancreas were showing changes of type 2 diabetes as well uh and and so i think um that you know that what we've shown and we've shown it multiple times is that there are many many effects that are independent of calories from fructose and it's due to this energy depletion pathway but one of this one of the consequences of this energy depletion is that it stimulates food intake and and and so part of obesity really is eating more and exercising or moving less i mean that really is true it's just that it's not so much behavioral driven it's not your fault it's you are activating biologic pathways in your body your it's a biology um and and you know certainly advertisement you know encourages you to go to movies and to be more sedentary there's lots of things that are pushing that and people are serving bigger plates of food but maybe they're serving bigger plates of food because they know that you're going to leave hungry if you don't have that extra food because you are becoming left in resistant and you're eating more as part of this problem so is it safe to say that neither of these animals were overweight at the end of this study but one of them became very skinny fat you know to use the term that we now describe for the lean metabolically unhealthy phenotype yes and we can see this and you're right these people exist uh out there that that are you know uh calorically restrict themselves but are still eating the wrong foods so so if you had done that study long enough rick which by the way it's an elegant study that you you you sort of did accidentally um it it would be interesting to see if there was a survival difference i think that uh this whole pathway is very important in aging and um well it's hard to imagine it's not so yeah it's like it's one of those studies where i feel like if you can devote the resources to to do the experiment for two and a half years and say look we're going to go after the holy grail outcome which is all cause mortality and again i like the way that these animals were calorically restricted right because it gets you away from the obesity is the problem i you see i've always felt that obesity is a passenger that comes along for the ride but it's the metabolic derangement that lies under obesity that's highly correlated with obesity but is is actually quite separate from obesity that that's the that's the root cause of our mortality and this would be an experimental way to demonstrate that um that that i think would be again not beyond the realm of of of doing right yeah no it would be i've actually proposed to do that study um but i'll i'll tell you some some things that really suggest that this is important in aging um the the first thing to talk about is that you know there have been studies done in fruit flies looking at the effects of sugar on aging and um you know it's sort of interesting the fruit fly actually you know is eating fruit uh i mean that's what they like and so they they are always on some fructose but they're not getting um highly concentrated fructose because the fruit also has lots of other things in it fiber and other things that they're probably getting you know and the flavonols and everything in there that some of them kind of neutralize some of the effects of sugar but if you give a fruit fly sucrose or table sugar which is really fructose and glucose together a liquid sucrose they'll love it and they actually have their studies showing that they will develop obesity believe it or not so you'll have obese insulin resistant flies and they die early and also when they die they die from complications related to uric acid production uh which is really interesting they develop equivalently uh kidney failure for their uh their equivalent of their kidney uh i don't know i'm gonna wait and see the mice data on that i i yeah yeah okay now i'm gonna move to the mice so um we were interested in whether or not uh mice that lacked uh fructose metabolism might live longer than normal mice and we happen to have some that we were keeping around they were on a normal mouse chow diet that is very low in fructose so these animals are eating almost no fructose it's like less than three percent of their chop so uh but we do know that animals make how much body how much glucose on their well you know so they get a they get a fair amount of starch uh and protein uh in the chow so they're they're actually uh they are getting a fair amount of carbohydrate so what what are the approximate macros of the three i would have to look it up i can't uh tell you at the moment but but but it's their standard chow which is basically but it's a very low sugar chow it's a low sugar chow and uh we took them out to like a little bit over two years and we found that they they had stayed lean compared to the control mice so they were they were more lean uh and you know when when an animal age develops kidneys was that statistically significantly lean yes and they also had um they were they they uh they tended to have normal blood pressure or lower blood pressure than the um then they control animals how do you measure blood pressure in the mice you put a cuff on their tail it's called a tail cuff and you can measure the systolic pressure what's a typical mouse blood pressure how low it's very similar to ours it's like 100 to 120 wow yeah um so and and so if they were statistically significantly leaner than the non-fructokinase wild types could you document how much less they were eating we did not actually measure that uh we did not actually measure that oh my god that's like the single most important piece of information you'd want yeah exactly in retrospect it was very important to know is to you know it's hard to do that over a two two year period it's a lot of laboratory time but anyway what was striking and i just bring this up is that the uh the normal mouse showed aging changes in the kidney and uh in all mice and rats and humans we all get aging changes in our kidney but the fructokinase knockout had no aging changes in their kidney it was very exciting and how much of that do you think was due to blood pressure differences versus were the blood was the blood pressure basically the same in these animals they were they were pretty normal you know so it was it tended to be a little bit lower in the in the fructo kinase knockout but we did do a study and showed that um if you give them salt the normal animals would show a much more rise in blood pressure than these animals but um than the fructo kinase knockout so there is a difference in response to salt which has also been reported with aging that people become more sensitive to the effects of salt with aging so but but baseline blood pressure was not really dead so what do you hypothesize was the difference between the kidney function in these two animals so i the the dramatic thing is that the fructokinase knockout were protected from aging associated changes to the kidney and so it suggests that endogenous fructose production is maybe more important than we think and that it could have a role in the aging process one of the things that we've uh how can we measure this rick how can we measure how can we quantify endogenous fructose production well there is a way it can be done there was recently a study that looked at labeling fructose and giving it to people and and and they were able to i'm trying to remember how they did it maybe it was giving a label glucose and measuring the label on the fructose but um there is a study that shows that when you give uh that maybe uh when you get like a soft drink you increase the production the production of fructose by threefold three to four fold over the amount of fructose that's in the soft drink no no compared to what a person normally makes so we're we're always making some fructose in our body we're always ripping off trying to figure like a quantify so i'll give you an example right if i have a patient with fatty liver disease right um i the first thing i do is restrict fructose and alcohol completely great so we stop we stop all alcohol and we drop fructose dramatically to typically five to ten grams per day which basically means vegetables and a handful of berries if they must have some fruit but it's basically a minimal fruit uh diet and no alcohol and that's step one so it's we don't start with caloric restriction we don't start manipulating other macros carbohydrate restricting or anything like that we just take alcohol out of the picture uh and basically get fructose out of the diet and that usually improves nafld in most people if it doesn't and by the way that may or may not accompany weight loss right so that's the interesting thing there is you don't have to lose a staggering amount of weight to reverse nafld under the conditions i just described now that said so true you often do lose weight with that intervention because generally the people who have acquired nafld uh are also in a state of positive energy balance so it is a little bit difficult to disentangle that and as i'm sure you're aware a number of studies david ludwig's group rob lustig miriam vos a number of people have looked at this and one of the challenges that all of these investigators have had is maintaining the weight of the fructose restricted group uh in other words that it's it's you almost have to force feed them extra glucose to try to keep their weight on par with the control group to disentangle this now i haven't looked at this literature in a year so it might be that there's a new study out there that has has has managed to overcome that obstacle which is to say they've managed to pair feed the humans such that you can maintain weight while uh reversing nafld are you aware of such studies in humans i think rob lustig did an isochloric fructose restriction and and did see an improvement in fatty liver but did he did the weight stay the same i think that there was still some weight loss but i'm not sure okay you know that the uh the observation that fructose could be a cause of fatty liver it was actually first reported by our group um way back when when non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was first being um you know recognized as an epidemic we became interested in the possibility that fructose could be playing a role and with manal abdul malik at the university of florida we did a study on patients and found that they were drinking large amounts of soft drinks that they had high uric acid levels and we even looked at liver biopsies and found an increased expression of fructokinase by what by what amount oh it was like three to four-fold uh increase and we ended up you know publishing that and then i started putting people on low fructose diets for fatty liver in addition to alcohol it really does work in fact one of the people in my lab had a son who was had developed fatty liver was skinny but had fatty liver it turned out he was drinking soft drinks almost every day i'm just cutting that out was enough um and that was one of the precipitants for me to write that first book uh was that you know the dramatic effects we could see in some people with with fructose restriction but now we know that it isn't just the fructose you drink it's the fructose you make oh yeah sorry so i i kind of got off track yeah and i apologize that's really where i wanted to go with that observation which was um do we know what the average american consumes in terms of fructose per day yeah so um first about 15 to 20 percent of the diet is from sugar and um and sugar is half fructose and half glucose so 10 of the giant high fructose so 10 of the diet 10 to 15 because we also are getting fruit fructose from fruits and other foods besides added sugars so um sugar in the diet can vary some people are eating as much as 25 of their diet is sugar um and so they're the and so people can be eating as much as 15 even 20 of their diet is fructose some but let's just do the math and say conservatively it's not hard to eat 100 grams of fructose a day 400 calories of fructose could represent 15 of your caloric intake absolutely correct okay so if you take the average american walking around eating let's just give a range 75 to 100 grams of fructose that's their exogenous consumption of fructose and that individual who we assume is a little bit insulin resistant maybe a little bit leptin resistant but not off the charts what would you expect their endogenous production to be how much are they adding to that till i would suspect a fair amount um i know you want a quantitative amount directionally are we talking 10 of that amount 50 of that about 100 of that amount like where are we what zip code yeah it would be a guess but i would say 25 to 50 of more from endogenous production and and there's and that's based on animal data based on our animal data now there's three major sources of fructose that we can make and we've only talked about one of them but the the first one is high glycemic carbs and so rice potatoes bread chips we think maybe a quarter of that can be turned into fructose and if and i think that that's playing a major role in metabolic syndrome so what what happens is when you're young and you don't have this polyol enzyme pathway activated eating things like potatoes and french fries may not cause so much weight gain you you may feel you're invincible but as this pathway gets activated and aldo's reductase starts being highly expressed in the liver then potatoes and bread may cause much more weight gain and so and we think it's because of this fructose conversion because we actually did another study at peter where we gave soft drinks a high fructose corn syrup to to animals and they got really fat and insulin resistant but if we blocked fructokinase we completely blocked the development of metabox syndrome so with soft drinks really was all fructose even though there's a lot of glucose in there we saw a little bit of weight gain with glucose alone but when we give high fructose corn syrup we it was pretty much all from the fructose that was causing them to gain weight and to get metabolic syndrome rick before we go to the other two sources of substrate for making fructose you mentioned almost in passing that when you're young you can tolerate lots of high glycemic foods i think anyone listening to this can relate to that or probably 90 of people can relate to that i know i certainly can um what is it about just aging that alters our sensitivity or vulnerability maybe as a more accurate word to glucose and and i'll throw another question throw another wrinkle at you because we've had a lot of questions about this from women what is it about menopause that for many women also seems to you know almost overnight or certainly within the span of about a year also alter the sensitivity or vulnerability that one has to glucose and by extension fructose yeah there's like three or four different reasons and so let me just go through the list real quick so the very first one is that when we're young we tend to have very healthy mitochondria and where we're a lot of kids are active and we keep the mitochondria healthy and the way that this fructose works is it has to cause oxidative stress for the mitochondria to activate these pathways but if you have really really powerful mitochondria you won't show these metabolic effects as easily because they're more resistant to the effects of fructose and you can still see this in super athletes they have fantastic mitochondria they many of them feel like they can drink a lot of sugar and that it they're immune and it's because they have really really healthy mitochondria tell me more about what that means tell me what does healthy mitochondria mean we talk about this but but give people a sense of what a healthy mitochondria does that an unhealthy one does not do and why is mitochondrial dysfunction viewed as one of the hallmarks of aging uh so so your mitochondria or your one of your major places where you make energy and in fact it's the high output energy producer and and so it's producing the atp that we need to drive everything we do and um over many years mitochondrial the mitochondria get less good at making the energy because of damage recurrent damage and it's thought that oxidative stress to the mitochondria can cause this damage and so when you're eating uh when you want to try to store fat mitochondrial oxidative stress is part of the requirement to store fat and fructose works to store fat by stimulating mitochondrial oxidative stress and initially that is a reversible very easily reversible mechanism the oxidative stress goes on it it's in inhibits these enzymes and it leads to fat production and and so forth so it's a it's a survival pathway right but what happens is um if you keep stimulating mitochondrial oxidative stress and it's been shown with fructose for example the mitochondria start to decrease and um and the mitochondrial change they become smaller and less efficient and what happens is the mitochondrial function starts to to to to reduce a number and and so you have less mitochondria and when that happens you can you make less atp and so you'll fee it's associated with feeling more fatigue more tired if you have lower atp levels in your muscle it's associated with muscle fatigue your natural gait will slow down as your mitochondrial function decreases and it's all associated with aging how do you quantify this in animals so if you if you were to take a four month old mouse versus a two and a half year old mouse and you did muscle biopsies obviously there's a quantitative assessment that you would do you would say per gram of muscle there's this many mitochondria versus this they're this big versus that big how are you assessing atp output and how are you quantifying the functionality on a per unit of mitochondria basis well first off you can measure you can measure the mitochondria themselves by looking at electron microscopy you can measure indirectly with a pcr technique looking at mitochondrial dna divided by nuclear dna you can measure atp levels in the tissues there's all kinds of ways to do it what we do know is that mitochondrial function tends to decrease as we get older there's a very good evidence that recurrent chronic oxidative stress to the mitochondria is involved in this we think that that fat storage is associated with mitochondrial oxidative stress so if you're continually stimulating these pathways with fructose that that may actually wear down the mitochondria we did do a study in newman's where we put people on a low fructose diet and showed that we could increase mitochondrial biogenesis in people uh within 30 days and and we had a very dramatic increase in mitochondrial production fasting is thought to increase mitochondria probably the same way and and actually even caloric restriction the the concept that caloric restriction can promote aging is probably through this pathway because if you promote or abrogate promote reduce aging uh by reducing mitochondrial oxidative stress so with when you think about this when you're eating whenever you're storing fat you are actually it seems to involve some mitochondrial oxidative stress and so if you eat less food you're going to have less oxidative stress to the mitochondria and you'll have less fat stores but what will happen is you will you'll live longer so in an animal they always want to have some extra fat on board because they're living in the wild they they don't know if they're going to be food there's going to be a food shortage suddenly or not so they want to try to maintain a little bit extra fat and so if you take animals and you put them on 70 percent of their normal caloric intake their fat stores are very minimal they have less oxidative stress to their mitochondria and they're going to live longer the mitochondria are going to stay healthier but if you take those animals and you put them in the wild and remember when they're in a in a lab they're being fed you know certain amount of food every day so so they're safe right you put them out in the wild now they have no fat stores and the first big crisis they you know suddenly kills half of them because they can't survive because they don't have enough energy stores so animals in the wild want to have a little bit of extra fat pregnancy it seems that we do too i mean the obesity paradox is hard to ignore that low levels of obesity actually seem protective absolutely so if you if you're have cancer or heart failure or any kind of chronic disease you'll actually live longer if your fat stores are like 20 if you have a bmi of like 27 that's going to do better than a bmi of 20 when you have a chronic illness and there's even even even 20 years 28 is going to do better than 24 as you age based on overall data which is again quite a paradox yes and it's it's because of that need to have a little bit of fat stores but but um yes so but anyway if we get back to the your original question which is you know why is it that when i'm young i can eat bread and there's no problem one is that our mitochondria are healthier at that point and and so we have what we call metabolic flexibility we can metabolize things very easily because we're you know everything's kind of young but over time sugar the more sugar we eat the more we get better at metabolizing it so normally in the beginning when we eat sugar the transporter for fructose in our gut is is expressed at low levels and and animals that get fructose when they're young tend not to absorb it as well but the more we get exposed to sugar the better we get at absorbing it we we turn on the enzymes and the transporters that allow us to absorb fructose more readily so if you've if you give an animal sugar for a month for example you'll up regulate all these pathways and then you can like maybe you can stop the sugar for one day and then if you give them a bolus of sugar they get a very dramatic uh activation of this switch and you know and the fallen energy is very dramatic compared to a normal animal that's not been exposed to sugar that gets a single dose and that's because we turn on these pathways so we turn on the ability to metabolize sugar so we did a study in children where we uh where we gave them a dose of fructose and we had lean children we had children that were obese and we had children that were obese that had biopsy proven fatty liver and when we gave them a dose of fructose the lean people only absorbed about 70 percent of the fructose and they metabolized it slowly and this was a liquid bolus yes how much and then we uh it was i think you always ask uh it's like one gram per kilogram body weight as i recall uh okay i would have to go back to the paper so but anyway they got it yeah they got a good dose of fructose and they absorbed it only partially then we looked at the kids that were obese and they absorbed much more fructose and they metabolized it a little bit faster but they still didn't absorb it all and then we gave the fructose to the kids that were had fatty liver and obesity and they absorbed 100 of it and they metabolized it faster and we think it's because of prior exposure to sugar and so forth but we it's possible there could be genetic differences but the bottom line is though the more in animals the more sugar you give them the more they'll absorb it and uh and we think that this carries over to people as well likewise and actually there's some there's other data in humans to support this so that's the second mechanism and the third mechanism is this polyol pathway also gets turned on over time and so what happened and and like by the time you have metabolic syndrome you probably have this enzyme turned on um because you're you're have a high uric acid and as i mentioned that that can can activate this pathway too so now you're you're able to convert glucose to fructose so let's say you're overweight now you you say okay i know it's sugar i'm going to cut out sugar i'm going to cut out the fructose and then you go hey i'm still gaining weight and it's probably because your your body is now making a lot of fructose and it's from those high glycemic carbs and that's like your number one food that that converts that is used to generate fructose and so uh and then uh uh those are your your main mechanisms that that make you more more resistant are are more sensitive to fructose over time um and what about menopause what effect do you think that is so estrogen um is uh increases uric acid excretion so young women tend to have very low uric acid levels lower uric acid compared to men but when you go through menopause and estrogen levels fall uric acids increase and suddenly post-menopausally women have the same suddenly develop obesity diabetes heart disease more like like males so premenopausal the estrogen is providing some protection you can certainly overwhelm it by eating a lot of sugar of course and and so forth but um but menopause i i believe it's related to this change in in uric acid and not anything to do with fructokinase or insulin or other hormones well the fructo fructose metabolism will be in upregulated by uric acid so when uric acid goes up not only does it turn on the poly all pathway but it actually up regulates fructokinase as well so um we've shown in animals that when you raise uric acid you raise fructokinase and you also amplify the effects of sugar and how direct is the relationship between uric acid um and aldost reductase uh it's pretty direct um meaning if you give a person allopurinol and you knock their uric acid from seven to four and make no other change do you reduce the conversion of glucose to sorbitol uh we have not actually done that experiment it's a great experiment peter let's get on let's get on it it's a good study okay yeah um before we leave this subject and go on to the next thing i want to talk about which is blood pressure kidney function i want to go back to something to kind of make this more practical for people right which is what what do people need to be wary of right i mean i think the other question that emerges from a discussion like this for many people is oh my god do i need to not eat any fructose right this means i can't have any fruit uh you know tomatoes have fructose in them by god i can't have tomatoes you know so so how do we provide some insight to people so that they can figure out how to adjust the dose of something that only is yeah it's something that it by the way is ubiquitous completely ubiquitous uh so if you want to go on a zero fructose diet boy you're gonna have a hard time yeah no it's not gonna work so how do how do people get a sense if they're consuming too much fructose okay so the very first thing i would recommend peter would be to really try not to drink uh to drink liquids that have a lot of sugar in it so immediately get rid of soft drinks and fruit juices i would drink minimal because there's a fair amount of fructose in that and it can kind of overwhelm the system sports drinks are sort of interesting some sports drinks are relatively low in fructose um and you know so maybe they're two to four percent fructose with four percent glucose or six percent glucose um it turns out that when you're exercising and let's explain to people what that means right so a six percent glucose drink means there is 60 grams of glucose per liter yeah so soft drinks are like 11 they have like 6 fructose and 5 glucose and that really is bad stuff soft drinks should i think they should be banned right so that's like a hundred and ten grams of total sugar per liter that's yeah it gives you a sense of how sweet that is huge huge amount teaspoons and teaspoons teaspoons so um so soft drinks are really bad sports drinks um were developed uh originally by bob cade and and and the invention of gatorade with the the fact that um that people who are exercising a lot are losing salt uh lots of salt in their sweat they're losing they're burning up glucose uh and some of them were getting hypoglycemic on the fields and and sports drinks were were really meant to help re replenish the electrolytes and to fix the glucose problem and um and and to provide glucose as fuel for the muscle during these heavy exercise spots because we often use a lot of glucose during exercise and so the original soft drinks were mainly excuse me the original sports drinks were glucose rich and had a lot of salt and and and water of course and um and then uh they there were some studies that showed that you could that muscle the the oxidation of glucose could be facilitated by having a little bit of fructose in the drink that the having a small amount of fructose actually accelerated glucose uptake um and it's working in the gut primarily and and actually your performance was increased by having small amounts of fructose like one to two percent maybe three percent fructose and um and the optimal glucose from sports drinks was found to be around five or six percent um now some sports drinks actually have more fructose in it because it tastes better and so that's a problem a little bit of a problem but it it you know if you're out there exercising if you do using it for what it's meant for which is a sport and you're really uh you know i think sports drinks for the most part are are fine but if you're drinking sports drinks in front of a tv watching uh you know a movie and uh you're drinking a lot of this stuff it probably is not good so um so but in getting back to other things i want to go back to the the uh juices um yes if if i take oranges and i squeeze them into you know i put my little juice squeezer and i ratchet it down and i just make concentrated orange juice what is the concentration of glucose and fructose in orange freshly squeezed orange juice it's pretty pretty significant it's probably about two-thirds of a soft drink if you made it with apple juice it's apple juice is so sweet it's equivalent to a soft drink and so you can get a lot of sugar with from juice unfortunately so the pediatric society a long time ago realized that juice has so much fructose that it was being associated with obesity in children so they made recommendations to limit fruit juice to like six ounces or less for uh adult i mean for older children in like four ounces or so for really small children and i think that that we should even limit it more and fruit juice is i think a real problem in in children because of all the sweetness of sugar that's in it now um natural fruits are different so natural fruits have like much less fructose because in an individual fruit when you make fruit juice it's like multiple fruits that are put in there so if you eat like a orange and it has like six grams of fructose um you know that so rick that that's news to me i didn't realize an orange would only have six grams of uh fructose that's that's surprisingly low i mean we're talking about a real orange here not like a little christmas orange right like a real orange would only have six grams of fructose i believe it's like six to eight grams i don't think it's over eight grams it's closer to six grams i believe an equal amount of glucose yeah it has some glucose in it too for sure um but i think there's about six grams of fructose in an orange so if that's the case really outside of someone maybe with nafld you'd have a hard time making the case to not eat an orange yeah i think that natural fruits are fine including like fake fruits like grapes i call grapes yeah there are certain fruits that have uh that are high in sugar um you know mangoes of figs oh my god they're very very enriched in fructose figs are probably something that we should try figs dates oh dates yes you know mangoes are high apples and pears plums they tend to be fairly high like around 910 grams i think oranges are around six grams bananas are fairly high glycemic and they have a fair amount of fructose but it's probably in the range of six to eight i think what we'll do in the show notes is we'll have our team pull together a table of yeah i have a great table typical sizes because i i this is actually used to me i would have guessed fruits would have a little bit more but it'll be good to know that yeah no it's it most fruits are between uh you know three grams and nine to ten grams max and most fruits are around four to six grams some fruits have much less sugar like kiwi like berries strawberries blueberries they're very healthy people should be encouraged to eat those and we actually did a study where we gave we gave people a low sugar diet where they was low in refined sugar low in high fructose corn syrup um and uh but we one group got of natural fruit and the other group we restricted that too so it was either a low fructose diet that was low fructose in all aspects the other was low sugar low fructose but you're allowed natural fruits so that actually was sort of a modest total fructose intake and when we did that we found equivalent improvement in metabolic syndrome and so the the presence of natural fruit did not block the ability of the of the low sugar diet to to reduce um or to improve metabolic syndrome so the takeaway here is don't drink it and don't consume added sugar and i think this is a difficult thing for people to um to differentiate right so added sugar is when a food has sucrose or high fructose corn syrup are typically the most common agents that are added and it's literally added to the food so if you have if you go out and get a jar of pasta sauce it they added sugar to it they yes that's not the sugar that you're seeing from the tomatoes that go into making that it's the deliberate addition of sucrose or high fructose corn syrup to make it taste sweeter and remember that the intestine does act as a shield for up to like five or four to six grams of fructose so if you eat four or five grams of fructose in a fruit the intestines going to protect you in addition the intestine you have fiber in a natural fruit and that slows the absorption so the concentration of fructose that gets to the liver is lower so there's less atp depletion now what about dry versus not dry so if you take um dried apples so if you if you if you take the equivalent of apple chips versus apples but you take equal amounts of the actual calories so it's just you know obviously one is a lot bigger because it's got more water and things in it what's the difference in how we metabolize that yeah the trouble with dried fruit is that it's still has all the fructose but a lot of the good things are are removed so that's the problem dried fruit is sort of like candy um it's so it's not just the loss of water that's problematic there right right things like vitamin c tends to be low in dried fruit and stuff so why is that i would i wouldn't i guess vitamin c is water-soluble is that why maybe that's it i always thought the issue was more that you lose the satiating benefit of the water like you can't it's hard to eat more than two apples in one sitting it's not hard to eat more than 10 apples worth of apple chips in one sitting so i really thought it was more more of just a regulation of volume of quantity i think it could be a mount as well as um it's probably the amount you're eating plus it's you know i certainly have read that dry that dried fruits do not contain as much of the good nutrients but you know we should probably check this before we um put it on your show um i this is something we should uh fact check we'll put it in the show notes we'll we'll have the show notes we'll assess that yeah because i i i'm not 100 certain about the vitamin c issue and i would hate to actually be quoted if i'm wrong on that but but it's been said peter that dried fruits dried fruits are thought to be primarily devoid of the good components that are in fruit and we know that there are many other good components in fruit besides fiber there's potassium and flavonols and there's a substance called epicatechin that's in a lot of fruit that actually can block some of the effects of fructose and other things like luteolin and mangosteen and some of these things also seem to block the effects of fructose so ostol and um and different flavonols so last question i have before we leave at least fructose from this standpoint is we talk about you know fructokinase knockouts in the lab i'm sure most people listening to this if they're like me are thinking two thoughts one how do i knock out my fructo kinase and maybe more interestingly how much polymorphism exists in the fructokinase gene in humans that might account for differences in fructose tolerance so while i don't think there are too many people born who have no fructokinase and therefore would seem completely immune to the effects of fructose i would have to believe that there are there's a distribution across which people exist and where they have higher versus lower natural either quantity or activity of this enzyme is that has that been documented well first off there is a condition called essential fructoseria and this is a hereditary condition in which you do not have fructokinase right so you pee all your fructose out yeah well you pee about 10 of the fructose you eat goes out through the urine and the rest is metabolized by the glucose enzymes because some of the glucose enzymes can metabolize fructose and to date no one has ever been reported with type 2 diabetes with this disease condition and no one has ever been reported to have obesity and um the the it seems that it's associated with normal lifespan or maybe even prolonged lifespan but but certainly with normal lifespan and um you know i'm i'm in connection with a small kindred you know of a family that has this this condition and interestingly they um they can eat all the sugar they want but they tend to prefer other kinds of foods they don't have a taste affinity for sugar they say that they do not prefer i mean they prefer salty foods they they tend to prefer salty foods to sugary foods okay so uh last question on that then is basically what is the hope for a pharmacologic agent that could block fructokinase as a treatment for obesity type 2 diabetes nafld it's a great question and first i disclosure uh i have a small company we're trying to develop fructokinase inhibitors uh for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and uh and other uh conditions associated with fructose but there are also several large pharma that are actively uh working on making fructokinase inhibitors and eli lilly for example is one that's actively trying to make fructokinase inhibitors um and so i think it's um it's a very exciting future if if we could develop these inhibitors and they they look like they hold great promise you know in animal studies they can block sugar-induced obesity and uh diabetes and fatty liver so uh there's a lot of promise with these wait so you these agents already exist because i always thought in animal studies you were doing it genetically no we have uh developed fructokinase inhibitors in our laboratory but uh there's also um eli lilly and pfizer have made uh fructokinase inhibitors and uh pfizer actually uh had a success in a phase two trial where it reduced fatty liver pretty significantly and improved insulin resistance um they have another drug that and so where is that pfizer drug today is it in phase three sadly um pfizer had recently stopped progressing with the uh with this he despite a positive phase two result i'm not sure what the reason was they have another drug they're developing for fatty liver that also had very positive results and it may be that they're they're focusing on one versus the other but i don't know exactly why pfizer stopped um developing their drug eli lilly is i believe doing phase one trials right now with theirs um so yeah the pfizer thing is kind of a mystery and you may not want to discuss it at this point since we don't really know no i love discussing stuff for which we don't know the answer i'm totally fine with that so so anyway so yeah pfizer just decided to not proceed and there was no toxicity that you were aware of in the phase two no and what was reported it looked very promising um okay so let's talk a little bit about blood pressure um it seems to play a very important role in really all of the major chronic diseases except for cancer and if there's a role in cancer i don't know what it is but who knows maybe somebody knows that but certainly when we come to neurodegenerative disease cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease and renal disease which are really the main pillars of of death hypertension seems to work against you so what is it about everything that we've spoken about that ties into hypertension yeah so high blood pressure which is sometimes called primary or essential hypertension is extraordinarily common in our country and throughout the world maybe one-third of adults have high blood pressure i mean it's huge percentage how is it defined today in most places of the world it's defined as a blood pressure greater than 140 over 90. 140 over 90 or higher but in this country uh recently it was redefined as being greater than 130 over 80. but i i think that for the majority of the world the definition is 140 over 90. and from a physiologic perspective where do you fit on that spectrum i mean you're the nephrologist so you take care of the organ that is arguably the most sensitive to blood pressure you could make a case that even more than the heart and the brain the kidney is the first place that damage shows up i don't know if you would agree with that but is that is that a true statement well well the there's actually three main sites where high blood pressure really causes problems and the first one is stroke it's the major cause of stroke it's also the major cause of heart failure and it's one of the two major causes of kidney disease and so those are the three main pressure related diseases pressure that related conditions where pressure is driving the higher the pressure the higher the risk for stroke heart failure and kidney disease the uh studies show that the greatest risk for stroke heart failure and kidney disease are when the blood pressure is like 170 160 to 180 systolic is kind of the turning point where when it's above that level there's really a dramatic increased risk for these conditions but it's been known for a long time that there's been that there's a tendency for a linear relationship between blood pressure and stroke and blood pressure and heart failure going all the way down to 120 over 80. so um so there are a lot of people that would like to say that you know 120 over 80 or 130 over 80 should be our cutoff because it's really a linear relationship but most uh you know studies done like around 1900 showed that less than five percent of the population had blood pressures of over 140 over 90 um and so uh based upon the the normal gaussian curve of the population back then uh probably about uh 140 or 90 should was the cutoff for what was thought to be high and i i'm a believer that 140 over 90 is a good mark for where we should be viewing hypertension as a condition that really should involve you know active management so rick does that imply that if somebody has a blood pressure of 135 over 85 which would be below the cut off that you're saying you would deem the time to act of 140 over 90. at 135 over 85 you could roll around at that blood pressure indefinitely without any damage to the kidney yes exactly so there's relatively minimal risk with a blood pressure 135 over 85. it it but however it's uh in epidemiology studies over many years you can show that you know 120 over 80 is superior to 135 over 85. and the reason i bring this up rick is is not to be a pain but it's to talk about how what our standards are really about right so yeah um i'm not a nephrologist but boy am i a freak when it comes to managing gfr in my patients why good for you but but why right because i want people to live to a hundred that's an aspiration right most people aren't going to but we make that the aspiration so if i'm talking to a 40 year old patient and their gfr is 85 well most people would say that's normal but i want that 40 year old not to live to 80 i want her to live to a hundred which means i can't treat her like a 40 year old i have to treat her like a 20 year old i have to time shift her back to say i need her kidneys to survive another 60 years so based on epidemiologic data i can't treat her as a 40 year old and her gfr of 87 is not good enough i want her gfr to be 107 because i need to know that at a hundred her gfr is still 40. so that's why i push back on this idea because i really want to understand this if we're in the business of trying to get people's kidneys to have a gfr above 40 at the age of 100 do we have to revise our standards on hypertension it's a wonderful comment that you make there and um i think that the that the answer is uh we would prefer blood pressure of 120 over 80. um but if it's 135 over 85 to put someone on a medication that they'll have to take for the next 60 years i'm not sure that that's the best way to go i i i think that um doing nutritional and exercise related maneuvers when you're 135 or 85 should be the way to go and um and it and we can fix it by diet by reducing salt and and picking healthier foods and exercising but when when the trouble with with um when you get to 140 over 90 if you can't lower your blood pressure by by dietary means i you really probably should go on an antihypertensive because it will provide protection over time but when your blood pressure is like 130 over 135 over 85 i don't i haven't seen any evidence that antihypertensives really provide long-term benefit to that group i do think that um dietary measures though make sense and i agree with your general idea that the idea that you know optimize health as best as we can and that's your best chance to maintain health for the longest you can and so i like that idea i think you're you're right on but i don't know if we should be doing interventions the trouble with defining blood pressure hypertension at a lower level is it implies that antihypertensive should be used uh at those lower levels and i don't think that the evidence is strong enough uh to to warrant that yeah but unfortunately the absence of evidence is not the evidence evidence of absence in other words correct the challenge we would have in doing that trial which by the way i'm not advocating for that i agree that i think most of the time a person's walking around at 135 over 85 you can fix it without medication but it's an important point here because it's the same problem that uh we face when we try to think about this through the lens of cardiovascular disease which is yes you know is a 30 year old with an apob of a hundred worse off than a 30 year old with an apob of 70. well there's no study that can answer that question because if you study a 30 year old for the next five years at apob of 70 versus hell 170 you cannot see a difference over that period of time you would have to study those people over their lifetimes now i believe there would wholeheartedly be a difference in that population unquestionably the 30 year old with the higher apob all things equal is going to have higher cardiovascular risk just as the epidemiology would suggest the person whose blood pressure is 135 over 85 relative to 120 over 80 is going to have lower renal function at the end of their life so just because we can't do this study because we can't right like if you right if you looked at comparing 135 to 85 to 120 over 80 over five years you're not going to see enough of a difference and um so it creates a bit of a problem with how you create guidelines yeah but it shouldn't confuse the underlying physiology right yeah i totally agree with you on the physiology part i think if the um if you use these more stringent definitions of hypertension then suddenly a very large number of adults have hypertension and and if you then say that they need treatment for it in terms of like an antihypertensive then you're talking about probably the majority of the population well or they need treatment via reduced insulin resistance yes i think that's the way that reduced reduced metabolic syndrome is the treatment yeah um for which you know frankly drugs aren't great at reducing metabolic syndrome um yeah well i'll i'll leave it at that but um let's now talk about very good points let's talk about the the role that fructose sodium play on hypertension through the lens of uric acid vasopressin fluid retention whatever the effectors are so blood pressure you know i've i've had a very long-standing interest in in the mechanisms driving high blood pressure and um and what we the way we kind of tracked it back and i'm going to kind of track it back in the way that we just our work kind of uncovered it the first issue was that you know it's known that salt is important in blood pressure and and that animals that are sensitive to high blood pressure you can make blood pressure a lot worse by giving them salt and studies you know from 1900 showed that if you took people with high blood pressure and you put them on a salt restriction that you can lower blood pressure so it's been known for a long time that salt is very important in blood pressure and this has led to restriction you know recommendations to restrict salt in people with high blood pressure not everybody is sensitive to salt and a lot of people when they're young can eat all the salt they want and and they don't seem to have so much of a problem but as we get older we become more and more sensitive to the effects of salt and blood pressure and you can show that as we get older that when you give salt blood pressure rises uh tends to rise more so the question is you know why is that and for years it was thought that the problem is that the kidneys and people with high blood pressure can't excrete salt as easily or as well as normal people and so that there was some defect in the kidney that could cause that to make a long story short we spent you know over a decade studying this and we discovered that people with high blood pressure have um inflammation in their kidneys they have low grade inflammation in their kidneys and it's due to a t cells and macrophages and they tend to be in the in the um main part of the kidney where we call the tubules and where the tubules are and uh and around the little blood vessels and we were able to prove that the inflammation was actually maintaining the kidney in a in a state where it could couldn't get rid of salt very well and it did this be by basically creating a reduced blood flow to the kidney so in people with high blood pressure they all have reduced blood flow to their kidney when you reduce the blood flow you you affect the ability of the kidney to excrete salt and you start to retain salt so when we when we discovered this and and others also followed followed this by noting this association it really emphasized the fact that high blood pressure is an inflammatory disease that is driven by inflammation but then the question is what was driving the inflammation and and what we found was that there are many things that can cause inflammation to the kidneys some things are you know there's there's there's drugs like um things that are very vasoconstrictive um you know cocaine for example and other things that constrict the renal arteries or or um the activation of the renin-angiotensin system for example can cause ischemia to the kidneys and bring in this inflammation but one thing that seems to drive it is a high uric acid and when we found this we we did some studies in in adolescence and we found that these adolescents were overweight many of them had a high uric acid and they were discovered to have high blood pressure uh and we did some studies and we found that when we raised uric acid in animals that they developed high blood pressure and so we thought maybe the uric acid could be plain a role in blood pressure in humans and so we did a study done by dan feig we published it in jama and what we did is we randomized adolescents with high blood pressure to drugs to lower uric acid or not and these were kids with newly discovered hypertension they'd never been on any kind of drug at all we put them on allopurinol which is a drug that can lower uric acid and we had a remarkable 90 of them normalized their blood pressure when they lowered their uric acid levels was this the study in i want to say 09 74 men who were placed on a high fructose diet and then given allopurinol or not or is that a different study that was a different study um so this was a study in adolescence okay they were like 14 or 15 year old kids they were randomized to alpine we had a big effect how much blood pressure reduction did you see in the allopurinol group the blood pressure completely normalized which was but what was the starting point oh so it was mainly done by ambulatory blood pressure but also clinic blood pressure uh it was like a five to eight i i would say five to eight millimeter drop so they didn't really have high blood pressure to begin with i mean they were high for teenagers but yeah they were all defined as having high blood pressure but if they dropped by eight millimeters right they they weren't like 160 over 90 or but they weren't even 140 right if they were how do we define a teenager's blood pressure their standards of what what is considered high i'd i'd have to go back to look exactly at what it was but that 2009 study where they were given 200 grams of fructose so a lot of fructose with and without allopurinol yes yeah there was uh five to ten there was i think it was seven millimeters of mercury systolic yeah five diastolically do we think that that's clinically significant so if those men yeah no that's clinically significant for sure i mean uh when when blood pressure goes up that much um that is definitely associated with increased cardiovascular events over time um and so um it's thought to be clinically significant when you can lower diastolic by more than like three millimeters and when you can lower your systolic by like more than four or five millimeters that's really thought to be what did they start at like how high were they and or maybe a better question is not what they started at it's how high did you induce the blood pressure in the group that was not getting allopurinol i mean their blood pressures all went up quite significantly i we we need to go back and look but they i know that uh 25 of them develop metabolic syndrome de novo and it was mainly because of the rise in blood pressure um but uh yeah we'd have to go back to look at the actual numbers um i've i've written about 800 papers it's uh so a lot of papers to remember all the specific details too and what do we think is the mechanism do we think it is all operating through the inflammation in the kidney and that's and where that's kind of the pressure sensing uh the most sensitive pressure sensing aspect of the body so no it's it's more complicated that than that so we know that the uh to have chronically elevated blood pressure you have to have this inflammation in the kidney and we know that that inflammation the kidney was associated with a high uric acid uh but uric acid is also raising blood pressure directly through effects on blood vessels for example it will inhibit nitric oxide it will stimulate oxidative stress as i we talked about and so the elevated blood pressure will inhibit nitric oxide synthase or the uric acid will uric acid will reduce endothelial nitric oxide through the inhibition of nos or what mechanism it does it through multiple mechanisms one is it removes nitric oxide directly by binding to it another is it decreases the uptake of of l-arginine which is used to make nitric oxide there's some in some models that seems to be blocking the endothelial nitric oxide synthase so it's working through multiple mechanisms have you looked at symmetric and asymmetric dimethyl arginine levels as well there's some association between these elevated levels and and decreased renal function and it's also believed to work through the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase yes we've not specifically looked at that and i've always wanted to look at that but we have not but anyway actually you know maybe we should start over on this um so high blood pressure is a very complicated problem and um we we think that it's initiated by uh by eating foods high in salt and foods um high in sugar and if you give sugar to animals blood pressure goes up acutely and if you give sugar or fructose to humans blood pressure goes up in within minutes how much like if you drink a coke how much does your blood pressure go up three to four millimeters okay with a 20 ounce coke but again so we've done it we've actually done it with a twenty push back on that for a second when i exercise my blood pressure goes up 40 millimeters of mercury and acutely that's not problematic because the it's it's i mean everything about exercise acutely is very dangerous right right blood pressure goes up inflammation goes up hepatic glucose goes up i mean everything met up if you if you analyzed a person physiologically in exercise heart rate variabilities down heart rates up blood pressure's up like you name a physiologic profile it got worse the question is what's the chronic effect of it right because chronically exercise reduces all of those things though acutely during the bout of exercise it makes them worse so i'm always a little bit worried when when we talk about hey you know you drink a coke and this happens acutely without understanding what it's doing chronically if that makes sense you're absolutely right so let's let's go back to sugar so sugar is linked epidemiologically with the development of hypertension there are studies out there where people have put uh people overweight people on low sugar diets and blood pressure comes down and uh there's evidence that the fructose component is what's driving the blood pressure response because acutely if you give fructose blood pressure goes up in a person if you give glucose it does acutely does not so fructose has something that does that raises blood pressure and our group discovered that when you give a salty diet to animals that they actually start producing fructose in their bodies so salt salty foods turned out to be another way to stimulate fructose production and when you give salt chronically to animals they get high blood pressure they get hypertrophy of their heart and they also develop metabolic syndrome they actually develop obesity insulin resistance and everything that's may seem surprising because we don't think of salt as driving obesity it's non-caloric but actually there's data in humans that high salt diet also increases the risk for obesity and insulin resistance besides hypertension but what's the mechanism so the mechanism is that salt increases when you eat salt the salt concentration in your blood goes up and when the salt concentration in your blood goes up it activates the polyol pathway it turns on this enzyme to make fructose which one the aldose reductase yes it turns on aldo's reductase and that helps convert glucose to fructose and so when you eat potato chips the the chips provide the the glucose and the salt provides stimulates the enzyme to convert the glucose to fructose so french fries are particularly fattening because they have the salt and the carbs that together really turn on this pathway to make fructose and how strong is the evidence for that in humans that that serum sodium concentration activates aldose reductase very high that that data is very strong the data in humans that that um increase serum osmolality activates this pathway or increased salt concentration in the blood can activate the aldo's reductase pathways is very strong in humans it's very strong in all organisms it's um the aldosterone is it's the osmolality so that's why elevated glucose could also do it because correct when you have someone who's if you have someone with type 2 diabetes and their glucose concentration is 140 milligrams per deciliter that's a huge osmolar load so even if they have normal salt concentration that could be activating it what what is it about osmolality that activates this enzyme in the promoter region of the enzyme there's an osmo sensitive region that gets activated it's it's a transcription factor called tony bp and that activates aldost reductase and that converts glucose to fructose and it's a major mechanism to that animals use when when they get dehydrated interestingly that dehydration or the increase in salt when you eat salty foods when you get thirsty you it means the salt concentration in your blood is high so those when you eat salt the salt concentration in your blood goes up you get thirsty and you start making fructose in your body from the glucose you've been eating and then that fructose appears to be enough that over time it's actually driving the metabolic syndrome as well as sugar so salt and and sugar both activate the pathway when we do it to animal when we give salt to animals it takes them a longer time to gain weight than sugar sugar is pretty quick but when you give salt it takes a few more months to the before the animals really get overweight and we've done epidemiologic studies in humans and when salt concentrate when salt intake is high it increases the risk for fatty liver and diabetes for example in japanese adults was this one study we did it increases the risk for blood pressure that's the salt concentration that's the greatest risk factor for high blood pressure it's not the amount of salt you eat it's the how how salty the food is and how much salt it goes up in your blood so for example if you drink a lot of water and so the salt concentration go doesn't go up then the effect of salt to raise blood pressure is blunted so we did a study in humans where we gave salty soup with or without water and if we gave enough water to prevent the salt concentration to go up we could prevent the rise in blood pressure so we know that this osmolal pathway this this that salt increases the salt concentration in the blood that activates this pathway and if we give salt to animals that cannot metabolize fructose what we find is they eat the same amount of salt they get that salt concentration goes up in their blood the same but they don't gain weight they don't become obese and they don't be and they don't become hypertensive so that this hypertension and the left ventricular hypertrophy and all these things that are happening are driven in a lot by the conversion of of glucose to fructose in the body from the salt and so the salt is work and sugar working together and then they are is it's what they're doing to actually uh drive the blood pressure response and obesity now interestingly when salt concentrations go up in the blood so does vasopressin and vasopressin is a hormone that's produced in the brain that helps to conserve water and so when you eat salt or if you eat sugar vasopressin levels go up in the in the blood and uh and the vasopressins released from the brain goes up in the blood and it helps can uh hold on to water and to try to help you conserve water but what we've recently found is that the vasopressin is also helping the fructose to dry fat and when fruit when you eat fructose or you eat salt you put the fructose that's produced from the salt stimulates vasopressin and the vasopressin actually binds to a specific receptor called the v1b receptor and that actually is important in driving obesity and and if you block that receptor you can block the effects of sugar to cause obesity metabolic syndrome and so forth so i'm sorry how how is that demonstrated so we took animals where we knocked out the different vasopressin receptors and there's a vasopressin receptor called 1b no one has known what the function of that receptor was i mean really it's it's been been a receptor that's had no known real known function and when we blocked that receptor we had a remarkable finding the animals could eat all the sugar they want or they could eat salt but they won't get obese because the obesity pathway is driven through that receptor exactly how the receptor works we we don't fully know but it stimulates a hormone called acth that stimulates cortisol steroids it also stimulates the eyelids to produce glucagon which is a kind of counters the effects of insulin and it also uh works to up regulate the fructose pathways in the liver where is this receptor found is it only central it's central but it's also in the adrenal gland and it's also in the eyelid and in obesity it seems to be expressed in the liver how does this effect compare to the fructokinase knockouts so if you took the fructokinase knockout mice and compared it to the mouse that has normal fructokinase but just has this receptor blocked and you give them the same amount of fructose glucose salt etc which one is more resistant to the obese phenotype so the fructokinase knockout tends not to want to eat sugar they tend not to not like fructose and so you have to kind of force them to eat the fructose but even if you force them to eat the fructose they'll never get fat uh the v1b receptor knockout like fructose they'll eat as a lot of sugar but they'll they won't get fat so what how are they disposing of their fructose they're totally regulating uh their caloric total caloric intake so although they eat more fructose they'll eat less chow so they maintain their energy balance right but how do they not turn into skinny fat mice who are lean because their overall energy balance is fine but they still get fatty liver disease and they still get diabetes they do not get that they don't they don't get fatty liver they don't get insulin resistant they stay normal but that's counterintuitive right because you'd think that the remember the energy restricted high fructose animals were still getting they were lean but they were inside fat right they had visceral fat they had liver fat they had hypertension so remember that the metabolic syndrome was driven through the energy depletion pathway and and and the uh the actual caloric pathway is still intact so what what's happening with this is that the um well what we know is that it's down regulating fructokinase this is probably the key key point the v1b receptor knockout have less they don't they don't have as much fructokinase they're turning it off they're reducing the amount uh normally when you eat sugar you um the fructokinase levels get higher and higher they get turned on by sugar and the v1b knockout doesn't do that so the fructokinase stays at a low level so my guess is that some of the fructose is being metabolized by other enzymes like glucose glucokinase and stuff but yeah they uh what happens is they eat normal amounts and they stay normal weight and they don't develop metabolic syndrome but they don't turn up their their fructokinase interesting yeah well rick this has been an amazing discussion we've we've gone uh we've managed to go a lot deeper into things that i think we already covered in some depth in the first podcast but i i've certainly learned a lot more in the interval of just two years um and i believe it or not think we got through many of the questions that people wanted to go deeper into so again thank you very much for uh for for providing your wisdom as always and uh uh we'll we'll make sure that the show notes are um littered with a lot of the references that we spoke about and in fact some of the things that we didn't know we'll make sure we track down yeah yeah some of the fact checking yeah thank you so much peter it's great seeing you i hope you can mention the book you know i will mention it in the uh i in the intro but hold it up again so we'll we'll we'll talk about that yeah so the book is called nature wants us to be fat and by the time this podcast comes out it will already be on bookshelves and i think the book which is the follow-up to the fat switch really goes into a lot of the stuff that we talked about today it goes into this next level of insight around uh fructose metabolism uric acid uh byproduct of that and the sequelae of that and do you mention also the vasopressin link and stuff in there as well yeah that's in the book excellent the one thing that we might want to point out it you know that's a very important finding is that when we studied the fructose survival pathway we found that the the the fat produced was not just being used as a caloric source but it was being used as a source for water because when fat is metabolized when it's oxidized it generates a ton of water yeah yeah it generates water so animals in the wild when they store fat they're actually storing it not just for calories but for water so the hibernating hibernating animals right yep well we'll use the fat as a source of water while they're hibernating and the fat tailed dwarf lemur and they must have very high vasopressin when they're hibernating yes well actually while they're storing fat vasopressin levels are high but vasopressin levels plummet during hibernation so that allows seems to allow them to burn the fat well that's interesting that does that mean that a hibernating bear is basically peeing itself constantly well they they uh are not generating that much they they are making some urine but their bladders stay permeable and so they reabsorb some of their urine but i don't think they're making large amounts of urine it's probably because of the low metabolism because they drop their temperature and their body metabolism so they're generating less urine got it but their vasopressin levels typically are turned off during hibernation and animals in the desert often have fat like in like in their tails or like the camel has a hump because they don't want the fat on their body because that would increase the insulation and increase the body temperature but they want to use the fat as a source of water and they uh live in these environments they do have very high vasopressin levels and what we big breakthrough was to realize that vasopressin's not just holding onto water by reducing the excretion the volume of urine but it's also holding onto water by stimulating fat and the way it stimulates fat is through this v1b receptor and we know as this v1b receptor increases cortisol and cortisol of course high cortisol levels can lead to cushing's syndrome where you develop kind of metabolic syndrome so we think that's part of it and it also stimulates glucagon which raises glucose and kind of counter some of the effects of insulin so it acts like it kind of creates an insulin resistant state but also because the fructokinase in the liver seems to go increase in the setting where the v1b receptor is activated and that may help produce more energy depletion by increasing the enzyme so that it can really metabolize the fructose as fast as it can so i think that that's the mechanism and and animals that have the v1b receptor knocked out like sugar they like salt but they they cannot metabolize the fructose very well and they they seem to be protected from uh obesity rick congrats on the on the upcoming book and thank you again for all your insights today thank you peter it was great being on
