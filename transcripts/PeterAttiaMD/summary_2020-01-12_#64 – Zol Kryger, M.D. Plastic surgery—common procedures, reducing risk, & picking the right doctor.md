## Description

Full title: #64 – Zol Kryger, M.D.: Navigating the sometimes shady world of plastic surgery—understanding potential complications of common procedures and how to reduce your risk by choosing the right doctor and asking the right questions

Original release date: 7/29/19

In this episode, board certified plastic surgeon, Zol Kryger, enlightens us about the frighteningly loose laws regulating the industry of plastic surgery, paving the way for a majority of cosmetic procedures being performed by doctors that are not board certified plastic surgeons. We talk about some of the very serious complications that can occur even in “minimally invasive” procedures, where the incidence rate is only increased by the flood of non-certified doctors who want to offer these procedures to augment their income. Fortunately, Zol provides listeners with a very specific list of important questions to ask a surgeon when considering any of the many cosmetic procedures available. We then go into the specifics of the most common procedures and the risk of complications for each of them, including breast augmentation, tummy tucks, liposuction, Brazilian butt lifts, botox and fillers, facial peels and lasers, and more. By the end of this episode, you’ll have a really clear understanding of what these risks are and how you can go about reducing those risks by choosing the right physician.

We discuss:
-Why Zol chose plastic surgery [7:30];
-The shockingly high percentage of plastic surgery being done by non-board certified doctors, and the laws that allow it to happen [11:20];
-10 Questions to Ask Your Cosmetic Surgeon (PDF Download) [21:00];
-Complications: Why you must ask your doctor about potential complications and how they would deal with them [24:20];

-Breast augmentation: What you need to know—types of implants, complication rates, and Zol’s summary of the safest and most effective way to do it [39:10];
-Breast reconstruction following a mastectomy [1:06:30];
-Tummy tuck: how it’s done, biggest risks involved, scarring, and how it can address hernias and diastasis [1:13:00];
-Liposuction: How it works, the potential complications and risks involved, and the importance of choosing the right doctor in the “wild west” of liposuction [1:26:45];
-Butt lifts: Rising popularity, major risks, the frighteningly loose laws regulating the industry, and how the butt lift industry is eerily similar to the subprime mortgage crisis [1:37:00];
-What is it about plastic surgery (and not other segments of medicine) that compels (and allows for) untrained doctors to offer these procedures? [1:49:45];
-Peter asks Zol if he ever feels emotionally conflicted working in an industry that sometimes can feed off the vanity and insecurity of people [1:56:25];

The conversation focuses heavily on common procedures like breast augmentation, liposuction, and Brazilian butt lifts, while emphasizing the importance of proper training and certification. A key revelation is that 90-95% of plastic surgery procedures are performed by non-board-certified plastic surgeons [00:14:00].

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Capsular contracture occurs in 2-8% of breast augmentation cases [01:41:46]
- Brazilian Butt Lift fatality risk is approximately 1 in 1,000 [01:41:46]
- 80-90% of liposuction procedures are performed by non-plastic surgeons [01:27:40]
- Textured implants have 70x higher bacterial adherence than smooth implants [01:50:34]

Context-specific Recommendations:
- Choose smooth over textured implants for breast augmentation [00:54:29]
- Consider under-muscle placement for breast implants [01:05:19]
- Avoid large-volume liposuction (>5 liters) due to increased risks [01:36:05]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Lidocaine with epinephrine used in liposuction [01:33:48]
- Peak levels of these substances occur 8-12 hours post-procedure [01:33:48]

"A surgeon knows how to take care of any complication they create" [01:01:10]

"If something has no risk, no recovery, no downtime, low cost, it has no result" [02:07:37]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific protocols for preventing capsular contracture?
2. How has the development of new imaging technologies impacted surgical safety?
3. What are the latest developments in non-invasive alternatives to traditional plastic surgery?
