Paul Conti, a returning guest on The Drive, is a practicing psychiatrist and recent author of Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic: How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It, in which he offers valuable insights on healing from trauma. In this episode, Paul explains how his personal experience with trauma and his many years seeing patients have shaped his understanding of trauma’s impact on the brain, its common patterns and manifestations, and how often people don't recognize the implications of trauma in their own life. He discusses major challenges in recognizing trauma, including the lack of biomarkers in psychiatry and psychology, as well as the misguidance of the mental health system in targeting symptoms as opposed to root problems. He talks about shame as the biggest impediment to healing from trauma and offers solutions to how, as a society, we can start to change the stigma of mental health and allow more people to receive help. Finally, he concludes with a discussion about the potential role of psychedelics like psilocybin and MDMA in treating trauma.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast featuring Dr. Paul Conti discussing trauma and shame:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode explores trauma, its widespread impact, and how shame prevents people from seeking help and healing. Dr. Conti, a psychiatrist, discusses how trauma changes brain function, creates reflexive shame, and manifests in various ways including addiction, depression, and anxiety. The conversation emphasizes how current medical systems often fail to address trauma's root causes, instead focusing on treating symptoms.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Trauma changes gene expression and can be passed down to future generations [01:59:09]
- Neurons that fire together wire together, explaining why trauma patterns persist [01:41:54]
- The U.S. has surpassed 100,000 overdose deaths in 12 months, indicating a trauma epidemic [02:04:14]
- Trauma affects brain function and creates reflexive shame responses [01:39:50]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Acknowledge and understand your trauma rather than hiding from it [01:41:54]
- Seek professional help when needed, despite shame [01:27:04]
- Recognize that healing takes time and isn't linear [01:41:54]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For addiction: Look at underlying trauma rather than just the addiction [02:14:08]
- For depression/anxiety: Examine potential trauma roots [01:39:50]

**4. Notable Quotes**:
"Trauma is anything that pushes our coping skills to and beyond their limits" [01:35:34]

"The antidote to shame is understanding" [01:44:30]

**5. References & Resources**:
- Book: "Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic" by Paul Conti [02:23:12]
- NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) mentioned as resource [02:23:34]
- The Bridge to Recovery (residential trauma facility) referenced [01:48:44]

**6. Follow-up Questions**:
1. How can we better screen for emotional trauma in routine medical care?
2. What role might technology play in trauma treatment?
3. How can schools implement trauma-informed education effectively?

Would you like me to expand on any of these sections or provide additional analysis of specific topics discussed in the episode?

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA Paul amazing to be back here in person with you it's uh thank you it's been way too long yes uh and the only thing I miss well not the only thing but one of the things I miss the most about going to New York frequently was that we got to see each other constantly and now that we don't really travel that much right it's mostly phone calls but we get to spend so much time together and I do miss that too and it's just really wonderful to see you I so appreciate you having me here and spending time with you and family it's wonderful well I excited to talk about your book of course um but I think even though a lot of people have heard you on the podcast before because we did we sat down probably three years ago um I'd probably take the Assumption here that a lot of people are also coming to you and hearing about you for the first time so let's tell people a little bit about who you are what's your day job what uh what is it you do sure sure I'm trained as a psychiatrist and a big part of my day job is being a clinical psychiatrist I also do some Consulting work along the lines of understanding brain function and and how uh brain function can impact

[00:01:22] Us in personal or professional settings but by and large my work is really grounded in the clinical and I do have a clinic about 15 really great people I work side by side with and trying to meet the needs of people who bring us whatever mental health question there may be which sometimes is clinical care and sometimes is just trying to understand themselves and the world around them better and when is it in your journey of medical school and prior that you sort of had this inkling that you were interested in mental health yeah I think around the time in the clinical rotation part of medical school probably into the last year when I realized that you could like really be a doctor and and like understand medical things and how they impact people and and really kind of be grounded in that aspect of of like practicing medicine but also trying to understand people's experiences of life right like what do people think and feel as they're going through their day and that you could combine these two things and then be grounded to to like all the things one learns about life just going through it and and and really help people in that way and and that just had such tremendous appeal as a sort of um widely encompassing way of of approaching trying to be of you know trying to be of help now you of course didn't come to medical school in a typical way you were not a Premed you didn't you know you had been out and working for four years or so before medical school if not more um so what is it that uh what were you doing first of all before you made this decision to go to medical school I worked for a consulting firm uh in New

[00:03:01] York and and really enjoyed a lot of aspects of the work the business and the financial aspects of it um but there was just something I kind of wanted more you know I wanted to know more and learn more and and be more directly involved with people and it was kind of a nebulous sort of theoretical set of thoughts but you know it led to medical school to try and learn more and explore like what might that be able to bring so we spoken about this obviously before you you write about it in the book there are a handful of events that occurred during your um your upbringing um your adolescence that I think ultimately shaped how you now think about this thing called trauma you want to talk about some of those things sure

[00:03:47] I had a really interesting course of life in the sense that in kind of the first half of my life the there weren't major traumas so I was fortunate to have a a stable family system around me and to develop a a a pretty stable sense of self um which is much easier to do if there aren't big traumas and and then in the second half of my life there there started to be some very major traumas and to experience the traumas after having developed an orientation to to myself and to the world um that had been free of them was very very striking I think it it put me in a place to to see even though I didn't completely understand them but like what was going on in me and what was changing in me and what were the impacts of the trauma on me in a way that was distressing and surprising and I think that's also part of what led me towards mental health we seeing like wow these things are happening in me and then there's a set of thoughts that come from that of like well what what happens if you experience these traumas and you don't have the you know the the fortune to have a a good fortune have a stable family system around you and have developed a strong sense of self because my sense of self was really thrown off by the traumas that happened even though I had kind of gotten through those formative stages without that how old were you when your brother committed suicide so I would been 24 24 at the time that he committed suicide and at the risk of asking an obvious or maybe not so obvious question how shocked were you at that time because you know you hear these tragedies of someone commits suicide and everybody around says well it was just a matter of time you know it was this almost seemed inevitable and then you hear these other stories where everybody around is in such disbelief so they're really coping with not just the loss but the feeling blindsided and guilty and how did we not see this and so where on that Spectrum were you and and I guess by extension your family in the disbelief in the shock and disbelief side of the Spectrum which I think like a lot of families that go through this if one stood from the outside and looked at the development of events right and what was really going on and what was changing in my brother is he had had a a huge trauma a few years before where he had a uh a very significant medical issue that had come out of the blue and was life-threatening and and really shook his sense of self and he was very different after that in ways that I could see in some sense but not fully understand so I think from the outside one probably could have seen that there were these changes in him that that would have meant it was not necessarily that shocking right but from the inside we often don't see that or we have our our mechanisms of of denial or of rationalization that tell us like no things are pretty okay when when really they they weren't and and then the the the shock of it happening and then of realizing oh like what could I have seen would I have seen you know I think it contributes to a lot of the the guilt and the shame that that people feel it's a bad combination right an immense amount of shock right and and and then immediately therea a sense of guilt and responsibility and and also a sense that if there haven't been big traumas that oh like they don't happen right like you know that that's not something that happens to me or happens to us and and I think we can get into that mindset because it it sort of psychologically protects us a little bit um but it can make the shock of of a trauma like that and in a sense all the more difficult because we start to feel you know uh cursed or unworthy or like you know there's some Mark of stigma that that that I think is just very very frightening how did your other brother your parents cope with this and how did you talk about it with them or was what was discussed and how did you all move on in the immediate aftermath of that I think I think my other brother and I were are sort of built in somewhat the same way of like kind of continuing to persevere and and and trying to find something new that can make life feel better which which often means working toward achievements applying ourselves right which which can be quite a good defense uh against trauma um I think in my parents it was a little different my father's a more s of outgoing gregarious person and and was able to fall into a social network that was really supportive of him whereas my mother who since passed away was more of a a private person less socially connected and and I think ultimately suffered from a lot of depression without her or us really understanding it and and I think that's part of what part of what pushes so strongly towards my interest in trauma is the realization of like all the things we didn't understand or understood enough to know weren't good but didn't have the words or the understanding to to to really talk about it and to talk about like what it happened and what it meant and the the changes to all of us that that we don't have a ready lexicon right or or a ready environment to be able to talk about things and then people at times sort of retreat into themselves and then you know the trauma stays very very immediate um even though that immediacy can play out over years and years so I think we were very ill equipped like I think most people you know we just we were ill equipped to handle a massive trauma and its impact upon all of us individually let alone the greater complexity of all of us as a family is it more common that in a situation like that where a child commits suicide and the parents and siblings are left picking up the pieces that very little is spoken explicitly I mean what what is you know

[00:09:55] I I I have I think about the stories in my life of people I grew up with who for whom suicide was a was an issue so I mean had a girlfriend in college whose mom committed suicide had a very close friend in high school whose dad committed suicide had another girlfriend in high school whose dad committed suicide and um one of these had a very tragic outcome the one there was a friend whose dad committed suicide he later committed suicide um and that was an example of where I thought to myself and it's something I felt very guilty about because I was in college and my mom called me to tell me he wasn't doing well um and it was in April and it was during finals and she said you know and his dad had committed suicide two years earlier and she said look he's really just doesn't seem like he's doing well and um I said well you know like and I to this day I just feel so ashamed over this you know I said I'm going to be home in like three weeks uh you know I

[00:10:55] I'll connect with him then but you know at that moment in my life nothing seemed more important than graduating first in my class and anything that was going to stand in the way of that was you know I couldn't be dist I couldn't go home for a weekend at my mom's request and of course by the time I got home it was too late he was dead um and I just wondered like I mean it's so obvious and yet I did nothing right um what was talked about what you know what else was being done um so not to dwell on this too much but I'm

[00:11:31] I'm just curious how much you remember in the months after your brother's death was there a was there a time where you sat around the kitchen table and said boy it would really be great if we had a therapist here that could help us process what's going on or right after the funeral was it sort of like nope we're all kind of going to do our own mechanism of coping I mean there was some discussion about it and I think partly because maybe the generation right I I'm in mean

[00:11:59] I hadn't been to medical school yet so I had no knowledge of anything but I'm maybe a little more inclined to want to talk about things like I I could tell like we all seem not to be doing well but but I didn't know the words to put to it I mean we we don't in a sense give ourselves permission to have like words of immensity right of impact of oh my my whole existence feels different right like we don't quite know or or feel a sense of permission to say those things and then often the reflexive nature nature of Shame right causes us to go inside and I think that's a a primary point that I that I wish to make about trauma is that there is a reflexive shame that comes of being traumatized right the same shame we see if someone is assaulted and then presents talking about the assault through the lens of their shame that had happened right it it you know the these these um powerful stories that that reinforce the reflexive nature of of a sense of shame that drives us inward so we don't have the words for it and we feel very very bad about it even you know your own you know even the the trauma that you felt as a result of not going home like you say well it's so obvious but it's obvious only in retrospect right at the time it was not obvious right because those words of desperation and of immensity were not being used right and we we sit within a social context around us that in a sense normalized is not really talking about it in in those big words or the words of like everything has changed and I don't know what to do about that or what that means and and you know then we we kind of move forward as best we can but we're sort of limping forward without really talking about the things that matter which really starts with how differently we feel about ourselves that I think we all felt a sense of shame in a sense of responsibility of what should I have seen what should I have done and you know he was living at home at the time so for my parents the the the thought of you know their thought of how they could have would have should have right seen something known something right that sense of Shame drives everyone inside and now we're trying to communicate and we don't have the words anyway but we we're like muffled is trying to communicate you know while being sort of all of it and we don't know like I don't know the words to say and I'm driven inside too and then I think the things that we do often fail to give us what we need and then you do see that Cascade of trauma where one suicide you know follows upon the initial suicide or know the people around the person feel so guilty and ashamed that they their lives head in different directions you know I think my mother became depressed and more isolative and it really changed the course of her subsequent life in a way that I think was very negative without any of us really knowing how do we understand this and what do we do about it and and I think that's the May among the biggest aspects I'm fighting against of saying like look we need to be able to talk about these things like what's more important and what's more worth the time and effort to put the right words of understanding to than what happens inside of us after trauma so you were living in New York obviously at the time I'm guessing this was probably a very significant um factor in your decision to kind of take an orthogonal turn in your career towards medicine yes um but it's interesting that it turned you to medicine but not necessarily to Psychiatry immediately um that it was you know it would take a few years within medical school to realize that Psychiatry became the vehicle through which you wanted to help someone

[00:15:40] I mean everybody goes to medicine for the same reason generally speaking everybody has some desire to help in one way or another right um and then of course the purpose of medical school is to figure out the The Avenue in which you want to do that um right what other thoughts did you have as you went to medicine as it pertained to your brother or were there other factors that shaped that as well yeah you know I see in retrospect in myself what I often have seen in my clinical work over these past 20 years which is which is there's a sort of bifurcation often after big trauma and you know I had wanted sort of other things in my life before my brother's death I wasn't completely happy with my career and I thought well maybe I want more education and I had a lot of thoughts about that and the idea of doing those things was really based on some sense of faith and confidence in myself they like hey could go do that I could apply myself I could learn new things I could take a different path and and figure it out right but after

[00:16:37] Jonathan's death there was a bifurcation where I start to feel feel very differently about myself to feel incompetent right to feel incapable I mean how could I even hope to take care of myself if I couldn't be a brother to my own brother right and and my thoughts about myself changed in this way that that I now I write about in the book and

[00:17:00] I think about and talk about a lot which was sort of forgetting that I had a sense of confidence in myself right and and you know I was going in a negative direction of becoming less healthy and drinking too much and just just Walling in my own unhappiness in in through a sense of guilt and shame over what had happened and and it really came to a point of realizing like this is not going well right and and I I'm sort of forgetting who I have always thought I was right and and I got a little bit of therapy which was a very um um like kind of wild thing to do like you know no one went to therapy right and and there was a sense of stigma even around needing mental health help after my brother's suicide right but even in that little bit of therapy it helped me ground again to like like no I don't actually feel differently about myself and and if anything then I felt more of a drive like I want to go do this good thing and and yes it was a drive to help people but it was it was really based in a drive of self that am I going to take care of myself in a way that says if you're not happy and you want more of your life right in the way that you see it are you going to go do that right and that's where I think helping ourselves and helping others kind of comes together I mean if I had no confidence in myself that I could guide my own life or be worth having in anyone else's life right how would I go off and do something to help other people and and I think that's often what we see after tragedy is you know in a very seductive and evil way the consequences of trauma beckon us to limit our Horizons to see ourselves in a different and very negative way which which leads to bad things right it leads to depression it leads to panic attacks it leads to substance abuse it just it leads to not being who we want to be right and and often ju opposed to that is is seeing the trauma a lens that that makes us redoubled in wanting to be who who we can be and our understanding of trauma whether it gets the best of us and the guilt and shame wins the day and the changes to our memories of who we think we are it's it's is it going to be that or are we going to be lodged into life in a way that lets us move forward and I was very fortunate to have to have gone the good path right instead of where it could have led me and going to medical school was although yes I wanted to help people you know was about me and my sense of of confidence in myself that ultimately wasn't taken away by my brother's suicide but man really could have been so when you think back to your residency um you you you stayed at

[00:19:47] Stanford after med school for the first part of your residency before going to Harvard um you think back to those first couple of years what what stands out in terms of what you learn learned and how one teaches Psychiatry because in some ways it strikes me as a more difficult discipline to teach than say surgery you know in many ways if I think back to my residency um it was you know there's a knowledge base you have to glean and then there's a technical set of things you have to be able to do and they're relatively easy to mirror um but at least from my vantage point teaching somebody how to make a psychiatric diagnosis might be less challenging than teaching somebody how to talk to someone and elicit information that would allow you to make that diagnosis or more importantly communicate with a person in a way to help them in other words using words seems harder than using a needle and suture so what what is the process of Education in a psychiatric Residency program well there's lots of learning of facts right of course around neurobiology and around medicines and around different modalities of therapy so I think in that way it's probably similar to other fields of endeavor um but then there are the less tangible aspects um that are the most important right like how do you establish Rapport right how do you really be present with someone and I think that's where the training in the field I I think across the board often fails us um and I think part of that is is sort of the world the society live in in the world of modern medicine I was very very struck and I can continue to be um over these past 20 years of how so much of of what I learned say as a secondy year Psychiatry resident I think we should be teaching people in elementary school right and and I really do mean that about like just how we respond to the world around us right even the idea that you know bullying comes from a sense of shame in the person doing the bullying and then creates a sense of Shame and inadequacy in the person on the receiving end right and how does this all work in our brains right and how do logic and emotion clash in our brains and and and emotion wins over logic yet we're taught that we're logical creatures right like things like that I was in some sense actually quite quite incensed at a whole education process that doesn't prepare us to like live life by telling us the basics of what goes on in our brains right so I was very struck by that and also struck that as I was learning it it wasn't necessarily being directly applied in the field as as mental health has tried to kind of fit itself in with the rest of medicine it wants to have very clear diagnostic paradigms so so this trend away from describing someone in a narrative you say well how would you diagnose that person right you know years ago it would be in a narrative you know you would talk about who that person was and in at least a couple of paragraphs right and that's by and large gotten reduced to a number right and in trying to regiment itself um in a way that I think is overly rigid and serves the The Field's interest and desire to integrate with the rest of medicine we we start losing the truth of really sitting with people and being present with people and a lot of what I learned about how to be a psychiatrist was about boundaries with other people right which do in many cases make sense but the boundaries were put forth in a way that was often about eliminating the realness of of presence with someone and and I think that's the part that maybe is the intangible or the harder aspect of the field that I think doesn't really have to be that way right if if we realize we're going to help people through through understanding through really being with someone and trying to understand their experience and of course having it be about the other person but being a real person with them right that that I did find in my training process but but I didn't find in the in the field which is largely moving towards these brief appointments and just giving people medicines instead of trying to understand what's going on with them a lot of what I often describe as polishing the hood when it's very clear there's something going on in the engine right and while I learned a great deal and I and I learned from some wonderful people who role modeled for me how to be with people you were trying to help there was also a great deal of disappointment with a a field that often in its training and its interaction with patients ignored the crucial point of of realness of the experience of the other person I want to think about kind of the differences between these two programs you you trained in right because you did half of your training at Stanford and half at Harvard which are generally regarded as two of the finest Psychiatry training programs in the country but they have a very different method of training so what did you find as you moved across the country um for the second half of your training and and how did that impact the way you practice today because in some ways you have a luxury of having seen two very different um approaches to Psychiatry yes a more sort of biologic and a more clinical more of a sort of Freudian view versus a a more I don't know how way you would describe the the one at Stanford but it seems to me more of a neurobiology view yes um both of which strike me as having huge benefits if they can be integrated yes was it received that way by you I think I didn't complet I didn't understand uh certainly not at the beginning because Stanford is so uh neurobiology based right so so the medical and neurobiological approach to

[00:25:42] Psychiatry uh is is just really the among the finest points of that program and I was lucky to learn a lot of of neurobiology neurochemistry function of medicines aspects of the different parts of our brain and how they Comm communicate amongst one another to generate our perception of reality and at times that the problems that can afflict us I learned a lot about that but I think I didn't realize how little

[00:26:10] I was learning of the psychology of of being a psychiatrist of the unconscious motivations in US of this sort of Rich history of understanding human beings that is so tremendously important to being able to help people and it was only when I got to Harvard and uh Dr Mariann Baco to whom I'm I'm eternally grateful um I think recognized in me she was very impressed with the amount of biology knowledge I have and I think that she was kind of horrified with the lack of psychology knowledge and then really helped me to get that knowledge once I was there from from from the people who could really teach it to me and and I ended up on the other side of that feeling like I had learned a lot of what I really needed to know and and then the way like how do you put the rubber to the road of that is by by being a real person with the person that you're trying to help which which I I think is the way I approach the field and the people that I work with we approach the field the same way um but like we're really the the instrument right through which all of that comes and and hopefully helps somebody so so that maybe is in one's personality or you know you just kind of realize that that like oh and I'm being sort of more rigid in a certain way like I'm less helpful and and if I'm less that way in a more existential therapy approach to realness with the person then I can use all of what I've learned the neurobiological and the psychological to really make a difference to someone and

[00:27:44] I think that I figured out through practice right and through learning what really helps someone just like I found my way to trauma I didn't decide I'm going to be a trauma person I'm going to write a trauma book I I saw it was undering you know a a a very very high percentage of everything that I was trying to treat so so things like that I think we learned by trying to apply what we know and I ended up being very fortunate to have had the brain biology knowledge and the psychological knowledge although it was a little bit distressing to realize when I got to

[00:28:19] Harvard how little I knew and I probably wouldn't have known how little I knew right unless I had had that experience that really exposed that so when was the first edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual published H how I don't know where this fits in the evolution in history of Psychiatry 1948 somewhere in late 1940s

[00:28:41] I think 1948 but in that in that range and as you alluded to earlier that the DSM as it's abbreviated is is really at least in part a way to catalog and create crisp diagnoses around psychiatric illness correct that's what it EV has evolved to in the in the initial versions of the DSM it was describing in a sense the phenomenology of like what is this particular diagnosis like what what are the aspects of it what's what's felt or experienced by the person and what's seen from the outside and and then there were sort of clusters of symptoms that that would then lead one to to think that that diagnosis fits right which acknowledges s the unique aspects of human beings and if we get too rigid about that right we start serving in a sense the manual right instead of the person and and in many ways the DSM evolved as a way of allowing for research criteria to say okay we want to be calling a diagnosis sort of the same thing if we're going to communicate among clinicians and do research but in my very strong opinion that has come to a place that now is so overly rigid that you now you have this very very thick book that could give everyone multiple diagnoses right CU it's kind of designed to do that and then come up with a number that justifies the 15-minute appointment right in which the person has no hope of of actually being understood in any way because you can't do that in 15 minutes right and we're at the DSM 5 right now correct we're in the fifth generation of this manual which seems to get updated about every 15 or 20 years yes it's the fifth generation there technical revisions in between but yeah it's really evolved to something that I think is so rigid that it um in many ways works against the clinical care that we're trying to achieve and and again

[00:30:39] I'm all for criteria and being able to have descriptive language and and research criteria but we've gotten to the point where it often gets called like a Bible right which I think is is like a very unfortunate word to use in many ways it it implies that there's something in that book that that actually tells you what mental health problems are and and what they are not and some of the criteria really make no sense so so for example someone who who has sort of VI vicarious trauma that they're experiencing but not in an occupational framework does does doesn't meet criteria for a PTSD diagnosis which has come to mean like everything trauma so if you have trauma that's real or legitimate you have PTSD and if not you don't right like this clearly makes no sense but the field of often views it that way and then applies criteria that are not the be all and end all of The

[00:31:33] Human Experience and then becomes very very rigid in a way that I think trivializes often what's going on with someone and and Trend towards that symbolism of capturing everything in a number as opposed to in a human experience and I think we've gone so far away from the realness of human experience and how to sit with a person and be helpful that the the field has in many many ways LED itself very very far astray and I think that the evolution of the DSM is both a driving cause of that and also a a resultant symptom of that too so outside of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD how often does the word trauma appear in the uh dsm5 well it I mean appears in other places but it doesn't appear in a foundational way right because if the book is descriptive then the book is is looking to take an inventory of signs and symptoms right it's not looking at causality right and and that is a problem right because so much of the depression that I see so much of the anxiety Spectrum disorders obsessive compulsive disorder for example um abuse of substances and addiction or alcoholism right is is undergirded by trauma right and Trauma changes that person's experience of of life to a place of fear and vulnerability right and then that drives the subsequent problems but if we're not looking at what's at the root of the things that we're describing then we're just taking a descriptive inventory and that's how we end up polishing the hood right I can't tell you how many people I've seen with very severe substance disorders that haven't been helped by three four five six courses of treatment right and they're then of labeled as quote unquote failing right the treatment and and very often the treatment is never taken a trauma inventory and it is trauma that is driving the substance use right it's trauma that's changed that person's internal dialogue towards something that's extremely negative that tells them that they're not worthwhile and they'll never get anywhere in life and why try for a new job or a new relationship right because because you're you're nothing ever works out for you and and you know this wasn't that person's belief in thems before trauma it's under ging everything and then it's spinning off these symptoms and then we take inventory of the symptoms as if they are the be all and end all and then somehow we're surprised when the treatments don't work right so so the fact that we're not looking to ideology right and and I think that I think that's a huge problem and it fits with not actually paying attention to people that you know I would get handoffs that would describe a person in a number like oh who's the patient I'm taking over let's a 296 6.44 with a 309.81 you're like oh my goodness right we're talking about human beings here right but we've somehow reduced that to numbers that indicate a set of symptoms and it's hard for me to see how one could argue the field hasn't been LED astray if that's become the standard so let's Define trauma as broadly as we can because there's probably somebody listening to this right now who's thinking um okay trauma could be an injury um and if they can extrapolate from that and say well psychological trauma we talked about PTSD I can see how a soldier coming back from fuia having watched people getting blown up both civilians and soldiers uh I can see how that would be traumatic um obviously the story with your brother yep I can see how that's traumatic but trauma includes much more than that so how do you define for somebody who's really hearing about this for the first time what what trauma means yeah trauma is anything that pushes our coping skills to and beyond their limits and then results in a set of feelings inside that could be acute

[00:35:48] Terror or it could be for example a chronic sense of denigration right but it creates these feelings inside that then change the the the functioning of our brain the communication within our brain among the various parts right in a way that that shifts the lens through which we see ourselves and the world around us so it pushes our coping skills beyond the limits and then it changes the ways that our brains function and know that's identifiable in modern science when we can see the changes in um in space aged neuroimaging right that that shows how the connectivity in the brain shifts or even the fact that trauma changes the the expression of genetically determined characteristics in us because genes are either on or not on and that changes as a result of trauma and can be passed down to

[00:36:43] Children even years after the trauma occurs so someone can have the trauma occur change the brain and then have a child years later and the child is impacted by the trauma that occurred years before so these are real changes inside of us identifiable by modern science that happen when our coping skills are pushed beyond the limits and our view of trauma comes through this history of seeing trauma through the lens of combat right because it's sort of the most obvious way to see it right like that person went off to war and they experienced terrible things in war and they came back and it's so clear that they are different right so that's how we we look to acute trauma because it's the most obvious right and as you said if okay there's a suicide and gosh the family members are traumatized like and we can we can see that right but what we we pay less attention to and less heed to are two different factors one the variables inside of us that determine what pushes our coping skills over the limits differ right it differs by genetic characteristics it differs by early life experience it differs by for example how finely tuned one's emotional compass compass is it it differs by the chronicity of TR AA so the sort of multiple hit hypothesis which we've seen that if they're multiple traumas it might be oh it's the fifth trauma that now pushes that person into a post-t trauma syndrome where the brain is different even though the fifth trauma might seem less traumatic than the first four but the weight of the first four are there right so we tend then to paint with this broad brush that ignores right the richness of human diversity right and and how we are impacted differently by different things right and then it also ignores that not all trauma is chronic sorry is acute right that that there are traumas that are chronic so you think of the the trauma of neglect right there's the neglect of a child is not defined by an acute incident right it's defined by the impact upon that child of the neglect over time right the same thing with with the aspect for example of systemic racism right of of a person who gets messages over time that they're less than right that they look different they dress different they worship different whatever is going on in them is less than and that's inculcated into the person over time and that can have exactly the same effects on the brain and the same is true with vicarious trauma I mean we are fortunate of course as a a species that we can be empathic with one another right we can experience the emotions of another person right in a way that's connected as if they're our own right but the other side of that coin is we can be traumatized by what happens to other people right and sometimes that might be someone we're very close to right or it might be a person who develops such a strong interest because they're they're sort of horrified by things they see going on around the world and then are paying very very close attention in a way that overwhelms that person's brain's ability to cope with with that and then you know for example a a a person who was so deeply impacted by the crisis in Syria right that then develops post-trauma symptoms right and and that person like never left their home in the

[00:39:58] United States but was so appalled and and so distraught by what was going on and and didn't know to like divert their attention that was too much attention to something coming from a good place in their heart but that ultimately leaves that person manifesting the same post-trauma signs and symptoms as people who suffer from an acute assault and whether the DSM likes that or not it is true it's true and it's a identifiable in Human Experience right so so the the truth of Human Experience reflects the diversity of how we can be traumatized in acute chronic and vicarious ways and that how tra how traumatic things impact us and whether they push our coping skills over the limits is also unique to each human being which doesn't mean we don't follow patterns and and of course the discipline of Psychiatry following patterns and identifying patterns is very very important but we also need to acknowledge that we are different and we we can't understand what's going on inside of a person without paying attention to that actual person you know using that example um it seems that at the risk of oversimplifying there are at least two variables at play there's the individual's susceptibility and then there's the event or events which again can be acute chronic or experienced by others that you witness maybe circumstances I would think that circumstances right because event still in my mind implies something implies something more acute right as opposed to circumstances which could be an acute event or something chronic or vicarious so using that extreme example of um a person who you know witnessing events in the news Rises to the level of the definition of trauma those events which are not being experienced by this individual over a prolong period of time produce the state you descri cribe which is to say they are pushed Beyond Their

[00:42:00] Manners of coping and they themselves begin to internalize shame and these These Feelings we're talkinging about so when you when you I mean does the DSM look at that and say that's not trauma or it says there's something wrong with that person because they shouldn't be feeling that way based on that event I mean I think it just excludes them because they just don't meet the criteria for what validates the trauma right which is interesting so the book has to validate the trauma right and like that doesn't really make sense right I mean we should be looking at people and saying do do you present with the signs and symptoms of trauma that is pushed your coping skills over the limits right do is your mood chronically lower is your anxiety chronically higher are you having panic attacks you didn't have before is your sleep Disturbed are you more hypervigilant do you feel less safe in the world about maybe yourself or people that you love like these are clearly identifiable things right and and if we're taking stock of like what is your Human Experience right and has something changed in you then the idea is we would honor that right and I wouldn't say well oh wait a second that that happened to you but you were vicariously traumatized in the course of something occupational so now okay so you get I'm going to put the stamp of approval on you wait you would that happened to you but you were just so horrified by what was going on say in

[00:43:27] Syria that you couldn't take your attention away from it and it woke you up in the middle of the night and you went on the computer for two more hours and now all of a sudden you really can't sleep well and you're fearful about your children and ways you weren for wait a second that wasn't occupational now now we're not now you don't get the stamp of approval right I mean the the the idea is we have to Anchor to the truth of

[00:43:45] Human Experience because it's it's not that extreme that people are traumatized by vicarious things I mean and I absolutely see this I mean I've written many more times than I can count on a prescription pic I'm going to write your prescription and the prescription I'm writing is no more news right because I see that that person's health or maybe that person I've known for years their health has really deteriorated over a couple months of paying attention to something so intensely distressing and we've had more you know than we can shake a stick out right in in recent years that you could pay attention you know to to the point of like utter despair right and then who who is that person like is that person someone who's had three or four really acute traumas but they don't have a post-trauma syndrome but boy they're really a setup for it so they start paying ATT intense attention to to traumatic things they're seeing in you know in the world around them and now they have a syndrome right so we we're not doing Justice to that if we're we're making a set of criteria that try and treat us like robots or machines instead of hey like these are human beings and we have to know like what's come before in your life right where were you at when you experience an acute or chronic or vicarious trauma and if we if we look at the manifestations what's going on in a person and how do we help them understand it then we can help people I mean part of the message of the book is this is not rocket science there's a lot about this that's very simple and very grounded to Common

[00:45:16] Sense which is pay attention to what's going on in people and help them understand it and if we have an entire Paradigm of helping that's around symptom inventory and putting a label or not putting a label and then schlepping some medicines at someone without really trying to understand then you we we often even the first step we take down helping Pathways is misguided and then is it a really a surprise that the mental health treatment system is not serving well the majority of people that it is supposed to serve and I think it's very clearly true I don't think this is a a overly strong or exaggerated statement that accessing mental health help often leave someone feeling worse and I'm not trying to be over over critical of the people working in the system there's so many good people that are trying to help other people but the system often doesn't let them do it I mean you have panels of more patients than you can count in 15minute appointments how are you supposed to understand and help someone so I think the entire system is misguided towards this you know how little money can we spend in the short term how can we get human beings out of the equation right because human beings cost more money to deploy than medicines right we we are misguiding ourselves in a way that's that's away from common sense and we do often leave people worse than when we found them a classic example being go to going to a hospital and trying to get help where maybe 15 or 20 years ago when a person I was taken care of might be in crisis I would think if I don't send that person to an emergency room like that would be malpractice right like they they're in crisis they need help now I have to stop and the vast majority of times I do not do that because I worry or I know for sure if they show up at a hospital they're going to wait 36 hours right 40 something hours before they see someone they're going to be put in a place that's going to feel very shameful and very stigmatizing right there you know there's a locked room and people are watching that person you know in a way that makes them feel um like they're being treated like they're crazy when they're they're in distress and when they finally get help you know there's some short-term stabilization give them a little medicine they fall asleep they wake up they feel a little better cuz they slept now send them home and we're not serving people well with this short-term view of how we're supposed to help them I mean there there are not enough beds and emergency rooms in mental health units there's not enough time with practitioners I mean the fact that the system is broken is to me as obvious as one plus one is too I mean I just see it in front of me day after day where in the last 20 years did the did the sort of Matrix come together for you with respect to trauma I mean the first time you and I ever spoke about this was four years ago 2017 um and not surprisingly at that time I didn't really know what you were talking about um I only thought about it in the most literal sense which is you know something that is so OB VI viously physically harmful that that that could be traumatic but it was clear you had been thinking a lot about this because you had a lot to say on it and you had already been sending patients to um you know inpatient facilities Residential

[00:48:44] Care Facilities that specialized in trauma care so when did this occur for you when did you start to integrate these other modalities when did you when was the first time you sent a patient to a residential program that specialized in trauma such as you know the bridge to recovery or a place like that I would have been sending patients to to residential facilities for trauma since very early on in my career but not having the understanding like you know like when you when you do anything for for a long time like you you internalize aspects of doing it that become reflexive and then it frees up parts of your brain to learn more you know and as

[00:49:25] I got I think just learn learn more and got more experience and more ability to spend more time with people and and and try and just always have a venue where I could try and understand that person right led me to realize like wait I'm doing the same things all the time right if you present to me with panic attacks you present to me with obsessive compulsive disorder you present to me with depression you present to me with addiction what I'm ultimately doing is the same thing is I'm trying to under to

[00:49:51] I'm trying to help that you understand why right because that's what going to make the difference and maybe along the way we can treat symptoms right maybe I have you on a couple of anti-depressants right or even someone who has psychosis something like so dramatic right that we're trying to decrease that with medicines But ultimately how to really help that person is to try and understand what their experience is of it right and their sense of vulnerability is of it and I realized like I'm doing this all the time is is trying to help people understand where the problems are coming from because that's how they get better right which is the same as what I saw in myself right you know this was anger frustration resentment you know underlying depression like all of these problems were in me right and and you know a very negative uh and oppressive internal dialogue right and in my own

[00:50:44] Psychotherapy of exploring this right you know we weren't trying to treat like what symptom is it spinning off now but trying to understand like what's going on inside of you right that you're doing this and so I saw in my own the process was to help me right my own Psychotherapy and what I was doing with others that it was all about the same thing which were the roots of what ails us and those roots are the the the seeds of trauma falling into a soil that lets those seeds grow and trying to understand what what is that soil inside of you right how is it unique to you how does it follow patterns that impact all of us right what was that seed how has it grown I I at some point realized oh that's what I do right that's what I'm doing and I stopped thinking oh like how many depression cases do I have or how many I didn't think about that I said oh

[00:51:35] I kind of have all trauma cases right and and that was such a revelation and then in the practicality of starting to do my work more intentionally that way I could see that it was more effective it was very very clear that it was more effective and then I started working with really great like-minded people and their knowledge and experience with what was learning like really came together in a way that this this lens of trauma seemed not like oh some esoteric

[00:52:04] Discovery but oh I'm just rooted back to the obvious right it rooted back to the obvious which which really some of the older literature and describing human behavior knew all the time right but just wasn't at the Forefront of the discipline in terms of its Education and Training if you had to Hazard a guess what fraction of mental health providers

[00:52:26] Psych ologist psychiatrists counselors Etc have never referred one of their patients to a residential trauma facility what would be your guess it's an unknowable thing probably a pretty high percentage right because trauma gets defined as does that person have PTSD right and you know L people aren't not going to even say all the things that would leave them to be diagnosed right because they're ashamed of the symptoms right I mean the role of Shame is so when you go to one of these facilities and been the two of them um the word PTSD almost never comes up right it's it's usually hey you know you have this addiction you have this maladaptive coping strategy you're angry you're depressed let's find out why let's find out what's underneath the surface so given that the facilities themselves don't position themselves as PTSD treatment centers necessarily although there are people there with PTSD but that's just another right you it's interesting to me that practitioners aren't more aware of this tool right let's let's take something like an eating disorder right right you you take care of many patients with eating disorders what fraction of those patients would you say have an underlying trauma as a significant contributory factor in their illness approaches 100% approaches 100% even if you look at trauma through that appropriately broad lens right because we're looking at what causes the the outcome so I'm not trying to look at what factors do I want to be part of it

[00:54:00] I'm looking at the actual truth of what causes the outcome so the The Chronic trauma of immensely high expectations of self right often placed upon self by self but but often uh that process being aided and embedded by external forces right which sometimes are the expectations of the people around that person or just the expectations of society of how you're supposed to look and how you're supposed to act and how you're supposed to present yourself to the world and what you're supposed to achieve can create immense senses of of insecurity and of vulnerability and and people laboring under that for long periods of time can find an outlet for control I mean in many ways that's often what the signs and symptoms of so many mental health uh uh issues are right it's an attempt to find control and maybe somebody finds control by tapping five times when they think they have a negative thought someone else finds control by restricting what they eat and they control what goes into their bodies right and what are the roots of that the roots of that are always trauma I I can't think of an eating disorder um situation a person suffering from an eating disorder who did not have trauma as a root of that eating disorder with the trauma being discovered and talked about and addressed at least to some degree during the treatment and that's why the facilities understand this I mean it's interesting the facilities know because when you show up at a trauma facility right they want to understand and treat your trauma right they're not concerned you have the magic card of Entry of PTSD right but because medicine you know how many times this this gets said so often but it's true right if the doctors are treating the computer the chart right the paperwork right that like so much of it is about that person have trauma or not have trauma I got to determine if they have

[00:55:45] PTSD like you know it's it's so busying around with things that don't matter that are about establishing a diagnosis so the insurance company will pay for the 15-minute appointment or will pay for the medicine that's going to treat the symptom but not the problem right that there then become a gating mechanism and like PTSD is some magic gating mechanism right that doesn't get talked about when you're actually treating trauma because it actually makes no sense as a gating mechanism and

[00:56:11] I think what you're pointing out is very very powerful that you know the the world we live in says you have to have PTSD and meet these criteria or you don't have trauma but what happens if you get to somebody who's treating trauma they never talk about that right they talk about the the reality and truth of what you've lived and and what that has done to you in ways that are then counterproductive to your life right and like that's the truth and the realness of it as opposed to opposed to a a false um sense of shity that comes from all those guidelines and box checking that is uh really divorced from

[00:56:47] The Human Experience it seems to me that part of the problem I mean there's so many problems to the recognition of this right the first first is there's you know medicine works in in the in the sphere of biomarkers and um objective measures of uh illness or disease right so we can look at a biomarker like a person's apob or LDL cholesterol or a hormone level and it's subjective we we can understand what that implies or we can look at a CT scan that shows an injury here there but you know

[00:57:21] Psychiatry has none of these things right Psychiatry you know doing an MRI a person's brain offers you no more insight into their plight or their suffering than you know rubbing a towel on their head and dumping some hot wax on it um you know again there are exceptions of course there are exceptions where you know certainly uh you know a nutritional deficiency like a

[00:57:43] B12 deficiency or something that can show up in a biomarker can explain a psychiatric but but for the most part that's not the case so that's I call that kind of macro problem one I think macro problem two is the heterogeneity of the soil mhm that you describe right you could take 100 individuals and simultaneously expose them to the same traumatic event but without knowing what their antecedent history is right right so what have what else has this person experienced and um so in other words what else has been dropped in the soil right and without knowing the composition of each of their soils you really have no idea how those 100 people are going going to react to an identical stimulus right and that of course is very uncomfortable for medicine when you know it's uncomfortable for science right like you think of Co postulates like we really love it when we can say add this microb get this disease subtract this microb subtract this disease like you know medicine is so good at that type of thinking and it's like we don't have the and again I'm not saying this to be critical of medicine or to be critical of psychiatr it's just an observation of maybe this might explain to somebody who's listening to this who thinks you're out to left field this is a very hard problem to quantify because of these a the again the obvious the lack of biomarkers Etc the lack of diagnostic criteria um and the incredible heterogeneity of the individual and their history and those are actually not the same thing yes and anything on the one hand look we need to acknowledge that complexity and also that lack of specificity right but on the other hand there are aspects of that that I think simplify in in ways that are very very compelling right so you know in the book

[00:59:41] I interview Stephanie Von Gutenberg who's a an expert on the prevention of understanding and prevention of child abuse and Darren richer who's a professor at Stanford who's done a lot of trauma work around trauma work and Trauma research around the impact of trauma on identifiable markers and what that means right so for example his work draws at times from the field of epigenetics which shows that gene expression changes after trauma and he was his testimony was instrumental in uh in um jurist Prudence on an international level recognizing that for example rape as a tool of War right is not like a one event criminal act right which was how it was being viewed okay that thing happened on that day right in a way that circumscribes it and the the epigenetic research around trauma shows that not only is it not a one event limited to a day right uh experience but that it carries on throughout that person's life right it impacts the society in which that person lives and it gets passed on to the next Generation right so now we start having that kind of powerful science that can show that woman who was raped has a Child 3 years later and the genetics that are expressed in that child are impacted by the trauma that happened three years say before conception so we do have in a sense the scientific proof to hang our hats on these days we do have that in a way that tells us right we kind of knew all this was true because we saw it obviously in front of us now we do have what science wants to have to to to hang our hats on right and even though like say those 100 people of different soil and will be affected in different ways we can understand how that may sort of disperse across those hundred people right like what is the trauma um you know a certain number of people or percentage of people are likely to respond in certain ways if it's a dramatic trauma like if there's some dramatic acute trauma it might not matter so much what the soil is people are going to be you know the majority are going to be very deeply affected right well there might be other kinds of trauma where you can only understand by really understanding that person so so like we do fit patterns and we can we can understand how those patterns unfold just like we can understand the aspects of basic science that we've learned now in a way that says yes this is very very complicated that's why it can't be deployed in some checkbox kind of manner right but we can understand it well enough to say okay it's actually not that complicated right to try and understand and like what what has your experience been or what's going on inside of you right if you present as depressed like well what's your history right and what are you saying to yourself inside right and has that shifted over time like we can understand that in a way that says do do I think that your brain is different because of trauma it's like it's not that hard to do that and then to say well let's try and understand your trauma so we can help make it better right so there's an aspect of this that's also kind of simple too that we don't deploy because we're lost Lo in the complexity of all those other things all that box checking and you we don't know we don't understand and Psychiatry wants to be like the rest of medicine and then we get lost in the complexity and that complexity very often prevents a person from being understood feeling understood feeling help getting any help at all are there um checklists that provide value so for example the adverse childhood event is that what it's called Ace um it's a series of questions right it's 10 questions 20 how many questions is it I don't know there different versions that get utilized in different Realms and I'm not I don't know the standardized version is now yeah yeah yeah but it's in that ballpark so sometimes these tests are really good at catching they they they they have a high positive predictive value but they seem to have a low negative predictive value um in other words there's lots of people who don't score highly on the adverse childhood event score but nevertheless they are there is significant trauma in their lives but it might only account for one of the 10 checks but again for them it was very um instrumental in how their identity was formed right so is this something that can be automated or is this something that can only be done by someone who has the ability to dig and really get deep into it so let's take an example right so you let's let's take a person who uh you know grew up in a family where they simply weren't paid attention to right so they they would check the box of neglect um but no none of the other boxes would get checked now let's say there were multiple kids in that family five children U neglected because the parents are working like crazy or for what whatever reason those five kids could completely internalize that in different ways right right some of those kids could go on to become the most successful people in the world because at least externally because of a drive that gets instilled in them to prove their Worth right one of their siblings could easily go in the exact opposite direction and turn to a life of substance abuse and addiction we see this all the time exactly let's explore that a little bit more because again there's two things I want to explore there one something as innocuous as neglect can produce such vastly different phenotypes and secondly the heterogeneity of the soil problem again which is how is it that two siblings and we've you and I have both seen scenarios like this two siblings in the exact same

[01:05:40] Family exposed to the exact same uh stimulus or environmental you know factor in this case neglect uh can have such vastly different responses right and one of them Society frowns upon and the other one actually society's pretty impressed with right right so questions around the the heterogeneity of it or how do we how do we understand well I think it's both right it's how do we explain the heterogeneity and two how would both of those people even rise to the level of coming to the lens of trauma given that again I'm using this very specific example where on an ace score neither of them would rise to the level of concern right well we are different even if we are siblings right

[01:06:24] I mean the the the genes are different and their manifestation can be very different right based upon aspects of Early Childhood experience that may have nothing to do with trauma right so I think where it leads us is inventories of signs and symptoms can be useful but they're just one element of data right I mean one aspect of it is accuracy of reporting right people will often under report because trauma creates shame in us right I mean I can't tell you the number of times say someone comes to care with me and they're checking oh they have depression and and panic attacks and say there's some intake form then there's they don't don't check the trauma box okay and and maybe I meet with them and maybe there is like a purely biological depression it comes out of the blue right and I can't find trauma associated with like that happens right it's rare but it happens more often than not when you start talking to the person it's it's remarkable sometimes I've you have three sessions worth of trauma history right that that's that's intrinsic to all aspects to that person's life and they checked no on the trauma box well because they didn't really think this was trauma and they really think that that seems that was too long ago to be trauma and like that's not as bad as what other people have to deal with so that can't be trauma I mean this happens all the time right so the the idea that what you just described strikes me as the norm right isn't that the majority of people who come into kind of a trauma diagnostic scenario with with a with an astute caregiver maybe caregiv is the wrong word provider um but it's the the comparisons well I mean come on that's what happened to me is not that bad look at what happened to so and so that can't be trauma right and a long time ago right all the time absolutely all the time because and this is really a Crux of the messaging of the book because trauma changes the instrument that we use to understand our trauma right like it's changing our brain right so so you com combine that with how much shame is evoked right and how hard it can be to discuss that right because if we're ashamed of something we don't want to reveal it to somebody else and we often don't know just because it's a professional is that person going to feel okay about me or are they going to look at me differently because they see that shameful thing in me like we feel this and absolutely I felt this after my brother's death I'm going to go see this therapist I don't even know this person and you know what's she going to think of me like you know here I you know here

[01:08:55] I wasn't around enough I only lived two hours away and I wasn't home enough to see this and like you know I I thought maybe you know she was going to say shame on you for what happened like I didn't know right and I think that is the norm which is why like we can't replace humans right like we kind of understand this that we can't replace humans in our helping Endeavors with like something that's computerized right so or mechanized in some way so so sure we want to take inventories and like if we can if it sense like take a an inventory of trauma scien and But realize that like you have no idea what that data means until you sit with the person right and like it it's why should it be strange to say that human beings are a necessary part of this helping process right because often I may look at all the data I have from someone and a lot of times I have data even from other providers or other facilities or you know I have a lot of data I'm like okay it tells me something but I really don't know who anything really about that person until they sit in front of me right because once they sit in front of me I can anchor that data to something right and and very often what I I started seeing over you know getting more experience in the field was when you talk more with a person about what's going on in them it is indeed linked to trauma whether they've checked that box or not and it's all those barriers it was too long ago or they feel ashamed of it that lead them not to recognize that the trauma is driving all of the problems and I think that the last story in the book about the woman who is a true story who 10 years later is 10 years younger and I got her permission before writing it because I didn't you know I didn't that's not a composite right it's this this person who just didn't understand like how her life CH tell the story so so she had had a tragedy in in her life and it was a years before and just standing from the outside and hearing the story there was such a disjunction of how she felt about herself and felt about her life and was living her life that changed after the trauma in a way that was so Stark this is the woman whose daughter died yes yeah who without realizing it right was living this life that was so changed and her her thoughts about herself were were through through such an unfair lens right who who really had no despite being intelligent and personable and like all these wonderful qualities couldn't see it right and like that's not the exception that's the norm right and those rationalizations inside of herself that no it was too long ago or or even feeling so badly about it that that being unable to let it to the surface enough to see what it was doing right had driven all of this changing in her so despite attesting to not having trauma it was 100% how did she come into your care it's for other things to to to treat some of the symptoms that had spun off which is often the case like oh this person is depressed or you know there's so many things I'm like okay that's that's just the card of Entry like maybe that I will find there a pure biological depression right but I have ceased to believe that that is what I will find because 20 years of doing this intensively has taught me differently so then the this case the person comes in and I see whatever the presenting I don't remember right because like that's not where the money was at so to speak right where the money was at was in trauma right and is it's that leaf at the end of the tree that caught the person's attention I want that leaf to be a little healthier that that a little bit better right that then brings her in where we look at what's going on in The

[01:12:44] Roots that's affecting all of the leaves right and it then gives us a chance of actually getting at it and developing an understanding of trauma and of reflexive shame and what that does to us and what a change in internal dialogue from from feeling a sense of pride in oneself as someone who works hard and does good things for other people and in the world around her to someone who didn't couldn't see her own worth anymore and you want to see an absolute disjunction of one self from before and after that will do it and by understanding it it could get better right does it take away the grief no in fact it lets her begin it let her begin to process the grief right because if we're we're blaming ourselves we can't grieve that's why it can be 50 years later and be just as immediate as when it happened because if the grief gets walled off right under this layer of Shame like an abscess medically would be in the body then it can spin off symptoms for years and years and years without anything ever getting any better and in fact with things getting worse because the trauma then brings new trauma right it brings the shame of like losing jobs and losing family and and you know all the ways in which feeling bad about ourselves makes us feel worse about ourselves right so the I it's a great example but it's not oh that's one in a million it's just a great example of something that I see all the time when she like let's get to the truth of what's going on in the person help them understand it and things get better and it's not that hard and complicated but it requires an approach that actually wants to understand what's going on actually I've always found the analogy of the abscess to be quite helpful especially for folks who understand what an abscess is how it's formed right and what the implications are of it right so for maybe folks who aren't familiar an abscess is a is a walled off infection so a great example of how one might get an abscess is if they had a ruptured appendicitis and you know a ruptured appendicitis carries with it a very high mortality but there are some ways to survive it without any biotics without anything and um this was even known hundreds of years ago when people were making long Hall Journeys across the ocean you know if you had rupted appendix in the middle of the Atlantic

[01:14:59] Ocean when you're halfway between Spain and the Americas kind of so um but what they realized was if you put the person on their right side down tilted slightly head up all of the pus that was coming out of that ruptured appendix would at least wall off in the lower part of the right abdomen as opposed to spread throughout the entire abdomen and there was at least you'd increase the odds that it would form this fous capsule around it that would wall off so you'd have all the puss and all the nastiness inside there but it was sort of Walled off and if you could get this right that person might just might survive now they weren't going to be perfectly healthy right um but but they'd survive right now today we still see people that show up with abscesses from a ruptured diverticulum or something like that right um and they're not well they're not dead though but they're just not well right well the first thing that has to happen is they have to come into the medical system for treatment which I guess the analog would be here they have to at least present for help in some way the second thing is they have to be willing to get help yes they have to acknowledge I have an absis now it's a lot easier with an absis because we have a CT scan that is Stark I mean an abscess is an unmistakable thing you don't even need to be a radiologist or even a medical student to spot the abscess on a CT scan it's the easiest thing to see literally there's nothing easier to see on a CT scan than an abscess but nevertheless there's got to be some component of convincing the person that you have this abscess but what's interesting is the treatment you often get a little worse before you get better because when you open that abscess and you release all of the bacteria uh even though you're doing it in a manner to clean it up the patient will initially have an INF fatory response to that that is probably worse than the condition that brought them in now of course you have the luxury of doing this in the hospital you're giving them antibiotics you're giving them IV fluids you're monitoring them so it's this is rarely a fatal event but it's nevertheless uncomfortable and in many ways that just strikes me as a great analogy for what has to happen here except it's harder in the case of trauma because one they might be less likely to come in and seek help two you have a really big hurdle to actually convincing the person that you have this abscess right and three the treatment is much harder right in many ways the treatment of the abscess is really quite simple you're going to be under anesthesia for the next couple of hours and we're going to do all this stuff and we're going to give you a bunch of antibiotics well it's a lot harder to do what you did with that woman than what I would have done with that patient yeah and I think as I'm listening to you what it makes me want to focus on is the really big hurdle right because I think the absess is it's really um it's a remarkably good analogy right because the the re Sav you the tra your response to the trauma right saved your life right right we're built to recoil and protect ourselves from dangerous things right which is why if if you you think about trauma leading to avoidance and hypervigilance right and people become more afraid of the world and less likely to engage and less likely to take chances right even if it's like the chance of a job that seems better or the chance of dating someone who seems like they could be a great partner right like Taking Chances in in good ways right that that a person becomes much less likely to do that right and if you think about how these systems grew in us right that trauma raises a lot of negative emotion in us and then we we recoil to protect ourselves right and it may be that even a depressed mood or a lot of panic attacks and Disturbed sleep like this may all go hand in hand with hypervigilance and avoidance to say look that's that is better than death right and when these systems grew in us where a lot of the trauma that that happened did tell you to stay close to home right you know when humans human development right and we're in small groups and you know if you eat something that makes you sick like never never never eat that again and you know or if you go over that hill and someone from another tribe attacks you like don't go there again right to stay closer to home they're they're there for a reason right they're part of the the evolution of human beings psychologically right over time in order to stay alive right but then in the modern world those things don't always make sense anymore right and that walled off say psychological absess right that is indeed better than death is spinning off symptom after symptom right it's making that tendency towards a little too much alcohol soothing that that person you know does a couple times a year well now they want to do it a little more because there's a desperation them right to not feel so terrified or have panic attacks when they're falling asleep and now they're drinking three four five six seven days a week right or that that tendency towards avoidance is now they can't get out of bed or leave the house like these are things I see all the time and and often what brings a person to care is a symptom right just like the person with the abscess might come to care because don't know they have an abcess exactly they just don't feel well so so the parallel is so strong there right and I think the difference is in the hurdle right that even though I might say okay wait I'm going to feel a little worse before I feel better but like oh I see that bright thing on the CT scan and you're telling me you're going to go in and take it out and I'm going to feel a lot better not just this thing that brought me in but 50 more things I didn't know about I'm much more likely to say yes to that right and the problem

[01:20:49] I think is in how high the hurdle is for for trauma and and I guess actually I I think the problem is is is is twofold it actually is in it's not as easy to recognize as the abscess but I think that it should be right that our mental health methods of coping of helping Sor should look for this in in in looking for abesses we have 256bit CT scanners that can produce a resolution of one by one by one millimeter and the analog of what you have in Psychiatry to do this is pre-ct scan era when you have to just palpate somebody's belly and surmise that they have an abscess I mean you're there's a huge I mean I don't want to use the word technology to imply that you will need technology to do this but it is effectively the difference between a catapult and a cannon but but I think maybe the beautiful answer to this is in this example we're setting forth

[01:21:49] Psychiatry is choosing to use the let's palpate the abdomen instead of the CT I completely agree yes cuz the human brain has more sophistication than even that finest CT scan right so if we apply the the trained human brain to say look I want to try and understand what's actually going on in you instead of saying oh oh you're depressed you checked all the depression boxes let me give you an anti-depressant and I'll see you again in two months and we won't make eye contact I mean like that's not helping that's not understanding right but if we apply the human brain like we apply the CT scanner right then we will identify way more trauma and say look how many times I tell a person like here's the great news is you do not have five problems right because people will present saying you can't help me there's no way you're going to help me right there been going on to me for years and

[01:22:39] I have four different problems right how are you going to help me right so here's the the great news been going on for years because it's never been looked at right so it's not surprising it goes on for years and you don't have four problems you have one right you don't have depression and sleep disturbance and panic attacks and alcohol abuse right as entirely different problems right they're arising from trauma and I may be why would I be saying that because we've had a couple of conversations where the person told me how none of those things were present before the trauma and all of those things are present after the trauma right and then that's not rocket science right so we could stop palpating the abdomen and bring in the equivalent of the CT scanner even better right the human brain right and then we can identify what's going on and we can also decrease the hurdle like why is it so daunting to get help for trauma right I mean in many ways it is scary right because the person often has been keeping it inside and and I hear this all the time too like I can't talk about that because then then they realize and often they knew all along not always but often they knew all along that that's what was going on because they could tell the whole world inside of me is different now but look at what it's doing to me and I'm not even talking about it right they don't realize look at what it's doing to you because you're not talking about it right but when you can get someone to understand that and often that comes already that's that's right there waiting because you're talking at least enough about it that the person has disclosed that there's been some trauma they put words to something they maybe never put words before and guess what the world didn't end right and I didn't lean across a table and say what like get out of my office things that people are afraid of like I was afraid after my brother's death right already there's an ex people this happens all the time say I feel better now right I already feel better because because literally after just 40 minutes say of talking about like yeah you know I really have felt different since that car accident or even since my my that thing happened to my friend's child right like like you know they know right they know but because of the shame and the idea of what are you going to do with that right they don't know that there's helping resources so we don't put it out there that there's helping resources right and people have way too many experiences of going to get help and then they come out with a prescription for an anti-depressant from somebody who didn't really talk to them and they know that's not going to help or they've already done it four times and it hasn't helped right so we create these barriers by like so many things in modern medicine by stepping away from from common sense like let's use the right helping mechanism let's use the the equivalent of the CT scan to find the absess and let's make the barrier lower so the person doesn't have to feel that it's utterly terrifying to go through this helping process once people start doing it even though it's difficult people feel good about it right they feel good about it like you feel good about doing something that's hard for you like you know like working out is really hard right but like you know you're getting healthier so you don't mind going and doing it and that's often how the experience is it's not miserable and it often surprises people that like the clinic that that you know the the the whole group of us have together like it's not a miserable place to come right and people are often surprised by that that know this is supposed to be miserable it's supposed to make them feel bad and if you come to a place that's like just reasonably nice and you meet people who are like hey I'm in the soup with you too right like I know things I'm trained that's why I can help you but but you know don't you find that in the in the short term it can be quite distressing to go back and revisit these things I mean I think that's been more my experience than not both personally and with others that it it can it really does feel a little bit like that abscess where in the in the days after that surgery in that case the the patient actually looks worse yeah absolutely like absolutely yes but because you know why and you know that it's helping you it's much more tolerable right and this happens in my own therapy I'll think gosh I've got to talk about something from the past that is now being triggered right like something happens in my present and it links me to a trauma of the past past that that like really shook my confidence and like now my anxiety level is higher and I know it's going to be hard to go in and talk about that I know it I know it's going to be painful but

[01:27:04] I'm not AF I'm not afraid of it right because I know that it's helping me just the way that that people perceive pain differently right in medical settings if they know why right and I I saw a study you probably seen around like gunshot wounds right and like people's pain being so different if they see that there's something that there was some reason right like they're trying to help somebody right and now they know that like even though like this is terrifying like they're going to survive it right and their level of pain goes down right so yes it's painful but the perception of the pain is this pain that threatens me menaces me with destruction right or is this pain that although painful is in the service of like doing right by myself right and that's often what we'll anchor to of like look I don't see a reason for you to have a dialogue running in your head where 500 times a day you tell yourself that you're that you're worthless like that doesn't seem fair or right to me you know not even sometimes you joke

[01:27:58] I don't know you you've been kidnapping buses of school children I don't know about right like is this it that that this like there's something to feel ashamed about here but it's the person who did that thing to you right or maybe there's nothing to be ashamed about here because like something just happened in life right and and it's that change inside the person that gives us all The

[01:28:17] Bravery to to go and do difficult things because we see that it's a line with truth and I think often people see Psychotherapy as like oh we're trying to shift towards something that feels better like that's not the purpose of it right the purpose is to shift towards something that's true oh and by the way that true thing feels better what do you think are the impediments um to to a person once they're presented with a plausible explanation for their symptoms in the roots of trauma what are the impediments to them doing the work that's necessary because again here's the second huge difference from the absis the absis you get to basically put an IV in your arm take some propop fall and wake up and have it be over right when you're confronted with these events of your childhood though seemingly completely disconnected from the problems you're having today as an adult are probably causally linked and we need to go back and talk about them and we need to go back and process them and we need to go back and disconnect your shame from those things there's a lot of resistance that's met there I mean last night over dinner you and I were talking about common patients whom they're you you get the feeling that they might not take treatment right right yeah I mean I think the biggest problem because you say what are the problems right and the biggest problem is presenting to a system right that is not looking to throughput and minimal short-term cost right as the primary metric of success right is that brings the frustration of not finding what's needed right and what's needed of course are skills that are learned through

[01:30:10] Education and Training right their neurobiological knowledge and pharmacological knowledge and psychotherapeutic modality knowledge right but most importantly it's it's presenting in a setting where there can be what's called a holding environment right the reason that we can do these things that are very very frightening is because we establish rapport with someone who we feel and believe wants to help us is capable of helping us doesn't want to look down on us and can help us hold the distress of it right and that's the commonality like the psychotherapeutic modalities are so very very different but if you look at primary predictors of success it lies in the Rapport because the Rapport the trust the mutuality that's generated is what creates that again that thing that's called a holding environment which she like I'm really I'm scared of this and it's intimidating but like I'm going to come here and this is a safe environment and you're a safe person and you want to help me right and I don't feel bad when I'm sitting across from you which is why me and most of the people I work with if not all acknowledge our own trauma I mean we're not talking about it in a way that serves ourselves when we're supposed to be serving someone else but I'm not pretending that I'm not a person for whom trauma isn't deeply ingrained in my life right and that sense of mutuality leads a person to feel the trust and to be able to tolerate the distress because they're not tolerating it alone and when

[01:31:30] I pack up my trauma at the end of my Psychotherapy sessions I'm going to carry that until the next time I'm going to go back in part because the person I go to for therapy makes me feel helped and understood and I know that he's going to carry it with him and he wants to help me and he feels a sense of respectful camaraderie in the in the work that we're doing and then I can bear the distress of it I can take it home with me even if it causes me some symptoms thereafter right and know that

[01:31:57] I'm going to come back next week and I'm going to make more progress but our helping systems have to be set up to do that for people otherwise let's assume those are in place okay let assum big assumption though right big assumption big assumption but let's assume that that is in place why is it that 10 people who have childhood trauma or early life trauma that is producing very maladaptive responses in their lives either with respect to self-care care of others uh you know any of the other manifestations of trauma what are the things that stand in the way of them accepting that information and moving forward first three answers are Shame Shame and more shame right that sh trauma makes a reflexive shame in us and that's what tells us to make the abscess right what's interesting is in the appendix example the abscess happens because a biological Pro process happens and now the appendix bursts right and then maybe the body can figure out a way especially if the person's leaning on the right side but can figure out a way so like that walls off but the difference here is like the creation of that absess occurs inside of us right through through our defense mechanisms right that say I've got to wall this off right

[01:33:09] I can't think about this I can't talk about this I didn't want to go to therapy after my brother's death because I was ashamed to go to therapy on top of the shame I felt about his death right so we do it to ourselves because that's what seems like the course of action that's safest right and that's very very powerful when we're promoting that process and then because things aren't going well we sort of wall off that absis more and more and more right because other shameful things happen like after my brother's death when I wasn't functioning super well and I didn't feel like I was taking good care of myself I felt ashamed of that too right which then makes it harder to get help right so shame which is like the primary henchman of trauma right my view comes along with all these other accompli like shame loves alcohol excess right shame loves an internal dialogue that tells you that you're not worth anything you're not going to get anywhere right there are all these these things that shame loves that we then cultivate in ourselves and we we apply to further Walling off further pushing that problem down and that's why it that's why the best route is not just okay let's shift how we're handling the care so if you go to see some someone about whatever your symptom is that person is actually thinking about you but we do need in my very strong belief to change the sociological aspects of this right to look and say like look many many many of us have really significant trauma that is that is has overwhelmed our coping skills changes how we view about ourselves and the safety of the world around us and it really behooves us to look at this and there's no shame in this right I remember this was a bunch of years ago but I was talking to a group about 300

[01:34:54] Physicians right from mixed backgrounds mixed disciplines and and I said this right I said that I've had like really significant trauma in my life and like psychiatric care and psychiatric medicines have really helped me right and I could see out in the audience like probably about a third or so is a rough estimate of people are like like shock like that I I had said something that was so shameful right as if you know the next thing that was going to happen is like someone's going to fly through the air and tackle me right and you know pull my medical license out of my pocket and and and you know put me someplace where where where people go who need those things and I said I mean look this is a problem right because I can see and

[01:35:34] I hadn't planned on this right I had it planned I I I said it's a problem because I see like a lot of you really recoiling from this right and and I'm saying something that I don't think takes away from my ability to be a competent physician or a competent person in the world right and and I and I think in fact being able to say it is what helps me navigate the world right but if we recoil from like oh you might need help right or you might need medicines like what what is going on inside of us that means How likely are any of those doctors to get themselves help right and How likely are their patients to feel comfortable if they bro something traumatic right to hear something back that even if the person's not in mental health right but just say wow okay look we know that way more than 50% of complaints to General Medical providers come from mental health conditions right I mean the studies show you know a bottom of 50% and a ceiling that's significantly higher than that so so non-mental Health Providers have to be aware and not respond in this way and again I'm not trying to be critical but but you see that response even in mental health like some of those people who were coiled were almost certainly in mental health right and we have to change the so to speak the soup we're swimming in toward the soup that says like what do we have why should we be ashamed of this right like don't we have to knowledge this otherwise the negatives inside of us including the anger and frustration that I think promotes all the dysfunction and our political discourse for example like all of this comes to the for in sociological ways so if we don't look at this How likely are we to help people get help and then if we don't do that do we make everything worse in our inability to come to even a decision about like what's factual and what's not factual as we all as a society try and navigate things like like racial issues or discrimination based upon gender or sexuality or the climate crisis like how are we going to look at that if we don't look at what's going on inside of us that often involves the anger and frustration that make people just say need to be right and like I'm saying this is always where it goes a lot of the dysfunction and the misery most of it gets turned inward to in people but some of it does get turned outward and I think we see the manifestations of that in the real degeneration of our discourse as a society what is the antidote to shame the antidote to shame is understanding right and I view the the the laning of that aspect uh sorry the the Lancing of the abscess right or the surgical excision of the absess that's the equivalent of shining a light on shame right that that shame is so powerful it's like you know the old um it kind of gets told a lot but it actually happened when I was a a kid like there was a clothed tree right in the the in the room where I my I me and my brother slept right and if you turn the lights off it could look like a monster right and and like I know it was a closed tree but it's a little kid like it gets scarier is that really a closed tree it looks like a monster it gets scarier and scarier and scarier right and then if I start screaming and crying and my parents come in and turn the light on oh I see that it's just it's not a monster right and and that's shame if we if we if we turn our eyes away from it which is exactly what it tells us to do you can't share that even with yourself right let alone with someone you love let alone someone professional right it's your fault that that happened to you right you should have dressed differently you should have not been in that place you should have been better and someone wouldn't have hurt you right you should have been different and people wouldn't have treated you so poorly when you were way back when in school right these are the the things that shame tells us like the devil on the shoulder telling us why we have to hide it away and then it gets scarier and scarier and when we go and shed light on it I have never worked with one person I cannot call mind a single case where shedding light on shame and all around it right looking in all the dark corners of it right and really bringing it to light in in a process that has its moments of fear and misery but also has its moments of levity right and also has its moment of bringing good memories to the four like being able to shed the light on light on that has never been anything but extremely helpful to the person doing it but all the impact of

[01:39:50] Shame tells us not to do that and Society really kind of goes along with that and the health systems that want to shuttle us through with a prescription for Prozac you know collude in that right so Society colludes with shame in in preventing uh way too many of us from ever getting a handle on our trauma when it's actually not rocket science to do so so if you shine that light on shame and the person now realizes why they feel a certain way right the reason I feel so inadequate is because of these events or this event and because of this inadequacy I go and do this other thing how do you change the feeling so step one is understanding why but then step two has to be you have to actually change that feeling don't you right yes and the answer to that is you work on it across time right we live in a society that so wants rapid results right and that's why we throw medicines at so so many things throughout the whole field of medicine that we shouldn't throw medicines at right oh you're not healthy well take this medicine this medicine this medicine we don't say like have a change your diet exercise I mean things that you you know you understand as well as anyone on the planet right we we don't do that so we look to short-term fixes right and we all well we know through our just even basic education and brain biology right that the neurons that fire together wire together right so so if you and I picked the word out of the blue and we decide let's say it over 500 times right then of course like we'll each be saying it like tonight right it'll be in our heads tomorrow morning right what if we say that word 5,000 times right it'll be in your head next week right so so if we say things to ourselves and we have a way of conceptualizing ourselves that we've overly reinforced it will not go away overnight right but we don't tell people that right so when a person comes to it like a a really say an understanding

[01:41:54] Milestone of like oh my God right the shame isn't mine like I was six years old the shame is that person who hurt me right that that part of how I make sure we end that session is all those thoughts and the feelings attached to those thoughts and it's the feelings that make the difference right are not going to go away right they will still be there with you because the only way they go away is they attenuate over time right and you've scored a victory today that disempowered them right that when those thoughts come like oh you're worth nothing and that was your fault and if you'd been better that wouldn't have happened to you like you say wait a second I don't actually believe that right I can't keep it out of my head but

[01:42:33] I'm going to put you back thought I'm going to direct my thoughts away from you more quickly and there's a whole bunch of strategies around that then I'm going to put you back a little bit less powerful than how you came and we don't as a rule we do not talk to people in that way and then people feel terrible and they feel ashamed and often they're practitioners think they failed the treatment and like everyone now looks at this negatively because oh two 3 four weeks later they're not better there's no way on God's Earth they were going to be better after 2 three four weeks like something that's developed over years doesn't go away that quickly right but if we engage in that process and we take away what the fear right because otherwise if the person feels better they have this aha moment right and then they go home and they're getting in bed and the same thought goes you know tomorrow's are going to be better than today because you're not worth anything right they no now they feel awful that that thing that happened today doesn't mean anything right so you have to prepare that person that like absolutely you can be better but it's going to take place over time you don't have to be afraid when those thoughts are still in your in your minds I've had people I've worked with who say started their treatment even before I met them right and they had among the most severe repeated negative thoughts and feelings inside of them and they may have been doing really well for 10 20 years right but you put them under enough stress and enough triggering and it'll still come in that oh you're nothing and you should kill yourself still comes into their mind right but now they know well enough they be like wow that stuff dies hard as one person said that stuff dies hard not afraid of it one little bit because that person understands that he said that thing to himself a 100 thousand times and guess what it's still going to come back every now and then doesn't mean anything doesn't have anything to say to that person doesn't carry one little bit of information right and now that person isn't afraid of it not saying oh my gosh am I going to hurt my they don't they they know no but you we have to educate people and and the mental health field doesn't doesn't put very much value in what's gets called psycho education

[01:44:30] Let's Help Let's help you understand yourself and I think that's also a lot of what I do psycho education through the lens of understanding trauma I think if you told me I could only do one thing I can't maybe I can't prescribe medicines anymore I can't do depth Psychotherapy I can't use multiple modalities I can only do one thing and I got to choose I think I would choose psycho education about trauma because then man you arm people with knowledge they didn't have before and they can go help themselves they can get help from people who are close to them they can maybe get professional help but it's that knowledge that helps us even if there's no professional help to be had which is also a point of the book that I want anyone who picks that book up to be able to read their way through it and to end up on the on the end of it with knowledge and education they didn't have before because that I think is what is most impactful and whatever a person does with that which may be limited by time circumstances resources all sorts of other things they're they're now equipped to do something good with it and the field generally does not do that you know when

[01:45:30] I think about our practice um I I think about all of the dimensions of Health span so when I use the word longevity I'm referring to two things lifespan how long you live and health span how well you live right and within Health span there's really three dimensions there's a cognitive Dimension uh which I think most people kind of understand right how sharp is their brain and most people can understand what the extreme loss of that looks like in the form of dementia then there's a physical Dimension the structural

[01:46:00] Dimension uh you know your ability to be free of pain your ability to carry out activities of daily living and your ability to do the things that you enjoy doing physically and then there's an emotional component to this right um so even though some people would touchy feely call this Mind Body Spirit I I I really like to think of it as cognitive physical exoskeleton and emotional I think this is the I think it's that emotional bucket that is the hardest one for us in our practice to help patients with right because one we don't have a great set of screening tools we have really good screening tools for these other ones and by the way on the whole lifespan side we have lots of great scen screening tools we have biomarkers and MRI scanners and liquid biopsies and colonoscopies I mean we're we're very good at trying to ident ify the things that will end your life in a binary fashion from a cardiorespiratory standpoint yep we're not very good at identifying the things that are going to end your life emotionally you know I'm working on a book that's a day late a dollar short it'll be out there eventually uh but in it I talk about four types of death the first one being the one that people think of cardiorespiratory pulmonary death like the the what I call death certificate death but then I talk about these three other deaths cognitive death so the really the the death of the ability of the brain the decline of the ability of the brain with respect to you know processing speed short-term memory long-term memory executive function the the physical or exoskeleton death or demise which is basically that which leaves a person in pain and unable to carry out these activities of daily living and then this emotional death and these three types of other death types 2 three and four often precede one in in some ways the perfect life would be a long life that just goes straight to type one death without detouring through type two type three and type four but tragically that's almost never the case and so we think so much about how to identify and treat type two type three and type four but by far the one in which we are the most limited is this identification of type four and part of it is is I think shame there's no question right part of it is inadequacy of tools so for example when it comes to identifying type two or type three let's use the physical one we have so many ways that we assess people for movement and strength and balance and stability and stamina and all of these things and usually once people are confronted with how bad they are because almost always relative to our standards for where we want people to be most people fall woefully short but they can see oh this is where I should be if I subscribe to your you know ethos that to be a really

[01:49:01] Kick-Ass 100y old I need to be a doubly Kick-Ass 50y old um and here are the steps that we're going to take to train to get you there but I've for years now wanted to think how could we do that same sort of screening around emotional health and how would it be received and how how would we then Implement therapy because really a person who's doing very well on the type one type two and type three meaning they have no chronic diseases they have no acute diseases their mind is sharp their body is great but they're a slave to some shame that's rooted in trauma they can often have the most miserable life and really how long they live becomes completely irrelevant in fact it almost becomes paradoxically a curse it's just more time to suffer um a lot of these people of course are not obviously suffering right so it's very easy to see a person living in a crack house with needle tracks in their arm and say are you suffering yes I mean that's not a huge cognitive leap there external markers that we can make that conclusion with a high degree of and and they're probably self-aware enough but when you take something body who's actually quite Successful by all the metrics of the external world they're successful financially they have a wonderful family all these other things it usually takes a bit of prodding for them to acknowledge and you have to be astute enough to prod and realize that actually all is not well so I'm not a psychiatrist how do

[01:50:50] I bring our evaluation of what I call type four death or demise up to the level of our ability to evaluate the other three the first thing I have to say is you've been kind enough to share with me some excerpts from the book and and when your book comes out it will be anything but a daylight in a dollar short and and

[01:51:09] I think you're you're talking about these these aspects of life that are just so so important in ways that we can understand like am I taking care of myself in the way I want to am I am I paying attention to my life in the way that I want to and and yes that emotional aspect of it can is the hardest identify as you said there aren't serological markers for it and and often the the truth of what may be going on is underneath the surface and and I would say that actually you know you already do the things there are to do and like we could talk about how might it be formalized right but I I think of like when you may refer someone to me right and like why is that right and

[01:51:53] I me you tell me if this seems right but but my thought yeah I guess I would say this I think we do a better job than most um I guess what I'm really getting at is why can't we be doing better right why is it that there are some patients whom I suspect there's an issue but as I Broach it there's complete denial right or there's other patients who on the surface will accept it but then we can't get them to engage in it right right see

[01:52:23] I I think right the processes that you're going through so again my what do I think you're doing right and you tell me this makes sense is I think that you're looking for people whose whose actual behavioral choices are running countercurrent to what they're presenting for right and you know people are presenting to you because they want to be the healthiest they can be right so it's a little bit maybe the health systems are less like that right people are presenting us with problems right so you will see if if someone presents you say the reason I'm here is I want to be as healthy as I can be and then you see that they're not actually behaving that way right or they're behaving in a way that kind of thwarts that right and then that will trigger like ah like there's something is going on here right because otherwise why would those vectors not all be heading in the same direction right good mental health is always consistent with Simplicity in all of us right so if I would like to be healthy and I come to a healthy healthy Health assisting Resource One would presume I'm going to act in ways that assist that resource in assisting me straightforward right if we're not acting that way then it points like there's something going on that's not consistent with that sort of simple um almost Common Sense understanding of how to make our lives better and that will Point towards something in the mental health Spectrum right which which the vast majority of times has its roots in trauma so if you see people running countercurrent to their stated goals right or the second I think there are kind of two occasions on which we we see people coming from your practice right the other might be if on discussion the person is sharing something about their inner world that's not consistent with what you're necessarily seeing on the outside right and then their sharing of that dissonance right then leads to ah there's something going on here that it's affecting them emotionally right even if they are still trying to be healthy right but there's some toll that's taking then under the surface that you want to understand better and guide in the right direction and the thought would be we could deploy that in sort of formalized manners in our

[01:54:24] Medical Health settings right so the person who like really wants to stay alive because they love their grand kids but they have diabetes and this is their third hospital admission in two years right and you say okay like that that person doesn't want this to happen like they like their life and they and they have they're grounded to these reasons of like being healthy and staying alive but they can't act that way right and and to look at that and say like maybe there are logistical barriers right like maybe there are non-trauma related barriers to them like getting to care taking medicines like we can look very hard at that and then very often I think where that process can arrive at is there's something that's preventing that person from taking care of themselves right and then there is the light bulb that is ah there's something here for the mental health you for for the mental health aspect of helping right or if and actually talking to someone whose life appears to be going well on the outside but like is your inner World consistent with your outer world right and there are ways of that of formalizing this potentially in your own practice setting right but then in the broader settings of of sort of non-mental Health helping right so look for vectors that run countercurrent to the person's stated and healthy intentions right and try and get some assessment of what's going on in the person's inner world right because even if things are going well in the outer world but these problems are there in the inner World they they they represent risks for the future right and again I come back to like it's not that hard to do and I think that you're just reflexively doing this right because you're in a sense applying common sense of you know in the practice is if there's something here that seems outside of the fold I'm operating in that seems mental health then you make a referral right but the the health health systems in our society as a whole can be doing this to help people because it's not that hard to take stock of someone's inner state if you if you know if you sit down and talk with and you establish the right Rapport or to call out when they're acting countercurrent with their stated intentions and a lot of times the

[01:56:29] General Medical Systems kind of push that under the rug because they don't know what to do about it right so they keep trying to treat the diabetes as best they can with some knowledge in their head that like you know this this lovely person who wants to be healthy isn't really on board with this right but if you don't know what to do about that or the last 10 referrals you've made to mental health haven't yielded anything cuz 3 months down the road the person got a Prozac prescription and they no better right then there there's a sense of futility to it and again I think if we come back to well-rounded Common Sense approaches it doesn't it's not all that complicated and it doesn't have to be that esoteric do you do you think there will be a day when shame is out in the open right because I mean that's really what this comes down to right you have the stigma of trauma and then you have the the the the vector of shame that works so effectively at keeping it in the dark right and what do a world look like in which the light switch gets turned on and shame has to retreat to the corner and cower as opposed to let its Cape sit over that that which needs to be exposed you I think a big part of that is an education process in our societies right that I think should start when you say education what do you mean does this is this something that occurs in schools is this something that occurs in medic schools is this something that is for doctors only I mean where you know should police be aware of this I mean like how how broad a net do you cast sure I think you cast a very broad net and I think it's not that hard to do that so I think it starts in Early

[01:58:07] Education right when you when you talk about what goes on in people when they feel bad right when something makes them feel good what happens inside of you what do you do with that feeling right help the bully understand why he or she is bullying right when we're when we're in first or second grade because go let's help that person understand and look at that person how would that be done I mean that would require teachers now understanding this right yeah I think we we do educate the professionals like we educate the doctors we educate the teachers I mean there's so much that we do in the education processes that I don't think I'm saying well let's bolt on some process that tries to turn everyone into a therapist right but but there's so many things that are done you think about in medicine like how many checklists how much paperwork they've done this utterly completely non-contributory and everybody knows it right why not an approach that's not paperwork intensive or time intensive right that just looks at look at part of trying to understand somebody is thinking about them through this framing right and and structuring the Mental

[01:59:09] Health Resources so that there is a place to send someone right there's a place where you can have basic conversations about what's going on inside of them that then Gates the care right there are ways we can do this that involve pretty basic education that can change again this idea of the whole soup that we're swimming in right where we start with Early Education right and we run that through educating professionals right educating police educating legal systems right they're mental health courts now I mean they're they're not nearly as widespread as they should be but we are trying to educate doctors in the legal process and the education process but we're not prioritizing it with a sense of urgency right it can be different but we've got to look at it and we've got to say yeah this is worth paying attention to right is this what's in large part or in very significant part driving that we have now over 100,000 drug deaths in this country over the course of a year like why do we not feel a sense of urgency and and want to look at our the the way that we provide help right and to say do do what we're doing does what we're doing that drive doctors to burnout right which is a term that I can't stand I mean when I grew up burn out was a negative term to say about somebody well they couldn't handle it right and now they're just in a corner smoking cigarettes doing their own thing like that was an insult to someone and now we level that at doctors who are often traumatized by the health systems that they work in and the unreasonable expectations and that they're treating charts and computers all the time and don't have enough time with their patients like why do we not look at this and say has this gone mad right that we spend more money than any developed country on Healthcare yet we have the worst outcomes and we're the worst about things that involve direct contact with humans preventive aspects of Health Care treatment over time like why can't we look at this with a sense of urgency that says oh this isn't working right and then I think at the other end people who who other people look to and and have a sense of respect for that will talk about their own trauma right as you know in some very small way like I'm trying to do right and you do right and Tim Ferris has done and even Stephanie gerat so Lady Gaga who is kind to write the forward for the book that she talks about her humanness right that that we all no matter who we are are susceptible to this so from the one end people who have any power whatsoever and Authority need to not shrink away from this so if I'm giving a talk to a bunch of doctors right I'm not going to pretend that I don't have any trauma right so so yes we need we I think responsibility to be open and honest about the things that have impacted us if we have any public presence whatsoever right let alone if a person has a big public presence so if that can be done safely and reasonably for the person of course so that's one aspect of it and the other aspect is is the the most important is on this

[02:02:10] Grassroots level of of changing how we frame mental health in the world around us and starting to get us curious about it at very early stage stages of life you know when that bully tells you that you know you're lousy because of what you look like or where you come from right that then what what what does that make you feel and let's start looking at that reflexive sense of Shame right okay can you stop and and think about that right like you feel bad right when that happens and what happens next well you feel bad about yourself right okay let's put a full stop there right like that person's hurting you because he feels bad about himself right like like and you don't so then you start to put a barrier right between the reflex of

[02:02:55] Shame right and the person feeling bad about themselves cuz how many people don't actually logically feel bad about themselves right but they but they do actually feel bad about themselves and it's the feeling that matters not the facts right and we've got to start looking at that because that is the plain and obvious truth that pervades the society around us and we are doing a very poor job of developing understanding in us as individuals at any stage of life and as a society and I can't believe that we're not seeing the dysfunction in the social Rifts that we're having in the ineffectiveness of the whole of our medical system right these are these are Big all-encompassing aspects of our society and we see hey these things are not going well right and if we look at the roots of it I think it's clear where a lot of it is coming from and also what we can do about it which is why I feel the book is ultimately uplifting I mean I'm pointing out problems but I'm not pointing them out in some way of like pointing them out and then well we don't know what to do about it right I mean I'm pointing out solutions that I think are quite simple and well- grounded and if we just follow them through that's resonating with people because I think it does resonate with common sense a moment ago you alluded to a statistic that uh I think for many people is just almost impossible to

[02:04:14] Fathom which is the United States has just for the first time ever surpassed uh a 100,000 person mortality for a 12mon period so 100,000 people have overdosed in the United States for the first time in 12 months do you see this as an epidemic of trauma and shame or do you see this as really just a new um Escape valve for it based on the availability of cheap and unfortunately highly potent opioids yeah I think it's a combination of both and I think the data tells us that that more and more people are feeling desperate and disenfranchised right are feeling like look I can't make my way in the world right whatever My Chosen route of endeavor is I can't make a living in that right I can't support a family in that I can't get ahead I can't feel good about myself right and we see that in aspects of like almost the entire service industry right which has which has changed to a place where people can't have careers that then support their lives and support a family like was the case even 20 20-some years ago right we see that even people who have good jobs right who feel like okay I finally got my way through I worked hard enough I have a good job that often that job is running them ragged in a way that they can't take care of themselves and they can't take care of their families and they feel the same desperation as a person who doesn't have a job right and this desperation builds anger and frustration and resentment and all these other symptoms depression and panic that spin off of it right and that makes it much more appealing to soothe in the short term like that's a basic psychological fact of human beings right the more pain you're in in the short term the more you're going to choose a short-term solution without any consideration to the long term right I mean if I'm absolutely desperately miserable and you've got something that can make me better right now you know

[02:06:05] I'm not going to ask what that may do to me tomorrow right so we have developed a society that has become more and more and more hard-hearted right towards people's attempts to make their way in the world right and I think we see that with the response the pandemic of you know I'm going to respond in the way that I want and I don't really care about you right and and like we've seen enough of that that um you know cringe at times at our like our inability to to even have basic compassion for others which of course isn't everyone right but like I think that's present in society in ways that it wasn't before and I think it's reflected in the rhetoric and the dialogue that's acceptable right that not that long ago the way people often behave who have a public presence right would have led to censure by everyone that that would say hey I I don't even care that you're advocating for what I want or even for me directly like I can't support you if you're going to behave that way talk that way denigrate people that way like we've moved far away from that right and we need to look at what are we doing in the world around us right how are we handling ourselves and are we indirectly promoting the this ethic of not really caring right that leads to the desperation that leads people to soothe with drugs right there's a very maab it's not even it's a a joke it's a it's a it's it's a tragic atrocity right that people will say oh I'm you know gosh I have four people who are drug addicted in my PR

[02:07:42] I'm going to see this afternoon or you know or 10 people right and um you know it's not who it used to be right because before it was people who' sifted down to places in society where really turned their backs on them now it's people from all walks of life right and and we see that socioeconomic demographic educational demographic geographic demographic um uh racial religious or ethnic concept there we've gone beyond that right where where now we're all menaced by this right because there's often a desperation to soothe that there wasn't that shot through every demographic we have and if we continue to turn away from that fact then we continue to look at statistics like that and say oh my gosh how horrible okay right like we don't do anything about it right which is which is a tcid acceptance of it right if we don't look at what are we doing to people that drives them to desperation right then we're not going to make that statistic better and how much has gone on behind closed doors in the pandemic how much violence behind closed doors neglect behind closed doors drug and alcohol abuse behind closed doors are we going to look more at this or are we going to just pay lip service to looking at it right while we don't actually change anything and then we'll be going oh my gosh it's so terrible it's three years from now that numbers 140,000 right well if we don't really care now as a society we just want to Marvel at the number and say how bad it is and do nothing well it's exactly where we're going to go that's why the number has been increasing right I mean it's not rocket science to say that either you just you just extrapolate that line ahead and that gets worse and not better unless we look at it in a way where we accept like we got to do something different right because this is staggering in the human misery that it speaks to not just 100,000 people lost not just I mean not just 100,000 people what about all the people who love those 100,000 people like what are we doing right which is why when people would say oh like sometimes I'll get approach like

[02:09:40] I'm in a I'm doing something that's very Niche right like I'm interested in trauma right it's like no this is not a niche right this you get up to numbers like that right there's a Cascade through the population right and it doesn't have to be like this that our burdens of trauma just grow and grow and grow we should be appalled by that number appalled enough to do something about it Paul a lot of times um we treat people based on the symptom of their trauma or we at least categorize them that way and this is even within the lens of helping people and acknowledging their trauma so for example um addiction is a very common manifestation of trauma and um the most obvious of those or at least the one that probably gets most people's attention would be substance addiction right alcohol or drugs but there's work addiction there's process addiction there's gambling addiction there's sex addiction there are actually lots of other types of addictions but we could bucket those as addictions there's codependencies there's anger um perfectionism other means of control we talked about eating disorders it seems that one way to think about this is treating people together who have similar end States so you go to a 12-step meeting because if it's you know AA it's people with alcohol if it's alanon it's family members of people with alcohol if it's na it's narcotics if it's essay Etc sex has anyone ever thought about doing the opposite which is rather than take everybody whose issue is alcohol addiction and having them come to a meeting which by the way I'm not advocating against what if we treated people what if we bundled people together through the common lens of what the trauma was yes is that is that something that's ever been thought about and would that be more or less efficacious than the current approach in other words you have a meeting which has lots of people in it who have very different manifestations of their trauma you're going to have

[02:11:52] Al someone who's addicted to alcohol someone who's a workaholic someone who's a rageaholic someone who's a completely codependent someone who's got debilitating anxiety someone who's got debilitating depression but what they all have in common is they were completely neglected by their parents that's their common threat would there be any advantage to doing that or would it is it better the way we typically think of doing it yeah I think there's a huge advantage to that and when at one point I was medical director for a clinic and we had we had programs running for helping groups right and it was it was by and large was all around substances but I I wouldn't separated it by what the substance was I think we even get that fine now we're going to separate by what the substance is Right alcohol versus narcotics right and and even at that level right let alone at the higher levels of this person is angry this person is addicted to unhealthy Foods right there's so many ways in which the The Addictive processes can take hold of our brain brains in order to provide some short-term sense of control or short-term relief from the desperation of feeling out of control right and when we parse that out too much then again we're just trying to check boxes and we're telling that person that you know what you have this this thing that is in a sense your burden to carry is so much about you right well I'm an alcoholic and I'm a rageaholic right and and there's just the very language we use about that is often so stigmatizing that's the thing that's bad about you right like that's often the message again not always but that's often the message that it sends as opposed to like none of us comes out of the womb right an alcoholic or rageaholic or addicted to unhealthy Foods right they have like look what's happened to us along the way right that leads us to this place and that's how we make a search for commonality right so so we we have a set of processes that want to further parse things out right we're so overly reduction right that often times we would see where the person who was an alcoholic would feel like well I don't want to sit in the room with a with the person who's addicted to cocaine like we don't as if there's like nothing in common right as as opposed to like yeah what's what is in common because I knew that Health histories of those people right because

[02:14:08] I was the the medical director of the clinic right and and I would say right what what is 80% commonality as a driving force amongst everybody is trauma right and and and that's just here if you step further back you see that across the things that we we get short-term relief from at the expense of our long-term health and it's the over reductionism I think is a facet of wanting to just put things in little buckets and then gaining some satisfaction from that right but now okay now all it's is is in a bucket and actually being in that much of a bucket right you know like a marble that goes down right is like now you can't get to it right or you can't get to what's real about it instead of like you what going on in a lot of people say at least is trauma can we put those people together and look at trauma which ironically is what the real sophisticated helping resources around trauma are doing right

[02:15:01] I mean that's often what say the bridge to recovery is doing it's looking at like hey what is your trauma right okay now let's go forward from there right but you know that's because they're bringing a sophistication to it and people who do that work just reflexively know that they know that that that that's not different you can look at people who are addicted to One Thing versus another and you're not finding massive differences between them and you know the aspects of our the science of it all catching up with it shows that right it's hijacking the same Machinery in the brain and you know you can't tell the difference not like one substance looks different from another in the brain or one thing a person is addicted to for relief of distress so it's like we know all of it but we have these entrenched ways of looking at it through the lens of of how Medical Care is or how Society views it and we're so far beyond the science right and I will say this that you know I'll say this a fair amount that if you're in a very um welldefined uh field of medicine like say Cardiology or so where like we kind of know how to assess people how to understand people there's a lot of data behind the interventions if you're practicing like you know even just a couple years ago like that's not okay and one will identify that right and and that's not okay right and we'll have to change that right but in mental health the practice within individual practitioners and the systems can be

[02:16:24] Antiquated by a half a century right you know or a couple thousand years in some cases and like we don't come in and look at that right there are programs that are taking care of people for opiate dependence that don't even talk to them about a medicine that you can get a shot of that prevents you from overdosing when you leave right like it's somehow okay not to even talk about that right because we let all of this lag behind and yes part of it is I think how the field has handled it and the science isn't as welldeveloped but it's not like there's no science and it's not like there's no obviousness to what we could be doing that we're just simply not doing and I think a big part of that is the stigma the shame that we don't want to come in and look at all of it and and say there's an obvious here that we're just not paying attention to because if the shame is shot through humans then it is also shot through the humans who are making those decisions resource allocation and and how how do we approach the helping process changing gears for a second Paul the final thing I want to kind of ask you about is um the role of two substances in particular psilocybin and

[02:17:38] MDMA both of which I've talked about in previous podcasts as they pertain to trauma I'm curious as to what your experiences with this and maybe more importantly what is your optimism around around these two molecules um both of which are really moving quite along a pathway towards a clinical approval a legalization uh for clinical use um in the case of MDMA it is for in fact PTSD right um so kind of curious as to whether you see that as an amazing adjunct to what we're talking about or a slight adjunct or potentially less I see it as among the the the brightest sort of shining hopes for the future and and I think the the data both from decades ago and the the more recent data and the clinical experience and trials and the the firsthand reports like tell us things that are so incredibly powerful and that fit with a lot of what we've thought about and understood about brain biology and about psychology right there's a way in which it provides so much greater potential for understanding and helping and and of course you know there are the the the processes in place so that these very very powerful tools can be understood and deployed safely and effectively and in the context of all of that I think that the hope is immense and and a story

[02:19:13] I'll tell sometimes to try to capture that is you know where I grew up was close to the Delaware rtin Canal you know in colonial times it ran between New York and Philadelphia was part of a network and and you know I was always fascinated that that like artifacts would be found there somebody to be fishing and find a vase or something right and and it was like a maze right these barges went up and down and like what's in there right and you know people would find things and that was interesting but then at some point in time they drained a whole section of it right and when the section was drained my goodness what they found and what they saw right and and it's the same kind of analogy that I think the helping po of these substances are are so strong that they can get us to places of really seeing what's going on inside of us and shifting how those brain Pathways which have been so changed and again the science tells us this this is not esoteric we have more science that is similar to what you know the CAT scan can do for the for the appendix to see that being able to do that with these helping modalities allows for understanding and is so um predisposes to and is permissive of change in ways that can let people reorient much much faster so I think there's a potential here for even a revolution within the field but we have to safely and effectively incorporate those arrows into the quiver right and then we see of course what is often seen which is many of the people or organizations wielding that that have you know the magic amulet of like I am the source of the helping resources don't like this right so we see some aspects of traditional psychiatric care that don't like this and I think that's through a sense of threat that that I think the power of these resources make a lot of the tools that I wield seem maybe a little bit ptry in comparison right now that's not always the case and if that is the case wonderful right their new powerful tools coming to the four we need to approach it those of us in Western medicine through a lens of being respectful of what that is and wanting to understand the new modalities and and approaching it from a lens that says look if I'm going to help people and I'm going to hold myself forth as knowing how to do so then I better know what all the arrows in the quiver are and understand them enough that I can either deploy them or I can understand who can deploy them right in a way that does Justice to the person coming in the door right if

[02:21:48] I'm coming in the door for help I don't care what it is I want the person who's going to help me to have all the possible arrows in their quiver and I think we can get to a place of incorporating this but again society and the helping systems have to bend a little bit to acknowledge the incredible potential and then we work towards integrating instead of splitting and like we're in a societal mode in this country that's very much splitting whether it's sociological it's political um and even medical right and I think again I come back to the basic theme of

[02:22:21] I think it's trauma that leads us to reject new helping resources because they may be threatening to our power within a discipline right and that by by regrounding to really the first principles of knowledge and of helping then I think we again come back to an urgency to ground ourselves to the basic common sense of understanding everything that can be helpful and having all of those arrows in the quiver of Health

[02:22:45] Systems or of to the extent possible individual practitioners Paul always it's it's great to to sit down with you and especially in a case like this where it's not just me you're talking to but but so many other people who I I I suspect will really benefit from this tell people again the title of your book and other other places they can look to find resources sure sure the title of the book is trauma the invisible epidemic and you can find it if you just

[02:23:12] Google me Paul kti or the clinic I work in which is specific Premiere group you'll come up with links that talk a little bit about the book or um or the principles contained uh therein and there's so many good helping resources around Nami uh is one of them uh that across the country has and and sorry what is that Nami what's that yeah so

[02:23:34] Nai so a great access to resources often on a local level that there's so much help to be had um and some of that help we can access in our own homes right we can access through people that we love and who love us we can access by thinking about what's going on inside of us and others and and I think that's such a part of the message that I want to deliver that it just isn't esoteric and and if we ground to what's really going on inside of us and paying attention to it and and in a sense being brave enough to face it because we see hope in facing it that we can begin a process of of really helping ourselves and others and and I've just seen that unfold so so many times including in myself that I really believe in it and

[02:24:19] I'm so glad that we've had this conversation that that is about some of the the the real big picture of it and and some of the more um you know the more kind of rarified medical aspects of it and I think a real understanding of it runs the whole gamut but is ground in that Simplicity of what's really needed and what's important to help ourselves and to help other people and I so appreciate you having me on and having such a good friend who's also such a good colleague and helps this discussion unfold in a way that um really helps get the message out there because we all need the message thank you Paul you're welcome thank you thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription now to that end membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally kickass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic paper person thing we discuss on each episode the word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these monthly AMA episodes or ask me anything episodes hearing these episodes completely access to our private podcast Fe that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to spiels like this the qualies which are a super short podcast that we release every Tuesday through Friday highlighting the best questions topics and tactics discussed on previous episodes of the drive this is a great way to catch up on previous episodes without having to go back and necessarily listen to everyone steep discounts on products that I believe in but for which I'm not getting paid to endorse and a whole bunch of other benefits that we continue to trickle in as time goes on if you want to learn more and access these member only benefits you can head over to Peter atd.com SLS subscribe you can find me on Twitter
