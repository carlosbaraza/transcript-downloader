## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast:

**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**:
This episode features Dr. TR (developmental behavioral pediatrician) discussing autism, ADHD, and anxiety in children. The conversation covers diagnostic criteria, treatment approaches, and the challenges in delivering comprehensive care. Key themes include the importance of personalized care, understanding the "why" behind behaviors, and the need for integrated medical-educational approaches. The discussion emphasizes that diagnoses are tools to help understand and support children, rather than rigid labels.

**2. KEY MEDICAL/SCIENTIFIC POINTS**:
- Autism heritability is 70-98%, highest among psychiatric conditions [33:47]
- About 50% of children with autism also have ADHD [1:06:32]
- Approximately 40% of children with autism have anxiety [1:07:20]
- Autism prevalence has increased from 1 in 150-200 in 2000 to 1 in 36 in 2020 [28:57]
- Three levels of autism spectrum disorder were established in DSM-5 (2013) [53:44]

**3. HEALTH OPTIMIZATION TIPS**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Focus on understanding the "why" behind behaviors before treatment [1:10:22]
- Consider behavioral interventions before medication for young children [1:44:38]
- Implement parent training as a crucial component of treatment [1:23:39]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For ADHD under age 6, behavioral parent training is first-line treatment [1:45:20]
- For ADHD age 6+, combination of medication and behavioral training is recommended [1:45:20]

[00:00:00] so it's really important to think about the why it was actually one of the things when I when I left like the traditional medical model and started my clinic one of the things that I really noticed when I was making that transition and one of the one of the things I wanted to remember when I started to work with families in my clinic was that it's not just about the diagnosis it's the it's the journey afterwards and it's really about personalized care and you can make such a big difference in child development human well-being by really understanding that specific child and unfortunately sometimes when you're on the treadmill in a medical model it's really hard to have the time to really get to know a child and I felt like I was you know you have autism here's a list of 15 recommendations good luck and you have

[00:00:51] ADHD here's a list of 15 recommendations good luck without really getting to know the why behind that child's Behavior hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA well TR thank you so much for coming all the way out to Austin um really nice to meet with you in person I've heard a lot of things about you from various colleagues in the Bay Area and you know frankly this is just a topic that I think a lot of people are interested in obviously many of them parents but I just think people in general are kind of interested um and so maybe just before we jump into it let's spend just a couple of minutes on your background so people understand who you are and why I wanted to spend so much time with you so um you trained in Pediatrics

[00:01:40] Developmental and Behavioral uh well let's just let me not try to summarize what you've done tell tell me what you've done okay um well I uh initially did an undergrad and master's degree in genetics and then went on to medical school um after medical school I uh went on and did a residency in Pediatrics But ultimately uh wanted to do developmental behavioral pediatrics uh for numerous reasons because it just was a really good fit with my interests and passions um so I did actually a year in uh pediatric neurology and then a full Fellowship in developmental behavioral pediatrics before moving to

[00:02:23] California and your interests today primarily revolve around behavioral therapy for three things that we're going to spend quite a bit of time talking about um I won't commit to the order yet because that'll come out of our discussion but somewhere along the way we're going to talk about autism we're going to talk about ADHD and we're going to talk about anxiety so coming at this through the lens of what you do today which is running a really large uh successful multi-disciplinary Clinic uh for and I assume this is just for children so this is up to 18 years old basically as your patient population correct um let's let's start by just getting some of the the the sort of diagnostic criteria straight I think that in general most people listening to us have a gestal for what each of those things are but I think it would be helpful uh to maybe understand clinically how how you look at each of those so let's start with anxiety okay um how I look at it clinically yeah and how is it defined how how how clear are the diagnostic criter IA um what does the dsm5 say about it and how does a practicing clinician use that or maybe modify that in the way that they try to come up with a diagnosis yeah that's great those are great questions Peter so with all of these diagnoses anxiety ADHD autism uh they behavioral clinical diagnosis so it's based on checklists of a number of traits and characteristics now you need to be working with a clinician a physician who has enough experience um diagnosing these conditions um and trained in these conditions but essentially that person needs to be an expert on what the clinical picture looks like because there because there's no biomarkers for any of these conditions that's the key thing there are no blood tests there are no brain scans to say who has anxiety who has ADHD who has autism um I have families come to me all the time um and

[00:04:31] I explain to them I have these clinical boxes and labels and diagnoses in my clinic um and these boxes and labels are essentially like man-made we create these lists of criteria but neurobiology in the brain is much more complex than these than these boxes um so the key thing is to have a clinician who looks at the and for me a child and looking at their traits at home at school in multiple environments collecting data through talking to parents history getting information from people other than the parents so that's using rating forms or talking to teachers and therapists um ideally we get to see the child in their real life environment so maybe even observing them in a real life place like school um and then doing assessment in the clinic to collect information about them um and with that um that clinician decides whether or not they meet um diagnostic criteria a list of of traits or characteristics described in a book called the DSM um and then we decide whether that child meets that criteria but one of the key things is about whether or not those traits are creating impairment and that's a key criteria for any of these diagnoses is for examp example anxiety we all have feeling of anxiety anxiety is actually a very appropriate normal feeling that we should all have but it's all about how much impairment is it creating how does impact function um and impact someone doing their job and for a child their job is to learn and go to school um make friends practice communicating and interacting with other peers um and be a positive contributor in their

[00:06:31] Community which is school so it's about how these traits impact their function in that job what would you say is kind of the youngest age that each of those could be diagnosed and I do want to talk a little bit about yeah the what the layers of diagnostic um criteria are but but just sort of starting at the first question which is um you know if a parent says hey I think my child has such and such I really want to get a work up is there is there an age beneath which you would say this this might not be a good use of of time and energy great question so for autism um although the typical age for diagnosis is more like three or four um we can confidently make that diagnosis as young as 18 months of age wow um and

[00:07:20] I'll be honest in the last 20 years there's been one or two cases where I've made it um at 15 months of age because it was very significant and obvious um most often at that young age we do wait a few more months to to watch how the child develops because kids are moving Target um but with autism it can be 18 months two years of age although half of the cases of autism are diagnosed over six um with

[00:07:49] ADHD um you can make a diagnosis as young as four years of age uh but again I'll just tell you from my clinical experience I rarely jump onto the diagnosis at with a four or five-year-old because they're still a moving Target although I may start interventions like behavioral interventions and parenting support um but there are a lot of four-year-olds who are pretty busy um so I generally way closer to school age although technically you can make it as young as four so that would be for most kids when you say school you don't mean preschool you mean actual kindergarten yeah for most five to five to six five to six I think is I think a lot of people will wait five or six to really see how that child is evolving um although technically you could make it younger um and then with anxiety we do see there's separation anxiety there's something called selective mutism in young kids in preschoolers um so anxiety there's many different types of anxiety but there's definitely uh anxiety conditions in preschoolers let's talk a little bit more about that I don't know much about anxiety and I'm guessing most people listening have you know sort of of a a sort of hand waving sense of what it means but but you know you said separation anxiety is an example anyone who's been a parent can appreciate moments of that um 99% sure our puppy has separation anxiety uh so what what are some of the other types of anxiety and how do you look to spot those in kids right right um so again just to emphasize anxiety is actually a normal emotion that we should all have so it's all about whether it's created enough impairment right so in the anxiety bucket there's multiple different types so someone may have generalized anxiety where is that's exactly it it's generalized it's seen in multiple places as pretty pervasive people can have specific phobias um towards you know dogs or spiders or other things um I mentioned separation anxiety so that is a condition um and again yes many toddlers have separation anxiety that's very normal it's about how severe and significant the the anxiety is and how pervasive it is and whether it is impacting function um so when it's impacting the ability for a child to go to child care or preschool um then it's like something we need to help um other types of anxiety there's something called selective mutism um children who uh are able to speak very well and speak well at home um or with familiar uh adults s but do not speak and are mute um outside that familiar environment um there's also obsessive compulsive disorder where people have obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors so there's many types of anxiety uh conditions out there and and children have these you've reiterated it twice now which tells me how important it is it it really has to come down to this impairment thing and we clearly all have um all of us could probably read through the DSM 5 and place ourselves in each of these diagnostic buckets I know

[00:11:04] I can uh I've done that exercise and turns out I could make the case I have everything but the truth of it is what I what I try to ask is which is maladaptive um which is mostly giving me kind of a negative response that is impacting relationships or work or these other things so I like that framework for kids right because if you think to yourself oh my kid has ADHD but they're doing well in school they're progressing in Reading WR arithmetic they enjoy playing sports yeah maybe they're a little bit more rambunctious but they have friends like how would you help a parent sort of navigate that if they if they came to you and said you know I think my son or my daughter has ADHD like what are kind of the the impairment style questions you would be asking to to sort of paint the Contours of this condition even if you acknowledge that boy that that that kid's got a lot of energy yeah right um so that's that those are great question questions because it is definitely a a spectrum a normal there's a bell curve we're all on a bell curve for all of these diagnoses there's a bell curve and so it's when does it become um leave the uh this is sort of like uh leaving the average range the typical uh profile and over into a what we call a disorder and actually I don't like to use the word disorder for these conditions either because I think they're just like learning differences and thinking differences as well um but when does it become a disorder so questions around impairment so for me one of the number one things I talk about with families is self-esteem and how people how is it impacting that child's self-concept how they see themselves um how is it impacting their relationships with peers that's another key one so um um does it impact social interactions does it impact how they connect with peers does it impact the feedback they're getting from peers um how does it impact their ability to learn and access learning opportunities at school or on the playground so are these traits impacting their ability to fully engage in learning be successful show their potential um the self-esteem thing is very important to me though and so for a child who has a biologic condition because this is these are all biologic there's neurochemicals there's genetics involved these are biologic conditions and for a child to have a biologic condition and be in class and then feel bad because they're they they are worried they're not doing you know well enough and they're getting a lot of negative feedback from teachers and peers not because those people are trying to be mean or negative but they have to constantly remind that child because that child is forgetting things losing things forgot to put their their name on the piece of paper completely losing yeah so it's losing forgetting it's not completing tasks it's not sustaining attention in a conversation it's actually avoiding um tasks that require a lot of sustained attention um so there's a lot of these traits where it's impacting this child's ability to be successful day-to-day at school how do you assess self-esteem what questions are you asking the child when you actually get to sit down with the child to to to determine that or and is there anything you can glean on that

[00:14:35] Dimension from speaking with anybody other than the child yeah um yeah you speak to the child and you do talk to others both of those things um when you talk to the child um there's multiple different ways of doing it um not always easy to get the answer um with younger children um we sometimes use approaches where we Act actually are talking about a third person so there's a number of different techniques where you are working with a child um first of course you're building relationship rapport with a child there needs to be trust um but there's a number of um uh ways that we assess it where we actually may talk to them about like another child it's like there's um you know so that you have another third person because it's sometimes easier to talk about a third person than yourself so talking about like um situations about how another child would feel at school or why does another child feel uncomfortable at school or why does a child come home crying some days and then you hear their stories so when they children talk about that they actually relate to their own situations and they start to say like well you know Johnny came home from school crying because nobody wants to play with him because he always messes up the rules to the game what is the age window in which you can utilize that technique H it's great question um so it's it's mostly Primary

[00:16:09] Elementary School age uh um so yeah so I feel like but by the time I get to a second grader uh second grader they are second third fourth fifth they're able to sort of share these stories about other people you mean yeah yeah interesting yeah when they're older they'll talk about themselves okay it's hard it's hard to it's hard to reflect on your own feelings and thoughts and identify for a child to identify their own emotions and the why behind their emotions is challenging so you've in that description actually made a pretty clear I think um case for some of the traits that are showing up in ADHD and in um anxiety all the different variant of it um let's talk a little bit more about autism now of course it was referred to as ASD right autism spectrum autism spectrum disorder uh we'll we'll park for a moment the the the use of the word disorder and maybe come back to that a little bit but um tell me today how is the diagnosis of autism made because I think when many people think of autism you know if they're old enough they might think of Rainman right you're going to think of somebody who in a very short interaction a non-clinician would go oh that person is not neurotypical that person clearly has something about them that's quirky and very different and you might think of even more extreme examples of children that are non-verbal um and things of that nature but but again given the nature of this and the fact that it's a spectrum um that must make it even more challenging to find the diagnosis correct very very um so uh I have so much to say about autism about the diagnosis and how we make it and how it's changed so much over the years um so autism spectrum so first it's a spectrum huge spectrum of what those what this means when we when we talk about autism spectrum um uh the it goes from um what people remember it from decades ago as from you know nonverbal very little you know communication skills um being somewhat isolated not interacting with other people mannerism such as flapping your hands very that's sort of a classic description that we do remember um from you know over the last couple decades um nowadays uh many children who have a lot of speech and language skills who C who are who do communicate a lot but struggle with the social communication that we have with each other um who have many many strengths but do struggle with social skills and do have some restricted interest in repetitive behaviors they also qualify under this umbrella term called autism spectrum disorder and this term autism spectrum disorder that term came out in uh 2013 with the dsm5 um so how we diagnose it uh is based on again clinical traits but the definition and those and the checklist of those traits have actually Chang many times over the last few decades um So currently it is uh you work with an uh an expert who has a lot of experience with autism and they do an analysis of someone's behavior um in the two areas that we look at social communication skills and the other is the repetitive behaviors restricted interest so for social communication skills um our current diagnostic criteria requires that a that a patient has differences uh in three specific areas um one is their social reciprocity so this is the um back and forth of social interactions it's how do you initiate social how do you respond socially the second area is related to non-verbal communication skills so it's how someone uses their uh non-verbal communication uh eye contact gestures as well is how they understand um and interpret somebody else's non-verbal communication um and then the third area is related to how they understand relationship so it's about building friendships playing with peers um um how they understand the social context of of being in a group um so those are the three key areas um when it comes to the social communication piece and in order to get the diagnosis you do have to have differences in all those three areas is this something that is done during one assessment or is this something that's done over repeated assessments great question um depends on the level of severity uh in the child um so first of all it's important that whoever is doing the assessment really understands that child tell me again what type of is this something like who in your clinical team does this what type of training does this person have is it a physician is it um a social science like yeah great question um it can be it can be a physician or it can be a psychologist those are that's generally who does it so physician it would either be a a developmental behavioral pediatrician um or a psychiatrist that's most often occasionally it's a pediatric neurologist um or somebody else uh in um with some sort of similar background and training um but generally DBP or psychiatrist and then um and if it's not a physician then it's a psychologist that usually does the assessment and so um uh the assessment could be multiple things um there's no uh there's no gold standard like the assessment has to include um certain components but again like as I mentioned it's important that the clinician get to know the child I think it's important to understand the child's profile like the label is only one piece of it to me if someone tells me their child has autism

[00:22:47] I actually really don't know much about their child say more I I that because you tell me your child has autism I have I really don't know what your child is like if someone tells me that on the street and so so um so and again like then we come up with treatment plans for like a child with autism it's like well there's a saying you've met one child with autism you've met one child with autism and so to really you know make a difference with the treatment plan you need to understand that profile of that child that child's strengths and challenges and so for me the assessment like there's two there's there's multiple goals with the assessment one part of the assessment is to make a diagnosis um because the diagnosis can be a tool to help the adults around that child better understand that child it gives some sort of structure of like how to approach that child and leverage their strengths and um and work on skill building it can help get resources at school or through insurance so there the the diagnosis is a tool however to really make a difference you want to understand what about that child is unique and different and how do you support that child so you were asking how do you do nment so when it is a um more significant case um with significant impairments we frequently can make the diagnosis I'll just be honest you can make it pretty quickly um you should take a good history you should definitely meet with the child work with the child in the clinic but there are many children where a trained clinician can do that diagnosis pretty quickly in a child with very significant autism it'd be obvious to you if you were in a restaurant you saw someone with autism you know it's obvious to many people yeah um but for children who have milder symptoms it is really important that um that there probably is multiple visits to see the child on multiple days um that different types of assessments are done uh directly with the child in addition to taking history with the parents and in addition to collecting information from other people involved in that child's life such as teachers or therapists uh it's important to get different perspectives you mentioned that um the diagnosis in in sort of probably more severe cases can be made earlier and earlier in life sounds like sweet spot is three to four years of age but then you said half kids are half of the kids are diagnosed above six yes so is that something that is a relatively recent phenomenon of the past decade since the dsm5 broadened the inclusion criteria or was that even true in the 70s and 80s yeah great question um so it it's complicated I'll say it has a lot to do with the new diagnostic criteria um so before 2013 we uh had asperous syndrome yes we don't use that uh diagnostic label anymore and we also had something called pddn pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified a mouthful um and PDD NOS uh was a term we used um when um it it had simil similarities to autistic disorder um because all three of those names were under the umbrella of autism um and so there were a lot of kids who received this pddn because they were like something's different something's different they're sprinkled with bits of autism but they didn't quite meet all the criteria when you didn't meet quite all all the criteria you got pddn and then there was Asperger syndrome which um generally described an individual who had um um good cognitive skills you know average or high high cognitive skills intellectual skills they had a lot of speech and language skills they actually had huge vocabulary um but again their social reciprocity back and forth conversation picking up on social cues that was uh atypical and they also had a lot of like restricted interests um they would they would uh have things they were really interested in but then they would like dive deep into those things um so in 2013 with the dsm5 we put all of that together um under autism or sorry autism spectrum disorder um and so now the kids who have the more like clearcut very traditional autistic disorder they you know they're picked up at two years of age or two and a half three years of age and it's the kids who have you know the stronger cognitive skills the stronger they have speech and language present um they're picked up later by the way nowadays with the new diagnostic criteria um language impairment may or may not be present in the diagnosis so when you give the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder you also have to clarify whether there is intellectual disability so with or without intellectual disability and then we say with or without language impairment so there with all of these

[00:28:27] Chang changes um the Spectrum has it's it's it's very broad now this is a question I'm sure you get asked all the time so the CDC said in the year 2000 one in uh roughly 200 kids 150 to 200 kids had autism now of course that's pre this change of the the dsm5 so we can only take that to mean that those were the kids in that in that bucket of more extreme autism that did not include the

[00:28:57] PDD no was that what the other one was called yeah and and Asbergers um but if you if you look at the data up until you know prior to that change the last year prior to that change in 2012 it was down from 1 and um 150 to one in 169 yeah so in other words there was something that was increasing the prevalence or diagnosis by about a factor of two then we get the change in the DSM and to today we're at 136 so it begs the question what is it that is driving the increase in the prevalence of ASD not withstanding that there has also been a larger uh bucket included in a larger net cast around it yeah that's a great question I can't believe it's 1 and 36 because I've been doing this in for 25 years I can never keep track of the numbers i h every time

[00:29:59] I went to every time I go to an annual meeting the number changes um and is one in 36 now what the CDC said in 2020 so I'm going to I'm going to go with whatever numbers you take I I'll believe your numbers more than mine um the point being that it the numbers has CH the numbers have changed drastically and yes people will say part of it is because the definitions change there's more awareness there's more resources there's more clinicians making diagnosis um but people in the field uh believe that um those changes don't explain the drastic changes in the numbers um and there has to be something else involved um and there is a lot of research in this area looking at the impact of the environment and epigenetics and what roles those two things have um in in increasing the rate of autism uh in our population so if you're at a dinner party and you get cornered and everybody wants to talk about this how are you walking people through this what are you saying let's put the diagnostic criteria aside let's put the you know keys under the lamp post aside meaning you know wherever there's more attention you're going to see more things um what what what are some of the environmental things that you think could be amplifying this yeah um there is thoughts around pollution um maternal uh infection prolonged fever during pregnancy the health of the placenta stress uh parental age there's a lot of environmental factors that have been implicated but what I want to say is that so just to take a step back first then just to kind of talk about the cause of autism like the genetics and the environmental piece so just to make it really clear like the word autism describes a constellation of symptoms there are many many causes for autism there isn't a single cause what causes autism is very complex and we actually have more questions than answers it's felt though that it is like a sort of like a a 10 hit model meaning like um and that we don't know that the number is 10 but the idea that there's multip it's not a two hit model it's not a two- hit model it's a there's many factors involved and it's almost felt like it's Gene Gene Gene environment environment environment and then now it's like epigenetics epigenetics epigenetics and so it's multiple hits and the Order of the hits and the timing of the hits are also felt to be very important let's start with the genetic piece so we've had a number of folks on the podcast over time so the listener are probably familiar with what we mean by the heritability of something but maybe just for folks that are need to brush up on that we would talk about the heritability of a condition whether it be depression whether it be schizophrenia whether it be bipolar disorder um as largely determined by you have identical twins separated at Birth raised in completely different environments what is effectively the probability that they're both going to come down with the same psychiatric condition right and that's Pro unfortunately fortunately that's the purest way we can get at what the genetic heritability is of something when you don't know what the genes are or when there are so many genes and it's very complicated and my recollection is that the heritability of autism is quite High

[00:33:47] I don't remember the number can you enlighten me yeah it's um again where it'll be anywhere from 70% to 98% depending again on the definitions used at the time um but it's well over 90% wow I didn't know it was that high I thought it was in the 80s which is still very high am I also correct in my recollection that the heritability of autism is higher than it is for any other condition in the DSM I believe so yeah in other words even schizophrenia even bipolar even depression and things that we know have very strong genetic components none are as high as it is for autism correct it's it's there's a very there's um definite genetic component to this but may I say so it's not one gene that's yeah I was just going to say so let's make sure people understand it is not one gene it is multiple genes so anybody with autism they have multiple genes that have been um changed so there's multiple genetic changes in anybody with autism and the other thing is every person who has ISM they probably have a different group of genes that have been changed and that's so it's actually hundreds and some people say up to like a thousand genes have been associated with maybe a way that I would explain this and please correct me if you don't like this analogy I liken it to cancer um with a fundamental difference okay so hear me out for a second and feel free to shoot this down um cancer is um mostly about sematic mutations and not germal mutations meaning most of the time when a person gets cancer it is not based on genes that they were born with uh it's based on genes that were at one point normal that have since acquired mutations in their mutated State they no longer function normally the person develops cancer so this complicates my analogy because only about 5% of cancers arrive from germline mutations whereas the genes that are implicated in autism are indeed germline you're born with them however the point point I want to really make is comparing the sematic mutations of cancer to the germline mutations of autism and the point I'm trying to make is that when you've met a woman with breast cancer you've met a woman with breast cancer you're not going to find too many women that look the same with breast cancer and that's really why gene therapy hasn't panned out for most cancers because to say that a person has breast cancer tells you some stuff you could dig a little deep and say well it's estrogen positive it's progesterone positive it's her two new positive but still why wouldn't they all respond the same well it's because they have many different underlying uh uh genetic changes furthermore they have completely different immune responses in terms of what their tumor looks like and so the way I try to think about it myself is if um you see a hundred kids with autism and let's just pick a number that's somewhat conservative we would say that that's 85 90% uh heritable it simply means that the underlying genes for each of them were inherited but they might have nothing to do with each other across all of those children just as we would say all of the women who have breast cancer have acquired mutations that gave them breast cancer but they could all be very different no I agree again I could poke holes in that analogy but I think that's maybe an easier way to think about it because poly genic things are harder to wrap our heads around especially when we don't know what all the genes are yeah yeah so we don't know all the genes we know that that there is this genetic component um it's like each each child with autism has a different fingerprint yeah um with their with their genetic makeup and so there's these uh genetic changes um but some of the hits I mentioned are environmental so there is research to show maternal stress pollution um maternal diet um parental age these things also um um are associated with autism and again there's a long list so there's a long list of things that are associated but none of them are alone like can identify like each one alone is not a uh you know the key to autism It's a combination the thing I'm still struggling with is let's take another example that we I think we can all Point reasonably at uh 50 years ago the incidence of type 2 diabetes was in the ballpark of 1.5 to 2% so 1 and a half to 2% of people in the United States had type 2 diabetes today we're God I haven't looked in a while but it's over 10% and I'm talking clear type two diabetes I'm not talking about in the gray area of pre type two diabetes so let's just say we've had a five to

[00:39:00] Sevenfold increase in a condition over the course of one generation um so then the question of what are the environmental triggers like right that's not a genetic it would be very difficult to explain that just genetically that there's been some genetic change we might have genetic susceptibilities we might have genetic manifestations but the thing of it something must have changed and I think most people would point to our food environment as the leading thing that has driven that change because the change in the food environment in 50 years is dramatic yeah so when we apply the same logic to autism do we do we see big enough changes in these environmental triggers even just over the last 20 years or 25 years to say okay 25 years ago kids were born with the same genetic predisposition there can't be that much genetic drift unless we believe that we're we are seeing more people pair together to combine four genes or genetic combinations that are producing this phenotype more than we saw before we can come back to that I'd love to hear your thoughts on that but let's put that aside for a moment if we're saying that whatever epigenetic change is happening is triggered by something in the environment and we're talking about if paternal age is going up if maternal stress is going up if maternal nutrition is getting worse if environmental toxins microplastics are all over everybody's talking about those things heavy metals whatever it is um I would love to go into a little bit more detail and get your thoughts on how those things are changing and we have to talk about vaccines of course right so um you know there's going to be a subset of people here I think who understandably would think hey what about vaccines haven't we changed the way we vaccinate kids is that part participating in it now um you mentioned that this is an in utero genetic condition if that's the case then childhood vaccines might be less responsible than some might think but I just like to hear you Riff on all of this stuff because you know before we get into the what to do I still think there's a lot of people asking how did we get here yeah um I wish I had all the answers I don't and so uh um but I do think that there had you know I think it's compx like the there have been changes in you talk about diet pollution toxin exposure I think that's one piece of it um it is one piece um with epigenetics as you know it can be you know epigenetic changes which just to clarify for everybody uh it's the the

[00:41:49] DNA sequence is not changed it's about uh tags on the DNA that can change the expression of genes or proteins called histones that um are changed that uh end up resulting in changed gene expression but the the change gene expression can actually be inherited or passed through generations as well yeah I was going to ask you about that can C is that do we know that to be a fact that the epigenome is being transmitted I think it's controversial yeah um I think it's controversial but there is some thought about that about the idea of a um The

[00:42:27] Germ cells uh in a fetus um in a grandparent being exposed to smoking toxins changes in food how that grandparent exposure can actually change methylation in The Germ cells of a parent who's a fetus who then that germ cell goes on to be a child with autism I don't know if that made sense it was sort of confuses a ton of sense to me because I think about this problem night and day I do want to make sure the listeners understand that um well first of all this is not established yet I want to make sure they understand what we're saying so let's let's explain it one more time so we have these four things that make up DNA right your CGA a and t and that is the code that is the code of Life yeah um but on the backbone of those things you can put little methyl groups which is just a little carbon with three hydrogens uh and that's called epigenetics and by the way we're all born with methylated groups all over our epig genome back of the genome right um over life we know that changes so we know that simply aging changes methylation um but we believe that there is differential methylation in individuals in response to all the things that you've talked about and we know that methylation controls gene expression in fact methylation is probably the single most important thing that controls differential gene expression in different tissues yeah so the question the jugular question is is if you have a methylation pattern and you pass can you pass that on to your fetus and what you said a minute ago is even more remarkable which is would that child when they develop pass that methylation pattern on to their fetus I mean at that point methylation would start to be epigenetics would start to become genetic right it starts to become a part of the germ line um so so I mean this is an answerable question by the way in my book like when I think of things that we should know the answer to in a decade I'm going to put this in the list of things that we should know the answer to just based on the fact that we have we we will have enough longitudinal data I think to be able to get at this I don't know if you're as optimistic as me yeah I am um the key thing is that the we do know the environment impacts the methylation correct and the epigenetics so it's the idea with this whole idea of like

[00:44:54] Crossing Generations it's the idea of the methylation in a germ cell is uh is altered or changed because of some sort of environmental exposure in again that parent or grandparent yeah and so in that sense the child is now susceptible to two things The Germ line that they inherit from both parents yeah and as a fetus the methylation impact that occurs as a result of any of these

[00:45:27] You' disced who who are the people that are studying this most closely is this is this in the purview of the geneticists uh is this in the purview of the epidemiologists like who are the people that are most working at this because again as a as a general rule I'm always uh you know I always think that it's very foolhardy to work on a problem an epidemic without understanding the causal nature of the epidemic yeah right like it's you know I use the example of like heart therapy yeah right like change the face of HIV forever so success like one of the greatest success stories of of infectious disease medicine um but it was all predicated on understanding what the cause was like if you didn't understand that HIV was destroying CD4 cells yeah you didn't have a prayer of developing that therapy and do you ever worry that you know if this epidemic what's to say this isn't going to get to be one in three kids in 30 years and are there enough people like you that are going to be able to help parents and help families and help children with that so so that that I don't want to sound alarmist but I worry when we have an epidemic potentially and we don't have a great sense of causality yeah um that's profound I'm trying and uh and it's it's and I'm thinking about a number of different things one I'm thinking about because you're talking about this one and three and I'm just throwing that out as hey what if this trend continues right yeah and so one of the issues though is though how we Define yeah the condition that's the thing that's is so there is still that I although I believe that there is this piece with genetics and the environment and how we are evolving and there's this it's a phenotype so pH it's how we this phenotype where differences in how in in social communication skills and repetitive behaviors and restricted interests this phenotype is uh which is on a huge

[00:47:38] Spectrum as well I just want make sure this is the thing it's a because the when we're talking about these numbers like 1 and 36 and this number continued to increase it's not just the kids who are like nonverbal autism it's this really wide phenotype is increasing um and so it is important we understand the cause of why this phenotype is increasing and then um what should we or should not be doing about that what do you know about the um change in the uh frequency or the prevalence of let's pick one subset of that which is you know the nonverbal or CH child that is so impaired that I could diagnose them or parent could diagnose them right do we know if that has remained relatively constant over the last 25 years despite the change in diagnostic criteria I believe there's an increase in that number as well um but the numbers that are put out there the really profound numbers actually describe the entire spectrum and um they don't actually subdivide into the the different parts uh of the spectrum do you have a ballpark idea so if the overall diagnosis of autism is increased you know fivefold uh in in the last 20 years has that more severe part gone up by 50% by 100% I mean what's the what do you think it is or what do you know it is we subdivide autism spectrum into three into three buckets level one level two level three so the more significantly impaired children would fall into level three where they require very substantial support but there are very few research studies that actually look into these sub buckets and um and I have to be honest I'm not sure clinicians are always great at um identifying kids in the sub buckets either like you and I are talking about a very specific you know profile that should be very obvious to identify but there's other kids in subbu 3 that are sometimes put in subbu 2 depending on what clinician I'm going to guess that sub bucket three is not the totality of the children that were called autistic prior to 2013 is that a safe assumption yes so you can't even say assuming the data existed and it sounds like they don't we can't just say what was the prevalence of autism in the

[00:50:17] DSM 4 and how does it compare to ASD sub3 today that wouldn't even be a meaningful comparison uh I'm not sure if anyone's looked into it but yeah I don't know if but even if they did it wouldn't be Apples to Apples it's not okay one of the reasons they actually by the way one of the reasons they actually went from um the Asperger syndrome pddn um autistic disorder and they they decided to call it all because I was actually quite controversial when they actually decided to put all three of those things under one umbrella called autism spectrum was because clinicians did a really poor job of deciding uh which which name which bucket you were in so you would have a child and one clinician would call it Asperger syndrome another person would call it autistic disorder another person would called it pddn so they decided okay rather than having these three names let's put it all under autism spectrum so then they put under autism spectrum but then they have level one level two level three but

[00:51:18] I would argue I would still say that clinicians still struggle sometimes where there is a little bit of overlap it's not always clear now if you go back to dm4 when as you mentioned Physicians are struggling to know which of these buckets to put them into as a as an outsider looking in my first question is does it matter in terms of treatment and resources does it matter more in terms of outcomes and support like there must be a reason why people cared about that in other words if you had a child in 2020 pardon me in in the year 2000 who one clinician said this this kid has

[00:51:58] Asperger syndrome and another person said no they're autistic was that going to make a material difference in the type of support that they got and most importantly the type of person they were going to turn into like were they going to reach their full potential in differential capacity great question so it did make a difference so uh with respect to resources so children with

[00:52:21] Asperger syndrome frequently did not get um support or support covered um you needed autistic disorder to to get support and what about pddn um they yeah people didn't know what to do with that they didn't even know what to do with that so so if by putting everything under autism then it's like okay if you have autism you um should receive Services it was a tool it's it's a get the label's a tool to understand and get resources now we have level one level two level three now level one is it says requires support level two is requires substantial support level three is require very substantial support my concern is that again when a child is level one um they don't always get the support they need um because they have so many strengths so kids in level one have um frequently they have you know good cognitive skills have a lot of language skills they struggle with some social skills and they may have you know some you know difficulties with executive functioning and coping skills at times um but again it's considered mild and a lot of those kids don't get support and

[00:53:44] I think that's unfortunate because they also are the kids that respond to intervention so well if they get a little coaching on how do you cope with distress how do you cope with change how do you practice some social skills not that they have to change um we don't need to change everything about them but giving them a little bit of support about how to again be adaptive um in in a community um giving that support goes a long way in that with that group um but frequently they don't get the support because they're called level one you help me understand the natural history of those kids back in the 70s and 80s right so back back in the and 80s when you and I were kids um nobody thought anything of those kids right they weren't they weren't going to certainly wer going to get labeled with autism they certainly weren't going to show up with uh you know in school programs to help them with their social skills and with their communication skills as you pointed out they're intellectually not impaired so it's not like they're going to struggle in school but there's there's clearly something that that they're struggling with right do I don't know if we I mean obviously this hasn't been studied but I'm very curious based on your experience and your judgment like are those people that just went on to pick careers where they didn't have to interact with people but they could still do challenging cognitive work like how did those people what was the natural history of them there clearly a lot of them there are there are a lot of them um and I think uh they did they found a path that made sense to them they obviously learned what their strengths were and their strengths may have been around memory uh you know detail oriented um following rules that are black and white um they may have had really wonderful cognitive skills um um in certain areas that were less around inferring and social skills and more concrete um and yeah my we don't have studies to to say this for sure but my guess is they have lived happy successful lives uh a lot of them some of them um doing things that they enjoy doing are passionate about they probably have found ways to not engage in large social uh settings um but there's a lot of careers out there that are a good match and they also have relationships and marriages I want to emphasize that people with Autism get married I I think it's I mean I just think there's zero chance that there aren't thousands if not tens of thousands of these people listening to us right now right because they're they're adults today and I wonder if they're listening to some of this and they're saying this resonates like I get that you know when I was a kid I was hyperfocused on this stuff I wasn't interested in a whole bunch of stuff yeah um it was a little harder for me to interact with other kids and and things like that and and yet I found my path and here I am today yeah so I talk to parents all the time about this because I evaluate children I evaluate children for autism or ADHD and very often when I'm evaluating the child uh at some point why while I develop this relationship with the family the parents say gosh uh so much of my child is in me

[00:57:04] I as you are describing my child and my child's strengths and challenges and I I see me and this is exactly what I went through when I was young and then they share how hard it was and they uh and they say gosh I never like you know no one understood me or I felt bad because I was misunderstood or I thought it was my fault and uh I didn't try hard enough um so I have to say it can be validating for an adult to learn that it wasn't their fault and this is part of their wiring um I have many many parents who ask me like should

[00:57:41] I go get aess now um what do you say ah we um I never say yes or no I I I ask questions I I I think information is uh is power um I think it's good for them to be thinking about it whether or not they go on to actually get assessed a lot of them don't necessar with the autism piece often they don't with the

[00:58:09] ADHD piece they often do because they realize actually their ADHD traits are impacting their function and Su success of their job so sometimes they will actually go to a psychiatrist to get an assessment but but I do share with them the genetics and the family history so what do I say I I validate I say it yes you're you're sharing you're telling me that growing up you had many traits that today we would classify under one of these diagnoses you're right and it is possible um because these things do run in families and there is a highly genetic component and um I think sometimes just that conversation can be therapeutic itself in that someone feeling validated and and they have that aha moment like okay this explains a lot um and then they can feel good as well because they're like okay this explains a lot and I've gone on and I currently have my family and I'm doing well in many parts of my life but it helps them also understand like ah but now I understand why sometimes I do have these challenges at work or with my spouse it um it's interesting just sometimes having seen like having a perspective where now you can see your challenges through a different lens sometimes helps a person just actually now think about okay now I can adjust or understand the triggers or think about can reflect to think about how do I want to respond the next time so I think again that information's empowering even if they don't ever go to therapy or do anything else just actually starting to become informed about it can can help yeah and I would imagine it helps them a lot with their child because they're they're seeing both hey my child has this diagnosis that now partially explains you know the challenges we might be having Etc but at the same time because I can empathize with that child if I've experienced it um it makes you better parent now do you so everything you said makes a great case for widening the diagnostic on envelope because we you know if we go back 40 years we had this narrow narrow envelope and in other words we had a test that you know had very very high specificity but very low sensitivity you were missing a lot of people um but you didn't get any false positives that's for sure right and you didn't over pathologize right when someone was autistic they were really autistic now today we have the opposite problem right so we have a high sensitivity low specificity test sort of I'm making that up but you know just to bring it to cancer diagnostics for people so now anybody who's autistic should get diagnosed but then we're you know we're stretching what that means and a lot of the people getting diagnosed today frankly maybe without any support would go on to do just fine do you worry that when the dsm6 comes out it could have a wider envelope and we could start to get to a point where someone might say hey are we over path over pathologizing this and are we getting to a point where well what does normal even mean anymore oh I agree with that so much so I actually ask that question all the time so I um I do Wonder like uh we every time a child has uh a few of these traits we uh whether or not um the diagnosis we're we're we're coming up with with a diagnosis uh every time someone is just a little bit different and rather than uh realizing that we are all there is you know neurodiversity we're all different we have to give a name to it all the time it's a it's it's an interesting debate um and you will have your he different perspectives I mean the name gives us a way to get resources and help people and um but Al concerned that we we you know we have to give everything a name I actually Wonder in the next

[01:02:32] DSM whether we will end up taking a step back like the whether the pendulum will swing a little bit and when is that due uh I I don't know uh what was the gap between three and four and four and five so there often um like 15 years I would say a couple decades so uh so uh uh so it could be another it could literally be another deade decade it can be so I'm concerned that uh the kids in level one autism might actually be part of several different uh diagnostic buckets so children who are identified with level one autism um one clinician they see one clinician that person may diagnose autism they see a second clinician that person may diagnose ADHD plus anxiety they don't even call it autism um so I see this all the time in my clinic I have kids who come to clinic and they may see you know three other clinicians before they saw me really great clinicians high standards uh experts um but there's a lot of blurry lines with the level one autism and you will hear different diagnosis so back to your your thoughts around like future dsms I I wonder how we're going to address level one autism and whether all the kids is it the same condition are is that like how how many different conditions are in that bucket um see to me the way I would think about that is I would hope that by the time we have to make that decision we would have enough data and the data would ask the most important question which is how are we impacting outcomes right in other words when we widen the diagnostic the diagnostic envelope and you know said that you know we're going to now have this ASD class one in here um that opened the door for more resources right that meant more more kids had programs at school what's it what's a i AP IEP

[01:04:38] IEP more kids have IEPs at school which what does that stand for individual education plan education plan and at the end of the day what we want to know is are those kids doing better and if the answer is yes then it's probably worth keeping right if the answer is that didn't make a darn bit of difference yeah then all we did was create a bunch of anxiety for the parents and maybe it didn't now again I don't know how one goes about answering that but I I would hope that somebody a lot smarter than me is thinking about it through that lens because we can't lose sight of the whole purpose of this like the purpose of a diagnosis in anywhere in medicine should be to impact an outcome a diagnosis for the sake of a diagnosis is not a particularly valuable tool unless you're an epidemiologist but even there it should be all in the spirit of how are we making people better yeah I agree and that's why again I agree that the kids in level one should be receiving

[01:05:32] Services yeah otherwise what's the point in giving the diagnosis yeah yeah so they should be receiving services and if we need to call it something by a different name who cares as long as it gets the service that makes them better off than they would have been had they received no service right right um before we get into more of the details about what you do specifically treatment wise I want to finish one other bit of uh the the the sort of diagnosis piece which is can you talk a little bit about the overlap you just did it sort of a second ago about uh ASD ADHD and anxiety how often do they overlap what do those ven diagrams look like yeah that's a great question okay um so I'm going to start off by saying okay we have we we diagnose anxiety and kids and there's that bucket and there's many kids who just clearly fall in the anxiety bucket and and U meet criteria and it's really clear to see that there kids who have

[01:06:32] ADHD and clearly meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD and fall in that bucket and then there kids who clearly fall into the autism bucket I'm going to focus on the autism bucket uh first so um we say that about half of kids with autism also have a diagnosis of ADHD if you look at the numbers they're anywhere from you can you can find reports for anywhere from like you know 40% to 70% of kids but we say about half of kids with autism actually do have a diagnosis of autism interestingly before the dsm5 before 2013 we were not allowed to give both those diagnosis together so they were mutually exclusive if a child had autism we we did not give a diagnosis of

[01:07:20] ADHD so starting in 2013 we did and we give it a lot so a lot of children children with autism have ADHD symptoms as well when we give that diagnosis and about 40% of kids with autism also have anxiety and this makes sense when you think about the parts of the brain involved like when you think about ADHD we're thinking about executive functioning skills we're thinking about prefrontal loes um when you're thinking about anxiety you're thinking about the amydala and then when people have done neuroimaging studies in kids with autism we find there's many areas of the brain involved but in particular frontal lobes the amydala as well as the cerebellum temporal loob there's many many areas of the brain involved um but kids with autism do have challenges with executive functioning um and anxiety although those are not part of the diagnostic criteria so those are associated symptoms associated traits associated diagn diagnoses so the comorbidities um not part of the core diagnostic criteria but there's a lot of overlap if 50% of them have ADHD and 40% of them also car pardon me yeah carry diagnosis of anxiety is there a percent of those that are overlapped and have all three yeah I'll say a lot of them have all three and what what is that I don't know the exact number for that one okay but there is a this is the thing that these kids have um they present with the core features of autism along with the executive functioning challenges and are anxious okay so now what can we say about kids with ADHD and anxiety what's that overlap yeah so um so kids who have adiation anxiety they their numbers towards autism are not as high so there are a lot more kids with ADHD who don't go on to have who are not diagnosed with with autism but there's a lot of overlap between ADHD and anxiet so ADHD frequently has a partner is what I tell families um if you have ADHD you often have either anxiety or some other mood challenges um or you have learning differences so learning disabilities are frequently uh present in kids with

[01:09:45] ADHD um or you have oppositional behaviors um so there's often a a second condition present in kids with ADHD say more about oppositional behavioral Tendencies yeah so there is a diagnosis out there called Oppositional Defiant Disorder and that is a diagnosis that I don't use um quickly or often uh in young kids when I see oppositional behaviors um this is my personal approach um is that

[01:10:22] I will say I see a child with oppositional behaviors um what does that mean means someone who argues doesn't follow rules um disobeys um lies um so kids with these types of behaviors I want to understand the why before I jump into saying that they have Oppositional Defiant Disorder technically you know maybe they meet the criteria again it's the checklist criteria for that name but to me that name doesn't help me it's just a name it's like okay I have a kid with o OD we call it it's like how does that help me what do I do with that um so if I see a child with oppositional behaviors I'm like okay what's the function behind that behavior and so I can come up with reasons for why a child is oppositional so you know we all we all have seen kids who you know have meltdowns who fight who yell who argue it's like what's the function behind that and so it may be that child is actually anxious I'll tell you a lot of oppositional behavior in kids is driven by feelings of anxiety and embarrassment it may be the child is impulsive that child lies and argues and yells no quickly because they're impulsive and they have untreated ADHD it could be that child struggles with understanding social contexts and social skills they actually have trouble with their social reciprocity but they're presenting with what looks like oppositional behavior um that child may be sensory overloaded and have challenges processing sensory information um and therefore becomes overwhelmed and disregulated and oppositional so the list goes on the point is is like when I see a child with oppositional behavior and a family says oh well someone told us it was OD I'm like okay well okay now what yeah I want to come actually right back to that because I really I think that's just a I mean I don't know what fraction of of kids are getting type of insight and attention but my concern would be not enough right my concern would be that these things just we're just we're just in a world of ever expanding labels and and codes and the so what is missing when of course yes there isn't really a field of medicine in which the so what matters more right I agree like if you think about um this person has hypertension hyper lipidemia insulin resistance it's important to understand why yeah but at a minimum we have great treatments if we don't know the why if at the end of the day it's just deemed essential hypertension we have no clue why worst case scenario we can put you on medication yeah you know if weight loss isn't enough to reduce your blood pressure and fix your insulin resistance at least we've got medications that work really well but you know a lot of people would be would be hesitant to give their kids medication here I want to talk of course about this in in length um which is all the more reason why boy if you don't understand why this kid has

[01:13:25] Oppositional Defiant Disorder if it's because if it's like sensory overload it's a totally different treatment path than if it's anxiety yeah I agree and so um this is one of the challenging things about my field and again I'm going to come back to my boxes it's just like because I'm I see a family and I I really I'm actually pretty transparent with the families I work with regarding the uh that we don't know everything I am really honest with them and transparent like because they're like doctor you know what is what is the diagnosis and the thing is is families they want to find a diagnosis because it helps I mean it's it's scary when you don't know what's happening but I really walk them through that there're these labels and diagnoses but the risk is that they can see someone like in my field and they do testing and you give a diagnosis like this child has o like I have kids they come with me to come with a report this child has OD and I'm like okay well what does that mean what are we going to do about it and so the why is so so very important um with like again comes back to like how do we create treatment plants and it comes back to again like I said you've met one child with OD you've met one child with

[01:14:37] OD and OD to me means actually I I don't even know what to do with that I'm like there's no treatment for OD but however if I know if the child has impulsivity I can treat that if the child has social difficulties okay I know what kind of treatment plan to create there if the child's anxious I know what type of therapies to give so it's really important to think about the why it was actually one of the things when I when I left like the traditional medical model and started my clinic one of the things that I really noticed when I was making that transition and one of the one of the things I wanted to remember when I started to work with families in my clinic was that it's not just about the diagnosis it's the it's the journey afterwards and it's really about personalized care and you can make such a big difference in child development human well-being by really understanding that specific child and unfortunately sometimes when you're on the treadmill in a medical model it's really hard to have the time to really get to know a child and I felt like I was you know you have autism here's a list of 15 recommendations good luck and you have

[01:15:47] ADHD here's a list of 15 recommendations good luck without really getting to know the why behind that child's Behavior yeah and I'm trying to think about how do you compare this to adult psychiatry right where um psychologists and psychiatrists who really help people tend to focus Less on their DSM five in this case diagnosis they use that if there's if there's a diagnosis there we should know what it is and it

[01:16:16] Paints the Contours of what we think about but as my friend Paul kti always talks about he's like if you don't know their story yeah you can't really help them now that doesn't mean that knowing their story precludes using pharmacologic agents when appropriate um it doesn't but what it means is you you have to really understand the root is this a response to trauma is this a response to an underlying biologic condition um and again like I I feel like based on the little bit I know here adults seem to have more access to that kind of mental health care than children do is that is that a misperception on my part no I agree I agree I don't think we've we've done enough in Pediatrics in this area but I agree you have to know the story and understand the whole child and so one thing about developmental behavioral pediatrics which by the way is a very young specialty and you were the first person at Stanford uh in that in that group that you created the group yeah so developmental behavioral pediatrics was only recognized as a subp specialty by the American Board of

[01:17:22] Pediatrics in 1999 so it's a very young specialty but a key thing about this field is it's what we call a bioc psychosocial specialty and so what that means is we think about the biology so the genetics the brain the biology the medication we think about the biology the psycho part is the mental health piece so it's the idea of to support child development and behavior you need to consider the physical well-being as well as the mental well-being um and then the social piece is the fact that we we don't live in isolation we live in communities we live in Dynamics and in order to help kids with their development and behavior and what better way to promote human well-being and health and to start early on and impact

[01:18:13] Child Development and behavior and self-esteem and learning um but the way to do it is you not only think about the biology you think about the mental health and you think about the social which is about you know family Dynamics parenting school and education like this is key like this is the bridge between education and medical health which honestly is hard to do in the traditional medical model bridging to education but but it is really really important that's where our kids are learning and developing and growing and exposed to experiences and so DBP looks at that whole picture and I really believe that that is the way to to support child development and behavior whether there's a diagnosis or not let's talk a little bit about your journey you know you you um you got to Stanford in ' 04 yeah my husband got there in 04 I was there just in 0 I arrived in ' 05 so I uh so I did my

[01:19:15] DBP uh training at the hospital for sick children in Toronto so I'm Canadian uh trained at sick kids an incredible place to train with volume of cases and complexity of cases so is a fantastic place um yeah probably one of the three largest children's hospitals in the world right yeah it is it is it is a fantastic place to to train um and so I did Pediatrics pediatric neurology and developmental behavioral pediatrics there my interests were always my interest of passions were always like genetics the human brain developing human um neuroplasticity I did a lot of research in neuroplasticity um and then um 20 years ago moved to California and in the Bay Area and took a job at

[01:20:00] Stanford but the field of DPP was brand new so as I said like it is was just starting out so they did not have a developmental behavioral pediatrician yet at Stanford um so I was the first there after me um they hired an incredible developmental pediatrician by the name of Heidi Feldman who then created the division of DBP at Stanford and she's still there and they have a fantastic group there now um but I arrived with there was nobody else um I was at Stanford for a number of years and did research um clinical work as well as medical education teaching um and then after that I focused on the clinical piece and went to a large clinical organization did clinical work but then 10 years ago in 2014 decided to leave the traditional model um and start my own uh multi-disciplinary Clinic tell me a little bit more about why what what were you what was happening prior to 2014 that you didn't enjoy yeah I I felt that

[01:21:03] I could help my families and P and patients more Andor differently I felt like I I wanted to make an impact that's one of my my passions is always to make a difference and I I felt that I was a little bit stuck in the model um and it's just you know the medical model it it's uh there's so many good things about it but I had to to to help the families the way I wanted to uh with my values which I which I can describe I I needed to leave and what did I value so one um I believe in promoting like health and well-being and and that's all about DBP development of behavior it's about promoting Health where medical centers are uh have been in the past primarily focused on treating disease um so that was one thing uh two I really believe in um multi-disciplinary teams and really having an integrated team um uh in this area as I just described like understand the whole child requires not just a physician requires therapists psychologists teachers like different types of professionals and I really believe that to make a difference those professionals have to be integrated um if you want a touchdown like all the players need to be reading the same

[01:22:26] Playbook um and so I felt like a lot of the families I was seeing they would come see me in the medical center the doctor but there was the school and there was the therapists and um we had all these different silos so I really believed I needed to bring the silos together um another thing is I believe in community collaboration so that's actually the bridge to education and that that's actually really hard to do in a standard medical model is to really have um collaboration with the school so now I I do school observations I go to

[01:22:58] IEP meetings I work with teachers in classrooms because I know that to move the needle with the patience I see I need to do that you need to see what the kids doing at school I need to see what they look like at school um and then I believe that the family is the patient not just the child so that's also uh if

[01:23:17] I am going to make a difference in a child's life I work with the parents a lot it's amazing how powerful parenting can be and training parents and working with the and and again this is the social piece the Dynamics understanding the whole family situation is really important to make a difference in a child um and then lastly I believe in um

[01:23:39] I love learning and being Innovative and thinking outside the box and so I decided to um set something up where I can continue to like ask questions and challenge the system and and try to make it better so tell me about your team you said you have 25 people on the team so we have um we have a few different programs we have um we have a behavioral team um where we focus mostly on kids with um with autism however probably about 20% of the kids who work with our behavioral team um don't have a diagnosis of autism but do benefit from behavioral therapy social skill groups um parent training that focuses on behavioral models um we have a mental health therapy team um that supports kids with and teenagers with anxiety depression so we offer different types of therapy for that mood uh disregulation ADHD we have psychologists who do testing for um to for Diagnostic assessment um and then um and then we have a medical I'm the medical team where we but it's it's not just giving medicines I do prescribe medicines but again it's like that is a portion of what I do I look at the whole child and it's really understanding um the therapies the parenting the school piece and medication when it's important and can help so there's something called

[01:25:10] Aba tell me remind me what it stands for Applied behavioral analysis okay and my it seems to be a somewhat polarizing Topic in the field of of of autism therapy um maybe describe what ABA is and explain perhaps why it's so polarizing yeah yeah so ABA um means a million things these days and it just like autism means so much as well um so ABA is a behavioral intervention um that traditionally has been used uh with kids with autism it is about taking um a skill and breaking it down into smaller sets smaller subsets um and it is so traditionally it was very direct adult directed repetitive um working on a small skill that and all these small skills add up to a bigger skill um and what's an example so an example would be um oh you put me on the spot and I got to think of an example now that's really good okay let's think of something um okay it may be something to do with um greeting someone okay appropriate greeting an appropriate greeting would be integrating um verbal as well as eye contact UM as well as maybe turning your body towards the person so when you greet them when you meet a new person and so for so someone with significant autism you know that's that's difficult and they need to learn how to you know turn their body and make the eye contact and do the vocalization and how to integrate that um so for that skill you You' work on the different subsets and so you might be first working on if you want to like greet someone and acknowledge them you're first going to look at them and make that joint have that joint attention so um you're going to teach a child how to um how to make eye contact so in the old fashion so I'm going talk about like initially we called something we we did

[01:27:17] ABA with something called discreet trial that's why it's controversial discreet trial uh which is still used today and still can be very helpful when it's combined with more naturalistic forms of ABA um discret trial would be about like teaching a child to make eye contact and they get a reinforcer every time so make eye contact get a reinforcer positive reinforcer so it's positive reinforcers it is a lot of repetition practicing teaching a child a new skill and then you would add the other layers to it the the eye contact and then the the greeting and the you know the vocalization tur your body add all that together to come up with this larger thing of like how do you approach someone okay so discret trial has been around for decades that's the part that's controversial because people say oh this is very repetitive and it's it's not you know it's not based on relationships so over the years there are have been more naturalistic

[01:28:13] ABA um you know methods created naturalistic in that it occurs more in a child's natural environment it is not just at a structure table where you and I are practicing eye contact UM natural environment um also trying to understand the child's natural motivators so for example um it might happen at a park and it might happen we know that child loves to be on the swing so rather than sitting at a table and me saying like may make eye contact here's your reinforcer make eye contact here's your reinforcer now we're at a park this child wants to be pushed on the swing well we're going to help this child learn that if you want me to push you on the swing you got to look at me and somehow acknowledge me so I go push you otherwise I don't know that you want to be pushed on the swing um and so those are more naturalistic forms one of the most naturalistic forms is something called pivotal response treatment

[01:29:14] PRT um which is actually training the parents in these skills cuz that's really what it's about it's like um it's not about whether this child can make eye contact with you know therapist a at the table it's about does this eye how does this child understand how to use eye contact when it's appropriate to use it and the power of it in natural settings and so when you train the parents how to do it then they can practice at the park at you know the coffee shop at you know on the playground the parents so that is the most naturalistic form teaching the parents this comes back to parent how powerful it is if you treat teach parents but parents work with the child in a natural setting with natural motivators are there limitations to treatment in you know families with single parents yes yeah you know well well well when when you said that I I'm thinking like it's just a single parent the time it's time and resources and driving to Therapies um again it depends on how significant uh impaired your child is and how many therapies they need yeah and and I'm just trying to understand like what the socioeconomic toll is so um uh so so I I guess think about that in multiple ways right so if what is the typical cost of therapy right so how much of this cost is covered by

[01:30:48] Insurance typically how much of this cost is embedded within the school program so obviously uh I think an IEP is included is in a if a kid's in public schools correct yeah if they qualify for IEPs yeah um but but is Aba therapy or uh PRT or any of these things are they covered by insurance companies for kidss they can be it depends on the state I see so how it's covered is is different in different states um I'm I'm from

[01:31:17] California um so in California um ABA is covered if you have a diagnosis of autism so there's that's where the diagnostic piece is important if you have um so then it is covered and and what about the impact of other siblings so is there anything that you you've noticed about um you know the nuances around if a kid has uh an ASD diagnosis and they have other siblings that don't have uh uh diagnosis or they do and where they are in birth order and all like just trying to understand the overall family environment and how it pertains to to treatment yeah there's actually so many so many things uh you can say about that so okay so I'll first start by saying that um siblings of of children um uh with with autism are at themselves at risk for either autism or Autism like traits or something called like the the broader autism phenotype they may actually not have autism but they may have a few traits of it um Andor uh at risk for other developmental disabilities so kids who are siblings also at risk for language delays anxiety so already they have again that that predisposition that load um to have some developmental differences so there's that's one and how much of that is based on the fact that this is a largely genetic condition and if they're siblings they share genetic traits even if they don't have all of them and how much of that is um the siblings develop those in response to anything from mimicking The Sibling with autism to responding in frustration to the behaviors of the kid with autism yeah there is a big genetic piece to this so they truly do have these conditions like language delay you know um autism traits ADHD they they it's very often you see a sibling with one of those other conditions um and there's that genetic piece but you're right there's a behavioral component um you know coping component anxiety component that um that may be related to family stress um attention seeking

[01:33:47] Behavior at the same time I also see the opposite I also see many siblings who um have incredible empathy and um for for people who are different because they have a they have a sibling who has a developmental disability okay so going back to Aba I'm kind of if I'm hearing you right I'm I'm not hearing you say it's good or bad I'm hearing you say it's just another tool in my tool bag and it has elements of it that are valuable if applied probably in the environment of the child is that I'd say I recommend it so so I do recommend it um I think it should be it should be a part of a child's treatment plan um the tricky part is it's you want it done with people who are well Tred who um understand autism who um understand behavioral therapy well and so that's the that's the why it's sometimes controversial is because because there is such a huge demand for therapy for kids with autism because the numbers are so high it's hard to find enough people to provide therapy and therefore it's it's also it's an industry and there's people who are in like you know who take jobs in this industry who actually are not well trained or well supervised or really understand the nuances because if you know one child with autism you know one child with autism and if you're just following a recipe um you might run into people therapists who who um who are not making a huge difference and and are not that helpful um but I I do offer it I do recommend it what is the current size of the autism treatment industry and how does it compare to what it looked like 20 years ago in other words has it grown commensurate with the increase in the prevalence or is there a greater burden on the per capita therapist today there's a burden I don't know I don't know the answer to like the exact numbers but um it's grown um but because it's growing it's scaling and when you scale you delute yeah you you run into issues with quality when you scale so it's hard but but but that's the thing how do we keep up so what do you say to a parent who's listening to us who's kind of trying to navigate this for their child um and they don't live in the Bay Area so they don't get to come and see you um what questions are they asking what are they what are they what are they trying to do to find the best care for their kids regardless of where they lie on these spectrums of anxiety uh ADHD or the various levels of ASD so what my advice would be with for them would be um so start with your pediatrician you start with your pediatrician but you need to find um so and your your hope is with the pediatrician that they are able to connect you to resources in the network um because you really need to find a team um it's it's finding a team and and you also need How likely is that that I mean it's hard yeah if you don't if you don't live in Boston or I don't know San Francisco or the you know or major cities uh I'm guessing that this multidisciplinary approach does not exist no and not it's it's not uh it's not easy to find so what are the options then what's the what's the next best thing yeah you try to create your team but the thing is I talk to families all the time this is so it is so stressful for a parent who is in a situation like this cuz um they they don't know anything about this this they weren't educated they could be highly educated and then we're talking about families who actually if you if you speak a different language and don't have higher education H this is a disaster but even for families who are well educated like you know trying to understand and quarterback this basically you need a quarterback to help you decide like is this ABA you know helpful or not is this should I be should I be focused on speech and language therapy or ABA therapy right now um what uh what should

[01:38:32] I be advocating for at my at my IEP meetings um you you really need someone to to help you with that road map so we need to help families more with that it is um I think of myself as a sherpa sometimes guiding people along this journey and it's it's the road map of like you know it every every year we pivot and turn like okay where where should we spend more time is it in

[01:39:00] Social skill groups is it speech therapy what should we be asking for and so your question is like it's yeah this is It's hard to find and so if you can't find it you're looking for somebody whether it's a the may not be a doctor it might end up being a really good you know ABA therapist or a psychologist in your community can help connect you um there

[01:39:25] State programs um what what is a what is a parent asking when they meet a provider to figure out is this going to be a good fit I mean obviously one option is just ask nothing and wait and see how it pans out and in six months ask yourself the question hey is my is my kid doing better today than they were six months ago but but if you if you as a parent had the chance to meet several providers so that hey look I happen to be lucky I live in a city there's three

[01:39:52] Aba providers here I'm going to go and interact with each of them what could I as a parent do to understand where should I go first which which is which of these three should I pick yeah what are the clues that tell me this person is going to have a higher probability of success yeah so one thing is that you make sure that they have the philosophy that um one size does not fit all so that is key is that um this this person needs to understand personalized care and that they don't just give the same um treatment recommendation same thing to every single child um it's not black and white so you need to make sure that that provider is um flexible in their thinking and their treatment approach so that they can provide individualized car as one two would be um that they would be proactive in helping you create some sort of team so it may not be a team like I have Under One Roof but you know they are open to the idea of collaboration meetings with the child speech therapist or teacher so someone and who is open to it but will also be proactive in arranging collaboration meetings maybe once a season um three would be um I think someone who has skills in um parent I mentioned the parent training piece I think that's a really important piece it's not just parent education it actually is parent training um because I've seen that really um um make a difference I think that's a great list um um I think you know again I'm thinking about this through the lens of how do you scale kind of what you're doing and there's two ways to do it right one is you just keep replicating a model that looks just like yours so really big multi-disciplinary model but you know that can only be supported in a certain geography right I mean to have a team at the size of yours you you're not going to be able to put that in every town and yet I think seems unlikely that this is a condition that discriminates by geography and therefore there's got to be half the kids in this country that are um uh that are that that have any of these conditions are going to be in areas where they're never going to have large TurnKey multi-disciplinary offerings at their disposal so their parents are going to have to do sort of the heavy lifting yeah and unlike cancer right so if a child gets cancer um a parent and family can go to another city for treatment right so if you if you happen to live in Austin Texas when your kid gets a certain type of cancer but Boston Children's Hospital or um you know pick your favorite city that has the greatest Center for that you know it's it's not an unreasonable thing to potentially go there for treatment right but this is not something you're going to go and do in another city right this is no this is has to be an integration into your life where you are for sure yeah because this is long this is the journey it's not there isn't this isn't n a quick thing this is uh this is years this is a journey um and the whole point is to have it integrated and generalized in the child's life we were just talking how you know ABA at in some like structured Clinic is is that's not that's you know that's not our goal for it's the goal is to have a child being showing us these skills in in real life in their real life in their classroom what percentage of the children that present to your clinic with a diagnosis of ADHD plus or minus anxiety require pharmacotherapy in your clinic in your experience before I answer that I'm just going to emphasize so kids who come to my clinic with

[01:44:08] ADHD um come often come to me not always but often come to me because it was a little bit more complicated um then straight there's a selection bias into your clinic If This Were straightforward they wouldn't be to you yes if it was straightforward hopefully their pediatrician can manage it okay yeah makes sense yeah so the percent of kids who are treated with medication uh depends on like the age of the child and the severity of the

[01:44:38] ADHD um so younger kids in my clinic um I will use behavioral interventions first Define young what is that cut off for you so I see preschoolers who come to me because they've been asked to leave multiple preschools because they are hyperactive yeah and in that preschool years although you could technically make the diagnosis I share with the family that we're probably going down this path whatever we're going to call this in the next couple years let's start working towards helping your child build skills to regulate you know manage their hyperactivity manage their impulsivity so we start with firstline treatment for

[01:45:20] ADHD in kids under six is behavioral parent training so that's first so under six it's behavioral parent training we do that first and try to get that to help um we may or may not need to add a medication um the guideline for six and older first line treatment is medication plus behavioral parent training and so medication makes a big difference medication can be very very helpful and I read the family where they are at on this journey and their family values and how they're processing the information um and I listen to their questions and concerns and I build trust and so some families are ready to start medication right away other families have questions yeah and I work at developing a relationship with that family answering their questions and most often we do move towards medication because we know it helps most of them say I wish I started sooner I want to dwell on this point tra because um I I have to believe there are a lot of people listening to us maybe not so much because I don't think my audience is quite where I'm going but but there there going to be people who understandably come at this and are really judgmental and their narrative is going to be the following these goddamn preschools trying to tell me a kid has you know

[01:46:51] ADHD maybe it's because the preschool's just overcrowded and the people who work at the preschool are too lazy to actually let these kids play let kids be kids you know there's nothing wrong with a kid that's hyperactive you just got to give him more to do blah blah blah blah blah blah this is sacrilege that we would ever give a child medication just because they're hyperactive so that's a narrative yeah for sure now again I don't think a lot of people if they're sophisticated subscribe to that because

[01:47:18] I think a person who's sophisticated would hopefully not make a judgment like that without understanding the fact base a little bit more would you agree that the best argument against that logic which is not an argument that says every kid should be on medication it's an argument that says you have to weigh the pros and the cons of being unmedicated and what the impact on your education is going to be um and the long-term success you're going to have as an adult as a well-adjusted adult versus the the accepted risk risks of any medication and the potential upside it has towards allowing that child to learn because again I I always like this framework you have which is you bring it back to what is the adaptation of the condition what is the adaptation of the phenotype yeah if it is disruptive if this is a difference in a child's education if this is a difference between a kid going to college and not if we believe that matters anymore or being successful in their career or not or having you know pro-social relationships versus not then maybe we accept the risks of medication so so maybe you can articulate that more eloquently if you have a different view but that's that's kind of how I like to think about things that seem at the surface absurd yeah no I I I love all the the points you brought up because it is a risk Ben benefit um you know ratio that you have to consider you have to consider there's risks in everything we do there's risks in all medications there's risks in so you have to consider both risks and benefits when I'm working with a family

[01:48:58] I talk to them about like the research and we actually have a lot of research around safety and long-term outcome and the outcome of individuals with ADHD who are left untreated but actually more importantly I get to know their child though see this thing I share like as I get to know them I share with them the research the Safety Research all sorts of information about the medication but what's really important so this is the idea about me going and watching the child in class me talking to the teachers I getting to know that family more really understanding like they come to see me for a reason if things were great they wouldn't come to see me they've come to see me for a reason and even though the school you know maybe initially was the school who said like your your little guy is way too busy and you need to see a doctor about this but when I get to know the family I find out well actually dinner is really stressful and bedtime routine really stressful and like there's often everyone's in tears in the morning um and so I get to know them and it's actually that personal part that helps them understand their child and then come back to self-esteem yeah so their their kid is not a statistic to you yes that's exactly it and that's how um and and some sometimes we don't use medication I am the first to say if your child isn't need it we're not going to use it although we know that medication can make a really big difference in kids with what are the so so I've I've discussed this on some previous podcast so uh is viance still used is Rin still used is Focalin used I mean what are what's in your toolkit in in that in that in that world yeah so um

[01:50:41] ADHD medicines we're talking stimulants and non-stimulants uh first line treatment considered is stimulants within stimulants um we have have two different medications we have one called methylphenidate and one called um amphetamine um methylphenidate we have many Brands that's the Ridin which has you know been around since I believe like the 1950s um we've got Ridin we've got Focalin we've got conserta we have lots of different methylphenidates they all have different ways of of um what was the other one after Focalin Concerta y okay Concerta um and there's many more Brands they're all different brands they all have different like how do they differ are they differing in pharmacokinetics and halflife like what what separates those three drugs for example um how the medication's released okay so it's just a timing of release and pH and the mechanism of Rel it's literally the same molecule yeah it's the same active ingredient methylphenidate but it's interesting kids respond differently to the different um medications the brands because the release mechanism are different so some kids are sensitive some kids are so in other words if a kid comes in and you try one of these and you don't get the response you want you don't necessarily abort the entire molecule you might switch to a different um formulation and I only say this because I can't tell you the number of parents I have spoken with who have said my kid was on Ridin it was a disaster when they switched to Focalin it got so much better yeah that's exactly right and so and there's no science unfortunately to tell us which one's going to work for your child um so you have to basically try a few okay and then the other one you said was just straight amphetamine amphetamine so that's Aderall which been around since the 1930s and then there's you mentioned viance viance dexadrin so there's medications um in that group again same deal it's literally the difference between viance and Aderall is release and kinetics yes viance is actually called a prod drug it's actually got a little molecule attached to it that needs to be cleaved in order for it to to work but they're all yeah the same again it's very counterintuitive to people why you take a hyperactive kid and give them a stimulant do you want to just give the brief overview of why that works yeah so the way these medications work is they uh increase uh dopamine and norepinephrine in the synapses between the brain cells in the parts of our brain that are important for executive functioning attention inhibiting impulses so the part of the brain the prefrontal loes where that all the executive function attention happens um we have our brain cells have to communicate in order to see that behavior attention these medications although they're called stimulants what they do is they they increase the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine in these synapses the gap between the neurons um and they improve the electrical activity and communication between brain cells what are the most common side effects you caution parents about with these drugs yep so the side effects can be annoying but they're not life-threatening the most common one is decrease appetite at lunchtime if you're taking a medication that lasts the whole day so there's medications that last 3 or 4 hours which we used to use a lot a couple decades ago when I first started doing this um but about 20 years ago we started using extended release a lot more and so extended releas is that it lasts like you know eight hours or 10 hours for the day or 12 hours a day and so those medications impact your appetite at lunch uh breakfast and dinner usually fine um there's this chance that it impacts sleep onset which is really important because sleep is super important kids but it can impact sleep onset if that's uh a problem we you know we adjust the timing of the of the medication in the morning um but these are generally single

[01:55:01] Administration first thing in the morning drugs I assum yeah so it's really they're really easy to use because you you take it in the morning they start to work the like the extended release will start to work within an hour and then they're working for the majority of the day then they come out of your system at the end of the day and so uh tomorrow um unless you give the medication to your child again um it's like they've never been on it it's like they've never been on it what are the differences then between the Rin class and the Aderall class do you have any suspicion one way or the other as to which is going to be more effective if you were to prescribe fcal in versus viance yeah so when I first meet a young child I generally start with methylphenidate and that's what most clinicians do with little kids and the reason for is that the metaanalyses show that kids tolerate methylphenidate a tiny bit better than amphetamine um although amphetamine is a little bit more bang for your buck when you're treating the symptoms um that being said no kid is a statistic like every kid's different so I have just as many kids on Aderall as I have on

[01:56:14] Redland so um interesting yeah so I use I have to say I use every single brand out there um and uh but I start with methylphenidate because it's shown to be tolerated better you mentioned a second ago that if your kid's been on this drug every day for a year and experienced all these benefits and then they come off the drug it's like they were never on the drug does that suggest that in the in the I hate to use the description this way but I think you understand I mean in the drugged State you don't get to do behavioral therapies that also have a

[01:56:51] POS positive impact independent of the drug such that if the drug comes off the phenotype is changing is that not to be expected so um so I I want kids to be actually practicing skills when they're on the medication yeah in in theory they should be able to do a better job it should be easier for them to practice the skills on the medication yes so so let me say a couple things so um so in theory um uh when they're on the medication they should be it's easier for them to practice paying attention controlling your impulses controlling your hyperactivity in addition to that this is where the behavioral parent training part comes in which is actually now a a recommendation that every family should have um should be doing training specifically for family not just child yes okay amazing how powerful parents can be in modifying the behavior of their child so parents undergo the training and the child might undergo some sort of therapy regulation group uh when they're older they undergo executive functioning coaching to learn organization and planning so what it is is you are trying to develop these skills so um when we practice something over and over and over again not only we develop new like behavioral strategies behavioral patterns new habits we actually positively impact the developing brain that's neuroplasticity which is one of my also my um my passions is neuroplasticity but we impact the brain through experience and our behaviors um so when a child has

[01:58:38] ADHD um it is a wonderful time to practice new skills and you actually impact neural networks so does that mean that you're telling parents or at least holding out a hope that hey you know your kid is seven or eight years old we're going to put them on riddin um this might not be a lifetime thing is there do you do you give them that hope or do you not commit to anything one way or the other I don't commit I I get asked that question all the time yeah for the types of medications I put patients on right if I put patients on a lipid lowering medication generally their first question once you get through the why should I be on this and what are the side effects Etc is am I going to be on this for Life yeah so what I tell fam so I have no crystal ball y I can't commit but I do have many many patients who do eventually come off medication some of them um maybe they shouldn't have come off medication they actually should stay on their medication but I have many patients who come off and do really well is it naive to think that because ADHD primarily impacts the prefrontal cortex that you would see at least a subset of people when they reach their late teens as girls and mid 20s as boys when they reach maturation of that part of the brain that at least a subset of them should be able to develop potentially the skills to to overcome the the genetic component of this or is that not necessarily correlated no I see a lot of kids who do who do um find ways strategies to compensate um and who do you know no longer need their medication as uh teen teers or young adults I have a lot of kids who are like that um but I think it's very important that they start early developing strategies and new behaviors um I think that is really important in strengthening those neural networks so what about the non-stimulant class of drugs here yeah there's um there are non-stimulants that we use um there um one is called stratera um which also um acts on uh epinephrine and increasing the norepinephrine um levels uh in the synapsis um and then there is a couple of old blood pressure medications we use one's called guine the other one's clonidine um those are alpha 2 Agonist um so they act in a different way with closing um channels in the post synaptic um neuron so it's a different mechanism but all of those medications also help with the you know the communication between neurons in the attention Center in the brain um the difference is the nonstimulants have to be taken every day um unlike the stimulants in order for them to work so meaning like um they're taken every day and you need a steady state in your body yeah do you ever mix these two or is it one or the other oh you mix them often okay you do and so often um they do not have the side effects with the um Poe appetite um and sometimes they can really good with kids who have um um some emotional disregulation impulsive emotions so we'll often use them um with a child who has a little bit of that irritability emotional disregulation and sometimes we're using both the stimulant and the non-stimulant at the same time are there any medications that typically show up in kids with um autism but without um

[02:02:19] ADHD so let's just say kids with autism plus or minus anxiety what is the role of pharmacotherapy yeah so with there's no medication that treats the core symptoms of autism so a the core symptoms don't require medication it's therapy we use medication in kids with autism to treat Target behaviors and symptoms so we use medication um for the symptoms no matter the label so whether or not the child with autism has ADHD or not we still may use an ADHD medicine yep if they're hyperactive or impulsive we still may use it whether or not the label's there got it so you don't need the diagnosis to decide in other words there are kids with autism that are going to be on medications and it's really just a function of the symptom correct correct so the target symptoms we usually treat are the um it is the attention hyperactivity impulsivity where we'll be using the stimulants or the um challenges with emotional regulation where we'll use a non-stimulant um we may use an anxiety medicine um so a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ssris such as Prozac or Zoloft we may use that um for anxious feelings we also use that sometimes for rigidity so kids with autism who struggle with rigidity and transitions it's often anxiety related so we'll use the ssris there um and then kids who have really um aggressive behaviors um and may injure themselves then we are talking about a typical antis psychotics which I I'll just share with you I I don't use a lot of those myself

[02:04:10] I um I at that point if if the child is having those uh difficulties I often working with a psychiatrist again I think it's just got to be so hard for parents to potentially stomach putting children on psychiatric medication but um what you said earlier was sort of interesting right which is most of them are coming back after saying I wish we did this sooner yeah which I I suppose would be the most affirming thing you could ever hear in that situation what are the things that they typically notice when they come back to you and say that and how long does it typically take well with the stimulants it could be pretty quick they're like um we're glad we did this and this made is making a big difference because the the impact of stimulant is right away you see the benefits right away what do the kids say let's assume a child is old enough so let's assume you're you're working with a seven-year-old or a 12-year-old um who can articulate their feelings like what do they come back and say to you yeah they um they share with me that it helps them with their focused they feel more successful at school and they share side effects side what other side effects do they complain of besides appetite suppression yeah so I will sometimes have high school students who tell me that they feel less social and funny uh when they're taking their ADHD medicine um so they're a little less impulsive or spontaneous and and so we talk about that and and I listen because this isn't it doesn't do black and white all or nothing like our goal isn't to make someone um 100% focused 100% of the time this is theirs could be it's like okay so um we want to improve focus none of us are focused completely all the time so when I have people come to me with side effects I'm like okay well probably the the dose is wrong or maybe we should change to a different medication you're this one particular medication may not you know be the right match for you so we should need to change it and find one with less side effects so I think that the key thing is having a relationship between the doctor and the patient lots of communication and the idea that if the patient is experiencing side effects that they tell somebody so that you can adjust you change the dose you change the timing you change the brand um again it's like it's just weighing pros and cons you hear this um phrase from time to time which is that you know kids with autism have have superpowers yeah um and and sometimes we you know we might think of you know an example like okay well

[02:07:05] Dustin Hoffman's character in Rainman I mean obviously highly highly impaired for most of life but clearly had a superpower right he could count cards toothpicks um so obviously that's kind of the Hollywood version of that but but is there truth to this idea that that you know kids with autism have have superpowers or is this something that you would put more brackets around and say well you know sometimes those kids who are in class three where they're really impaired you know maybe there's something there but it's it's a lot harder to see than the kids in class one for example it is so there is a difference class three versus class one for sure um it's harder to see it's harder to see in class three um class one a lot of superpowers M um memory uh could be one of them um attention to detail um really good with remembering rules and following um you know routines or a set you know order of operations um there's a lot of strengths with with the kids in class one there are a lot of famous people I won't name who have even talked about themselves as having mild forms of autism

[02:08:22] Asbergers um so you would almost think that that that you know it's predisposing them to some of their greatness in in in in the fields that they're in often very technical Fields is that kind of consistent with what you see in the children yes more of a predisposition towards engineering technical Fields I do stem in general yeah definitely so it's less of the you know with that profile like I I called it a learning profile a thinking profile and so things where you need um a little bit more inferring BL you know little bit more there's abstract inferring or the social piece it may not be their strength but where you need to dive deep into some details um persevere stick with something hyperfocus on that you do really well and so a lot of people once they find their passion as a young adult if they find a you know a career where they can actually dive in they can dive deep and do really really well what do you think is kind of the most important thing you want people to understand about anxiety autism ADHD that you think is either misunderstood or not understood at all I think that there's a lot of overlap um I think people sometimes get stuck on the label and name and um although there's so many positive things we talk about the diagnosis you need to get resources uh I think I could concern that people get stuck on a name and don't actually see the person beneath that name and so um I think that's my key thing is that because I have had so many experiences where families are like but they told me it's autism it has to be autism if you think otherwise like you know what's wrong with the system and this is hard CU in this field it's there's a lot of gray and so I think that's what it's about it's there's gray it's a moving Target we've we've changed the names and the definitions multiple times the last couple decades they probably are going to change again so it's for us to be flexible with our thinking that the definitions might change again but there are these learning styles and so if you've met one person with one of these names you've met one person and it's really important to understand that person in order to help them with leveraging their strengths and then understanding what kinds of um what kinds of gaps you want to like fill and what kinds of skills you want to work on TR this has been really really fascinating um I guess my only frustration in this discussion is the concern that there aren't enough people like you and your colleagues um out there to match what is very likely uh the psychological burden of these conditions across kids today and I'm and I'm only speaking to the

[02:11:33] United States so I think if you were to think about this globally I I I won't I won't attempt to make a statement because I simply don't understand what the prevalence is or what the what the resources are but but I think we could probably say in the United States that there are far more children and families that are impacted by the AAA then there are multidisiplinary teams that can take care of them are you optimistic that 10 years from now this model is going to be different there are going to be more people that are going to want to come to practice this in the way like where where is the uh the long pole in the tent is it getting more people to Simply go into these fields is it uh a better payer reimbursement structure to incentivize more people around a multi-disciplinary approach what is it going to take in 10 years to close the gap between demand and Supply

[02:12:26] I think it's both those things you mentioned um it is definitely training more people and trying to think about um um how to use um and recruit people who are who are also going to support for example the developmental behavioral pediatrician or the psychiatrist or the or the psychologist like um for example we need more DB PS but we also need then like more maybe more nurse practitioners or other you know Allied Prof you know professionals who could can support the teams so it's it's being creative and

[02:13:02] Innovative with how you create the teams and find enough people to to be in on these teams but then um how it's reimbursed and um and making sure there's access to these teams will be really important I really believe in the bridge to to education as well which is not something that is funny you say that I was literally just about to ask you the following question which Dov tailes into that which is are we thinking about this the wrong way are we thinking about this as something that should be done through health care when maybe this should be done through education yeah now again if if if you had unlimited budget right so if look one way or the other this has got to get paid for so it's either going to get paid through through health insurance or it's going to get paid through via systems in education um do you think that the burden is disproportionately on the healthcare system today and it should be a shared burden with the education system and I'm not saying that to be critical of the education system they would need the funding and the resources to do this but is that part of the issue is that you're always going to see these things manifested in the education system and that's where you're going to get the most bang for your buck when you address them yeah it's It's tricky because it's

[02:14:18] I I I'm going to go back to it's the bridge y cuz is it's like the insurance um you know they'll say that parts of this intervention are educational so they're not responsible for it and then the educational people will say that you know well this part is this medical thing it's actually not interfering with the classroom but to help that child this is the this it's you need to realize to help that child move the needle you have to have both systems working and talking together and collaborating together if you really want to move forward and so it's a totally different system but I really believe in bridging education mental health and medical if you want to make an impact on child well-being and health well I am I'm really hopeful that that this message spreads and that we we see more and more of this type of

[02:15:14] Integrative approach because it it really makes sense so thank you so much for your time and appreciate you coming out here thank you Peter n [Music]
