## Description

Full title: #48 – Matthew Walker, Ph.D., on sleep – Part II of III: Heart disease, cancer, sexual function, and the causes of sleep disruption (and tips to correct it)

Original release date: 4/8/19

In part 2 of this 3 part series, Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience at UC Berkeley and expert on sleep, describes the preponderance of evidence linking poor sleep to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and sexual function. He also details the impact of cortisol on our nervous system contributing to sleep disturbances and insomnia as well as the efficacy and risks associated with the most common sleeping pills. Matthew also describes the sleep needs of teenagers and urgently lays the case that we should reconsider school start times. We also get into the effect of electronics at night, the efficacy of napping, the general impact of modern society on our sleep habits, and what changes we can make to course correct.

We discuss:
-Sleep and cardiovascular disease [6:00];
-Fuel partitioning and dieting while sleep deprived [16:45];
-Sleep and the reproductive function: testosterone, sperm count, FSH, menstrual cycles, and fertility [19:45];
-The biological necessity of sleep, the lack of a “safety net”, sleep debt, and ways to course correct sleep problems [23:45];
-Fighting cancer and improving immune function with sleep [34:30];
-The medical profession: A culture that devalues sleep [47:30];
-The sleep needs of children, the travesty of early school start times, electronics at night, and advice for parents [1:04:45];
-How exposure to light affects sleep, and how modern society has changed our sleep habits  [1:26:15];
-Is napping helpful? [1:36:00];
-The effect of cortisol levels on sleep [1:41:15];
-Are sleeping pills doing more harm than good? [1:52:15]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dr. Matthew Walker:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focused heavily on the relationship between sleep and various health conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease and cancer. Dr. Walker discussed the biological mechanisms through which sleep deprivation affects health, including immune function, hormone regulation, and cellular repair. The conversation also covered important topics like school start times, medical resident work hours, and the problems with common sleep medications.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Daylight savings time causes 24% increase in heart attacks after spring forward [00:05:30]
- Sleep deprivation leads to 70% drop in natural killer cell activity after one night [01:37:00]
- Teenagers need 9-10 hours of sleep; only 11% currently achieve this [01:31:00]
- Delaying school start times leads to 70% reduction in car crashes among students [01:06:00]
- Sleep restriction leads to 200-300% increased risk of coronary artery calcification [00:09:30]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Remove technology from bedroom [01:19:37]
- Use warm/yellow light instead of blue light in evening [01:29:59]
- Practice meditation to reduce sympathetic nervous system activation [01:52:34]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Ambien and other sedative hypnotics discussed negatively [01:53:53]
- Phosphatidylserine mentioned for cortisol management (400-600mg) [01:48:28]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Sleep will bend that curve of your lifespan in a downward direction with a dart into the ground when it starts to get short" [01:34:19]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific mechanisms through which meditation improves sleep quality?
2. How does sleep debt accumulation differ between adolescents and adults?
3. What role does sleep play in autoimmune conditions?

Would you like me to expand on any of these sections or provide additional analysis of other aspects of the episode?

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD comm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription welcome back to the three-part series on sleep with

[00:04:15] Professor Matthew Walker professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California Berkeley and the founder and director of the Center for human sleep science matthew earned his undergraduate degree and PhD in neurophysiology in london and subsequently became a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School before moving to Berkeley his research examines the impact of sleep on human brain function in healthy and diseased populations today he has published over a hundred scientific studies he has received numerous funding awards from the National Science Foundation National

[00:04:44] Institutes of Health and he's a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences he's the author of the international bestseller why we sleep which also happens to be the favorite book of mine not yet two-year-old son he holds many patents covering various consumer based sleep recordings sleep tracking and sleep simulation he's asleep scientists at Google where he helps the scientific exploration of sleep in health and disease he is also an enormous fan of

[00:05:09] Formula one and my hero Ayrton Senna and in the third part of this installment we actually spend quite a bit of time discussing this in the second part of this series we discussed sleep and cardiovascular disease sleep and how it affects diet sleep and reproductive function the risk of deliberate sleep deprivation --'s sleep and cancer the lack of sleep within the medical profession school start times and sleep deprivation sleep patterns and light the biochemistry of sleep and naps the efficacy of various medications on sleep as a reminder at the end of this series we're going to take questions for a follow-up AMA with

[00:05:48] Matthew asking questions on the AMA forum and listening to the AMA podcast with Matthew along with all AMAs will only be available to subscribers so if you haven't signed up yet you can do so now at Peter attea MD com forward slash subscribe so without further delay here is part 2 of 3 Professor Matthew walk okay there's like literally a hundred more things I want to ask you about so can you make the case for why cardiovascular disease is worsened by or accelerated by sleep deprivation and then same question I'm gonna ask you in a moment for cancer just pick the best like because again you could write a book on each of those going assisted yeah and and that book but let me just give you one example for cardiovascular disease there is a global experiment that is performed on 1.6 billion people across 70 countries twice a year and it's called daylight savings time and what we've seen is that in the spring when we lose an hour of sleep there is a subsequent 24 percent relative increased risk for heart attacks that following day 24 percent in the fall when we gain an hour of sleep opportunity there is a 21 percent reduction in heart attacks that follow how long has that been known I mean I remember the first time I saw that I was like that can't be right and you know when you see it bi-directionally like that it's varied if you know that seems like a very robust manipulation that's been known for probably about 10 years what's also interesting and I won't get away from cardiovascular disease don't worry but just simply to mention that when you look at that same transition you see the same profile for car accidents you see the same profile for suicidal attempts and suicide completion as well what's also interesting by the way is that you see it in terms of federal judges handing out harshest sentences they hand out harsher sentences on the Monday after that time change in the spring because they're more moody emotionally irrational and less sort of you know empathetically sensitive because of that one hour of lost sleep and in the fall more lenient sentences so I think is this effect will last for two or three days so there is a blast radius to it that you can see it that it's better but still worse in the spring which is where you think you lose that area see the effect is still worse on the the second day and it's almost recovered by the third day and finally comes back to what looks like a baseline by about day four so there's a blast radius and this is you know you know why this interest obviously yeah and here's the other thing I always found amazing about that statistic in the northern hemisphere you would predict the opposite if sleep were irrelevant right wouldn't you think that gaining that hour of sunlight in the day in the spring just the overall anticipation I mean there's virtually no one in the northern hemisphere that isn't happier in April than they are in November right so so it's almost like you have all of that positive stuff working against you it'll see the signals described yeah so in that's like a kick in the face yes so in the face of birds chirping sunlight streaming temperature warming that one error of lost sleep was still you put put you back on your derriere rather quickly in terms of all of these facets so there's one example for cardiovascular disease another one there was a fascinating study where they took a group of otherwise healthy middle-aged adults who had no sign of coronary artery disease and then they tracked them for five years and then they looked at how much sleep that they were getting so again hands up this is essentially an associational longitudinal prospect of studying it you know you can't derive causality from it but what you can certainly say is when they started they had no signs of calcification of coronary artery those people in that study at the end of the five years who are getting five hours of sleep or less had a two to three hundred percent increased risk of calcification of the coronary artery which is the main corridor of life for your heart if you have a massive coronary essentially when you hear that colloquially you know that's essentially what's happening there so that you could have that calcium buildup on the basis of being bucketed into insufficient sleep that tells me that it's not that when you are insufficiently slept you also are someone who has calcified arteries it is saying that if you are insufficiently sleeping you are increasing your risk for developing that condition this is about the development of the heart is it to control that for some obvious things that would track with that for example shift workers or people of lower socioeconomic status who are working three jobs and so all the other things that can work there are exclusion there's some great exclusion criteria in that study where they prevent those participants from entering the city they also then added in other factors that you could imagine would lead to that so they controlled for those things like exercise BMI neck circumference smoking they even include history of snoring so they tried to take

[00:11:07] LEEP apnea out of the equation and still that relative risk was significantly larger what do you think is the mechanism i think the mechanism is probably several fold I think the first thing that we see when we under system driven now that to some people may sound oh that sounds like a good thing no you have two branches of your automatic nervous system I swear it wait for a moment I thought you would say good knowing that the listener would understand that there's sympathetic and parasympathetic but thinking you were you were gonna make a comment about being more high-strung is better because but no you actually were making a joke yeah I love I mean I think I think you're so well tuned to this I think that's the the beauty of my IQ is so low

[00:11:55] I'm such a simpleton that I can always revert to the naive state and I don't have to make assumptions that's the beauty of my idiocy but no sympathetic nervous system being sort of cranked on your sympathetic nervous system is not a good thing your sympathetic nervous system essentially is your fight-or-flight branch of the nervous system and what we find is that as soon as you start to understand individual that fight-or-flight branch of the nervous system starts to ratchet up when that increases you start to see or perhaps the reason why it increases is that you get a greater amount of adrenaline release you get a high spiking in levels of cortisol you get a blunting in growth hormone and I think probably just the cortisol and the growth hormone alone may set you on a path towards cardiovascular disease because we know that those are two factors that lead into that sort of some of that a--throw sclerotic and brings it back to alzheimer's disease which is even if you just look at the epidemiologic data the signals quite large on the benefits of IGF and growth hormone more than any other disease in protection from neuro degeneration so that may be even in addition to everything you talked about with respect to clearance you're simply taking away neuro trophic factors correct are essential there's some data and I don't know how well replicated it is I just read in one they were if you look if you're a poet for so this is in terms of your genes there are some genes that can predispose you to Alzheimer's disease on this podcast there are wonderful descriptions of going into all of the details of these but i po e for significantly increases your risk for the development of out Simon's disease it appears but what's interesting is that if you are a

[00:13:43] PO for but you are Norma tensive you don't necessarily have an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease if you are a pony for but you are hypertensive then your Alzheimer's disease risk is far higher so in other words there seems to be an interaction a gene by cardiovascular disease interaction that leads that genotype to predispose you to

[00:14:08] Alzheimer's disease and therefore you know if you are under sleeping you are putting yourself on a path towards many new different factors that we are learning regarding cardiovascular disease you know calcification of the arteries is one of them but we also just see you know blood pressure you know spike we can take someone who is in a lovely state of you know Norma tensive profile and has been and after either one night of total sleep deprivation or one night of short sleep you know we can almost start to see it after about reducing sleep by three hours take someone down down to five hours for just one night you immediately see this spike in the fight-or-flight nervous system blood pressure goes up you start to see cortisol increase heart rate starts to increase as well you know it's almost as though you've just got a beautiful car engine you've put it in neutral and you put your foot on the gas pedal and you're just revving the living daylights out of that engine in a fight-or-flight state now if you do that chronically which is what most people do with insufficient sleep you know day after day week after week year after year decade after decade it's not surprising that you know just revving the daylights out of that engine at some point gaskets are going to start blowing it's not designed to operate in that high revving state or now high-revving occasionally just fine and if you have a beautiful let's say you know Metzger Porsche engine which loves to go to nine grand and course you and is in the gt3 I had to geek out on cars for a little bit cuz I'm just so obsessed I had to get in there but but even then you just can't stay at that rpm that high rpm for very long you just know it from listening to the engine you just know that mechanical badness is happening in neutral when you've got your foot on the gas pedal well that's the same way with chronic sleep deprivation in your nervous system so I think many of the cardiovascular effects in fact I think were writing a paper right now I think if there is one central common pathway through which we can understand almost all aspects of the

[00:16:23] Dilla Tereus impact of insufficient sleep it is through the autonomic nervous system and specifically an excessive leaning on the fight-or-flight branch of the nervous system which is to say that your sympathy vagal balance is way off and you are far more in that fight-or-flight sort of aversive state so I think that to me is were that disease pathology starts and perhaps progresses from that point and I think only adding to that which is probably what you described is sufficient alone but when you look at what I think are pretty well-documented appetitive changes in people under sleep deprivation and more importantly the inferior fuel partitioning that follows so the hyperinsulinemia the impaired glucose disposal the tendency to probably eat more crap I mean I'm at my worst when I am sleep-deprived it is you know I just it's so hard to avoid junk food whereas probably the single greatest tool in my arsenal to eat well is to sleep well I mean it doesn't sound like that's an obvious thing but it's amazing when we read the data I mean it's it's striking and you know we can get into that which is essentially what you've just described is the the energy balance of an organism of a human being and both the regulation of energy once you've taken it in and also the input of the energy or and the selection of the energy how do you eat and how much do you eat and then secondly once you've eaten what does your body do with that food in terms of a basic kind of blood sugar control and then the fourth thing is where you access it so you I'm sure I mean I'm sure this has been done I just haven't seen it but if you look at respiratory quotient of people sleep-deprived versus not I'm sure RQ must be going up right

[00:18:18] I'm sure they're absolutely going after the wrong fuel partitioning that's exactly what you see I'll do what you do well you know I always forget to do let me explain why that matters respiratory quotient going up implies that under the same level of exertion you would preferentially go after glycogen for ATP as opposed to fat and so not only is that not what most people want because they prefer to burn their fat and burn their glucose it signals a metabolic inefficiency which lays at the heart of all of this stuff and a beautiful example of that is a great study that looked at the efficiency of dieting when you are underslept and effectively what they found is that your diet is all for nothing if you're not sleeping well because what they found is that when you are under slept to find two sleeping six hours or less seventy percent of the weight that you lose will come from lean muscle mass and not fat in other words is perfect when your cortisol is high that's exactly that's exactly what you'll see with cortisol so in other words your body becomes immensely stingy at giving up its fat your body will ruthlessly hold on to its fat when you are under slept and not give it away instead it will so when you are under slept in you're losing weight you're losing the thing that you want to keep which is beautiful muscle definition and you're holding on to the one thing you're trying to get rid of which is the blubbery fat and it's really everything it's the cortisol is working against you insulin will work against you you're gonna have more hyperinsulinemia you will have more catecholamines working against right yet we see that with norepinephrine input kela oh and testosterone will go down that's gonna work against adiposity getting rid of it yeah I should note by the way that you know men and we I think we'll come on to this later but you know men who are sleeping just 5 to 6 hours a night will have a level of testosterone which is that of someone 10 years their senior so insufficient sleep will age a man by a decade in terms of that critical aspect of wellness and virility so if you want to sort of be very you know bravado about insufficient sleep be careful I would also say that by the way we found it simply associational but men who are sleeping just five hours a night have significantly smaller testicles than those men who are sleeping seven hours or more and I'm sure that in that you would see FSH and LH must be lower right so we do so you know I'm not trying to make necessarily funny even though sometimes I'll start talks that way just to sort of get the bravado folks out the way but you also firstly see that you men who are sleeping six hours or less will have fewer sperm those sperm will have more deformities but this is not simply a form it is even genetic so even aneuploidy and the splits correct yep and you can see that in rats too if you do those studies and those studies have been done with short sleeping rats but it also transfers to women that you see that women who are sleeping just five to six hours a night will have about a 20% reduction in FSH which is called follicular stimulating hormone which essentially is a critical part of the reproductive you know pathway in terms of getting pregnant women who are sleeping that little to typically have about a thirty percent higher rate of abnormal menstrual cycles so if you put together a couple that is trying to conceive and that couple is on six hours of sleep you've got a man who's down on testosterone down on the amount of sperm that they're producing the motility of those sperm are reduced and then the woman you you're down on you know you've got erratic menstrual cycles you've got FSH that's down to from a reproductive standpoint this is devastation and again it evolutionarily isn't that surprising it's basically mother nature saying if the conditions are not optimized for you to sleep it's probably not optimal for us to propagate the species at this moment and that is probably something that rarely happens and what happens to fgf21 do we know I was about to say we don't know I I should say I don't know of any studies that have looked at that fgf21 has such an interesting it's one of the few places in the brain where you'll see a difference between men and women under a fasted State so under a fasted State you don't appear to see the same hid and reproductive fitness of a man but you do see it in the woman there's actually an anatomic reason for this that I at this moment I'm forgetting but it basically has to do with this rise of fgf21 and you'll see basically the inhibition of FSH and the women without it in the men which again is like it's this question of if food is scarce we really don't want a mother to try to nurture another body yeah maybe that's the biological warning beacon that just says timeout on you know reproductive capacity right now I always get asked is a ketogenic diet in any way good bad or indifferent towards fertility and my answer is I actually have no clue but just on first principles it would seem that a ketogenic diet could have one negative side effect on the woman which is exactly that because a ketogenic diet generally does put up fgf21 it could be offset by benefit so if you took someone who's metabolically ill who is fixed by the game it could offset it but all things equal yeah you know I certainly wouldn't recommend fasting for a woman who's trying to conceive but you've had the luxury of spending a lifetime thinking about this I'm sort of playing catch-up over the past couple of years by the way it's one of the things that you do brilliantly by the way from what

[00:24:01] I've listened to on every one of your podcasts but but what I would say in response to your question though about that evolutionary question the reason I suspect it rarely occurs however is the following human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep for no apparent reason you almost never see other organisms undergo sleep deprivation the only time that you see in other species a seemingly restricted sleep isn't under two conditions the first is under certain with certain mammals after they've given birth they will deprive themselves of sleep to care for their young the most obvious example there is in killer whales where the mother will break from what's called the pod which is the main group they will go away and they will give birth and then they will bring that calf back to the main pod and during that time they will short sleep the second is under conditions of starvation that when an animal starts to become starved they will there is a wake promoting signal where you will actually stay awake longer and it gives the animal the ability to forage in a larger perimeter because presumably the current perimeter is not containing sufficient food and I think that that's the reason why some people will say when I undergo you know either time restricted feeding especially when I undergo fasting the reason that I feel like I don't need to sleep as much or you know I and I feel more awake even though I'm sleeping less and it's great I actually would be very cautious about doing that for long periods of time and doing it sort of repetitively for long periods of time is because there are still you're still suffering the decrements of insufficient sleep but the reason that you feel awake is because there is a biological mechanism in place that says oh my goodness if you're not getting food we need to keep you awake for a little longer we're going to sacrifice this thing called sleep for a little bit so that you can go and find more food so there's a wake promoting mechanism and we know how that works but the more important point here being made I think for me is that because human beings are the only species that deliberately deprive it cells of sleep and no other species has really done that it means that mother nature throughout the course of evolution has never had to face the challenge of sleep deprivation so in other words Mother Nature has never come up with any safety nets for any of our major biological systems metabolic reproductive cardiovascular immune mental health none of these things have any safe holding they don't have any sort of crutches when sleep goes away why because Mother Nature's never been asked to solve that question now I'll give you an example I use the same argument by the way first sitting in chairs you know worried or so many of these things sedentary base at Regis that we just do that we you could argue if our species could survive another hundred million years maybe sitting around doing nothing drinking soda would we'd figure out a way to make that not so harmful you know assuming it interfered with you know our capacity to reproduce if it didn't then maybe evolution wouldn't take any interest in it but I mean I think it's it's the reason for me at least why an alternative example in the pro would be you know an adipose cell that mother nature throughout the course of our life and most species experience times when there was feast and times when there was famine and so Mother Nature faced with that challenge of famine came up with a solution called the fat cell so that we could store caloric credit and then spend it when we needed to when we went into famine where is the adipose self asleep where is the fat self asleep you know wouldn't it be lovely if we could store up sleep credit and then spend it and the answer is there is no such thing because there it's there has never been the challenge in the course of evolution to come up with that solution and because hibernation is not an example right no nation is the opposite high variation basically says it's not giving you credit to sleep less in the summer it's just taking stock of the fact that there really is nothing for you to eat in the winter correct I knew that that's really about energy expenditure and essentially energy preservation and in torpor and hibernation of different states to sleep itself but that's always

[00:28:38] I think being something I've thought a lot about that example of you know the fat cell versus sleep and it's the reason why people unfortunately think that sleep may be like the bank that you can accumulate a debt during the week and then you can just sleep it off during the weekend what's the name again for that phenomenon of the sort of Monday through

[00:28:58] Friday short sleeper who Ben sleeps on the weekend what's called social jet by social jet yeah where you sort of essentially it's what I used to term very politically incorrectly asleep bulimia which was where you had essentially you know purge during the week I mean you just binge during the we it's this real binge kind of abstinence syndrome the reason it's problematic is not just because sleep doesn't work like that and the studies show that that's very dilatory us to health is because it also is terrible torture on your circadian biology because what happens is that you start to wake up you know you'll be going to bed at one sort of one or you know midnight rather than nine and then waking up at ten eleven you know on a

[00:29:41] Saturday and a Sunday and then come Sunday night you've got to drag your body clock back by three hours you know to get into bed and you repeat it the next weekend that's essentially like saying to your biology and no different I'm going to fly back and forth from San Francisco to New York every weekend three-hour social jet like difference that's a hazard ratio impact on your circadian biology there and as I'm listening to you say this I'm making this stronger and stronger case for my move to Austin which in part is driven by just shortening the trips that I have to take you know to be able to only have to take a one-hour time zone Delta or you know never basically having to take more than a two-hour time zone Delta is the your fuel lifespan health spend for the impact that you can have on this planet planet and this society during the time that you're here and for the preservation of you in your children's life I would strongly recommend it I'll share we do an interesting example of a patient of mine who has an example of what happens when that system you know quote-unquote breaks those gentlemen

[00:30:53] I'll try to be as vague as possible so I don't identify him even if he's listening not that he would care if I told the story anonymously basically worked in the finance sector but at some point was living on the west coast of the United States but basically was exclusively in in you know Eastern European markets so you can imagine what time he had to be waking up to deal with that after several years and he in part moved from the west coast to the east coast to try to make that gap smaller but he got to the point where he could never sleep past 3:00 a.m. it was metaphysically impossible regardless of what time if he went to bed early if he went to bed late he was up at 3 a.m. and it turned out one of my colleagues Vic Jane who's a

[00:31:39] Stanford trained sleep doc at Northwestern and also someone I just can't wait to interview because he's just so insightful in sleep you know he basically did something that you and I had talked about earlier which was reverse use of melatonin and blue light to phase-shift him into the correct time zone and what humbled me about the story was how long it took to move and it just gives you that sense of could you imagine forcing that on your system once a week and I mean it took months to correctly us correct a class right yet now admittedly it had been in place for a couple of years by the time you know I met him so you know you have a little bit more to overcome but nevertheless I was blown away at the lengths that Vic had to go to drag him forward by three hours for that biology to have been tortured for that long it's going to take a reset of you know non-trivial magnitude and help from an exogenous agents like melatonin light blue light regular exercise exposure to daylight you know even manipulations of body temperature it could take so there are a whole arsenal of tools in the sleep doc kind of box that we can use to sort of make these manipulations either be it for people with insomnia be of people with anxiety be it people with sort of jet lag or what's called circadian phase delay which is essentially what he was suffering from which was you mentioned temperature this was something I didn't know until I learned it through the through this patients case and through through VIX learning which was about two hours before the wakeup you see this drop in temperature and like that drop in this guy is occurring at 1:00 a.m. he's getting that drop up and then and so you what you basically were doing was dragging that thing to you know 4 a.m. you had to drag the temperature drop to 4:00 a.m. and again I think it just speaks to the complexity of this situation and and as a general rule when you mess with really complex hardwired evolutionarily sound things you've got to be careful you're gonna pay the fiddler when you fight biology and sleep is one of the most conserved behaviors across all living organisms that we've observed when you fight that kind of innate hard grained biology you normally lose and the way that you know that you've lost is disease and sickness either acute or chronic you know at some point a lack of sleep will get you it may be in your late stages of life you know Margaret

[00:34:19] Thatcher ronald reagan examples with alzheimer's disease could be from a heart attack prematurely when you're 56 years old or it could be a car crash at any moment in time because of a micro sleep you will be popped out of the gene pool pretty quickly so let's talk about one more thing which I'll we could talk about cardiovascular disease for much longer but let's talk about cancer and let's talk about when I talk about these diseases with patients one of the things

[00:34:45] I try to do is say let's reverse engineer what we think is happening when this disease goes wrong and then back things out so when it comes to cancer I say look cancer has a bunch of things that have to go wrong first you have to have a genetic insult - it has to be missed by the immune system unfortunately most of the time our t-cells can figure out that cancer is non-self etc etc and you kind of walk through all of these things so let's talk about the immune system for a moment because we know that if you're not swell I want to let you explain that yeah I'll let you go there because I was gonna I was just about to go off on this topic but tell me about how sleep impacts the immune system and not only how that might impact getting common colds but how it could impact cancer so firstly what we know is that there are now significant links epidemiologically between sleep and cancer of a variety of form currently that list includes cancer of the bowel cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast and then we can step down which are basically three of the top four exactly yeah three of the heavy hitters next you can sort of say okay what what about the causal evidence well firstly I would say before I describe the causal evidence that causal evidence is now so strong that recently the World Health Organization decided to classify any form of nighttime shiftwork as a probable carcinogen their words not mine and the proof of evidence that is required by the World Health

[00:36:09] Organization to make such a statement usually has to be astronomical and that data is now I think very well put in place I'll just mention one quick causal manipulation study done by a colleague down at UCLA they took a group of healthy adults and they limited them to just four hours of sleep for one single night and then they looked at a set of cells called natural killer cells and you can think of natural killer cells like The Secret Service agents of the immune system in that they're pretty good at identifying dangerous foreign elements one of which are malignant cancerous cells they'll inject some things into them and try and destroy them essentially so what you want is a pretty vile set of those immune assassins circulating in your body and what they found is that one night of four hours of sleep reduction led to a 70% drop in natural killer cell activity that's quite a surprising state of immune-deficiency that has happened within one night so you can step and repeat that and imagine what would be the state of your immune system particularly for those critical anti cancer fighting immune cells after several weeks if not months of insufficient sleep that's one aspect which is what is your vulnerability to developing cancer because you know many of us are you know we'll have cancer cells emerging in our body every day or so we need those aspects of our immune system to prevent those cells from becoming the disease that we call cancer

[00:37:46] I mean that's such an important point and I'm probably biased because I trained in an immunotherapy lab but I don't think people necessarily appreciate that we pretty much always have cancer and our immune system is pretty much always protecting us it's actually the exception when the cancer develops into something clinically correct and yeah you know I've debated not debate is the wrong question I one of my favorites sort of sitting around dinner discussions with with cancer biologists is what is the greater driving force for the obvious age association of cancer in other words why does cancer increase nonlinearly as you age and I offer two hypotheses is it three actually is it an increase in the rate of mutagenesis do you experience on a per unit of time basis a greater insult to the genome two if you assume that that's the same is it that over time the accumulation and the expression the phenotype of that becomes more problematic and or three is it that our immune system specifically the adaptive immune system is weakening and the balance starts tipping in favor of cancer and you know I've asked this question of Nobel laureates and future

[00:39:04] Nobel laureates every one of them has said we don't know they suspect it's all of the above but they all agree that the weakening of the adaptive immune system is almost assuredly playing a role in why we get cancer more as we age because we know many things are working against us when we do that and so when I hear you say NK cells which you know the cd8 cell the NK cell the cd4 cell these are these are your green berets and your

[00:39:36] Navy SEALs of the war against cancer if you put a hit on those guys you you know you could be taking a ten-year step in the wrong direction right just as you talked about the gonadal tenure leap right yeah testosterone I mean I would love to add a 3b hypothesis though which is that one of the most dramatic changes with age and most sizeable and robust physiological changes in with age that we see is that your sleep gets worse and sleep is probably one of the most powerful regulators of your immune system you know if you want a full arsenal and you want every single weapon in there to be sharp and ready to annihilate sleep is what you need that data I think is very clear in terms of the decimation of your immune system with sleep and that you know I just gave one example there - and the funny thing is like you give that example and it's not even that dramatic like there's no person listening to this who hasn't had a four-hour sleep night that's part and parcel for just being a human being in the civilized world and maybe even in the non civilized world right and yet to think about a lifetime of stacking those things and the compounding effect of what does it mean to get eight hours a night versus six point two to five hours a night imagine that I'm almost amazed it doesn't kill us quicker because to your point we have adapted a great system to cope with excess nutrients right we had a great system and it takes a long time for that to break us down I think in some ways we're probably so naive in our ability to measure the short-term consequences of sleep I mean not you of course because this is what now at night but I think as a medical community we're really shitty at knowing how to measure short-term like what's really happening and sleep deprivation in you know in clinics and in in health care system they're like in school like we don't really understand how bad sleep deprivation is on a learning child we don't we clearly don't understand what it's doing on the road like we do we don't understand that this will kill you much faster than you know bad nutrition right which is I'm literally going naked but you know if you look at all cause mortality and short sleep it's not even linear it's exponential you know it really is sleep will bend that curve of your lifespan in a downward direction with a dart into the ground when it starts to get short I think your argument is so great that it really comes down to the fact at least we had a system in place to train us for excess nutrients now look we can argue we didn't have a system to train us to consume refined carbohydrates we didn't have a system that trained to consume massive amounts of polyunsaturated fats or high high amounts of sucrose but we still knew how to consume some of these things and there is a dampening effect in nutrition that the you know ever-present adipocyte can numb and at least for a while blunt that system but you're right if we didn't if it wasn't really until what probably 200 years ago that sleep deprivation could have become common I mean what when do you really think was the tipping point I know that in the 40s we could compare the 40's to today but it would almost seem like the light bulb was a pretty big step in the wrong direction fight you know anything not to blame at a time for it yeah but you could go back and you could argue that you know Edison with the light bulb and his his company may have been the starting point I think it was probably happening even earlier on the basis of social demands you know the industrial era I think then yes impound things once we switch from an agrarian society to an industrial society in my mind that's when stuff is easy I mean my history's world but that's about two hundred and fifty years ago exactly yeah so I think we've been that that curve has started to happen so it's an evolutionary millisecond and correct correct it sounds like a long time the blink of an eye the other aspect of you know cancer is not just that you increase your risk for developing cancer because you weaken the immune system components that other to combat against all of those you know carcinogenic influences cellularly that you've just described but another study by a colleague at the University of Chicago

[00:44:01] David goes out he looks at the relationship between sleep loss and cancer in mice and I'll just give you one example of a study he did took a group of mice and occu lated them with some cancer cells on their back and then gave that cancer a one month period to grow at the end of the month he resected the skin measured the size of the tumor half of those mice were allowed to sleep normally the other half had their sleep restricted so they just had their sleep kind of top and tailed not total deprivation just limiting their sleep in the morning in the evening a little bit what they found is that at the end of that one month those underslept mice when they looked at them the tumor was 200 percent larger

[00:44:40] I mean it was physically distorting the body and if you were to see these pictures you know you would just think my goodness you know I can see its small tiny little sort of dot that is the growth of the cancer in the well slept mice you know the others it just looked like a hideous you know mass on these underslept mice secondly what they found was that that cancer in those underslept mice had actually metastasized which is just you know in some ways a fancy way of saying that it breached the original origin and started to invade other organs bone as well as brain and when cancer becomes metastatic you know that's when we know things can get really dark and grim in terms of life expectancy who'd explained that I won Kiera sister how many there were so so one would I think be exactly what we've described which is this immune weakening yeah but you could also look at so hypercortisolism puts as they actually hyperinsulinemia did they curve they you look at renal ekta mised the mice and riders fed them prior to it so they control it control the ball and resurrect yeah and what they did find in terms if they looked a little bit at the mechanism they found that macrophage m1 cells those were actually down regulated by a lack of sleep and what was up regulated was a sort of a rogue version which is called the m2 cells which seemed to have a tumor promotion component to them as well so they really but the the adrenalectomy is brilliant what a clever design take out the stress response and they limited that engine if you still and that's the fear is how much worse would it be when it really happens in humans because you will have that plus this huge tsunami of a cortisol impact hyper cortisol impact which is only going to say so bring this now back to the clinical tragedy here right which is again that we can of our profession and I say ours meaning mine and not yours you take a patient who's got a diagnosis of cancer do you think anxiety is gonna go up hell yes right do you think their sleep is going to deteriorate on no basis other than the fact that they have this diagnosis and they're often undergoing horrible treatment right it's amazing to me that

[00:46:58] I can't imagine how many oncologists are thinking through this problem right which is as careful as we are about crafting what the chemotherapy regimen looks like what the exact if you go to ASCO right if you go to the largest oncology meeting I don't know how many papers are being addressed on this topic do you know and I think there are they are few and far between with where's you you think about some of the stuff we mandate over in oncology like exactly who gets the sentinel node biopsy versus this and well what if this is an ER PR positive breast cancer versus in ER positive PR negative or like we could we could noodle and and mashin ate on the most menu details which you know maybe they matter maybe they don't and yet something like this seems so obvious and yet you know we just seemed ill-equipped to deal with it like it it's almost like you say and it doesn't surprise me either by the way it's not your fault as a medical profession you know and you know being part of that profession you know what I did was I looked at a retrospective and I looked at medical curriculums across you know the top 20 first world countries practicing medicine and what you find is that on average most doctors get about one to two hours of education regarding sleep so one to two hours regarding a third of the patients lives that is so anemic in terms of meeting the needs but the critical part is that one-third of their life spent sleeping also makes such a huge difference to their two-thirds of their life awake that is just to me unacceptable and there's a deeper problem which is in training to be a part of that profession you enter a culture that is as difficult as the one you described where you know heads of state our chest pounding about how little they sleep I mean I'll just pause for to share another sort of set of stories so when I started my residency we were on call every third night I mean every third night you know I think my record I think the most sleep I ever got on call in five years was five hours and that happened once and it wasn't of course straight five hours but I had accumulated five hours of sleep on a call night so I think you would average probably two to two-and-a-half hours of sleep every third night but that's average so guess what lots of those times or thirty minutes or less so you're on call every third night so it's my second month on the job so the way it works is you you're basically either on call post call or pre call those would be your designation so I come in on a Monday

[00:49:35] I am pre call so it's my day before my call day so you you know you come in at five in the morning you would normally leave by about eight o'clock at night or seven o'clock at night and as we're finishing our rounds that evening someone a surgical resident had failed to show for the ER shift he got sick so the chief resident said you know hey we need somebody to stick around tonight to cover the ER so I volunteered because I want to show how tough I am like of course I can do this so I stick around I do the ER shift that night of course in the ER you're absolutely not you don't get one minute of sleep obviously now it's Tuesday now

[00:50:14] I'm on call so I'm awake of course all day Tuesday and Tuesday night and Wednesday and I probably slept an hour Tuesday into Wednesday now it's Wednesday I get to go home early which means 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday so I've been up since Monday morning so this is not like within the realm of the type of sleep deprivation that's gonna kill you there are lots of people in the life come back to that yeah yeah that's the yeah but yeah okay so I'm driving home my point in case I'm driving home so I have quite a long drive till I have to get to the freeway it's about two miles but it's like stop signs and streetlights and then I have to get to the freeway and then I've got kind of a hike home at the point this point in time I lived kind of north of the hospital I noticed something really odd every time I come to a stoplight or stop sign I can't keep my foot on the clutch because for some reason I just I have a habit of like keeping my foot on the clutch and keeping it and first as opposed to just sitting in neutral which whatever so the point is I keep stalling and I'm thinking god I've never done this in my life like why can't I even sit here for 27 seconds and maintain my motor control over this thing so I met about the last street maybe maybe two streets away from before

[00:51:30] I have to get on the freeway for a 15 minute drive and in what I can only describe as one of the best dumbest decisions of my life I decide I freaking cannot get on this freeway I'm going to die so I pull over to the side of this road Eastern Avenue and there's this park called Patterson Park I have no idea what Patterson Park is like today but at the time I knew nothing about it other than it was grassy it turned out at the time it was like you know an open-air drug market and and this is now speaks to the second point so I had really good judgment which was don't get on the freeway but then I exercise comically bad judgment which is I'm going to go take a nap in the park so I get out of my car probably didn't even lock it walked into the park put my pager on my neck of my scrubs set the alarm for one hour it's like 6:00 p.m. wake up at 2:00 a.m. in the middle of the park with rat bites on my arms I mean this is like the drug infested rat infested park and just think to myself what in the hell just happened I had about three of those in residency the other thing that happened once in residency same situation every third night call but I had to take an extra shift in there and to be clear I volunteered right it wasn't like no one put a gun to my head and said you have to do this I volunteered for someone who couldn't take a night of call so I basically was on the same thing but now

[00:53:07] I'm way further into my residency you know this was in my like fifth year of training and I think the accumulation of that was devastating and so now it's 2:00 in the morning on that third night and we're operating on a patient and the way it works in residency is when you're a senior enough resident you're the operating surgeon meaning you're the one doing the case the attending surgeon is assisting you and this is a very trivial operation we were doing the only reason in fact we did it in the middle of the night is just to get the.oh our time like it wasn't even an emergent case it certainly could have waited a day it was just removing the gallbladder laparoscopically so i'm holding the two devices that in the trocars and i'm doing the case and the attending is just retracting for me and i don't know how it happened but i fell asleep on the patient and face-planted directly onto the patient and again the only solace you imagined the amount of sleep pressure that was necessary to build up for you to I mean and I remembered that

[00:54:15] I had had a number of head drops prior exactly yeah yeah everyone's like jammy tick of music but no the no it's just like you're falling asleep right right and you know after god knows how many of those it just turned into bang you full L position face-first into the patient again the only fortunate thing there is in the process I didn't jerk my hand and tear the common bile duct or you know an artery that could kill a patient so what happened well the attending surgeon said dude you're too tired let me do the case you come and hold this like it it wasn't even like it was just sort of like this happens and you go stand over there now whereas you think about like if that had happened in an airport an airplane or in some other profession where you'd think that's a four-alarm fire that's a what's going on here how can this happen it is and the data though we've got is pretty strong you know I've lobbied the the

[00:55:09] Medical Association on a number of times and I just recently wrote a piece in a journal called The Lancet which was called a sleep prescription for medicine and I lay out the case for why both for patient and doctor sleep is you know utterly essential but profoundly absent and firstly what we know regarding you know your surgical experience and that story there we know that if an a ding surgeon has slept only six hours in the previous 24 there is a hundred and seventy percent higher likelihood that they'll make a major surgical error such as you know splicing some kind of major vascular component of the patient what's also interesting is that when if a resident has worked a 30 hour shift relative to when they've worked just a 16-hour shift that resident after 30 hours of being awake when they get back in their car and start to drive home just as you did there is a one hundred and seventy eight percent increased likelihood that they'll get into a car crash end up back in the same emergency room from which they just came but now as a patient requiring ER treatment because they got into a crock the irony is lot lost them either the the other point is that we know that one in five medical residents will make a serious medical error during their residency caused by insufficient sleep one in 20 medical residents will kill a patient because of insufficient sleep now when you realize that there's well over 20,000 medical residents active right now and you think about that statistic one out of twenty and you were to then do the math and lay out the number of bodies in front of you that were preventable deaths preventable by way of this simple thing called insufficient sleep I think it is an absolute disgrace you know doctors working in the ER if they residents if they've worked a 30-hour shift 460 percent I think it is more diagnostic errors which just stuns me in terms of a number but what's also interesting is that when you lobby the medical organization and I've tried to do this a while back and I lay out that compassionate case of medical errors impact on patients impact on doctors themselves there was incredible pushback and resistance which was my mind is made up don't confuse me with the facts and

[00:57:41] I'm going to just you know have a mere culpa because there are a few people that were more vocal morveau cailli opposed in our residency than me when this 80 hour work week came in and my view was not that sleep was you know good and we needed more of it I I really didn't have a point of view on that I actually frankly hadn't reflected on that because I obviously didn't know any of the data you shared my view was the conditions under which we work are horrible and that's a selection feature you want people that are willing to opt into that who are willing to take that much pain to do this and I had this whole thesis which I have no idea if it turned out to be true or not that if you lowered the bar lowered the pain you would bring in a broader demographic now regardless of whether that's true or not it doesn't really matter in the face of this data in other words you if it is true that back in the day you were just training better physicians because you were attracting people that could persevere more or had whatever you know make up your thing it still doesn't change the fact you've got to come up with a new screen for that you've got evidence of the deleterious impact of even if you attract even if it's just a selection bias that you're bringing in these hard nickel folks who can just jam through with wakefulness in ways that you know really are just horrific for everyone involved you still can't get around the fact that they're not going to be performing medicine and its highest and we know for a fact that you don't need to so I think the only piece of evidence that favors that type of you know 30 our continuous residency type of mentality the only good argument I've heard is continuity of care that once you go down to a shorter amount of time you lose continuity of care with the patient that you're cycling doctors between patients but I have to say though even that I don't believe because when I looked at systematically at the other medical practices there are places that train wonderful physicians that have a maximum of somewhere between 12 to 16 hours places like New Zealand

[00:59:56] Sweden and France they all limit their junior doctors to training on nothing more than those amount of hours and if you then look at the ranking of the medical systems in terms of how well they're doing those guys are way up there at the top so I find it difficult to see a case for arguing for the ability to train doctors with insufficient sleep I'll tell you what I think is going on cuz I agree I mean I I haven't I've been away from it for so long but I've spoken to a few people who have kept up with the sort of medical education literature and it turns out the 80 hour work week has not solved the problems that they had wanted

[01:00:40] I don't believe that medical errors have necessarily gone down you could argue well ATS not low enough but I also think a more subtle part of it is in the countries that you mentioned I suspect that it is the cultural norm of not just the residents but the people who train those residents because they were trained in that sort of more humane way that you bring a different way of thinking about handing off a patient it means something different because it's just so engrained in that's how medicine is practiced and I think what happened in the United States and again this is wild speculation I don't follow this literature but just based on what I've seen since I suspect that when you overnight created a new rule which I think took place like July 1st 2003 new rule right overnight but none of the people that were leading that had trained under those conditions they didn't necessarily know how to teach under those conditions they didn't understand as we said like what does it mean to hand off a patient after 16 hours because in our day you were responsible for everything I mean you wouldn't dream of doing something like that because you just don't know how to communicate what needs to be done to the next person means so much of it just comes out of that so I suspect that's a big part of it and of course unfortunately that would suggest that this is going to take time but it still has to chime but I said I fear it that type of mentality is going to die one generation at a time because in part there was you know it's a bit of an old boys network I think some it but you mentioned those things about how do we understand the informational transfer of the propagation from one doctor's to the next regarding continuity of the patient who remains and I think that really is an important point part of me though it feels as though we've been able to put people on the moon and that was non-trivial but we solved it I think we can also probably solve continuity of care and protect both patient and doctor alike in terms of their well-being and still do it so I think it's nice no no I don't need to sort of trivialize the problem and I think what I want to try and do here is you know just raise my hands and say that you know I really appreciate how hard that is it's an it's just like early school start times and the work that I'm doing there to try and lobby for kids to start later that's not a small thing either because you've got to solve multiple problems you've got to solve bus unions bus transportation you've got parents who need to be in work at a certain time point and you know starting those times later is going to be non-trivial all of these things are hard problems and it's not as though

[01:03:23] I'm either ignorant of those and I want to really recognize how hard they are but what I would also love to do is to try and just make sure that we don't lose sight of the end outcome here the end outcome in terms of education is our children and making sure that we are not essentially educating our children and music by way of the insufficient sleep and the same is true for our patients and our doctors let's keep the target that we have in our crosshair at the end of this process in mind rather than gets perhaps distracted by how difficult the problem is it is difficult and I'm so sympathetic to that I know it's hard but there's so much on the line there is too much on the line for us to be swayed by the difficulty of the problem in terms of the importance of the solution that we must reach no no I don't disagree with anything you said I think what I'm trying to do is provide an explanation for why and it's not an excuse an explanation for why I think the experiment has failed here and it probably speaks to the need for a greater buy-in to the gravity of the problem and therefore a greater emphasis on solving what I agree are quite in the grand scheme of things trivial problems

[01:04:46] I mean splitting the atom was hard putting a man on the moon that was hard eradicating slavery that was hard all of these things have been done but I think we will look back you know with shame just like you were describing to your family regarding sleep and insufficient sleep as we look back now with smoking you know 50 years ago we will look back in probably 20 years with shame that we were having schools start at 7:30 in the morning by the way for schools that starts at 7:30 in the morning buses will start leaving at 5:30 in the morning that means some kids are having to wake up at 5:15 five o'clock or even earlier which in my mind is lunacy and I think the shame will be present when we consider the impact and the impact we already know from the studies there when we delay school start times what we see is that academic grades improve we see truancy rates decrease we see behavioral problems and psychiatric problems also decrease you see the number of people who drop out of school and drop out of certain classes also decrease and then finally shockingly the life expectancy of students increases and the reason that it increases is because of car crashes there's a great study in Teton

[01:06:06] County in Wyoming they shifted their school start times from seven thirty five in the morning to eight fifty five in the morning and then they looked to see in just this narrow age range of just 16 to 18 years old what was the change in car accidents and what they found in that following year not just that the kids reported getting one hour of extra sleep there was a 70% drop in car crashes that following year now the advent of ABS technology in cars anti-lock brake systems that dropped accident rates by 20 to 25 percent and it was deemed a revolution by some people well here is a bile chuckle feature getting enough sleep that will drop accident rates by up to 70% so when sleep is abundant Minds will flourish and if our goal as educators truly is to educate and not risk lives in the process then I fear that we are failing our children in a quite spectacular manner with this incessant model of early school start touch say a little bit more on this you and I have talked about this in the past which is and I think I even posed the question to you this way which was Sir you know all things equal Matt if you're trying to pick between three schools for your kids like would you way start time in the matrix of decision and you your answer was emphatically yes why is this the case why is it that do kids just is there something in their brain as they're developing that it's just a question if they need more sleep and therefore you'll pick it up in the morning or is there something about they need to sleep to a later time that won't be solved by putting them to bed earlier all of the above so firstly you know kids even when you're 16 17 18 you're still needing 9 to 10 hours of sleep because your brain doesn't finish developing until it's about 25 what percentage of 18 year olds in the US do we believe are getting that sleep or if it's easier to answer the question what do we believe is the median duration of sleep for an about 11 percent 11 percent are achieving the required 89% not getting sufficient sleep and do we have a sense of what that average is I think the numbers you quoted earlier I assume were for adults or is that for all comers no that was for adults for teenagers it's probably it's down to about 7 hours when it should be somewhere between 9 to 10 hours so those are what's a bigger deficit so the dollars of deficit is bigger than it is in adults what's also striking by the way is if you look at parents and you ask them do you think your teenager is getting sufficient sleep 72 percent of them will say yes I think my teenager is getting the sleep that they need yet only 11 percent of them are getting the necessary sleep so in other words there is a mismatched here between the parental and child sleep equation and what that also leads to then because parents believe that their kids are getting enough sleep there is a parent to child transmission of sleep neglect and what I mean by that is you know the pulling the covers off at the weekend when these kids are sleeping in for two reasons firstly they're sleeping in because naturally their biological circadian rhythm moves forward in time so they they want to go to bed later and wake up later it's not their choice they don't get a choice in that a biological it's hardwired so for a parent listening what would you say to them if they're breast lling with their kids sleep schedule what do we think is the most natural time to bed time to rise for a 16 17 18 year old I think for you know 16 17 you know you're looking at a 10 hour period probably from you know somewhere between 10:00 to midnight depending on their chronotype mm-hmm 2 then sleeping in until you know essentially somewhere between 8:30 to 10:30 the following morning now the reason that that is actually still too early though is because that would be what would naturally happen if you were to let them sleep like that every single night of the 7 days of the week but we don't because what we do is during the five days of the school week we are getting them up way too early you can even put them to bed at you know 9:00 or 10:00 and say sleep they can't biologically so they won't be sleeping as well during the week so at the weekend they're trying to sleep off a chronic debt that we've sampled them with during the week due to early school start time so no wonder they've got such a sleep pressure that is forcing them to try and sleep until like 1:00 or 2:00 in the afternoon so then we chastise them for saying you're lazy get out of bed you're wasting the day but it's not their fault firstly because their biological rhythms their circadian rhythm wants them to be asleep latent into the morning and into the early afternoon and secondly they've got this huge data of sleep that they're having a rebound from in terms of sleeping trying to sleep off that debt that the school systems have given them as well so to me I think we just need to you know reformulate our notion of how important sleep is in that context and you've already alluded to this that's a hard one to solve right because you're restructuring when a parent goes to work etc it's still non-trivial what would be a middle ground that would be a great compromise in other words like if a school started at 9:00 a.m. I feel like when I was in high school we started at 9:00 a.m. well ironically yet what's happened is that back in the 60s schools were starting around 9:00 o'clock and then evermore as we marched on in terms of our quote-unquote development in society in the u.s. that time has actually gone back and back to earlier and earlier start times I think because it's been squeezed by the the sort of the vice grips of you know work schedules where parents are having to work longer hours they are ultimately commuting for longer so they have to leave the house ever earlier so they have to put those kids in school ever earlier and I think many of these kids are just sitting there unabsorbed like a waterlogged sponge they're not going to be taking up information and in fact if you look at the data regarding delayed school start times and you ask yes overall GPA SAT scores all of them rocket up they all improve when you delay school start times but which classes get the biggest benefit in terms of the grade improvement it tends to be not the classes in the afternoon where they are finally awake because of their circadian rhythm it's the classes in the morning where before those classes would be starting at you know 8 o'clock but now are starting at 9:30 when you push them to 9:30 they're doing much better in those classes and it reaffirms the case that the hit that is going on in terms of the amnesic impact that early school start times are having is really in those morning hours when the brain is not designed to be awake and it certainly not designed to be receiving an education it's designed to be asleep preparing itself for its education which should really start at maybe nine or ten o'clock in morning I mean the United

[01:13:36] Kingdom right now as we speak at the time of this podcast there is a bill that's going through that will lobby for a 10:00 a.m. start time which i think is probably the sweet spot in the reality of it is because someone will say well great what do you want kids to stay in school till 6 p.m. and blah blah blah but my guess is you could probably do less with more if you did it right in other words you wouldn't need to spend as much time in school if you could have crammed right you could efficient you know more efficiently learn that information we've done these studies you absolutely do learn more efficiently when you have had sufficient sleep so it's a forcing function could you compress it it's like zipping a file you know the amount of information that can be stored is much greater but what's also interesting let's say that that's not the case and you say look to do all of the staggered system with the bus unions and to make it work out with parents and work schedules it's gonna require more money to figure this out well it turns out that some of that can be cost savings at the back end because kids get released later there is a time during when kids get kicked out of school if they start early which is this kind of criminal be witching hour which is where the kids are out of school but the parents are not home yet from work and when they get together sometimes for some kids bad things happen that's where you see a lot of juvenile crime happen which is in that sort of twilight hour' between you know the the 3 to 4 p.m. period when they're out of school to the 6 to 7 p.m. period were the parents are finally there and they get home if you look at the cost of that criminal impact of activity in those hours and then you say if we were to start schools later kids get out later we limit the window of criminal opportunity the cost savings comes back around and pays for itself for delayed school start times so you just need to open up the aperture of your memory think about the problem and ultimately you can solve these equations my daughter hates when I say this but I keep saying to her that I think this whole summer vacation thing's ridiculous because you know it's sort of an artifact of a world when you needed the kids to sort of work in the farm in the summer but it almost seems like having a shorter day shorter time in school more time in other words uniform the situation right more time to do extracurricular things more time to sleep but just go to school 12 months out of the year like go to school like we work right yeah that seems to be also culturally a very difficult solution but conceptually an easier way to approach this as well I mean I love your idea and I do think that the data supports it empirically right now which is that you may not necessarily need to just simply take the school day and push it forward in time you may just need to take the start of school and push it forward in time and hold constant the end of the day but by way of that sufficient sleep ultimately you may be able to still gain the same amount of intellectual equity within the minds of those young individuals by way of that sort of later school start time and greater sleep as a consequence and it also just seems like something that is so amenable to testing I mean it's very easy to do a randomized control trial there's lots of that stuff that's going on right now the dates it just keeps coming out and it goes in no other direction it's so consistent it really is is there anything that we as parents can do outside of the obvious which is choosing you know if we have the luxury right a lot of times you don't have the luxury but if you have the luxury of choosing between schools that have you know meaning if you can choose by where you live or if you're putting your kids into private schools or something the later time let's assume you don't have that luxury and you got this hand that's dealt to you which is school starts at 8:10 and you know it gets out at whatever 3:40 what can we do to help the kids get as much sleep as possible even if it means bucking against what might be their innate circadian rhythm I think probably right now the best thing to do is to try an excise technology and you know I'm very when you say that can you just say that again that is such AI mean that is such a hot topic right now but is visit other discussion I had with my daughter which is I worried that in 20 years we will look back at the idea of 10 year olds with iPhones as I worry we will look at it with even a worse lens than the smoking mother and that's there's two folds right there's the technology piece which we'll talk about and then that says nothing about the whole social piece of you know the influence of social media and stuff like that but so sticking to the first one you take the technology away completely you limit light after sundown so there's that component which is I think just the basic impact of light and this is scales to not just children it scales to adults too that we are a dark deprived society in this modern era and we need darkness at at night to allow the release of a hormone called melatonin and that melatonin as it rises it will help time the onset of your sleep and there are great studies that have been done where if you use let's say an iPad for an hour before bed first you get about a 50% drop in the amount of melatonin that's released so you lose 50% of the signal of sleep timing worse still that melatonin peak even though it's lower to 50% lower it will arrive 3 hours later at night so it's so mistimed by the the perverse impact of the screen so that would be like you and I living here in

[01:19:37] California but our melatonin release is much closer to Hawaii in terms of timing that's one hour one hour of iPad reading is that true also Matt for television does television in the same it doesn't so television less so but television has another mental impact especially if you're watching it in bed that's not a good idea because then your brain associates your bedroom as the place of being awake and watching television not the place of sleep and that's a when you start to form those maladaptive associations it can be a trigger of insomnia and anxiety and typically that's one of the recommendations that we have that you only use the bed if you're struggling with your sleep for sleep and intimacy that's it but to come back to the two kids that's the first impact which is that the light can disturb and disrupt their melatonin significantly we also found in those studies by the way that the one hour of iPod reading before bed reduce the amount of REM sleep time when people woke up the next day you have them rate how refresh by your sleep do you feel significantly lower rates of feeling restored and refreshed by their sleep what was also interesting is that once you stopped that iPad reading it again had this carryover effect it had this blast radius where they kept sleeping poorly for another two to three days after that iPad reading the second component though is a mental component I think it's the component that may be as if not stronger than the biological component with melatonin which is firstly that these devices that kids use can cause sleep procrastination what I mean by that is and this is just for adults too you can be there with your phone or your iPad and you can be sleepy and you could fall asleep no problem at all but because you got it there you just think just check email one more time just check Facebook all right let me send that tweet out and I forgot the detergent and we go on to Amazon very quickly and I just ordered that and and then you look up and it's 40 minutes later and now you're 40 minutes short on your sleep sleep procrastination is a problem but for kids I think the two bigger issues are waking up in the middle of the night there was a survey done that demonstrated that well over 80% of teenagers admit to waking up during the night to check their phones and check social media say that again later zero eight zero during the week will wake up at least once to check their devices so you've got this dependency that is causing this alertness spike to wake you up and that's a habit that once it builds is quite difficult to break the final thing I think even if you were to be diligent and put your phone in airplane mode what those technologies do is cause what's called anticipatory anxiety so I think many people have had that experience of having it like an early morning flight and you've got to wake up at 5:30 in the morning and you know it you set the alarm but you wake up at 528 and you are awake like a bolt mat I want to I'm glad you brought this up I have noticed this for my entire life I sometimes will play the game of can you wake up at five twenty-eight I'm blown away at the ability to do that now you can't do it if you're really sleep-deprived at least I can't so it's not I can't go to bed at 2:00 a.m. three nights in a row I want to sleep it if you don't have them what what is that telling us about it's almost like I've got a CPU with a crack in it like know an actual no kirat that that's right cuz cuz you can do it to a wrong time you can miss set the clock at the bed by ten minutes and hit that time versus true time right it's crazy and if there's a great experiment that I'll tell you about but that anticipatory anxiety that airplane example that's kind of like the extreme version but a weaker version but a chronic and I think a very maligned sort of version of it happens with our phones because most people the first thing that they do when they wake up in the morning is swipe and they just unlock this world of anxiety that comes flooding in through their phone emails texts social media you essentially are training your brain to anticipate that wave of anxiety every morning and what we've discovered is that when you embed that anticipatory expectation in the morning the amount of deep sleep that you get at night is less you end up sleeping in a shallow state and you don't get the same amount of deep sleep and the greater the anxiety that there is the next morning the greater the duction in deep sleep that you have night before that's the way you'll feel like you've had a pretty rough night of sleep when you're waking up for that early morning flight because you've just had a poor quality of sleep but the timing thing so I think to come back to make the point here so I don't forget I think for kids the best recommendation right now is technology to try and limit it and I know that's hard because the genie feels like it's out the bottle and it's not going back in anytime soon and

[01:24:58] I don't want to be puritanical I don't want to be puritanical about alcohol or caffeine about CBD THC I don't want to be puritanical about kids getting the sleep or timing of the sleep that they need or can't get but what I would say is that to try and maximize that sleep in the face of early school start times which is what we're currently facing right now taking that technology out the bedroom is probably the single best thing that you can try and do the other thing that they recently found was a correlation between the use of or having social media in the bedroom and fear of missing out because for kids so often I understand this you know because we were both kids you could remember that folks were going out you know in the afternoon you wanted to be there he wants to hang out as fear of missing house FOMO well now FOMO plays out on social media and it plays out when you disengage from the parents it plays out in other words in those Twilight hours and so there is good data now showing that fear of missing out is directly related to insufficient sleep at night in teenagers the way that you can try to help that is to try and limit the devices that give you the ability to have FOMO in the first place so but in truth I don't honestly have a good set of solutions right now for this teenage sleep problem

[01:26:26] I think it's gonna have to be letting them sleep when biologically they naturally want to sleep again fight that biology it's not gonna go your way it's just not well mat that that certainly will scare any parent senseless with respect to electronics you know one other question on that that my daughter actually asked me time if she's reading a book in bed with like a nightlight is that as harmful a from the standpoint of light which is actually the question she's asking and now Bea would be my question more broadly we talked about not watching TV in bed because that's creating kind of a different purpose is reading in bed a bad idea and or is the you know sort of natural white light that not natural but you know the white light you get from a bulb where does that rank on the melatonin suppressing scale so if you're someone who is struggling with sleep that you are someone who has sort of insomnia such that you are finding it difficult to either fall asleep or you wake up at night and you can't get back asleep so the first is what we call sleep onset insomnia the other is called sleep maintenance insomnia you can fall asleep fine but you can't maintain your sleep the advice there is even reading should be something that you should forego that you should read in a different room wait until you get really sleepy and then go to bed that's the advice and because otherwise as I mentioned the brain is this incredibly associative device and if you lie in bed awake your brain quickly learns that your bed is the place of wakefulness I hear this from patients a lot where they'll say look I'm sitting on the couch watching television and I'm falling asleep and then I get into bed and I'm wide awake and I don't know why and the answer is because your brain has learned the connection of your bedroom being a trigger for wakefulness because wakefulness is what you do there so what you need to do is break that Association and get up after 20 minutes go to a different room in dim light read a book else were in dim light and I'll come back to what type of light in a second and then only when you're sleepy and there's no time limit for this should you return to bed and the analogy would be this you would never sit at a dinner table waiting to get hungry so why do we lie in bed waiting to get sleepy and you shouldn't and we need to sort of you know bring that back so that's if you're struggling in terms of light what I would say is be a bit mindful as to what kind of it is if it's an LED light it's usually enriched in the blue sort of low-frequency of the visible light spectrum and it's the blue light that is most harmful to melatonin so light in general not great for melatonin it will stamp the brakes on melatonin and it will stop releasing it so your brain is fooled into thinking it's still daytime even though it's actually on the clockface night time but of that light if there is a better form of light it's the red and the yellow the very warm kind of colors the cold blue light that comes from LED that's the more deleterious light that's the type of light that is more detrimental so I would say that you know you can get these smart light bulbs now that can change the dynamic frequency range of that light and the visible spectrum make it more kind of warm and yellow in the evening definitely favor that and try to stay away from you know light that is

[01:29:59] LED light you know even if it's just going back to a classic light bulb which typically is warmer in color and low in wattage that's your best light for reading as the experiment been done when this magnet from the ethical today where subjects are given no restriction on when to sleep how long to sleep but they are put in a perpetually light environment no but the opposite well I know of the opposite yarn the this to know there's one experiment that has kind of been done that is like that and then there is the other opposite which is so the one experiment that's not dissimilar to that actually happened inadvertently unfortunately which is with premature babies in the neonatal intensive care unit what they used to do was they would just leave these fluorescent you know light bulbs on in the NICU all of the time and at that point even though the circadian rhythm isn't especially you know robust in infants they're you know awake they're asleep they're awake they're asleep they still need that signal of light and dark and what they found is that when they regularized light in the neonatal intensive care unit in other words when they gave back darkness at night and gave strong light during the day firstly the infant started to sleep better you saw about a 50% improvement in oxygen saturation in those infants and they put more weight on within the time period because they were sleeping more regularly and then finally they left the

[01:31:37] NICU somewhere between two to two and a half weeks earlier so that's the only example I know of were you take a condition where you were put under artificial continuous light conditions and then you do the experiment where you try to mimic more naturally what a 12 12 hour cycle of a light dark would be and what you see are just biological changes all for the better that's the only experiment that I know of in the positive which is what you're describing the reverse experiment was done where they essentially took a group of people they said you know what time do you normally go to bed missus nobody goes to bed early I can't get sleepy until about 11:00 p.m. and I sleep usually about six six and a half hours they took that group of people off they went to the Sierras here in America this sort of beautiful mountain range with no electricity whatsoever no access to artificial light and firstly what was dramatic was that these individuals started going to bed around nine o'clock in the evening this wasn't necessarily just because they didn't have anything to do they actually rated themselves as feeling sleepy er earlier why because they were getting the signal of darkness at the natural time secondly they went from being you know ardent about the fact that they were only six and a half hour sleepers and that's all that they needed to then sleeping a little bit more than nine hours now I think this point about going to bed at 9:00 p.m. is a really important one have you ever thought about what the term midnight actually means it means it means middle of the solar cycle means middle of the night whereas now with the perversity of the industrialized civilization midnight and especially now in the digital revolution means it's maybe the last time to you know send a few emails whereas if you look at hunter-gatherer tribes whose way of life hasn't changed for thousands of years and you ask how do they sleep as if they are a good indicator and we think that that probably a good indicator of how hominids should sleep they typically go to bed about an hour and a half to two hours after sundown so around sort of 8:30 9 o'clock they usually get about seven seven and a half hours of sleep at night and then they have a siesta like nap in the afternoon to make it up to around about a total of nine hours so I think what has happened with modernity is that we have changed both the amount of sleep that we're getting we've reduced it we've changed the timing of sleep so we're getting less sleep and we're getting it at a different time quote unquote perhaps a wrong time of night and finally the nature in which we obtain our sleep has been changed it seems as though we are designed perhaps to be sleeping by physically which is a long bout at night and then a siesta like nap in the afternoon a lot of people will ask me about this two phases of sleep thing but in a very different sense which was you've sleep about four hours then you wake up you kind of have a social life and then you go back to sleep for another four hours and it's called the two sleeps or first sleep and second sleep and there's a great book written on this now that definitely happened sometime in human civilization it seemed to happen around the Dickensian era but there is nothing in our biology that suggests that we should be sleeping in that way it seems to have been a social feature a social pressure there is a meal that took place our that's real that took place between those two sandwich between the two for our sleeps right correct yeah yeah and people would you know they would have social activities planned they would write they were playing music loved people you know it was a real thing but it was not a biologically defined way of sleeping it's a natural way of you'd think you'd be I mean I guess you could condition yourself to do anything but to wake up after four hours of sleep under any circumstances generally quite miserable it's rough it's absolutely terrible so that happened but I think to come back to the point it's just that how we are sleeping in modern society is not just about sleeping less it's about sleeping less the timing of our sleep and the structure of our sleep so I think those are the things that have changed one of the questions I get asked a lot and I don't know the answer so I'm hoping you do is one it you sort of touched on it but the efficacy of naps and to the notion that you should or shouldn't app if you're having sleep issues right so so on the second one I have a slightly stronger point of view and I hope it's not incorrect which is in that situation the nap is wrong you want the adenosine accumulation and you want it to draw your bedtime back earlier right if you're struggling I would rather you push through not sleeping and then go to bed at 9:00 o'clock but to the first question more broadly speaking I can't imagine that one cycles through what you described with the outset of our discussion in a 20 minute or a hour-long nap right I mean what actually do you have people nap in the lab as well you must yeah what does that look like so we've done a lot of these studies were we asked you know what are the benefits of napping and we certainly do find them we find benefits for learning in memory we find benefits on immune function we find benefits for things like cardiovascular health in terms of metrics of heart rate variability we see benefits in terms of lowered systolic blood pressure all of these things we found benefit by way of a nap now when I say nap you can ask what you mean by a nap and we've played around with that dose as it were and we've done sort of we're trying to do a little bit of a dose response curve with some of these things too what we found is that you can go down as about 20 minutes of a nap and still see some mental benefits in terms of things like learning in memory but typically we do an app that is 90 minutes because that gives the ability of the brain to go through with a full 90 minutes ichael so that the brain can go through all of the stages of non REM sleep stages one through four and it gets the shot to get to REM sleep and then we can ask by testing people in brain scanners sort of before and after and with cognitive tests and then with peripheral body tests we can ask you know what was the the benefit of that nap relative to a group that does exactly the same thing they lie in bed but we don't let them fall asleep that they may just kind of passively watch a movie so there inert for the same amount of time they're in bed they get all of the wires on the head we tried to do it as controlled as possible with the only difference between being sleep between those two groups so you do find benefits to your first point to your second point you're absolutely right in terms of your sleep prescription for your patients their current recommendation is this if you are finding it difficult to sleep at night and sleep throughout the night the recommendation is do not nap during the day and this helps us when we try to think about the biological mechanisms of how wake and sleep actually work and you mentioned a chemical called adenosine so from the moment that you and I woke up this morning and everyone listening the moment that you woke up this morning

[01:39:26] Chemical has been building up in your brain called adenosine the more of it that builds up the sleepier that you will feel so it's the sleepiness chemical and after about 16 hours of accumulation you should have enough weight of healthy sleepiness you should have enough adenosine within the brain to have you fall asleep easily and then stay asleep soundly and then when you're in sleep the brain actually will clear away that adenosine removing the sleepiness and after about eight hours of sleep you've removed sixteen hours of a cue of adenosine so that when you wake up them in the morning you feel alert you feel more awake and that's the reason that you don't feel as sleepy anymore throughout that following day now the problem with naps is that if you nap in during the day particularly if you nap in the late afternoon essentially what you're doing there is acting like a pressure valve on a steam cooker that you've building up all of this great healthy sleepiness there's sleep pressure and then you nap and Shh you'll just release some of that sleepiness so now when it comes to your normal bedtime you don't feel a sleepy why because the nap removed some of that sleepiness pressure it removed some of the adenosine and you are going to perhaps find it more difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep perhaps is the important point there are some people who can nap if you can nap regularly and/or you don't have problems with sleep at night then naps are just fine but if you can't nap regularly and especially if you're struggling with sleep at night the advice is don't nap stay awake build that healthy sleepiness build lots of adenosine that gives you the best chance to stay asleep and then fall under the spell of sleep under that weight of sleepiness for as long as possible you know might be oversimplifying but the way I generally describe sleep to patients is sort of a balancing act between adenosine cortisol and melatonin and you've got it like these three things have to make they're like an orchestra you have to have the crescendo of adenosine with the decrescendo of cortisol and then you have to let melatonin take the breaks off this whole thing and you know even when I just think about myself personally I am convinced that virtually all of my sleep woes are on the cortisol axis and the reason I'm hypothesizing that is I can't measure adenosine it's very complicated to measure you need a very special type of aspect to do that our mrs but we can measure melatonin and urine we can collect urine over night and measure melatonin levels so we have at least some sense of how much we're making but because I measure glucose 24 hours a day and I'm pretty familiar with meal timing and response in many ways nighttime glucose from me as a proxy for nighttime cortisol and the association between high nighttime glucose and poor sleep is overwhelming and I suspect it's that I suspect it's through this cortisol axis there is in some ways a manipulation that we'll speak about in just probably a little while of adenosine even though you can't measure it you can actually manipulate it with something called caffeine and that can demonstrate to you how by the way we're up we're in America here I think there's a human that doesn't know what caffeine is you're get everybody's ears perked up like you're gonna mention like some new compound you just discovered in the lab yesterday it's some nice squirt no no but what's interesting regarding cortisol which really supports your hypothesis right now the leading underlying mechanism the leading theory of insomnia essentially comes back to that fight-or-flight branch of the nervous system that you are in this profound parasympathetic state where that nervous system is cranked too far in sort of the high strength direction and if you essentially have a cannula and you sample cortisol every thirty minutes across a 24-hour period you see this you know this nice rise during the day where cortisol is helping you stay awake it's keeping you alert it's doing all of the things that it needs to do and then as you start to come towards the nighttime period cortisol should drop and needs to drop for you to be able to initiate sleep and in fact it usually hits it's sort of almost it's an idea at the point where most people will say that's my typical bedtime and it then goes through this awesome sort of downstroke in terms of concentration and then a few hours before you wake up cortisol will start to rise in other words it's a preparatory hormone that's to get you ready for weight fulness if you look at patients with insomnia however what you see is that their cortisol starts to come down nicely in the evening sort of six or seven or eight so you know they could feel just as sleepy as a regular person but then right before bed it goes back in the opposite direction it spikes again and then starts to come down and then often in the middle of the night you will see cortisol spike back again when it should be lower still before it starts its rise those two cortisol spikes I think are the natural biological bookmarks for what we call sleep onset insomnia and sleep maintenance insomnia so your cortisol spikes just before bed you can't fall asleep sleep onset insomnia cortisol spikes in the middle of the night you wake up rolodex of anxiety and brain starts to happen cortisol spikes you can't fall back asleep that's what we call sleep maintenance insomnia those are the two principal types of insomnia I think that's where you can see part of the biological basis and my guess is that if we were to measure you know things like your heart rate variability and we were to decompose them with some mathematical equations that you would know of things like the fast Fourier transform you can look at the contribution of the sympathetic versus parasympathetic when you break down the heart rate variability my guess is that you're going to see that sympathetic that fight-or-flight branch of the nervous system getting jacked just before sleep onset and then once again spiking in the middle of the night underlying the cortisol spike which underlies the awakening which underlies the syndrome of insomnia yeah who do you think in that equation I mean I don't want to give everyone a lecture on this topic because you've done a great job explaining what sympathetic is right which is autonomic but it's sort of different from the glucocorticoid regulated pathway do you think that the sympathetic is driving the glucocorticoid or the other way around and the only reason I ask is in a moment

[01:46:37] I'm going to propose the only two things that I've ever really thought I have in the toolkit to treat that but but the answer to this question might impact that as well I honestly don't think we have the evidence to argue which way round that chain of command unfolds I just genuinely don't know of the evidence I think both the tenable hypotheses both could be independent so they I think they could be not mutually exclusive so in truth I don't think I know the evidence in favor but what's nice is that the fact that we know that they both happen and can be causal contributors means that we've got at least two treatment targets that we can go ever after which I think will then play into exactly what you're going to say which well I don't know that they're correct but to me when we see that pattern because we do measure night time cortisol and we you know we measure them at how the lights of it and all of these other complicated assays when we see that high nighttime cortisol we basically you know I mean we sort of that's a very hard problem to treat permanent you know because if you really think about it we're just dealing with the endocrine system right you know it's a heck of a lot easier to treat thyroid dysfunction and dysfunction of the sex hormones and I'm not saying that those things are easy but they are easier than treating the upper end of the like when when you have low sympathetic function and low glucocorticoid function that's actually easier to treat than the opposite the hardest problem I think in clinical medicine from an endocrine perspective is high sympathetic output high glucocorticoid output and really it's amenable to behavioral therapy right it really comes down to a change in mindset and a change in routine we were talking about this earlier it's like the further I can separate bed from email the better because for me emails just I hate emails so much so anytime

[01:48:28] I'm looking for Nestle's agenda field yeah I'm just I'm just I have a low level of pissed off at 'no swen ever i'm looking at email so the further I can separate my pissed off in this room the less my cortisol is can I get that t-shirt by the way and then the second thing which appears to work anecdotally is phosphatidylserine at a high enough dose which generally requires about 400 to 600 milligrams and and again for me the only time I find that that's anis that's really necessary isn't under those jetlag circumstances you know when you're trying to put yourself in the time zone of London when you're leaving San Francisco and you basically have to make yourself go to bed and it's only 2:00 p.m. in your brain but it's late enough there you know that the you know slamming yourself with 600 of phosphatidylserine really seems to move the needle both in terms of your glucose response and your cortisol response what else do you have up your sleeve on that particular problem because I honestly I can't think of a more difficult clinical problem and the one you've just described I think the glucocorticoid issue is iving is a really tough nut to crack I think for the sympathetic Drive I do think you're correct that it's behavioral there I would actually argue meditation and I looked at this data when I was researching the book gosh this must have been about four years ago now you know and I'm I think I'm a bit of a hard nosed dyed-in-the-wool scientist so some of the when I was reading the studies on meditation and insomnia I was wondering if it was a bit woowoo and know how to take it seriously but the data was very compelling in terms of it really does decrease the amount of time it takes someone to fall asleep the continuity of their sleep is improved if you look at some of these apps that do it very well and you know things like headspace or calm my guess although I don't know if they've ever released this data is that if you were to look at their usage statistics you will already see that people are self-medicating their insomnia by way of meditating right before bed and I think you know both of those apps are starting to now launch you know aspects of sleep and sleep health in the portfolio of offerings rightly so because they've probably realized that sleep is a huge part of the issue for which people are coming to them to solve and the clinical data is very supportive of that so I would say that for driving it it's almost impossible to fall asleep if your autonomic nervous system is pushed in a sympathetic dominant state in a fight-or-flight state and a good example of this is you know when you are jet-lagged you can be there you could you may not have slept on the plane you can feel that you're tired you're really tired but for some reason you know your cortisol is now spiking because you're mismatched with your circadian rhythm you can feel your heart rate and you can just know that your nervous system is cranked and you are tired as tired can be in your eyes and in your mind but your nervous system because it's on on that sort of upward swing will not let you fall asleep but meditation I think is a great way to drive a parasympathetic dominance of the nervous system which is to take you out of the fight-or-flight branch and more into this quiet sort of more introspective state I think that's probably the the better thing now I know it's not from a clinical medical perspective as desirable because it's not a pill that we can take it's not a dosage it's you just have to put in the work to sit there and meditate but I think that's the nature of sleep I mean I think cbt-i has efficacy but it requires work it does and changing the way you eat requires work it's not a pill I mean I and exercising you know same thing and

[01:52:34] I've been asked this is a totally unrelated topic but people always say oh my god you know please write me a prescription for metformin because it's gonna help me lose weight and blah blah blah and I said look let me be clear I mean I think metformin is a really powerful pill I don't think it's nearly as powerful as an exceptional diet in other words metformin superimposed on the world's worst nutrition versus no metformin on exceptional nutrition I don't think it's any comparison in the end molecules that you take intermittently aren't really nearly as potent as molecular changes that occur over a time course behaviorally I mean that's I mean I I wish that weren't true truthfully yeah I really I'm not anti pharmacology by any means you know if we had a good sleeping pill

[01:53:21] I would embrace it and I would recommend it but right now the sleeping pills on the markets they firstly don't produce naturalistic sleep secondly they've been associated with a significantly higher risk of death and also significantly higher risk of cancer I'm glad you mentioned this because this is a great segue to this topic but any going back to my friend Kirk parsley and I remember another thing he said because I this is again going back to 2011 2012 my go to travel drug was ambien and unfortunately

[01:53:53] I've never I've never had insomnia but I empathize greatly with those who do I've seen enough people with it but when I need to sleep I was going to take ambien and I remember getting hints that this wasn't a great drug when I would when I worked at Mackenzie I used to have to go from San Francisco to Atlanta every single Monday for a day and because I was ruthless in my pursuit of not wasting time rather than like take a

[01:54:18] Sunday afternoon flight and come back Tuesday I took a red-eye from San Francisco to Atlanta every single Sunday and as one of my friends put it that's the pink eye and ain't the red eye like that's a four hour flight right you always get the tailwind so you you got about three and a half hours of sleep on a plane I'd get to Atlanta at 5:00 pick up a rental car drive to the gym do a two-hour workout shave shower get to the client stay there all day you know leave at 6:30 get to the airport by you know 8:30 get the flight back to San Francisco you're back by whatever you're home at minutes it was a 26 hour door-to-door every single time and I was using ambien to make sure

[01:55:04] I slept on that flight I would I would come up with these grisly discoveries which is I'd find emails I sent that I didn't know I'd sent and thank God none of them were inappropriate but you hear these stories of people doing really crazy stuff on ambien which is never committed to memory and you know it's only when people make the phone call the next morning and they say you know what were you are you going on about last night oh I wonder serious things I ever saw was I remember looking at my phone and seeing outgoing calls to people that

[01:55:37] I didn't remember making so my friend Kirk parsley is saying and by the way that ambien crap that you take you know a couple times a month he said you know that's not sleep right and I said what do you mean it's not sleep I'm out and then he just Ben again you'll laugh at this because this is exactly the kind of story that you tell so eloquently he said you're confusing consciousness and sleep or lack of consciousness and sleep if I took a baseball bat and hit you on the head

[01:56:05] I could render you completely unconscious laying on the floor for eight hours do you think in any way that mimics the restorative process of sleep I mean not even close right so you know think of ambien more is a chemical baseball bat to the head then something that's actually promoting what you've just been speaking about for the last you know a little while it's such a critical point again I'm not anti pharmacology and I know some of the people in the drug industries the scientists and their goal their passion is to create drugs that better humanity and they are genuine and authentic about that and I love that about them but I also will not accept or speak in public about a drug that clearly doesn't seem to be beneficial for a certain process and unfortunately if you look at the evidence firstly you find absolutely that those drugs are a class of drugs that we call the things like ambien

[01:57:03] Leicester sort of you know all of these things that you've heard there are class of drugs that we call the sedative hypnotics and sedation is not sleep but people mistake the former with the latter and it's not it's literally just knocking your cortex out so I'm not going to argue when you take those drugs that you're awake you're clearly not awake but to say that you're in naturalistic sleep is an equal fallacy because if I look at the electrical signature of your sleep when you are on or off ambien radically different for a start you don't get into the same depth of deep sleep that you get it's not the same electrical quality of deep sleep the second thing that we found is that there does seem to be a higher association with mortality risk now we don't know if it's causal and my guess is that on the strength of the evidence right now IRB committee is ethics committees that sort of allow you to do certain scientific studies may not even allow you to try and do those studies because the evidence is already so Dilla tereus the other finding was this strong association with risk of all forms of cancer which perplex me because you would think well if I'm taking this drug that helps me sleep more and sleep is so good for the immune system including things like natural killer cells and combating zli then this drug induced sleep should actually make my cancer risk lower not higher and the fact that it is higher I think tells you that the type of sleep that you're getting is not of this rich complex restorative restful biologically appropriate sleep the other thing I would come on to and these are very difficult studies to get funding for because you know I've received some of the drug companies they may not necessarily want some of this information out there it was the only chapter in the book by the way that my publisher brought in a legal team to kind of look at when I was kind of making all of these claims but this is just I'm just conveying the science there's nothing controversial about the science and they ended up feeling legally comfortable with what I wrote there was this stunning study done by a good friend of mine called Markus Franke at Penn and he was looking at basically brain plasticity how does the brain make connections and strengthen those connections and those strengthening of connections is the underlying mechanism that we know leads to the long-term formation of memories it's a very well understood mechanism this idea of brain plasticity and there is a model where if you kind of patch the eye of an animal and then you measure the visual cortex what you see is that once you patch one eye the brain says well we're not going to waste the real state of that one eye that's no longer doing visual processing we're going to shift a lot of that over to the other eyes territory and give it even more kind of rich connective fidelity as it were so you've got this model of what's called monocular deprivation plasticity which is a classic model of how the brain rewires itself for things like learning in memory what he found is that he took a group of animals and he gave them naturalistic sleep and did this kind of monocular decoration and sleep it turns out basically doubles the strengthening of plasticity sleep is wonderful for shifting things and making new connections and really strengthening those neural connections sleep is essential for brain plasticity and it's almost it sleep will almost double the strength of the connections relative to if you just keep the animal awake so sleep it's not just time that helps the brain rewire itself it's time with sleep that makes the difference then he dosed those animals with ambien now firstly the animals slept longer because they were dosed with this sedative hypnotic and you would think that surely that should improve this strengthening of rewiring in the brain it did exactly the opposite yeah I was gonna say or at worse it would make not have change right control from with control if it was quote-unquote naturalistic sleep what he found was actually a 50% unwire ring of the connections that have been laid down before when the animal was awake in other words not only had sleep failed to strengthen the connections the ambien laced or the ambien induced sleep was doing the opposite it was weakening connections within the brains now what makes me fearful about that is firstly if you look at the number of people who are using these medications you know it took George Lucas I often say I think about 40 years where the Star Wars franchise to amass about 4 billion in profit it took ambien less than 24 months to amass that in terms of profit so you've got to imagine the number of prescriptions being written are high then the fact that the prescription age of these sleep aids is starting to decrease gradually as parents get more concerned about their kids who may have more anxiety who are having sleep problems they're turning to pills and when you bring that experiment back into the context of pediatric prescriptions of sleep medication you've got a brain that is developing a brain that needs to wire itself up strengthen connections build and mature it needs to learn it needs to consolidate and then you're providing a form of sleep through medication that may actually be unwire another system and unwire amuri Zhou and strengthening them that frame you can find all of this information and more at
