This clip is from episode 360 ‒ How to change your habits: why they form and how to build or break them

In this clip, they discuss:

- Mental Habits Are Often Invisible: Most habits that shape our behavior aren’t physical—they’re mental, automatic patterns we barely notice
- Hardwired Emotional Responses: Mental habits can dictate responses like getting angry when cut off in traffic, even if it doesn’t help
- Changing Habits Starts with Awareness: To shift a habit, identify the cue that triggers it, then create a different, intentional response
- Contemplation Is a Mental Muscle: The most successful people create routines that spark deeper thinking and insight
- Without Reflection, We Default to Reactivity: Mental habits form the foundation of how we react and live, making awareness essential for growth
