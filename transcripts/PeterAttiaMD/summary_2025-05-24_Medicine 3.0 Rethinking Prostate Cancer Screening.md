# Medicine 3.0: Rethinking Prostate Cancer Screening

**Channel:** Peter Attia MD
**Upload Date:** 2025-05-24

**Duration:** 6 minutes

## Description

This clip discusses:

- Biden’s Diagnosis Sparks a PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) Wake-Up Call – Former President Biden’s case illustrates a failure in how prostate cancer screening is approached in Medicine 2.0
- Why PSA Alone Isn’t Enough – PSA can be misleading without also evaluating PSA velocity, PSA density, and free PSA—all available from the same $5 test
- Additional Tests Can Refine Risk – Tools like the 4Kscore, PHI (Prostate Health Index), or a multiparametric MRI help determine whether a biopsy is even needed
- Medicine 2.0 Prioritizes Lifespan Over Healthspan – Screening was likely dismissed based on actuarial life expectancy, not quality of life or long-term health
- Be Your Own Advocate in Medicine 3.0 – For preventable cancers like prostate and colorectal, proactive screening and smarter interpretation can save lives

Quick Correction: Please note at 2:40 Peter says the units for PSA are usually ng/dL, but he intended to say ng/mL.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of Dr. Attia's discussion on prostate cancer screening:

1. **Executive Summary**:
Dr. Attia discusses the importance of prostate cancer screening in light of recent news about President Biden's diagnosis with metastatic prostate cancer. He criticizes the current medical system (Medicine 2.0) for its overreliance on actuarial data and age-based guidelines, arguing for a more comprehensive approach to screening (Medicine 3.0). The discussion emphasizes the preventable nature of prostate cancer when proper screening protocols are followed.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- PSA testing costs approximately $5 and provides multiple valuable metrics [03:08]
- Three key PSA measurements discussed:
  * PSA velocity (rate of change) [02:03]
  * PSA density (PSA/prostate volume) [02:45]
  * Free PSA percentage [03:08]
- Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men [01:08]
- PSA density threshold of concern: >0.15 [02:45]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Annual PSA screening recommended [02:03]
- Consider additional tests like PHI or 4K if initial results are concerning [03:08]
- Multiparametric MRI before proceeding to biopsy [03:08]

4. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
Primary Tests:
- PSA (basic screening) [00:33]
- PSA velocity [02:03]
- PSA density [02:45]
- Free PSA percentage [03:08]
Advanced Tests:
- PHI (Prostate Health Index) [03:08]
- 4K test [03:08]
- Multiparametric MRI [03:08]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"We placed an emphasis on lifespan over health span. And this is the part that really grinds my gears about medicine 2.0 is it says nothing about the quality of life." [04:43]

"Each one of you has to be your own advocate here." [04:59]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific criteria for PHI and 4K testing?
2. How frequently should multiparametric MRIs be performed in at-risk individuals?
3. What are the specific guidelines for interpreting PSA velocity changes?
4. How do different prostate cancer screening protocols vary internationally?

7. **Risk/Benefit Considerations**:
- False positives and false negatives are noted as concerns with PSA testing [01:08]
- Benefits of early detection outweigh risks in prostate cancer screening [04:59]
- Quality of life implications of metastatic bone cancer are severe [04:59]

8. **References & Resources**:
Case Study Referenced:
- President Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis [00:00]
- Last PSA check at age 72 [00:33]
- Current guidelines for PSA screening after age 70 [00:33]

This episode provides a strong argument for proactive prostate cancer screening and highlights the limitations of current medical guidelines that may be too heavily focused on age-based recommendations rather than individual health circumstances and quality of life considerations.
