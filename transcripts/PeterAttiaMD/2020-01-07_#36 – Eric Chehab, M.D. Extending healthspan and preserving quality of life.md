[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'm your host Peter Dean my guest this week is one of my best friends from medical school guy by the name of Eric Scheib eric is an orthopedic surgeon specializing in sports but overall knee and shoulder he's an assistant clinical professor at the University of Chicago we met obviously at Stanford and he went on to do his residency in orthopedic surgery at the Hospital for Special Surgery or

[00:01:06] HSS as it's known in New York City it's generally regarded as the best orthopedic facility in the country if not the world he did his fellowship with the New York Giants before settling in Chicago he was also mentored at HSS by a guy named Russ Warren who anybody listening to this who knows a lot about or a little bit again about orthopedic surgery will understand the significance of that Russ is generally considered the godfather of sports medicine this interview was also really informative for me because I as you know think about longevity through the standpoint of living longer but living better and a big part of living better is not getting hurt and what I love about talking to orthopedic surgeons especially people like Eric who are just so cognizant of what the demise looks like at the end of life is I think by understanding where people fail later in life you can understand how to mitigate that earlier in life so we get into a lot of detail around the common joint injuries so what's going on with knee pain especially from incorrect form in a loaded fashion you talked a lot about shoulder injuries especially with weights being used over head elbow wrist injuries ankles what's going on with the

[00:02:11] Achilles tendon obviously we talk about lower stuff which for many people is also you know I think it's almost impossible to get through life without at least one lower back flare-up we revisit sort of my injury which I've talked about actually in the past we talked about all the complications that can come from it and we talked a little bit about how you can decide when PT makes more sense than surgery which unfortunately for lower back injuries is almost always the case we get into some of the real controversy stuff like meniscus surgery which some of you may be aware of we talk about the origins of pain so a lot of times people present with joint pain but it's not really clear is the pain matching the thing you see on the MRI and again I have an example of where that was not the case we get into PRP stem cells sham surgeries and all sorts of things like that the other thing that probably comes across them not as maybe as much as I would have liked is Erik is probably the funniest human beings I know he actually sang at my wedding and I think we even discussed that story early in this episode although I didn't get him to sing so that's probably one drawback anyway the show notes will be linked to a ton of awesome stuff that follows up and goes deeper on some of these things and obviously if you want to learn more about Erik that's great but the reality of it is this is mostly just a way to kind of help people think about orthopedic surgery and more than anything else these types of injuries and what we can do to prevent so I hope you enjoyed today's episode and here we go hey man what's going on not much good to see you it's been a long time I feel like it's been two years since I've seen you in person and we did get to spend an hour finding a place to record this so that that like here's a good chance to catch where are we sitting right now we are sitting in my well mad office for

[00:03:53] Illinois bone and joint and moment' we're like we're actually in a patient exam room I think we're in a patient exam room yep just like the only room we could find that didn't have a AC unit blaring or something like that well Eric there's so much stuff I want to talk about you know mostly about orthopedic stuff because in the spirit of sort of trying to live longer you've probably heard me talk about it there's no point living longer if you're not looking better and a big part of living better is your exoskeleton and for a lot of people that you probably see and certainly I see it to a lesser extent you know once that quality of life deteriorates meaning once they don't have the strength mobility or freedom from pain kind of carry out the activities of daily living you know for many people they don't actually care that much if they're gonna delay their heart attack by four years or something like that it stops mattering so I mean let's go back to the beginning there's something goofy things I want to talk about did you grow up in New Jersey I don't think I knew this yeah I grew up in New Jersey

[00:04:43] I was born in Omaha and moved to New Jersey when I was three and his Bruce Springsteen still probably one of your favorite singers he's my favorite yep there is this I think I put it up on social media a little while ago but there's this awesome video it was from 2009 in Madison Square Garden where Bruce Springsteen was playing with Tom

[00:05:00] Morello and my son when he watches the video thinks I'm Tom Morello he doesn't get that I'm not and it's like none of them actually daddy looks like him or he looks like Daddy but that's not mean he's like what do you mean that is you and he can't he's like why do you know how to play the guitar but you never play at home this is just one song which we'll have to link to the ghost of Tom

[00:05:19] Joad that they played together it's like an eight-minute thing with Morello doing like a three-minute guitar solo at the end that is out of control but there's something about Bruce Springsteen's a voice that like he might kind of be the coolest guy ever no he's definitely the coolest guy ever how many times have you seen him live five six times first concert I went to is Bruce and 84 at Brendan Byrne in New

[00:05:44] Jersey and it was as he was kicking off the born the USA tour it was summertime there were about five or six of us we were in eighth or ninth grade and it was great fantastic and then I saw him I lived in Milan for a year I was teaching high school and he was playing in Verona on Easter Sunday and he was supposed to play in an amphitheater in Verona that Guns & Roses had played in like a month earlier and basically nearly tore the place down and one of these amphitheaters that have been there for two thousand years and sure enough one concert and no more concerts so he played in the soccer stadium in Verona on Easter Sunday for about five hours and I remember I was on a bike tour I was taking my bike through

[00:06:26] Tuscany I was by myself on a mountain bike and it was Easter Sunday morning I was in Florence and there was the Easter Parade and I had this one ticket to Bruce and I'm like how the [ __ ] am I gonna get to Verona so I ditched my bike someplace I get on a train of Verona turns out there were a lot of Bruce fans on the way and there were translations of Bruce's lyrics into Italian which I always wonder how like working on the highway and you know you know drinking warm beer and the soft summer rain translate into Italian but anyway and I get there and this show goes on as usual for about five hours and I get on a train at 3:00 in the morning from Verona head back to Florence pick up my bike around nine o'clock in the morning and then keep riding because it was so pumped up and jacked up from haven't seen this fantastic Bruce concert and just kept riding for the rest of day so that was one of my favorite Bruce concerts was that in Italy I saw him in

[00:07:19] Oakland with my wife with Lynne when we were dating in medical school and that was sort of tempered by the fact that she wasn't much of a Bruce fan so my good buddy Marc Pomerance was at that concert yeah is that right yeah we're up in Oakland up in the nosebleeds and then I saw Bruce most recently with Lynne who now is a fan in Milwaukee on his river tour and he gives such a great show the river tour is fantastic and so he plays the album and then he goes on for another two or three hours with just great songs and he's so good live I saw him at Wrigley right after Clarence

[00:07:51] Clemons had died and they had that tribute where they at tenth Avenue freeze out they just stopped the music when the big man joined the band and they have a large shadow silhouette of Clarence from the Born to Run album it's really moving I mean he must have done that about 50 times from his death to that concert but it's still very genuine and very moving and the whole place goes quiet and then it erupts and sort of cheer and laughter and tears as it was really moving and that was what I think

[00:08:21] I must've been four years ago when he played at Wrigley and yet I'm sort of a JV Bruce fan compared to my roommates in college you go man my one roommate on had probably been about a hundred concerts and he tells a great story of no one that I know it's the only new new though yeah he tells a great story of punching someone out on the Bruckner

[00:08:39] Expressway on his way to the Bruce oh I'll let him tell that story he says well new yorkese yeah no it sounds like the guy had a coming so I don't really have one was it like wasn't a Navy SEAL or he's a Marine and he's now he's now an undersecretary of Defense for general mattis the special option do you notice over time as you go to these concerts like the the fans seem older to you and so for me Pearl Jam is the band that I've seen more than any other band and I just saw them recently in Fenway and I got to tell you it was the first time in a long time I've been in a concert where I had as much joy out of watching the other people there because they were older than me some of them but you could tell so when 10 came out I was maybe 17 or 18 but you can tell there were people who were 30 when 10 came out and probably still found it amazing and so now they're you know in their late 50s and you can see the emotion in them when Eddie Vetter gets up there and plays something that from 91 or something like that so it must be the same with Springsteen but even greater because it's a greater time period ya know that's another funny thing when you're at Wrigley and you see the fans to your left and your right and they're pretty old and then you'll see some of them holding their 10 year olds and that's the fun part of it is that there's sort of intergenerational thing you have these younger kids growing up loving Bruce because their parents love

[00:09:58] Bruce and so but yeah no doubt the crowd is older it's funny mentioned Pearl Jam they opened for u2 in Verona in 92 I was still in Milan and I saw Pearl Jam open for u2 on the Zooropa tour and SF Pearl Jam u2 and Bruce Springsteen in one trip to Italy no no well we were there for a year but same venue same and fabulous venue and the lead guitarist for Pearl

[00:10:26] Jam was licking his picks out like he does yeah Mike McCready I've almost caught him Mike McCready pick once in DC I was in the third row I was like my that's my one shot at catching the pic and I didn't he also had a disposable camera mm-hmm he takes pictures of the crowd so be creative he still had one that would be kicking an old school but the disposable camera out in the crowd it was great we could spend the next two hours talking about music because we both loved it so much the last music story I do want to tell though is remember what you did at my wedding I hate to tell you weren't the first

[00:10:55] I still feel special you should I mean you're the first that I used the buckteeth for but pretty much everybody's wedding I've got up and sang with the band or whomever and for whatever reason let me do it and I don't have any talent I don't have a voice that's worth listening to but I certainly think I'm great and I have a lot of Verve and energy and so at your wedding yeah fire fire and I had my teeth in so

[00:11:19] I was lisping pretty badly they had those buck teeth that maybe yeah we're gonna explain what these are in a moment so anyway I though those dr. buck teeth in and sang fire to you and Jill and I could tell there was kind of like what the hell is going on here among the whole wedding crowd and but hey we were all in and it was great and you had a I remember that incredible I remember that wedding also talking to Conti because he was driving from was it then that he was driving from he had just driven from

[00:11:52] Jason piles wedding in Los Angeles to boss Boston in 30-something hours right so he was planning to do it without stopping right at his wife or I wasn't his wife yet he taken provigil which is they gave him four hundred milligrams of provigil eight hundred milligrams of ibuprofen and he said he was gonna be fine and I was like that's crazy and she finally made him stop in Cleveland ya know and it was 36 hours to get to

[00:12:16] Cleveland before she made him stop right hours before they finished the drive to Boston I asked him was like oh my you must have suffered like 24 hours a no eight hours got up drove the rest of the way yeah when you sang fire at our wedding it was one of the most amazing things because it was kind of like camping on blanket he was a Dan Flaherty you know the Dan band yes it was that experience cuz like at one point you threw in a couple extra fox like it was [ __ ] fine yeah yeah I did actually yeah that's the part I love him I wish I had done something more with it to be honest with you because obviously it's been a great career for that guy I actually got to meet him at a party two years ago I see you send me the selfie yeah yeah I just glued myself to him the whole night that's like I can't forget

[00:12:57] Aleve I'm sitting here with this guy it's incredible so where'd you go to college so I went to a little school back east Oh whereabouts that's east of the Mississippi okay what city oh I can't go city so quickly or what stick it was a message to Eastern mass you're Boston's a little school outside Boston Boston

[00:13:15] College Harvard so you were the first guy I met that took that to another level in terms of the complete buffoonery of the the too cool to say Harvard yeah no I'd always struck me as odd when people couldn't say that they went to Harvard and I remember being in the back seat of a car with Duncan and his brother Hunter and this dude is there with me and I'm like oh so hey we're in school and he starts out with Massachusetts and I'm like oh my god you got to be kidding me so I play along with it on the go where

[00:13:50] Massachusetts on the west side of Massachusetts or the east side of Massachusetts like east side and so he's so happy he's not coming out with it and then finally you know we wither down to Boston and then Cambridge and then Harvard he finally lays it on me I was like I had to I'm what there too and then but I've got am it very lucky to go and there's not a chance in hell at Gayo to a place like Harvard or anything like that these days as my 16 year old is going through this it is a different world for college admissions and all the breaks that I had to get there you know the door was still much wider open than it is for kids today it's just a different world more international kids and highly more competitive they're much less wed to schools that they've used to admit to they're much more open and for kids all over the place and all the work so I think it's a great thing but it's just not the same I mean there's no chance in hell I'd be in a school like that little school back east if I were flying today well we used to joke about this so much that it stayed with me forever so even when I left med school and wound up anywhere I would go there after now I became I was always looking for the person who went to the little school back east and so finally so fast forward maybe ten years after we're done with medical school I've got this friend his name is David Betar Oh incredibly talented artist could have be talented at everything basically and he went to that little school back east and he thought that was the funniest [ __ ] on the face of the earth and I said David I need you to design little school back east t-shirts so I want the sort of the Harvard shield but

[00:15:21] I need you to find the exact font that it normally says Harvard but you have to just say little school back east and of course David because only David could do this he probably spent the next I don't know three weeks designing the font to make the t-shirt that I sent you yeah so he made ten of them because I had ten friends who had gone to Harvard or whatever at least who I thought would appreciate the joke there were some who

[00:15:42] I didn't want to piss off too much so do you still have your little school back east yeah of course I do I should have worn it during a reunion just a couple years ago that would have been good so did you know when you went to college you want to go into medicine I had a pretty good idea my mom is a nurse my father who I'm not I didn't grow up with my dad when my mom and dad divorced he went back to Lebanon and I really didn't hear from him until I was 16 17 how old were you when they split three but he's a physician and my grandfather was a physician and so I always grew up around medicine with my mom being a nurse and the doctors that she worked for were terrific people I had a bunch of injuries as a kid so I saw dr. Taylor I remember like it was yesterday in his office for some of the knee injuries I had as a kid so I was exposed to medicine probably more frequently than most people and so

[00:16:37] I had a pretty good idea but I took a little bit of a circuitous route after college where I taught chemistry and physics in high school but I did it overseas I spending your Milan that's where I saw the great concerts and started an American School there which was a terrific experience and then came back the state's 4-year to a private school in DC called st. Albans an all-boys school there it's very prominent great preparatory school and then went back overseas to Bulgaria about places and tottered an American school there so these three years that you're teaching yes kids in high school did you still think you were gonna go and do medicine or was this a part of deciding if you still wanted to do that no I was pretty sure I was gonna go but as interesting the teaching was fun but

[00:17:19] I felt like there was more than I could offer I guess and I was basically a high school chemistry teacher and and enjoyed the kids and loved working with the kids but I just felt that medicine would be a better fit because I'd still be able to teach and still be able to help people but it it was a little bit more challenging I guess it was just more up my alley and I think it was sort of a calling to go and do it but the teaching was a great experience it was a great way to see the world it was a great way to learn how to be an adult from college to earning a living getting a paycheck paying your bills paying back your student loans and then directing your life in a way that you know jeez I really want to make some of this and so and then you go back to school so that that time off between college and medical school for me was invaluable in terms of maturation and it's hard to imagine I mean knowing me in medical school I don't think I was the most mature dude on the block but man is too much no you know Conti and I actually did a podcast awhile ago which

[00:18:13] I just actually just came out and we talked a little bit about this that there was just a group of us that became very fast friends and I think we were viewed externally as sort of these testosterone knucklehead guys but we all had this thing in common which we had all kind of taken a bit of a winding path to get there and I think on the surface while it looks like we were just a bunch of you know idiots I think there was there was probably more to it yeah do you remember the last time you and I interviewed I sure do it was me interviewing for med school yeah I was your student interview yeah that was my first interview so I was beginning like this circuit and doing all that but it was also my first time in California so

[00:18:49] I'd never been to California until that interview and in Stanford was the only school I applied to that was not in the Northeast and I remember leaving there and I think I went either Duke or Hopkins or Hopkins Duke and sort of worked my way but I remember thinking you know in part because I met you and I really connected with you and in part because I remember it was February and it was 76 degrees out and I having grown up in Toronto and going to school outside of Toronto it didn't occur to me even though intellectually I understood you could live in a place in the winter where it wasn't freezing to see that I was like wait a minute this is this is a different place but when you went in med school my recollection is you we kind of thought you were gonna wind up doing internal medicine or ortho there was a bit of a toss-up there right yeah that's right I was undecided pretty much until the 11th hour between internal medicine orthopedics and the appeal to internal medicine was the idea that you'd have these long term relationship with patients my guess is most people who are struggling between ortho and something that others something is not internal medicine so it's generally surgical for sure I don't know maybe I shouldn't be admitting this among my orthopedic colleagues well there's a joke and I'm when I was going through my rotations you know you had sort of the attending and the senior resident of the fellow and the senior resident junior resident all the orthopedic team walks into the patient's room you know post-op day one and the nurse says you know I think so-and-so might have broken out into afib last night and says you know so I'm gonna call the cardiology console and the attending says come on we're doctors here like you're not gonna call a cardiology to tell us our own patients in afib give me a stethoscope and he reaches in his pocket doesn't have one he looks back at the fellow the fella doesn't have one he looks back at the chief resident doesn't have one of them all the way down even the med student for the ortho rotation not carrying the stethoscope so then he's like yeah I just call the cardiologist well there was a sign at the general outside of the weight room that said ortho library oh and there's a stereotype right I mean all the jocks go into ortho ya know it's definite steroids but it's sort of an unfounded stereotype I mean obviously there's some of it that's true I mean most of the guys in orthopedics are athletes or have been athletes at one point but it's a pretty thoughtful specialty it's not simply bone broke me fix and that's that and I'm really glad I made a decision I did I mean I really can't imagine not going to the operating room not seeing patients not seeing sort of the fruits of my actual work I think being in internal medicine is for some people it's great for me I think it would have been alternately a poor fit so I'm very happy with the decision I ended up making I remember you let me read your essay for residency and you talked a lot about Bill yep who was Bill so when my mom and dad split we moved back my USA move back my mother's from New Jersey we moved back to the town where she grew up and it's a beautiful town near the shore called Rumson very well-to-do place similar on par with Cornish Connecticut some other places that people hear about and when we moved back we moved down to a smaller street and across the street was a guy bill Hensler who was living with his aging mother and he was a longshoreman he'd worked down on the docks he'd been a caretaker he'd been married three times had kids and but had been estranged from his daughter for a while but anyway he was our neighbor and he took a liking to my mom and my family and sort of ended up being Oh a father figure to me and like I said I didn't really have any contact really had no contact with my biological father for between ages 3 and 16 and Bill was that that role he was that father figure so the real turn of the relationship actually happened in I think 1978 close to there where my older sister Corina we were all out that plane in the street and bill at that time was an alcoholic he was a world war two veteran and I think he had PTSD and like many in the

[00:22:38] World War two vets basically suffered in silence to some degree and his family they were Brewers in Newark there was hence ER beer that was brewed in Newark and Bill passed out and I think my sister was like trapped under his leg in the middle of the street and I mean it was just a whole scene and my mom said hey enough and she took him to a place called carrier clinic in New Jersey and he sobered up in 28 days and that's the last time he had any alcohol to drink and he was sober since he came down my

[00:23:06] Pop Warner football games he would drive up to st. Paul's in New Hampshire I went to boarding school and come to some of those games there and he got remarried in 87 and I was his best man and that was you would have been what 18 I was 18 years old yeah and it was the honor of a lifetime to be his best man and you know we were very very close and part of the reason why I chose to do my training in

[00:23:27] New York and leave California was so that I could be closer to home and closer to bill because by that time he was in his late 70s his health was failing he'd had a cabbage and a cabbage for the listener is a bypass surgery of the heart coronary artery bypass graft so he had you know he was aging and I just wanted to be close at home and then he died my fourth year of residency about five days before my youngest son

[00:23:47] JJ was born and those last six months were rough for him but I was very happy to be there he actually broke his hip which is an end-of-life injury for many many people and it was for him so he broke his hip in March and it was actually right after we had come back from Key West Florida where his daughter

[00:24:08] Annie lives and works and his daughter and he had been estranged for a long long time but his wife Jay who I had stood up for at the wedding she had gotten Annie and Bill back in touch and they were and they were and re-established their relationship and so I had a week off from residency and Lynn and I decided to go to Florida and our plans had fallen through at the last minute to be in a place near Palm Beach and so we said let's go to Key West and let's bring bill down to Annie and so we did and then he ended up staying planning for a week ended up staying for about six weeks and then he came back to New

[00:24:45] Jersey and then shortly thereafter he broke his hip and I went down to see him immediately in local hospital in New Jersey and they hadn't so medicated that he couldn't talk he wasn't him and I said this is not going in the right direction so I brought him up to New York to special surgery and mateus

[00:25:02] Bostrom who's one of the greatest guys at Special Surgery did his hip that his Emmy arthroplasty and then the nursing staff really took a liking to Bill and everyone really you know he's a hard guy not to like so he ended up staying for about two weeks in the hospital after his Hemi arthroplasty for no other reason that people liked hanging out with him which is unheard of right I mean and then you know when I was on call over the weekend we used to take call basically from Friday to Monday and and being overnight and so we would go up onto the roof on a nice day and this was now in April weather was turning nice and we went up on the roof on the sunny days and I'd hang out my page over golf I'd bring him back downstairs and then whenever he had a minimum we go back up to the roof it cruise around and then he got out of rehab he went to the home he was on his own but he just got scared and then he I'd forgotten to mention this he ended up having a liver cancer HCC so he had a pad of cellular carcinoma so he was becoming cachectic he was losing weight and he was just becoming scared and so the summer was sort of miserable for him he was on his own at this point Jay had died about a decade earlier and you know he went in a hospice and about two days later he he died but bill was probably the most giving and nicest person you could meet it was always quick with the laughs he was a ton of fun you know he when he'd come up to st. Paul's he'd make fast friends with all these other people and again you know they'd be like are you his grandfather he's like now he's just my friend but he was that father figure that I otherwise probably wouldn't have had and he made all the difference in the path that I was able to take and so you know I did write my essay about

[00:26:40] Bill partly because I just wanted people to know who he was you know if I'm applying to be a part of your medical school why I mean I didn't want to just list my resume that seems sort of stupid I just wanted to give an insight so I would talk about I think on that time I J if it was in my application for residency J it passed it's about two months after she died and I was at home for the summer there's between my second and third year of medical school so I was in

[00:27:04] New Jersey and I wanted to take him on I just want to get him away so we went up to New Hampshire like we had done when I was in high school and we drove when we drove we called it a sponge door when he was younger he talked with his buddies they would go on a sponge tour where they go from house to house and place the place and sponge off their friends or the friend's parents and so we kind of did that we stopped in a few places then we went back to can't get move Joe 'king in the car conquered New Hampshire but the way the folks in Concord say conquered his ganking that was something

[00:27:39] I'll never forget then we went to Winnipesaukee where Mike loved who's one of his family friends and it was one of my first bosses i bus tables at mike's restaurant in new jersey and mike moved up to New Hampshire and open a restaurant in Moultonborough on Lake Winnipesaukee and then he opened another restaurant in one of the other lake towns off Winnipesaukee called love's key and so bill and I saw Mike Mike insisted we stay with him and we really were sponging from place to place and so by the time I got back to New Jersey about ten days two weeks later you know we had gone on this nice ride and just had a chance to kind of normalize his life again and that was in the late 90s and so I think that's what my essay was about was the sponge tour that I had with a guy who had just had a big loss in his life in a way of sort of healing through time and healing through laughter and healing through just normal daily activities that's what sort of struck me about it I remember this because you know I remember going because a you were a year ahead of me and I'm sort of putting that stuff into my own thought at the time which was like what do I want to write about you don't get a lot of space to tell your story when you're making these applications and I remember thinking this isn't what you'd expect from a guy applying to orthopedic surgery and there was some stuff in there about right which was like returning functionality to people and things like that but I was I was very touched by this story of Bill and yeah I had forgotten until you mentioned it again but that you were his best man you know at the ripe old age of 18 I love that story and your oldest son is named after him yes so my will we call him well is named after Bill answer and he was tickled pink about that he would have loved to met JJ I mean sort of a

[00:29:13] Hellraiser character like Bill was and I think about life is somewhat serendipity and it is serendipitous that we happen to move into a house across the street from this man and that we took such a liking to one another and it was really all by chance and I sometimes think would it happen in a day and age like we have today where everyone's so suspicious of people you know becoming close anyway the bottom line is it was a great stroke of fortune to know Bill and

[00:29:41] I did write about him an awful lot because he was probably one of the most meaningful influences in my whole life are you close to your dad today no no I I've seen my dad probably a total of about four weeks and you know it's funny you mention that because he's recently you're here in the office right now doing this interview and so he's been sort of raising hell through the office because I get calls from the hospital pager I think your dad is on the line and then I get calls my secretary

[00:30:10] I think your dad is on on the line and we don't we don't talk very much and he lives in Spain he's he was in Beirut for the majority of the Civil War during the 70s and 80s and he refuge from Beirut to Spain in the mid-80s and in 86 was when I saw him again and he was in a small town and on TNT now lives in Alicante which is a beach resort towns about five hours south of Barcelona and I think he also suffers from PTSD I mean he was living in war zone and he's an OB guy and and you know he tells the story of having a woman on the table who he's doing cesarean on and then someone comes in with a machine gun asking to save his brother's life and you know he became somewhat of a trauma surgeon as an obstetrician and that's a big leap and you know I just think it got too much and he misses being at home he misses

[00:31:04] Lebanon I'm sure of it but the fact is he's sort of anxiety riddle guy we never really had a meaningful relationship so he got in touch with me again when he was hounding the office I called him and we talked for an hour but I think the bottom line is is at a point in his life where he's not gonna change very much

[00:31:21] I'm probably not gonna change very much and it's hard to bridge the gap I wonder sometimes whether I want to expose my kids to that type of relationship with their father so I go back and forth on that and then I did make a point of seeing him the last time I saw him was when I was engaged to my wife Lynne and

[00:31:39] I told her look you gotta meet the gene pool before you commit to this whole thing because he's a little nuts so that was the last time I saw him physically face to face my sister ran to my older sister went to see him and it was a real brutal visit he's starting to lose it a little bit and he's just not fully there so it's it's tragic it is it is it's very sad because I think well he was at Hopkins he trained at Hopkins he was one of the foreign medical grads he had gone to American University no no yeah he was at Hopkins he did his OB guy was that working at your mom he met my mom and Roosevelt Hospital in New York where he was training I think he was doing some of his residency there or somehow he they met there I'm not sure if it was during his residency afterwards but they met in New York my mom was working as a medical assistant slash nurse anesthetist at that time she was worked as a medical assistant her entire career but I think about a man in his mid-20s he's got his whole life ahead of him everything's very promising he's a young medical student he's becoming a resident and becoming a doctor he has his family and then fast forward 10 years it's all falling apart like he's lost his family he's back in

[00:32:44] Beirut he's with his you know his four kids his wife gone back in New Jersey he's in Beirut and then he basically gets burnt out in Beirut during the war and since then really hasn't done much she's taking care of a few people locally in Spain as a obstetrician for some of the community that a refuge there essentially but not really doing much it's a derailment of his life at a time when things were really looking very promising and when I see him and meet him I can see how that can happen and then I I just don't want that for myself sometimes I maybe I'm just turning a blind eye to it yeah again I probably a deeper discussion that we could have but I have so many thoughts about this right I think but I think that you know on the one hand it's I have found myself more and more empathetic to sort of the situation's people are in that on the surface might look like well you know that's a cut and dry case of you know he left his family and x y&z but you start to realize that there are there are other bits of baggage that people are carrying with them that you know you can make a wrong decision in a moment and that that decision can you know to two people can make the same sort of wrong decision but one comes with far greater consequences you know one of the other people I have on this podcast we got him Cory McCarthy and it was a really really interesting discussion about his life and how he wound up in prison and it made me reflect even more on how close I could have come to going to prison - like when

[00:34:13] I was in eighth grade the kid I looked up to the most in high school and he took me under his wing I mean he really liked me and he was the toughest kid in the block and blah blah blah you know by the time I'm in tenth grade he's in 11th grade he's in jail for armed robbery and I've always thought like what if I went was out with him that night that he decided to do this really dumb thing and hold up a liquor store like you don't have enough of a prefrontal cortex at that age to sometimes go wait a minute this is a bad idea like in the moment that can seem like this is a grown rush like we're gonna get some money now that said you've brought a Blin a couple times so I gotta get one story out of you that is probably if I had like top 27 che hab stories this one's on the list so do you remember your first date with Lynn was one of our classmates so you knew Lynn yeah but you finally figured out a way to get her out on a date yeah our first date was a real winner oh I finally sort of mustered up the balls to ask one out on a date we were gonna go out to dinner someplace it was over Thanksgiving break and my buddy

[00:35:15] Josh Edelman was at the edge school at Stanford at the time and he called me up as they said somebody friends called me Sid first said well escape from nobodies like he said totally forgot that it's like sent you one of those hams it's halftime at the melon a 13-game I'm wonder if I can come over and have some of it like hey Josh I'm sorry man I got a date with this girl I really dig her I'd take her out to generate it's like dude dude come on I'll be over in like five minutes I'm like all right so I call up when I say hail and I'm sorry I gotta cancel dinner

[00:35:45] I've got I got Josh coming over here to eat my ham but you know maybe we can meet at the goose like that again thank you what is going through your mind in that phone I'm just thinking I want to give all my ham to Josh and so anyway so she goes are you kidding me I'm like no and then she goes okay and I'm like well do you wanted me to go she goes we're not meeting it the goose you can pick me up when we go the goose

[00:36:11] I'm like okay and the goose was the dive you've been there any time for those who don't know it's a dive bar outside of Stanford it's still there it's still up and running is it still there yeah same first place I ever ate when I came to Stanford yeah know you'll never forget it either it's probably still working its way through yeah and so Josh did come over he ate most of the ham and then I picked up Lynn and we went to the goose and we were talking and chatting across the table and I don't know if I should talk about this part of it but I had gas and I was just trying to sniff it one way and blow it the other way I'm just trying to divert it from getting near her nose but I don't know she says to this day she knew exactly what I was doing I thought it was very subtle so after that I drove her home and my car at that time was this was 96 and I had an 83 Honda Civic semis station wagon with where you can see the road through the floorboards I had sheepskin on the seats because they had worn completely through there was no radio and there was no air-conditioning and this thing was a you know I bought it for like $1,300 and there's a story about selling it to so anyway I took one back and we're sitting in the car and the sheepskin and I asked her hey can I give you a kiss and she's like he once again are you kidding me like I'm like what do you mean am I kidding here so like why why do you have to ask is like I don't know I thought and so anyway we kissed very awkwardly and she bolts out of the car good night and she leaves and I'm my god Jesus Christ I really [ __ ] that one up and so I get in the car you're sort of three strikes at this point ya know on that blowing off the dinner for them and like 27 ounces like a no-hitter so I'm leaving and I'm driving and literally like I don't know fourth way home like [ __ ] you should have you idiot so I turned the car around and I this is the story yes so guys if you've listened to nothing else yeah in this story this is the money line yeah so I knock on the door and she looks at she opens or she looks at me I'm like hey Lynn I'm so sorry I got halfway to the Safeway and I'm like

[00:38:22] Shammi with it and so I turn around I decided I just gotta tell you how I feel and she goes well how do you feel I'm like I think you're hot as [ __ ] and I said and I know I said myself if I don't care if I have to sleep on the couch or in your bedroom but I'm not going home she was well you could sleep on the couch strike strike ten and then down so these things just sort of happened from there so I mean I mean I slept at home that night we did kiss and it was much better kiss and then you know things just took off and lucky me but that's the line I mean I think yeah we're in a new era now yeah I still think that your hottest [ __ ] is not gonna get you a me-too offense I don't know I can't imagine why it could might I think it's reasonable yeah no it's objectifying it's often it's objectifying it is authentic and it's sincere but it's objectifying you know it's using swear words and stuff so there's certainly something that could be me to DES bout it I just love it so you've alluded to it already but just for those who don't know what HSS is so the Hospital for Special Surgery in New

[00:39:31] York is the apex facility for training orthopedic surgeons I mean even though I wasn't interested in orthopedic surgery even I knew what HSS was from the first year of medical school because if you wanted to do orthopedic surgery you wanted to go to HSS so you end up there but I mean just for someone listening this what the heck made HSS so special they had some Giants in the field of worth

[00:39:54] Phoenix and so number one it was an all orthopedic hospital it was all orthopedics and so they were a think-tank of orthopedics and they were let let the oxymoron there slide on the think tank of orthopedist yeah so but the development of joint replacement that was a big they played a big role in that some of the Giants in the field of joint replacement and chip Ron Awad Thomas

[00:40:18] Koko Phillip Wilson were part of it the spine surgeons I mean every every field within or every subspecialty within orthopedics HSS had a player in that field and again it's just a really unique environment where the reputation of the hospital is well earned and well deserved patients come from all over the tri-state area to get their orthopedic work done at special surgery the hospital work now we have 20 operating rooms for all the subspecialties there were 20 inpatient operating rooms alone all for orthopedics so just do that incredible volume you can't help but learn just to osmosis and they were very dedicated to resident education

[00:41:01] I remember one conference that we we were getting a little bit scolded because not everyone was showing up to conference obviously it's funny when people scold that people are actually there for not showing up right but anyway I remember one of the guys saying look we don't we don't have to do these teaching conferences every morning we'd be just as happy to crank up the arse at 7:30 instead of 8:30 but they did do that they would have these conferences every day from 7:30 to 8:30 about some topic of orthopaedics and by the end of four years again simply by osmosis you'd absorb so much knowledge and then the operative experience was second to none because the operating rooms were humming all day long and sometimes well into the night is not unheard of to do ten joint replacements and be doing your last one at 10:00 in the evening and they just that was the the ethic of the place was you took care of people you did there was no sort of end to it and they had an endless demand in a Nemus volume and they still do and and they still have the same Giants in the field they've developed some really young talent and influencers in the field so who were your mentors when you were there well there are several mentors but Russ

[00:42:05] Warren I consider a mentor I'm probably the not his pride and joy he's had several east train hath the NFL team physicians and he's been you still as prolific as he ever has been and he's got to be pushing into his mid-70s now and he is a Vietnam War surgeon and it seems like all those and you probably met him at Hopkins but these old-time Vietnam War surgeons were just incredibly gifted Bazzi they were just great surgeons and they really know how to take care of people and I think their training in wartime was a big part of that so Russ Warren for sure what did he specialize in specifically with the

[00:42:42] Northeast so he's one of the godfathers of sports medicine and in one of the earlier developers of ACL reconstruction and he was a pioneer in arthroscopy and arthroscopic reconstruction and he's written more papers than any orthopod alive and probably more papers and all orthopods combined I mean he's been he's he never stopped moving and working if it wasn't seeing a patient he was reading a research paper he was coming up with an idea and I remember one night his driver he had I worked with him as a fellow with the Giants when he and he's still their team physician and he had a driver Ernie who would take him every place and we had a late

[00:43:19] West Coast game we got back to Newark at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning and dr. war and spend the night above his office and then start seeing patients today to him and Ernie he asked me if I want to lift back I said yeah that'd be great thank you because where I lived was two blocks down from the hospital and Ernie dropped off dr. Warren and then I was in the car with Ernie I said hey Ernie and how does dr. Warren do it I mean he's always working and and I'm like how do you do it he said well dr. Warren takes very good care of me but he once told me all

[00:43:47] I got is time and I'm not wasting it for anybody and when I heard that it put everything into perspective the way dr. Warren work the fact that he never let a minute go wasted he was constantly either taking care of patients or thinking of research I remember on a West Coast trip he met with some engineers at Stanford for a type of bracing he just was constantly thinking orthopedics and advancing the field so he's obviously a huge influence and anybody who's ever worked with him will tell you he's the number one guy and then dr. Polly Chief Paul Palicki is another joint replacement surgeon I was for its medicine surgery surgeon was the most gifted joint replacement surgeon I've ever seen he could do a total hip replacement in 45 minutes to an hour what do you mean skin to skin yes and he just put in a perfect total lip every time and he was the doctors doctor he did anybody in the area and anybody in the hospital needed a replacement was getting it from bleachy I mean he was just a very very gifted surgeon and everyone knew it he's awesome one of the funniest people you can possibly meet a big Bruce fan as well and a Bon Jovi fan and turns out

[00:44:49] Jovi played it yeah honorary dinner and Bon Jovi was his you know was playing at this yeah at this dinner for in his honor but pleat sheet terrific guy and Wicca wits Tom Wicca wits who was the director of our fellowship again super good guy Scott Rodeo who's the head team position for the Giants now who's a phenomenal research clinician and though they're hard to find the clinician scientists are sort of a dying breed but dr. rodeo certainly embodies that and he takes terrific care of people including my mom and I don't know I can go down the list

[00:45:19] I mean well before we talk about leaving New York you spent a year at the Giants you did your sports fellowship what did you learn there I mean it strikes me as an interesting crash course of sports medicine because you're really seeing the finest tuned machines under the greatest destructive forces yeah that's a great way of putting it so with the fellowship that dr. Warren had he dr.

[00:45:38] Warren's fellowship he picked two guys and you would alternate a week at training camp and so once the Giants open training camp that was also coincided with the beginning of our fellowship just by just by chance and I grew up a giants fan like a rabid Giants fan and Bill Hensler was a rabid Giants fan LT the greatest linebacker of all time yes without question and one of the greatest people I mean so bill and I used to go to Giants games that that was our thing and one of my first Giants games was with Bill in 1983 when Scott

[00:46:05] Bruner was the quarterback and any giant fan will remember this when the Giants scored in our end zone and they went up by three points against the Redskins and it was pissing rain it was 32 and a half degrees I mean I've never you can't really be much colder than that and then the Giants kicked off and they squib kicked it and so the Redskins got great field position with 40 seconds left they get in the field goal position and Mark

[00:46:27] Mosley kicks his record-tying consecutive field goal then the Giants lose the coin toss the Redskins to get the ball they drive into field goal range mostly this is like first scores gonna win it's 83 and Mark Mosley kicks his record breaking consecutive field and we all home so disappointed and I think that was a game that Phil

[00:46:47] Simms heard his Nieman out but anyway bill and I would go to all these games and actually the night before bill died there was a Giants game on and we had talked about it and and we out like we always did we recall you know when I was in New York and or California wherever we talk every Sunday talk about the

[00:47:02] Giants game and I remember talking about that game with Bill and then and he knew something was up because that following morning he that's when he died and we were crying on the phone I love you and you know after talking about the game and the game was again just another vehicle so anyway I had it and I bill it taking me to try his training camp when we were driving up to st. Paul's I think one time and I was going up early for my own football camp as a junior in high school when we stopped in Albany for the

[00:47:26] Giants training camp where they would have it and we hung out there for the day and much practice and I remember that training camp but now I'm coming back about a year and a half after bill died two giants training camp and it was a bizarrely emotional time I never spoke with the trainer's Ronny Barnes and and

[00:47:43] Byron Hansen and Steve Canali about this I mean there were three of the greatest guys there they're unbelievable practitioners and caretakers of these athletes but as a kind of an emotional moment where I'm in training camp having all these memories of Bill thinking man he would be he would love to imagine the pride here he would be so happy but okay all that aside the first thing you do realize is that these guys are freak athletes like beyond anything you can imagine they're so physically gifted it is beyond belief I remember I had a poster in my bedroom when I was a kid of

[00:48:21] Jerry Rice standing in the end zone and he's holding the ball up and at his feet is a player I think it was someone in the Bengals and he's like got his ankles but he's completely like laying out and obviously failed in his attempt to stop Jerry Rice and I remember one of my best friends in high school who was himself a fantastic athlete we were like sitting in my room one day sort of shooting the [ __ ] and he he said one of the most of

[00:48:43] Stute ever he looks up at that poster and points to the back laying prone and he's like do you realize that guy's a better athlete than will ever be like the dude at the feet of the guy you're worshipping well the guys in the league are free Catholics the guys trying to get into the league are free Kath leads the guys at the top of the league are freak athletes and it is a razor-thin margin that separates the guy who's a superstar in the league and the guy who's not in the league and again it is such a narrow margin of you know this athlete versus that they are all tremendous athletes so that's the first thing you recognize is just how fast strong powerful gifted graceful all of these guys in longevity matters you know I mean Ryan Flaherty who's a friend of mine that I do need to get on this podcast at some point I've talked about him in the past but you know Ryan is really the Guru of speed training and he does two things basically trains guys in college who were you know the top sort of 10 recruits that are gonna go to the combine and do really well and then also trains guys once they're in the NFL and he said to me once you know the focus changes so much after the combine to what you care about so when you are in college trying to get there it's all about performance at the combine and performance to get in the league and that predominantly comes down to speed and then he said but once you get in the

[00:50:07] NFL once he's working with these guys that are there its longevity it's just don't get injured and he changes the strategy is completely dedicated towards maintaining how long they can stay healthy and that's a huge challenge it is so violent on the sidelines it's very very difficult to really get a sense of how violent it is unless you're right next to it but the hits are massive I mean when they talk about it being like a car wreck it really is like a car wreck and it's an incredibly high energy collisions that happen over and over and over again I mean the closest

[00:50:36] I've ever sent an NFL game is probably 20 rows back in the end zone so you're far enough away like it's still great to be able to you know I was watching Barry Sanders play the 49ers that sounds like the only time I've ever seen Barry Sanders in person but yeah I can't imagine where you're sitting on the sidelines just even acoustically what that's like yeah I remember there was an interception once and the Giants had thrown the interception and and then

[00:50:58] Chris knee who was an all pro-gard and Tom Coughlin's son-in-law as it turns out he was married to Coughlin's daughter comes over and just wrecks this guy I mean and it was right at right in front of me and he flattened this guy and this guy got up but it was the most acoustically impactful it felt like a sonic boom when this guy popped him like just really took him out that's the other thing I think people don't appreciate

[00:51:24] I only appreciate this cuz I've seen him train how fast those linemen can run like the right you look at those getting you think ah he's 320 pounds he's got a little bit of a belly he's probably not that fast and he's gonna run a forty in like five seconds flat if not for nine right and then I couldn't run today if my life depended on it so they would do gassers

[00:51:45] Coughlin had him do gassers where they'd go 50 yards across the field 50 yards back and you'd have to do it in 18 seconds 16 seconds depending on your position so I just like alright let me give this a try and I wasn't in as good a shape then as I had been you know five years earlier I'd sort of fallen off too you know but once the kids came the wheels kind of came up but but I was trying to do the gassers on the linemen time and it was very challenging and these guys can motor they are exceptionally good athletes they are big but they're also graceful and they're strong and they're all that they're coordinated you name it but the freakishness of the athletes is certainly something that sticks out the stress that these guys are under I don't think people appreciate it I mean people think about professional athletes just sort of coasting they're making millions and everything else but that's not it's done anywhere near the truth and particularly in football where they're really few and far between guaranteed contracts so these guys don't see their money unless they stay healthy and play and there's so few games I mean I remember reading an editorial awhile ago that talked about imagine we just took hockey basketball and baseball and made it a 16-game season like think of what that would do to the intensity recency of every game yeah every play every game so that's exactly what it is it is intense it's and if you're in the league and you know that the f you know you're fighting with everybody on your team for a position you're fighting with everybody in the league for your position you're fighting with everybody out early trying to get into the league for a position it's an incredibly stressful environment for a young 20-something year old to be exposed to it mean these guys are under a tremendous amount of stress to just perform keep their job not get hurt and it's an intensely difficult situation so that's certainly something that stood out what were the most common injuries like yeah I remember reading and this is almost assuredly dated and no longer correct but directionally I'm sure it's correct but the median tenure of a player in the NFL was like you know three to four years yeah we hear about

[00:53:46] Tom Brady I mean it's great to talk I mean frankly most of players we know about you know the great quarterbacks you know they've been around for a decade and you sort of take that for granted but that's not the norm not even close I mean it is positionally dependent the running backs have the shortest careers linebackers have shorter careers but they really really again because everyone's trying to get in the league everyone in the league is competing and there's attrition I mean these guys leak oil and they leak oil relatively quickly because of the violence of the game and it was funny I remember at the combine the combine you'd examine the 300 participants were in the combine and would you actually examine everyone or with the Giants say hey look these are the guys were most interested in go examine them it wasn't that they would cherry-pick the players they they got a grade on everybody so all the 300 participants I got a medical grade but what would happen is the teams get in groups of four or five and the docs grooves are four five so the players are going to seven or eight not exactly the same physical exam seven or eight times exactly and if they had an injury history obviously that would be what would be of interest the docs would share the information among the teams they were there you know very much working as a group of physicians trying to evaluate the medical care that these players had gotten in the past but I remember I mean all these kids coming through had something and you know wrist surgeries for scaphoid stability surgeries for shoulder dislocations ACL meniscus surgery I mean it seemed like more often than not these kids had already had a prior medical history or prior surgical history and I said to

[00:55:18] Ronny Barnes and SiC on Ronny all these guys are somewhat injured and leaking oil yet these are the best guys coming through and he said he said they're all injured because they're the best guys coming through and they play and it's made me realize but it's a very tough sport to play at a very high level without exposing yourself to injury and that everybody gets hurt at some point and it's usually those injuries that slow you down just a little bit that again is that margin that razor thin margin of being a star in the league and being out of the league do either your boys play football my youngest does actually JJ does he's playing freshman football does that worry you at all not just with everything you know but also with me stuff we've since learned yeah sure it worries me like crazy and you know he started playing football as he's probably the only Jewish kid in the history of the world to leverage his bar mitzvah into a football spot yeah he's in seventh grade and he's preparing for his Bar Mitzvah and he was hating it and he basically struck up a deal it's like you guys let me play tackle football you won't hear a word about the Bar Mitzvah preparation I'll just almost say work and we took him up on the deal and he was playing in a weighted Football

[00:56:28] League so 125 pounds was the max and they everyone's acutely aware of of CTE concussions head injuries that way the game is coached has changed drastically among the youth level and then when you watch the games it seems relatively safe I mean it's sort of kids bumping hips it certainly doesn't seem any more violent than the lacrosse and hockey the kids were playing at that age and we let him play he then he played again as eighth grade year kids a little bigger and so again it was still a size limited League so he's a little bit more advantage then and then sort of reluctantly he's playing as a freshman and simply because he loves playing the game and we look at the mentors who are his coaches and we have such admiration for his coaches and we look at his teammates and he gets an awful lot out of it and I remember hearing at Curtis Martin's Hall of Fame acceptance speech which I will link to it but it is beautiful it's an awesome speech so you're better off listening to it I don't know if you want me to spoil it but yeah I mean go ahead and paraphrase it for the pose of the folks who want to listen so Curtis Martin talks basically off-the-cuff about football and his closing line was and he came from very poor disadvantaged environment

[00:57:37] Pittsburgh and football gave him an Avenue and he talks about all the dangers of the game and he's not certain whether or not he'd let his son play football or not but he's he says to himself if football can do for your kid what it did for me there's no question then I'd let you play I mean that's fundamentally the the punchline that there's a lot of pros and cons you have to weigh the pros and cons for your own kid and decide whether or not it's worth it and for us we felt it was worth it and I I [ __ ] my pants daily every game I'm always worried about him playing but then again I see the joy he derives from playing it and it's hard to hold that now as time goes on and the game gets faster and the kids get bigger and and he may decide this is for me or this is not for me you know we'll see how he develops and he's still just a freshman and still an underdeveloped freshman but it is something we let him do despite Lynn being a pediatrician me being an orthopedist and both of us being fully aware of the risk of playing because in the end we felt the benefits outweighed the risk yeah oh no stuff I'd like to be

[00:58:37] I was on the way over here to meet you I was talking to my brother and my brother's really in a mountain biking and he keeps trying to get me to do it I'm like yeah I just want to do it like I just you know hey I don't need a new thing to get into but also it's like just don't the risk of injury like I don't even silly injuries like I don't break my wrist or do something like that but look he's obsessed with it and we have a mutual friend who's much closer to who's a motorcycle racer and he used to do a lot of road riding and whenever we would be on you know road rides this guy was the best descender like because he had been racing motorcycles all his life he could he could basically rip hell going down a mountain when all of us would be a little more tentative and on our breaks and stuff and this guy's name is Jimmy and now Jimmy's got my brother into something I didn't even realize was an activity which is downhill mountain biking so they go to ski slopes in the summer and you ride you take your mountain bike up the ski slope and you just come down and I'm like my brother is like I know what you're gonna say before you say it so don't say it I thought it was crazy too but it is the freakin best thing in the world not to rush and I was like you couldn't pay me to do that Paul what are you thinking riding a mountain bike down a ski slope like I think I'm just a [ __ ]

[00:59:49] I took a trip with my buddy Jim Barker from Telluride mo on a mountain bike over the uncompacted plateau but we were such novice rookies we even like hey let's go mountain biking yeah what do you want to do let's go to the Colorado and go down some ski slopes and then barrel down around bikes that's what we thought we can do well we think it'd be fun it's like alpine sliding on a bike so let's talk a little bit about some of the nuts and bolts of orthopedic surgery because I can't imagine there's somebody listening to this who hasn't either personally directly or indirectly been touched by an orthopedic injury and I don't know the right way to go through it but why don't we just start with the knee since that seems to be a pretty common joint that gets injured talk to me about it through the lens of an engineer what is the knee really good at what is it bad at if you could be God for a day what would you change so well that's a good question so the knee is incredibly good at bearing weight in supporting your weight and it's incredibly stable for what it's being asked to do but it's an incredibly complex design with more moving parts every degree of freedom is in is in play with rotation translation so if I were

[01:01:03] God for a day I would make the ligaments actually no I would make the cartilage immortal because the cartilage wearing down in the knee is fundamentally what will slow people down I see so you're not going to save the ACL tear but you're gonna save the knee replacements for arthritis correct and the cartilage is what when that wears down that's when people have pain people can live without an ACL I've lived without an ACL in my left knee since I was 12 years old and I was able to play sports not many not everybody 12 you torria ratio yes and you at the time you could have had a cadaveric replacement so at 12 years old at that time I was casted for patellar tendon it was in the early 80s so I mean when I was 12 and so ACL reconstruction was in its nascent say I'm not even sure anything was really being done on any sort of widespread level and if it was it was being done through open incisions and there's a five and one procedure where you'd sling bits of the IT band around the knee and certainly not what modern techniques would be of reconstruction sometimes repairs were being done at the time that's failing basically trying to sew the ligament back together and so you can live without an ACL and you can live a very productive back to life without one but you will be prone to instability and the instability can wear down the knee the repetitive giving out episodes can start wearing through the meniscus and then once the meniscus starts going the articular hard cartilage starts going and once the heart cartilage starts going the knee pain the knee swelling limitation describe the joint because now I'm realizing it's hard to do this over audio but you've got this thing called the tibia and it has a plateau and that's where the cartilage sits right on top of the plateau yes and then the other end of the joint is the sort of bottom end or the distal end of the femur that's kind of roundish yes it actually kind of looks more like a knuckle right like yeah and they're two condyles two knuckles yes so you've talked about the cartilage but then where does the ACO

[01:02:56] MCL and mend this guy fit into that for the person listening to this so again like you said it's hard to describe and we'll put cool pictures up so people can kind of look okay so the MCL is on the inside zone of the knee and it's actually a ligament that's we consider extra-articular it's it's outside the joint capsule and the MCL is a very stout ligament that controls the knee from swaying side to side so if you can imagine your tibia swing out towards your hip or back towards your other foot the MCL controls that the LCL which is the lateral collateral ligament on the other side of the knee and the outside zone of the knee has the same function but just in the opposite direction and then the cruciate ligaments are crossing ligaments that are directly in the center of the knee and the anterior cruciate ligament is crucial for rotational control of the knee and when people tear their ACL it's usually a rotational injury that does it and it's almost a new your dislocation of the knee that occurs and so usually the outer part of the femur will rotate backwards and even come all the way off the tibia and then rotate back and as it comes off and comes back that's where the tearing of the ACL occurs why do people tear the ACL more than the PCO

[01:04:08] PCL usually gets torn from a direct blow injury from falling on to the knee but falling specifically on the tibial tubercle and it's not easy to do that I mean most the time you're falling more on your patella but if you fall directly on your tibia you will drive the tibia backwards posteriorly and that's what puts the PCL on stretch and it gives out but people do very well with a full PCL Tara as long as they don't have any other ligament injury in the knee and plenty of the professional athletes including a few on the Giants had to complete PCL tears who were functioning at that high athletic level so it doesn't have the same rotational implications when patients to other PCL they typically if they're having complication from the PCL tear it's from the increased contact pressures that happened in the patella because the tibia is now sitting back and it's pulling the patella into the femur as it sits back and that pressure between the patella and the femur is what gives people disability from a PCL tear and then so where did them in this guy sit the menisci I sit on top of the plateau they're rounded and they basically contour the flattish plateau and to a more rounded femurs so it allows for the contact pressures within the knee to be distributed evenly more evenly and their critical tissue structures as it turns out we've wasn't long ago that we were removing menisci without really any thought consequence there is no foreseen consequence of taking out the meniscus or even parts of it and it's become very clear that losing the meniscus is sort of the beginning of the end for most people's knees once they started having meniscal tears and it's far more likely that at a younger age their cartilage is gonna wear down their heart cartilage and so when a person gets a knee replacement the tibial plateau has that built in little curvature up at the edges to mimic what the meniscus would be doing sitting on the actual tibial cartridge is that necessary with a replacement so the meniscus is also stabilizing structure within the knee and again it takes the flat tibia makes it more rounded so that the femur fits in it and that gives some natural anterior and posterior resistance to translation and losing that meniscus puts the articular cartilage under a lot more pressure and it tends to wear down more quickly now there are several other factors besides the status of the meniscus that leads to loss of that articular cartilage that hard cartilage that code cm of the bones but when people end up losing that coating of hard cartilage on the end of the bones in the joint that's the cartilage that we really care about because losing that will lead to swelling and pain and difficulty walking and feelings of instability and all the things that slow people down as they're trying to live a long life and that's where their health span and their life span starts separating as you you know you've taught me this whole concept about life span and health span but that's where it starts separating when that articular cartilage starts wearing down I tell all my patients everyone's gonna lose their heart cartilage that's that's not an if it's a matter of when and we all want to lose ours one more 150 years old and the things that influence that our genetics exposure to injury trauma but also things that are modifiable your weight your exercise things that really tend to help and so when people have knee replacement the plastic that's put in between is really again for stability and to distribute some force and to hold the knee in place and they're different designs with is it still ultra high molecular weight polyethylene it is polyethylene that's used in hips there's more cross-linked polyethylene to resist wear the knee replacements tend to fail because of loosening of the prosthetic from the from the bone and one of the things that can lead to loosening is particulate wear causing inflammation leading to a cascade that eventually results in failure of the knee and unlike changing the tires on your car when when you have a new knee it's not the same as the old set it's not as durable it's typically not as satisfying it's not as flexible and so people don't have the same sort of euphoric outcome with their second knee replacement for instance than they do with their first what's the typical expected or median expected utility out of any replacement again it depends heavily I'm sure on the age of the patient and activity level but as a general rule do you necessarily give a number because it does depend on the activity the younger patient is the more active they'll be and the more likely they will loosen at an earlier age and so for the people who need the knee replacements the longest people in their 40s and 50s well the shortest life suite if an 8 year old you'll tell them just to set expectations you're probably going to need two of these in your lifetime he's gonna need a revision at some point in the lifetime but it's a significant difference in longevity for the fifth year old getting a knee replacement than the 65 year old and so we try and kick the can down as as far as we can down the road so that if patients end up needing knee replacement that it's going to be their knee replacement will outlast them and that they'll only have one operation on their knee so not unlike the way you think about a heart valve it's the same be age and yeah tissue versus mechanical different situation let's go back to some of the modifiable factors you talked about so wait how clear I mean it's intuitively obvious how clear is the relationship is it linear is it nonlinear in between it may be geometric and I mean because every pound of weight loss up top is four pounds of weight loss through the knee was just walking and it becomes amplified is that that's just again the mechanics mechanics of the knee so your center of gravity and and and how that applies torque into the knee is part of the reason why that body weight is amplified so it's not just pound for pound so when patients gain the pound they're putting four more pounds of pressure their knee was just walking six pounds more with going up and down the stairs eight pounds more with running so it's a significant multiplier and there are similar multipliers what they happen in the back and so we it's so interesting we bring this up we've been trying to help patients with these modifiable factors for their knee and particularly their weight and we started a program in our practice called the ortho health which is based off a lot of the work you do and I I don't know if you've ever seen the webinar I give but you're sort of an all-star in the webinar and so as men but we're trying to help patients sleep better trying to help them manage their stress better try and help them eat better and try to help them exercise more efficiently

[01:10:19] I think people exercise way too much trying to get it all in Bernal they have a concept of burning all the calories as opposed to sort of activating their metabolism and so we're trying with these this group of patients were typically overweight BMI over 30 35 40 they're pretty ill patients there it's they're not just their knee that's bothering them and trying to get them that turn their lives around a little bit so from an activity standpoint is all things equal running harder on the knee than any other activity a patient does it is harder and what's more strain on it but the body reacts to this there's I think it's called Wolf's law where the body reacts to stress so the more stress that's put on it the more bone that's laid down for in so that's why we emphasize weight-bearing exercise for patients their thirties in particular before they start losing bone so that they can build up their bone density and so the body reacts when do you lose the ability to increase bone density through that activity it's usually around 30 and women have an accelerated bone loss in menopause so the bone building is occurring through the first couple decades of life and then from then on it's down but there's a big big decrease during menopause in bone density for for women and that's where therapy's directives are all advanced all the hormone therapy and all the exercise basically isn't to bring you back to where you were when you were 30 it stupid slow slow it down slow it down because it's an it's an inevitable decline what is driving that is it osteoclast ik is it well it has to be to some degree because the osteoclasts are what are the they're the cells that resorb bone but how well understood is the why like what's the evolutionary reason that we would were not short of any of the minerals that are in bone we could certainly get them exhaustion ously why in the world would we just decide to enter a catabolic state at the age of 30

[01:12:05] I don't have a clue and I don't know whether for women its childbearing and building the skeleton of the fetus certainly there's a transient osteopenia of pregnancy that occurs but I don't have the faintest clue and and those are that's a fantastic question that people are trying to answer and you know pharmacologically we try and slow down the osteoclast ik function we try and slow down the speed at which the osteoclast and I use that term technically I shouldn't have I should have defined it so osteoclast ik is but breaking down of bone osteoblastic is the building up of bone and though the cells that do that you know and so the osteoclasts get inhibited by some of the pharmacotherapies the Fosamax boniva is that list phosphonates that slow down and quote-unquote build bone density but it's not necessarily building great bone and so it's building denser bone but there's concerns that there may be fault lines in the bone that it may not necessarily be more torsionally resistant it's not more tension resistance so you see tension sided failure of bone with prolonged use of bisphosphonates and so those are some of the atypical femur fractures that you see people get foot fractures with this so it's not going to be the answer just inhibiting osteo class to build healthier bone or to slow down the process of bone resorption and is there anything that's in the pipeline pharmacologically with respect to activating osteoblasts great question most of it is focused on osteoclast ik inhibition and there are thoughts about bumping up osteoblastic production with magnetic fields and that's what's the technology behind bone stimulators for when patients have hard to heal fractures you can use a bone stimulator which is an electromagnetic field that seems to be stimulating to the osteoblasts but there's always concern that when you stimulate the osteoblasts that you may be provoking a cancer type station because you don't necessarily know where you're directing them right and so we don't use these bone stimulators in patients with cancer we purposely avoid that to avoid stimulating out-of-control growth so if you're listening to this and you're not an athlete so meaning you're like most of us you're just your sport is life at this point you exercise me mainly to you know help you perform through life better as opposed to play in the NFL it's relatively easy to avoid the twisting injuries but it's these repetitive strain injuries you know the person who's riding the bike that doesn't have their pedals and their cleats fully tuned correctly or they're running but they're doing and so and efficiently or God I see people that ride you know spend hours on ellipticals and their hips are jacked because they're just in a lousy position is that the case or is that just my bias that I see towards it I mean are you still seeing people our age that show up like is it just as common to see the guy who's playing pickup basketball and still tears his ACL through a torsional injury no I share your bias I do think people exercise incorrectly and I think part of it is because there seems to be such an emphasis on volume of exercise and the volume of exercise and intensity or not intensity but getting in your volume of exercise within an hour because of your sedentary lifestyle for the other 23 I think that is what leads people to injury they do too much repetition with poor form like you're saying exposing themselves to injuries so there's no question that repetitive bad form will lead to injury and especially under load correct and then if you have a torsional if you just happen to be playing hoops and you happen to put your foot down on piece of turf or on someone's ankle and your knee twists I mean those are sort of freak accidents that can occur at any point and if you want to keep it as safe as possible and as helpful as possible then you should walk I mean walking will give you the cardiovascular benefits that most exercises most any other exercise well I think the Harvard School of Public Health has done an awful lot of work at looking at walking and cardiovascular risk and nearing you know thirty to forty percent risk reduction with walking yeah I mean you won't find many people that are more critical of the Harvard School of Public Health effect I don't know the answer my intuition is that those studies are so biased by the people who have the luxury of being able to walk like in other words they're so there may be too many health are you healthy user biases within those studies I think unfortunately to get to do long term clinical trials with randomization here is going to pose a huge problem it's that going to happen so we are stuck with I think some combination of short term clinical studies that can show us measurable changes in short terms coupled with I think trying to do better epidemiology which is you know that's sort of like saying trying to make toilet water taste a little bit better but yeah I think I struggled with this I mean I yeah my view is and again it's so unlike me to say this because it's so sort of hand-wavy bullshitty but i really do think that there is the less time you are sitting around the better and i think in part it's not just the benefit you get from walking around it's the damage that's done by shortening the hamstrings by tightening the so ass and the hip flexors like that stuff starts to translate into these other things that set you up for orthopedic failure when you actually are doing your one hour of activity or whatever it is very well put so when you have again a primarily sedentary life but you're trying to make up for that with one hour of exercise or two hours of exercises I think that's the setup that leads people to injury yet people have jobs and families to provide for and they are sitting around and so then how can you get moving more consistently through the day I do think that that sort of consistent movement is what leads to better orthopedic musculoskeletal health and it's not necessary having to do an hour exercise a day I think it's more generalized movement for the majority of hours of the day so I couldn't agree with you more and I I don't want to get into a thing with you of all people about any sort of epidemiologic study but I don't see a lot of patients coming to me who've injured themselves walking yeah and I and I you know I think my question is I guess I'm not at a point yet where I know enough even though this is a very high priority for me to understand this can walking be sufficient from a cardiovascular standpoint in other words if you told somebody all you gonna do is lift weights and walk but you can skip any of the high-intensity training you can skip doing your Tabata Xand mat ball slams or you know peloton stuff like that there's like a type of exercise that's still in the middle of those I'm still trying to I think come to grips with what the relative physiologic benefits are because I the way I think about exercise in it like all things there's a Venn diagram but there are certain exercises that we are doing where the emphasis is on the exoskeleton so maintaining muscle mass maintaining functional movement maintaining bone density and doing so free of pain and then there are some aspects of exercises you alluded to where really what we're doing is talking about physiologic benefits we're talking about what it's doing to the micro vasculature what it's potentially doing to the mitochondria what it's doing with other hormones for example BDNF and the role that that plays in the brain I mean that I think you can make a pretty compelling case that there is no intervention that has shown a larger impact in mitigating cognitive decline than exercise yes and all avenues seem to flow through BDNF and increased micro vascular composure so those are kind of like what I put in this sort of reducing exercise to reduce the risk of disease versus exercise to increase health span and then of course the sweet spot is when they overlap right then the question is where do they where do they not this is actually probably the thing I think about the most in my free time is that particular request yeah so I try and ask the octogenarians that I see in my practice who look like they're in pretty good al who get around pretty well and you know what's the secret I ask as many of the older people as I can what's the secret how did you do it and totally see you doing this and you know commonly they not saying some people say yeah I've been working out every single day of my life some people say I make all my meals some people say I just go for a walk and there's probably such a you know everybody probably has their fingerprint or their metabolic foot fingerprint that for some people walking is sufficient for some people it's high intensity intervals that would be sufficient to the function of what's their sleep like what's their act what's their nutrition like and so it becomes such a you know huge variable equation that you're trying to solve that I'm not sure it's ever gonna be solved I hope it can be but I do give the advice to patients because I see a lot of injuries from people trying to overdo it that I mean it really is important to start in increments when you're just starting it's very difficult to go from zero to 60 without exposing yourself to injury unless you are 20 years old yeah that's an important point I want to come back to the joint stuff but I my patients will they're pretty tired of hearing me say this but I always say sort of rule number one of exercises you can't get injured rise if you get injured then you know you're defeating the taking person steps backwards I don't wanna put you on the spot because this is a question that I should have asked you earlier to let you think about it but top five exercise bad moves that end up coming into your clinic for adults let's let's take that let's not even talk about the high school and college kids who are doing crazy sports but so probably the most common thing I see is knee pain and knee swelling from excessive squats and lunges and I understand the core benefits and the quad benefits of doing squats and lunges but like I said it puts a lot of strain on the knee and some knees just aren't ready to absorb that strain or don't have enough cartilage to absorb that strain or most commonly don't have enough muscle to absorb that strain and so they come in with an overloaded joint that's swollen injured in that articular cartilage has been put under too much pressure and it might be failing and you get the sense that they're too anterior when they do these things especially on the lunges I mean the technique for a lunge is actually so counterintuitive because really a lunge the front knee should be under no-load the front leg should be all glute based loading and my guess is if you're if you don't know that and you don't have a trainer who can put you in the correct position you end up being too far forward you're gonna load that knee is that what you think is happening without a doubt so and they come in with and overloaded the anterior knee pain from not using their glutes from overly relying on their quadriceps and I am II look most of the trainers in our area our kids who like lift weights and and they have their clients and so I I mean it's really important like you're alluding to to have a trainer knows what they're doing because it makes all the difference in the world but I see a lot of patients for having trouble with their knees from repetitive squats and lunges that are again probably done with poor form which is what we were talking about earlier about repetitive injuries being a result of poor form and then I see patients with shoulder injuries using weights and again being in significantly disadvantaged positions and you know when you're using weights you're you're trying to that the ultimate weight training would be to activate the muscle without loading the joint and you can do that you can activate the muscle and not load the joint when you use very light weights but enough weight that the muscle gets challenged just just even the most minor degree because once it's challenged you can then over flex that muscle you can voluntarily flex the muscle beyond so you need an just enough weight to initiate the muscle activation and contraction and that's usually not very much at all and then the joints not being loaded the muscles being activated and you're getting a much safer workout do most shoulder injuries occur from loading the shoulder above the plane of the neck in other words an overhead type resistance I think so I mean I can't say for certain I'm not sure anyone can but it seems that most people when they come in with shoulder pain will have commented that the biggest problem has been that they're having trouble with overhead you know they were doing an overhead press and it's usually a press over a pole it seems like the bench pressing the military pressing the inclines goes a little bit more trouble than for instance to pull downs in the bench rows so I think the again the joint load is much higher when you're doing a press compared to a pole so when patients are recovering from shoulder injuries or have sustained and shoulder injury I my sort of generic advice sort of take-home advices you know try and emphasize more of the poles in the presses as you're recovering so what are the most common injuries you're seeing for elbows wrists hips ankles that kind of stuff so elbows and wrists typically tendinopathy x' again ten and overload tendon inflammatory injuries and I'm not sure whether they happen because of inflammatory changes just biologic and age-related changes blood flow related changes so around the elbow in the 40s and 50s I see you know endless it seems like epicondylitis which is tendinitis around the the forearm muscles that flex your wrist and straighten your hand or bend your wrist and curl your hand and those tendinopathy 'z whether they occur in the wrist the shoulder the elbow the knee the ankle I'm absolutely certain have the same biologic mechanism and I do think the blood flow to these tendons as they decline between the fourth and fifth decade of life that loss of blood flow that loss of reparative mechanism is what leads to this sort of again uniform biologic problem in these very joints so I don't consider elbow lateral epicondylitis or tennis elbow golfers level that much different from shoulder tendinitis or impingement or that much different from patellar tendonitis or

[01:25:25] Achilles tendinitis from a biologic standpoint I'm pretty certain they're exactly the same thing and I think again the common pathway is probably loss of microvasculature to the tendons what about ankles why ankles so ankles again it's usually the Achilles tendon that's the key to the foot its Achilles tendon that's the key with the foot the most common sort of acquired problem is poster tibialis tendon deficiency where there's attenuation and stretch of the posterior tibialis tendon and that's the tendon that supports the arch and over time that just starts getting stretched out as you can imagine it's a mechanical issue and unless it can keep itself in prime shape it's going to stretch out over time just due to the forces that it's under and when it does the foot starts changing shape the foot starts changing how it loads and pain is the most frequent presenting problem with a poster tibialis tendon deficiency and you can help support that with orthotics there are some very complex foot reconstructions that can be done to help reconstruct the foot in such a way that the poster tibialis tendon isn't playing as much of a role but you know those are difficult reconstructions to undergo you're non-weight-bearing for six weeks strictly and then you know gradually weight-bearing you're taking a big chunk out of your life and you're definitely knocking yourself down to build yourself back up again and whenever you do that there's always the risk that you knock yourself down and you don't bounce that's the problem with a lot of the surgeries that we do is that we do set people back and not every single person's kind of bounce back better than what they started and that's sort of the challenge in the difficulty and what about the hip it's a simpler joint in the sense that it's a ball and socket so it tends to just wear down not to oversimplify now there are some muscles around the hip that act like that we're much more familiar with because of the accessibility of it like the rotator cuff so a lot of the abductor muscles around the hip connect like a rotator cuff does in the shoulder but because of the again the weight-bearing nature of the hip the congruence of the hip it tends to just wear down and that labral cartilage which is the soft cartilage of the hip can get frayed but it's the articular cartilage that really makes a difference now there are some conditions around the hip that we can change the natural history to it seems that we can where we can reshape the hip a bit so it's not banging into itself as much that's called femoral acetabular impingement and that seems to be a place where we can be make a difference in terms of long term outcomes of those patients by reshaping the hip to some degree and you know labral tears I think the jury's out a bit it strikes me as one of those things that's sort of a little bit like lumbar disc herniation where someone can have hip pain you do an MRI they've got a labral tear you're no further ahead than you were before you don't know if that's the cause right you're exactly right so you and I can go on an MRI scan and both of our hips are incredibly likely 90% likely to have label tearing on em are and you put a 20 year old in there and it's not 90% but it's about 80% so the odds are it's very high so you're gonna see some sort of label abnormality on an MRI on nearly everybody put in so then you're basically right where you started from you don't know much more than what you did so a lot of people will be given the test of time they'll be put into physical therapy they don't see if this remains an issue and for those people who fall out then some type of correction can be helpful but again you know our experience of the meniscus is kind of a good example of that where you know having a meniscus injury on MRI is essentially you know in a 40 or 50 year old isn't very meaningful it's much more meaningful that if you suspect there's a meniscus that the patient hasn't been able to have sort of riding on their own they haven't been able to use physical therapy or time to their advantage to get their knee right and then those people will typically benefit a lot from a procedure let's talk about this in a little more detail so this is still a kind of controversial area or is the controversy within the you know esteemed orthopedic surgery community no longer controversy but it's taking a while to trickle down to the rest of us so no I mean it's a funny topic so Jana Claude I wrote that article about how surgeons are addicted to use with surgery underneath

[01:29:23] I mean I'm gonna reserve that's fine but she's a little off base on this one in particular I think she's off right so there was a paper that my buddy did he's at Wash U Rob Brophy he's a very accomplished researcher and he's great surgeon great doc and they did a study that was published in the New England

[01:29:45] Journal regarding physical therapy versus surgery for meniscus tears and the punchline was that there's no difference between physical therapy and surgery and so Jeana Coolatta interprets that as hey it doesn't matter whether they do surgery or therapy so why we're doing surgery at all we should just do therapy for everybody well turns out in one of the arms of the physical therapy group there was a cross over to surgery for those patients who weren't getting better but it was an intention-to-treat model so they were still counted there was no count of yet they were still counted as physical therapy so the take-home message of the study was and hey it doesn't matter if you do therapy or surgery will end up in the same place it's more hey look it's reasonable to try reasonable to try both just to start with physical therapy and start conservatively but don't you know they're still out there are subsets of patients that will benefit from crossing that's exactly right that's exactly the message and that's exactly what I tell my patients they look you have a meniscus injury odds are is probably gonna get better with therapy and time and you should play those odds if however the odds aren't your favor and you start having pain or you continue that pain you're not getting any better in a month let's go up we need to take care your meniscus what letter was that paper that was prease 2016 yeah okay we'll make sure we link to that paper because I think it'll be good for people to see it again I we can go back and look but do you remember off the top of your head or even never mind that just clinically what you say to patients is how long a period of time do you want to give them on the conservative approach before you cross over so I usually give them about a month or two but when patients come in a month later saying yeah I'm feeling a little better I'll keep on riding it outright and even though they might be just feeling a little better there other people come in a month later feel a lot better I remember working with John

[01:31:16] Healy who's an orthopedic oncologist at sloan-kettering and I mean he's really taking care of some very very sick patients with osteosarcoma most conscious sarcomas they're young or they're all durbin and he's an amazing doctor an amazing surgeon and he once made a comment about people scoping for dollars and I hate to think that that happens but there's no question that it happens none of us like to think we're the ones doing it but the fact the matter is it has to happen there has to be some pressures for people to feel like you know the arthroscopy is the right thing to do even though the data is pretty clear that someone walking in your office with a degenerative meniscus tear probably shouldn't be scoped there's a first line of treatment and so

[01:31:56] I don't know what's motivating that person whether their past experience of they're getting better which is again tainted by the fact that they were probably gonna get better whether you did surgery or not so that idea of doing useless surgery in fact is I see where it comes from because we kind of as a as a group can dig our own hole by making these decisions that are whether consciously or not are being influenced by outside factors I think this is a really interesting point in medicine and

[01:32:24] I struggle with this a lot when you're not a procedure list which I'm not the stakes are a little bit lower and the opportunities are a bit lower but I don't refer I told the story before but this was a moment when I had a realization so so one of the things that a lot of people in my type of practice do is they also sell drugs meaning they can get a license to become a pharmacy basically and they can sell anything that's sort of compounded and it becomes another profit center so you can start to sell whatever it is that you would be prescribing to your patients so you get to make the money instead of sending them to a pharmacy and on the surface that sounds okay but the problem with that is and I realized it one day when I was really on the fence about two different therapies for a patient and they were they're different but one of them is actually quite inexpensive its generic it's basically a free drug and then the other one is not now I was sitting there really wrestling with which one to put them on because of the age of the patient and a few other factors it really wasn't a clear-cut case at which to do and I remember thinking holy [ __ ] if I were the ones selling both of these do I trust myself enough that subconsciously I wouldn't lean towards the more expensive one because I would make ten dollars on the nothing burger one and I'd make like $400 on the other one and I and I thought to myself you know don't be so sure it's probably a good thing that you don't actually have to make that you don't have to think about that because it's not to say that you're a bad doctor if you fall right I think that's human or a man or a bad person yeah and it's harder for you guys because your procedural is yes you get judged on this you get judged on you know by the people like who write about medicine who like to sort of expose the surgeons is doing things that are unnecessary or the you know the fifty thousand dollar diabetic foot that was talked about with Obama I mean this stuff is just so crazy I mean the fact the matter is most if not the highest percentage of doctors are really looking out for the best interest of their patient but they're human like you said and they may be influenced by other factors that have nothing to do with the best interest of the patient one of the things about orthopaedics that I think actually makes it a little easier if done in the right setting I'm sure this was the case at HSS is it so multidisciplinary that you have these physiatrists who aren't getting paid to operate and yet there's still a part of the team that's sort of saying yeah you know this patient probably does do better with surgery not that this this guy yeah and so I don't know how prevalent that sort of that model is but

[01:34:55] I've been lucky every time I've been evaluated for a pretty what I consider at least significant orthopedic injury I've had the luxury of not just having to talk to a surgeon not that I can't talk to a surgeon but it's nice to be able to balance that with taking one layer of bias away I think that's a great point it's not easy to find though

[01:35:13] I mean a lot of people don't even know exactly like HSS is one of the places where you get lucky enough that you're going to be able to see a physiatrist yeah or non-operative sports medicine that's something that's been very prevalent you know labral injuries that a label injury crap I have a right shoulder labral tear that's you know I was weeks away from seeing all check for surgery at HSS what's happened with it so I was getting a massage with my body work guy and you know this thing had been dragging me down it's probably been five-year at four years from oh nine to about thirteen it was just getting worse and worse and it got to the point you know it started when I was swimming marathons and so it was anytime I swam longer than six hours the pain became really unbearable to which any person listen to this is like why are you what who cares right start swimming less than six hours okay but the point is it very quickly turned into if I swam two hours it hurt if it's when I'm one hour it hurt actually swimming just hurts constantly and you know you can do 50 pushups nope you can only do 30 push-ups no actually you can't do one pushup when it hit that point so that was four years after the initial injury I you know I thought okay well I gotta go do something about it so anyway so you and

[01:36:21] I spoke and you basically said look these are basically your two best guys in the country right the I forget the Neil I'll Jack and Jill our tribe yeah yeah I've forgot to mention that I'll check is also one of those mentors yeah yeah I mean a superb guy great surgeon well that's why ultimately I was gonna go see I'll check because and also because I'm in New York it was just easier to do so I'm seeing my guy and he's working on and he said you know I know you have a labral tear I mean I can read the MRI but he goes I don't think that's why you're I don't that's why you're in so much pain I actually think the pain is due to the fact that the labor hotel labral tear caused you to move differently and over the past four years you have changed the way you use this arm and now it's actually in your triceps your deltoids your subscapularis and your infraspinatus and he said you know the recovery from the labor all terror is gonna be brutal it's you're in a sling for six weeks you're not gonna be swimming for nine months I mean for you that's a big compromise he said I think in six months with manual therapy and Pt I can get you better and I said okay let's give it a try and within three months I was at 80% of baseline and today I would say it's hard to say I'm a hundred percent because I've also aged like I so you're dealing with the declining curve anyway but I there's really nothing I can't do anymore like including like any number of push-ups or you know sort of any activity I have to be careful with certain things so one thing I've learned how to do correctly is when I do pull-ups which I love doing I never do a full dead hang without a scapular retraction and so I'm always protecting my shoulder I don't do any overhead pressing activities I do a lot of static overhead stuff but yeah I consider that that along with the IT band injury I had that basically ended me from riding a bike in medical school and almost ended me from riding a bike a second time and

[01:38:09] I was again right ready to have surgery on my IT band before this same guy was like actually it's not really I mean yeah your IT band is jack but it's because you know the the real issue is your glute meet and your TfL aren't firing correctly and as a result of that your vastus lateralis and your quads are moving the IT band in an imbalanced way and there's the same thing I mean I think within two months I was better to have someone that skilled with evaluating balance and musculoskeletal balance they're few and far between I don't claim to be yeah these guys are guards and I'll tell you just to give you the flip side of that story of course this guy and now his protege you know really work with my patients and that's you know so what I basically do in my practice is try to find the people who are the best and just figure out a way to utilize all of their time you know close down the rest of their practice they now so so so Josh who now basically only sees my patients you know the flip side of that is I've sent patients there where after one appointment they say this guy needs a shoulder replacement like clear as day like I could I could sit here and take a lot of money from this guy for the next six months and do conservative therapy but it's not gonna work and so I've always appreciated people who had the ability from an out totally unbiased point of view and that's working against his phony best interest the other thing though that I will say against this and this is just kind of me on my soapbox about how I get a little pissed when people sort of say all surgeons are incentivized you know it's like you know when you're a hammer everything's a nail great surgeons aren't looking for business right like big it's a great rack Tichenor z' are so overbooked they don't have to do that so you know in the case of this guy his name is Brian Brian doesn't need any more patients so it's easy for him when I send him somebody who he thinks needs a sold replacement to say you need your shoulder replacement and similarly like I actually sent a patient up to Stanford recently to get an aorta root replacement in aortic valve and it was a huge operation and he was a little reluctant to do the surgery and he said you know I'm a little worried because the surgeon says I need this operation but you know he's a surgeon and I said let me give you a little secret about this surgeon he's God he he he has an infinite number of patients who need his help whether you are or are not one of them so I promise you this guy's he doesn't make one more or less dollar as a result of your existence the recommendation to have surgery is because of the physiology of your disease but that said I'm sympathetic to this and I think it's I don't have a good answer to it other than this sort of multidisciplinary approach I think there's something to be said when it's available to be able to be evaluated by more than one individual but that those individuals are working in your best interest not their own and that that doesn't grow on trees yeah again I'd like to think that most people in our profession are genuinely working in the best interest of their patients and again I think it's the overwhelming majority of physicians who do that at least in my experience here but there again like you've also mentioned there are some unforeseen influences or unrecognized influences that affect all of us because we are human and may be tainting our decisions in a way that may not be fully within the best interest of the patients so there are a lot of things in orthopedic surgery now that are quite popular and and they've become almost rampant and I don't have enough of a sense of their value so for example like PRP and stem cells like let's let's talk about PRP for a moment so maybe just explain for someone who's listening to this who hasn't heard of it what is it PRP is a super concentrated portion of your blood it's a platelet-rich plasma and the procedure itself is quite simple we basically take a needle put it in your vein take some blood out and then put that tube of blood into a centrifuge and the heavy portions of your blood go to the bottom the lighter portions go up top the platelet-rich plasma is typically in the middle and you take the platelet-rich plasma and you inject it into a knee a shoulder a tendon for healing purposes and the idea is that the platelets are rich in healing factors and veg F and platelet derived growth factors so that you can stimulate and accelerate vascular growth factors so another one of these growth factors that would promote growth so again the idea being that you can accelerate healing you can take the body's natural healing responses and and really supercharge them to some degree or super concentrate them to some degree so the studies about PRP are somewhat imperfect because there's there's so many different commercial preparations of PRP and there's sort of general categories there's leukocyte rich PRP so high in white count white cells is leukocyte poor those were deliberate design choices or those are yes methodology difference yes yes design choices and then again several different types of preparations for PRP so you're dealing with a very heterogeneous starting point and so one PRP injection doesn't isn't the equivalent of another

[01:42:52] PRP injection but it's hard to really know whether PRP is making a big difference in tendinopathy is most commonly it doesn't seem to be regrowing articular cartilage when you inject it into a knee or a shoulder or an ankle or hip it may be helping to stimulate tendon injury but that's a very hard endpoint to measure because most the time we're measuring pain and function with that and it might be getting better in the tendon because of the injection itself and the veg F and the and the platelet derived growth factors are doing exactly what you are hoping that they're doing or it might be because there's a placebo factor it might be because you're resting because it's pretty sore after you get one of these injections and you know again you don't really know the answer why but the site studies seem to demonstrate that PRP has a marginal benefit for tendinopathy so it's not a make-or-break which is why not everybody's running to get it which is why the insurance companies are typically in the pain and where point four tendinopathy is pain change and pain and function and the placebos used in these are what saline or they might be had to have a cortisone or they might be head-to-head with if you're doing an intra-articular injection with the visco supplements the the higher onic acid injections and each of these has their own limits too by the way never been efficacy one of the challenges with this space is it's so nascent and if I were gonna make the case that PRP is better than the studies led on and I'm not making that case because I actually don't know but if you if you believe that PRP is better than this studies suggest you'd probably also believe that the reason the studies are under finding benefit is that they're underpowered because of the heterogeneity and approach and the inconsistency in patient selection so I suspect that with all new procedures you know if you had a crystal ball and you could look into the future in a decade you'd say well actually we now know that like a third of the patients we did this on should have never had it and so now you've reduced your patient population to a more homogeneous because in medicine it all comes down to the more homogeneous the population you can treat and study the better your outcomes are going to be now in the end we're all heterogeneous oh yeah the better your outcomes will be but also the better your science will be yes whether the science will lead to a better a better inference about who to do it but so so it always makes me wonder like we're still in the Wild West of a lot of these things and I do wonder if you know will this stick around long enough to get rigorous enough to actually understand what are the patients that are best suited for this procedure and is there a way to standardize and optimize really the preparations and the technique and where do you think if one out of ten is when it's starting and 10 out of 10 is when it's fully dialed where are we probably 3 out of 10 and we're still I think there's a long way to go on the biologics but I mean they are the most promising intuitive Avenue to go down how do you think about it personally when you're treating patients so patients ask me every day about stem cells in therapy every single day and I think the issue with stem cells is that we don't know why it works for the people who it does work but it doesn't seem to be working because it's regrowing their cartilage so that's the big issue now it might be working as an anti-inflammatory it might be working as a placebo and it turns out as you're aware the sort of the bigger the procedure the better the placebo effect so the more you're digging the more you're extracting you are harnessing a larger placebo effect what is the placebo effect with that procedure is it viewed as about 15 percent benefit that's the all in typical placebo benefit yeah I couldn't give you the number I actually don't know the number but I think with stem cells there is a lot of promise and I hope it works because I'm gonna need it myself and well I'll need it but right now there are people who I think are particularly in the orthopedic form are taking advantage of the fact that we don't have great treatments for arthritis we don't have any reversal for arthritis we have ways of managing arthritis and maybe slowing down the pace of worsening arthritis but we don't have anything that reverses the course of arthritis that turns your older knee into a younger knee your older hip into a younger hip and the stem cells seems to be that sort of molecular Fountain of

[01:47:09] Youth that people have glommed onto they have this idea that they can regenerate their hip they can grow their native hip back to what it was when they were 20 and a lot of it there is promise and this there's no question that there's promise in it and the animal studies really demonstrate it but for instance there's a local group that's doing stem cell injections here where they take a bone marrow biopsy bone marrow aspirate from your posterior iliac crest they take a slurry of fat from under it from your abdomen they take some pure up here from your arm they put it together and they inject it and they charge five to six thousand dollars per for this procedure cash and talk about incentives

[01:47:46] I mean they're highly incentivized to do this and they will have patients come back to them saying I feel better but again there's no rigor are they feeling better because of a placebo effect are they feeling better because there's an anti-inflammatory effect which you can get with cortisone for 25 bucks or you know what what's really deal but I don't think it's the cartilage we're growing and when they do those injections those preparations for putting a couple hundred stem cells in the studies that showed some benefit in rats and small animals it's about 10 to 20 million so you know we're orders of magnitude yeah we're orders of magnitude off and so I and this is one story I do tell my patients as well I had a woman who said

[01:48:23] I went to a stem-cell talk they offered a free steak dinner and I listened to the talk and I decided to sign up for it and I ended up paying $13,000 for three stem cell injections for the steak exactly I'm like how do you feel look I feel a little better he's just like what do you think and I didn't have the heart to tell her like you said that she paid $13,000 for a steak dinner thirteen thousand or 1313 thousand now for three stem cell injections so these price tags that come with it are so exorbitant and I think there's some exploitation that's going on because again we don't have the solutions and it doesn't take a lot of anecdotes out in the community yeah I got this I feel a little bit better I feel better I can do things I couldn't do and that's all great but we don't know why you can't do the things that why you now can do the things you couldn't do is it because the stem cell is doing what is being advertised growing new cartilage or is it because of an anti-inflammatory effect or a placebo effect are there randomized trials going on look sure those yeah and most of the time they show some clinical subjective benefit but you again not a single radiograph or MRI showing rested reconstituted cartilage and that's with not just PRP but stem cells exclusively correct there are RCTs that are ongoing there are random randomized controlled trials now the randomization process might be a little bit well because I mean this is the exact reason you actually have to have double blinding yes so you these have to be complicated trials yes you're not doing this again there's nothing that's come through that says we should be doing this at this point I struggled with this I get a lot of patients that ask me about this and

[01:49:53] I've had probably half a dozen patients that have had it done and swear by it and sort of like you I have a hard time sort of having a straight conversation with them because deep down I sort of think it's [ __ ] frankly but I but at the same time I'd like to think I have the humility to say I have no clue and my first question is is it doing harm and I say that specifically with the IV stem cells so that's the one that I'm most most skeptical so question one is what's the probability of harm and let's bracket harm as physical harm financial harm like let's actually break this thing out and then we talk efficacy in other words you want to think about it through the wid through the lens that you would think of drug development phase one safety phase two efficacy phase three effectiveness I don't know I hope that that level of rigor is being applied to this because I do feel really bad like again I don't know how wealthy your patient was that about the thirteen thousand dollar stake but boy that would break my heart to think that that was a meaningful chunk of change to her yeah and and in her case she didn't get a big benefit she felt a little bit better and she had a problem that pretty clear that it's a surgical issue it's a surgical issue so but she doesn't want anymore surgery she really wants to try everything prior to surgery and so again the do no harm part is yeah again I don't discourage when people ask I just try to steer them towards one of the academic medical centers where they are doing trials so that yes they may get a placebo yes they may get the stem cell but they won't get fleeced and eventually they will get an answer whether or not this is effective you know when we talk about placebo effects in particularly on orthopedics there was a recent paper published in the British JD's yes I think it was regarding subacromial decompression which is a very common procedure used for shoulder pain for shoulder tendinitis and impingement and for patients who don't have rotator cuff tearing but have to shoulder dysfunction and pain traditionally subacromial decompressions have been a procedure of choice where you shave a little bit of the under surface of the acromion remove the bursa and allow for more space for the rotator cuff to move and it generally leads to pretty good outcome as the results of the surgery seem to be pretty good well I was having dinner with a law professor at University of

[01:52:01] Chicago Todd Henderson and the paper that was done looked at subacromial decompression versus sham surgery and there was no difference between the channels people would have sham surgery yeah you make the incisions you don't do anything so and you blind it to the to the so it's a single blind obviously the surgeon can't be blinded to a shame sir correct and all the therapists and the patient so everyone downstream from the operating room is blinded and the results were the same between a sham surgery and the decompression which would speak to you know the decompression being worthless except that both groups got better and so when both groups get better his argument was the only ethical thing you can do as a surgeon is to offer the Sham surgery the problem is if you offer it as a sham you might lose the benefit right so you can't do that but then you are duping the patient taking them to an operating room for what they consider to be a procedure that's a procedure when in fact unless you explain to them that look the reason we would explain the equivalence of the Sham to the procedure is the post-operative care that you got it's the PT it's the or it's some combination of the rest the post port the for stress from the first arrest and the forced PT because you're gonna take PT way more seriously when you're in a sling and you've had surgery right but then so I will say that the patients sometimes with meniscal injuries say let's cut out the middleman it's probably the rest in the therapy that's helping is someone we do that but you are also withdrawing the possible effect of the procedure and the what seems to be a placebo effect now I

[01:53:36] I do subacromial decompressions I've done them and I probably will still do them because I ia yet the science that's a reasonable study of randomizing patients and finding that much of a difference and so and these studies have been done with an S better did the patients get do you recall what the absolute improvement I don't know the absolute improvements I don't recall cuz that's the other thing that kind of has to be weighed into these things I mean people who was most podcast have heard me sort of rant about the difference between absolute and relative improvements and those things have to be well they're out there relative improvements by definition when you're doing shoulder surgery but it is it look

[01:54:09] I again yeah I thought that was a very interesting point the the most ethical thing you can do that's the Sham surgery let's talk about what I consider the elephant in the room when it comes to orthopedic injuries which has lower back injuries I you I don't you probably remember what happened to me in math I totally remember what happened to you you had a that a cauda equina yeah I mean I had that free fragment the l5 s1 free fragment stuck in the canal I mean the whole thing was a disaster I hate even talking and then you got infected afterwards too right I did have a little infection after the bigger issue is that he robbed her on the wrong side the first procedure he went he would you know laughs I know that was or he yeah it was the left side injury that a right-sided decompression and DHing the right side of nerve so I came out with a right-sided foot drop even though I went in with a left-sided injury I didn't know that yeah yeah and had a bunch of redos so it's something that's near and dear to my heart for personal reasons because I spent basically a year of my life recovering from the back injury three months of which I was debilitated meaning I was I couldn't move my mom had to fly down from Toronto to feed me I mean literally I couldn't even make a meal and you know my roommate mat was like you know he's still a med student it's not like you know like I said they're gonna feed me in white my ass so yeah I'm still partially sort of traumatized I think from that but also I now realize that it was and I've talked about this in the past it was the best worst thing that ever happen right it was the worst thing they were having because it's just a year of being hooked on opiates and all this other crap that comes with it but it's also where you learn how to move again and in many ways I think I feel very fortunate now that that happened to me when I was 27 45 today never really had a back issue ever since because it hurt for so long I learned how to redo everything that you wouldn't be able to relearn if you only had two weeks or a month of pain so for example like I learned how to sneeze while protecting my back I learned how to brush my teeth while bracing myself over the counter so that

[01:56:04] I'm not just completely placing you know a torque on my lower back by bending forward like little things I remember a friend of mine was over at my house and I was putting the dishes away and I put a fork in the thing and I did a squat to bend down to put the fork in and he's like dude what's wrong is your back hurting and I was like no it's exactly the opposite my back doesn't hurt because I do this because I never get caught picking up that piece of paper because so many people when they throw their back out quote-unquote throw their back out it's usually the tiniest insult that does it it's not always the while I was doing there the 400 pound deadlift right so that said you can't go far in life without running into a friend a family member a patient who's who's really suffering from lower back pain and I gotta say I'm not convinced that surgery is there are clearly some amazing cases I've seen some spinal stenosis these cases that you know the moment this patient comes out of surgery it's like it's changed their life but more often than not I want to say and maybe I'm biased in my sampling patients probably would get better without doing you know a lumbar diskectomy for example but again that's now me speaking with a bias I curious as to your thoughts on this even though I know you focus on joints and within the field of orthopedic surgery this is sort of like it's a subspecialty of spine but but you know look you're you know more than I do so that's you kind of go if you go to an ophthalmology conference and you ask how many people do lasik most of the hands go up in the air and then how many would happen on themselves most of the hands go down if you go to an orthopedic conference and ask how many people have done or would or have done spine surgery and we've all done it and we raise our hands how many people would have it on themselves and the hands go down because we see some of the very poor outcomes that can happen with spine surgery and the difficulty that people can have with it and low back pain is ubiquitous it's the number one reason people go to the doctor not the orthopedist but the doctor and I didn't realize that yeah so it's the number one reason and so when people have low back issues there may be mechanical issues like you mentioned a slipped disc which the majority will resolve with time but when patients have neurologic compromised weakness there tends to be a greater urgency to do something about it especially cervical right crack and because it can affect you know people's balance people ability to walk not just their hands and I can show you I will show you my friend Nick

[01:58:27] Oregon moved to London and he was new to the area new to the healthcare system and he calls me out of the blue he's like hey I had and that's what you know they had I got a little problem here and I I got this this disc and they're telling me not to fly anywhere not to go anywhere and have surgery on Monday so I asked Nick to send me the worst picture on the MRI that he could see and he sends me the picture and he has this massive disc herniation with signal within the spinal cord called Milo

[01:58:56] Malaysia which means that he's getting injury to his spinal cord and we'll lose neurologic function in short order and I said to Nick Nick do not fly like they told you do not go anywhere you go into surgery when they tell you to and then sooner the better and he underwent a successful cervical decompression infusion and he had a vertebrate to me at the time and a big graft and those type of spine surgeries are life altering and life saving and there are other spine surgeries where the problem isn't so dramatic but the intervention is so dramatic and you've mentioned this to me before you sort of introduced me to the concept of asymmetric risk where you know when people are functioning 70 percent and you do something as dramatic as a spine operation you could take someone from 70% to 90% but you could also take someone from 70% to 20% you can really drop them out with a spying operation and because it's your core it's your it's your axial skeleton and if things go awry there they go arrive for your entire body if I have a shoulder surgery where I'm trying to take someone who's 80% functional and make them as close to 100% as I can I'm probably knock them down to 20% and and so again they anything they'll be a little bit worse or the same but it's rare for when you're working on the extremities to take someone way way down like that Ken but it's rarer the spine it seems to happen more frequently and again you're taking people who are reasonably functional but not happy happily functional and trying to make them better and in the instances where you don't you can make them all hell of a lot worse and it's kind of why I think joint replacement is such a successful subspecialty in orthopedics you have people who are 20 to 30% functional they can't walk more than four or five blocks without pain they've pain all day long while they're sitting make an untimed flama Tories are working their life is completely dominated by their hip or their knee pain and you do a joint replacement and you make them 70% functional and they're the happiest people you're gonna meet because you make a man from 20% functional to 70% functional and you have an incredibly wide margin to improve them if you're in sports medicine where people are about 85% functional I mean you could do everything except swim and do push-ups but you could everything else in your life without pain and you're taking someone who's 80 to 85 percent functional you're working with a very small margin and so it's a harder it's harder to get the satisfaction that you can get there's just there's so much more downside than upside there's the potential but again because with the work that sports medicine surgeons do you rarely make someone from 80% to 20% yet in the spine because it's the spine you can take someone from 80% way down so I think that's a not sure if that's making sense I don't it does make sense what what can people do you know obviously like you're my go-to guy for any orthopedic question like I'm always calling you and I'm always sending you

[02:01:55] MRIs on my patients and stuff like that and you're always like okay well what city is this person in and you're always a phone call away from like the best person in that city or if they're willing to go see the best person period in that one case we got really lucky that person had a foot injury needed an ankle replacement and the best guy in the country happened to be one of your partner's silence that's really nice but you know your connections through HSS has always been great but but the average person listening to this doesn't get to call you up and doesn't get to say Eric here's my MRI tell me what to do so it's hard to ask because if it's anybody that is your friend or family you're gonna be able to do this for them but if there's someone you can't help but you want to give them sort of the guiding principles of how should they be screening orthopedic surgeons what questions should they be asking before some of the more common procedures how would you navigate them well I think you alluded to it earlier with your friend who you know doesn't need the business or that patient was having the Arctic route replacement volume does speak volumes I mean when surgeons have high volumes that's probably a generally a good sign now there are some surgeons or buy volumes because they're scoping for dollars or doing other things but in general it's a reasonable rule of thumb that they have a good volume so let's talk about a couple procedures if you're getting your knee replaced how you know

[02:03:08] I and I this is how when we were trying to find the best surgeon to do my friend's aorta this was a big question right it's like you don't want someone who's doing one of these a month so with a knee replacement what do you consider the volume number above what boy would want it to be 200 for a week somewhere in that in range high volume is considered by the way greater than 30 in some of those studies which is once every other week but the high really high volume guys are doing several a day

[02:03:35] Wow and so saying so someone who's doing four of these a week 200 a year that's basically that should be all they're doing pretty much right they'll be doing that and hip replacement you know between 4 to 600 surgeries a year that's an incredibly high volume surgeon those are the HSS type numbers yeah you know though those are the people who are gonna be really at the top of the game again and that already introduces something interesting you said if studies are considering anybody over 30 to be high volume you've already seen a great heterogeneity now in the studies right because there's a huge spread between 30 and 400 yeah right so but I think the volume of cases that are done obviously just asking around and seeing what other people's outcomes have been have been really helpful and you want to pick a surgeon who's not going to run from there complications because we're all gonna have complications and again human nature does play a role and you know no certain likes complications it's you don't feel good about yourself when your patient has a complication it is one of the most interesting dynamics between a patient and a physician because the patient feels horrible because there's been a complication the physician feels horrible because if they're even remotely honest with themselves they realize that something whether it was a really their fault or some combination of things something that they did led to this and yet the natural tendency is to run not because you want to abandon the patient but because you can't stand facing the fact that this happened well there's a shame that's involved I mean when you have a complication you definitely feel completely responsible for it and you know that [ __ ] happens things happen but you feel responsible is it is your fault I mean you can't get around that and you sometimes want to cower away from it and that is your first instinct to some degree to just you know bow away from it but obviously when you're choosing a surgeon everyone's had complications and the surgeon you want to have is someone who steps up when there is a complication you know we've always been taught you know keep your patients close and your complications closer and and and I try and do that I mean I've had patients who've had infections I've had patients who've had outcomes that weren't expected and they're the ones that I obviously remember the most I can't help but there's an emotional component to it but I try and be available in every possible way that I can be both emotionally being able to just call me text me directly and I don't like to put barriers between my patients in the beginning but for anybody who's had a complication I try to create zero barriers I try to make it as seamless as possible so you want you want to have a surgeon who has a reputation of you know being someone who will deal with complications and I don't know how you find that otherwise I were to say because there's really those are two interesting traits right well you're not gonna advertise your complications right yeah and it's something I think that patients have a hard time asking physicians about I don't have a hard time you know if I'm when I'm talking to the cardiac surgeon who was gonna operate on my friend I didn't have a hard time saying all right let's talk about the complications like how many of your patients get a fib after surgery how many rebleed how many reduced boo-boo-boo-boo-boo your 30-day mortality but you know I came from that world so I can talk in those terms but for patients is it okay to just say hey what's your infection rate what's your reoperation boom boom I think you absolutely should do that I mean and then a surgeon who can't answer those or doesn't want to that's probably a harbinger of something worse I agree I think most people worth their salt welcome those questions or happy to answer them a surgeon who welcomes the second opinion yep please by all means I think that's someone that you know you don't want someone like I shied away from having a second opinion I think that's a red flag for sure so volume the humility to answer questions about complications the willingness to participate and have second opinions I mean those are three pretty good rules of thumb yeah I mean generally someone who's embracing those is concerned more about your best interest than anything else is a concern about themselves and it's more concerned about your outcome your best interest but it looked choosing a surgeon is really difficult there's no metric I mean you can go onto health grades and you'll see some of the people that when we're in the know who we see operate who have great outcomes who are gifted surgeons have terrible health grade I feel like health grades should be taken away I got to be honest with you I think there is no benefit to that service and I and I don't say that disparagingly about health grades because I think they're doing anything wrong I think it's a beautiful idea I'm not sure it translates into directing people to the people that they salute literally does not it is a collection you know you're just going to it's a bunch of extreme selection yes great way of putting it and it's like well my kids are huge fans of South Park and it reminds me of the

[02:08:03] Alper special episode but I know yeah well we'll link to that I'm sure you should it's unbelievable but it's an imperfect there's no perfect metric for who's the best doctor there's just like you know Tom Brady is drafted in the sixth round of the NFL and there are a lot of metrics for measuring athletic performance of how these guys are going to do and 32 teams made the same mistake six times over when Tom Brady was drafted 199 and they have 40 yard times they have tons of film they have you know pretty much every metric you could why and they still don't get it now let's take that in the medical world where you don't have 40 times you don't have how many times you can bench you don't have any game film and it's in the best of circumstances it's incredibly difficult to measure elite performance and or predict elite performance and then you throw something in as complex of the medical world it's even more difficult so it's very hard for patients to figure out how to select the best surgeon but then ultimately it comes down to trust I mean I think again there's a big trust element and you have to trust that that person sitting across from you who is proposing to do a procedure that's quite invasive that you trust that they have your best interest that they're gonna do a good job for you that they're gonna be there when you need them and and so there's a lot of intuition that goes into it I know that you're one of those surgeons who doesn't shy away from the complications and of course the irony of it is being so good you have fewer of those complications but then you're kind of all in when they're there I'm guessing the toughest complications are the ones where they're occurring in people who have lost a non-trivial amount of function when it's all said and done meaning you know it's one thing if you know god forbid you have an infection and that means there's an extra two weeks where you need an antibiotic and you have to be an inpatient and there's a bunch of inconvenience but in the long run it's gonna be the way it was before or better but have you had those complications where either through the complication or just the bad luck of the disease they're worse than when this they're worse than when they started yeah and they can't do something that they could once do before yes and it's very difficult and it kind of leads into something that I wanted to speak with you about and the idea of coping and from the surgeon standpoint when you have people have complications you still have the next person who needs a similar procedure and you have to be able to cope with the fact that you had a complication in one patient and move on to the next and do the best you can for them because you feel it's the right thing and that's not easy to do at all for a patient who has a complication that has left them with the deficit coping becomes a big part of it our role as physicians is to help patients adapt and cope with their new reality and helping patients focus on what they're able to do as post what they are unable to do is a big part of helping them cope and if you can change the mindset hey from I know

[02:11:06] Larkin can do this because of the complication I no longer can do that from because of the complication to I'm still capable of doing this I want to do this can I do this more of a again focus on what you're capable of doing as opposed to incapable then I think you can help patients adapt to a new reality that again there's a better acceptance and a better way of coping and it's not just complications it's sometimes even without a complication you know the natural history yeah the natural history of the disease yeah the natural history can be just on a downslope and and again trying to help patients cope with that limitation and I again I think it's so critical to help people focus on what they're capable of doing as opposed to incapable what they still have ahead of them as opposed to what they've lost from behind and again it's very difficult I mean I've been it you've been in that situation when you've been laid up and thinking about all the things you were unable to do and now what you were able to recapture but some people don't recapture but still have to look forward to what they're what they can do and I kind of was exposed to this coping idea through the care of a family member who has a form of cancer that requires ongoing treatment and this family member through this illness I was exposed to a physician at dana-farber one of the leading cancer centers who's a breast oncologist Eric Wyner and dr. Wyner was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement

[02:12:32] Award in breast cancer treatment and he gave a lecture it's the mcguire memorial lecture in san antonio in 2016 I believe 2016 December of 2016 and he talks about the state of breast cancer and research and developments and reasons for hope and reasons for optimism but he also for the last 15 minutes he tells a very personal story about his own interactions with medicine and and what he feels his primary role is as a physician and fundamentally believes it's our role to help patients cope whether it's with an illness whether it's with an injury whether it's with a psychological it's about coping and helping patients manage and helping them continue to live their lives so that they focus on what they're capable of doing again he delivers it's such a powerful and I don't want to spoil it I really want people to listen to this I think everybody who wants to be a physician or is a physician should listen to it I think anybody who's receiving medical care has an ongoing issue should listen to this it's an incredibly inspiring message that he gives and again his own personal example is it's just it's tremendous and his message is spot-on and so I see many patients who are in need purgatory I call it who aren't ready for joint replacement who don't have a bad enough well aren't at that twenty to thirty percent point of dysfunction that they would benefit from a knee replacement if they're sort of sixty percent functional and you give them a knee replacement there's seventy percent functional they're not typically happy with that because they have to go through hell to get it so in that knee purgatory sort of sixty to seventy percent functional where we don't have a lot of options it really is the emphasis on treatment and management is on coping let's take an example of that so the athlete who's in need purgatory probably can't run anymore yeah well like the athlete usually isn't in need purgatory it's usually someone my age or above is in need purgatory with a degenerative case right I'm so used to calling patients athletes because I try to get this idea of like everyone's an athlete like you're an athlete when you're 90 you're a thief or a light but yeah I see your point okay so this person could be a 45 year old who's been athletic and all of a sudden now she just can't run anymore like she you know if she used to be able to run marathons and now the 5k trot with her daughter at school she'll an unbearable right and then we don't have a lot of treatment options for that person surgically and there are forty five years old so you want to get under 55 or 65 as we talked about earlier already you know I want to get them to a hundred no but yeah you want to get them to there to do the joint replace correct the long long view think

[02:15:08] I don't know hundred we want to get out to 100 and still mowing the lawn right so coping is somewhat of managing the expectations of what you will be capable of doing but also not setting limits allowing patients to try the running and allow sort of the joint or their problem to limit them as opposed to you imposing any artificial limits on them so I draw a graph where I talk about thresholds and and you know above this threshold if you're developing pain or swelling and below the threshold you're not you want to be up against that threshold with your activity level as much as you can be and you can modulate your threshold you can strengthen your leg you can lose weight even the person who weighs 100 pounds loses five pounds is gonna benefit from weight loss if they have a painful or extremity joint well it seems

[02:15:52] I'm glad you bring that up because I was gonna ask you about that and we got off and I forgot about it so even me you know I'm not overweight but if I lost 10 pounds presumably it's gonna be a little easier for me yeah things will feel better and I feel the same thing I know when my knee I almost know my weight by the pain of my knee I can gauge it that precisely because I know what weight I feel good and don't have pain and what weight I don't but there's typically a threshold it's kind of a binary issue and so again I try and get people to do what they can and then let them know that they can modulate that threshold through effort I mean really through strengthening through weight management and through education and the more you learn about your condition your illness your injury the better you'll be able to cope with it period and what are some of those things that you will recommend to those person so you know that 45 year old mother who's a star athlete gray runner you know probably played tennis in college whatever do you say if they keep hitting that threshold so often do you just say look I want you to try swimming or bite of course yeah yeah yeah and again if people are focusing what

[02:16:56] I'm what they can do versus what they can't do so if she's focused on what okay I can swim and I can bike is supposed to I can't run anymore that mindset makes a huge difference in managing that and coping with that and so helping to cultivate that mindset is a big role of what we do in in terms of again helping patients cope it's not a biologic it's not an injection it's not a cure it's not a Jetsons approach to good health being able to take this pill and you're okay or take this injection you're okay and we're not pursuing the molecular Fountain of Youth through this approach but on the other hand you can help people still live better and move better if you can focus on what you're capable of doing as opposed to what your lost yeah and this could be especially valuable if by switching to a different track you can slow the decline you know one of the fears that I have in the in that type of a patient is they stopped running because it just becomes simply too difficult but they don't replace it with something else and all of a sudden they have a really precipitous decline in their physical quality of life now look for a 45 year old to get sedentary doesn't mean that much but by the time they're 65 the difference between them having pivoted to a new sport or having done nothing becomes enormous especially for that woman because in five years she's gonna go through menopause and she's gonna have another accelerator thrown onto it and and you know these are the things that really this is the problem that keeps me up at night you know I was leaving my building the other day this in New York and I came out and I saw a guy who you know I recognize because he's in the building and he was in one of those sort of motorized scooters and I was just coming back from the gym and I was sort of running up the stairs because I live on the you know whatever fourth floor and there's a part of me that kind of felt guilty I was like god I can't believe like there's ever a day that I [ __ ] about anything when I just ran past a dude in his motorized scooter and ran up the stairs and I thought you know he didn't look that old probably 75 truthfully you know maybe 80 but look in today's world I you know that's just not that old and yet he you know he has to get a doorman to hold the door open he can't go through the revolving door not that going through a revolving door matters but the point is like I thought boy once once you get to that point like what would you give to go back in time if somebody says look man go back to when you're 45 and do these seven things different you'll be on a different trajectory there and I wonder how much of it is this this adaptability that you talk about which is hey you can't run great you're gonna learn how to ride a bike can't do that that's fine you're gonna learn to do X Y or Z or even again changing the technique oh you're on call right right and so whether it's barefoot running or getting an analysis of some sort getting lighter on your feet taking shorter strides I mean whatever it is they don't lose 20 pounds and right now and so aging is such a big part of what we treat in orthopedics and we do a tremendous job with with traumatic injuries and the traumatic injuries that don't involve the joints again we do a terrific job with those we can realign the bone we can get the bone to heal we can get people's function restored the injuries that involve the joints specifically into you know into the intra articular portion of the knee or the hip the ankle or any other joints and we have a much harder time and those are the injuries that linger for a lifetime so a long bone fracture in the middle of femur you'll pretty much recover from her in the middle of your tibia you'll pretty much recover from and not have much of a deficit if any but the moment you have an intra-articular injury to the joint it puts you on a different trajectory and and how to sort of manage that trajectory and keep it as close to what it would have been had you not been injured is obviously one of the goals and difficult to do but then also when that trajectory prevents people from doing what they want to do having them focus on what they're still capable of doing I think will help them cope because if they keep thinking about the trajectory they were on and compare that that the trajectory that they were on to the trajectory that they are currently on that can be a tremendous source of frustration and so in the end if they can just focus where they are and realize what they're capable of doing I think that's a big part of just preserving health and that fall must be you know bringing it back full circle to be guys in the NFL that you worked with that's got to be one of the greatest deltas between the former track of performance and the current track when these guys retire well you see all those horrible videos of like girl Campbell and these tremendous athletes who are aging so prematurely and so difficulty and they really have no quality of life and they and and but you ask them if they do it all over again the majority will say yes yeah it's so funny I was I was actually just thinking about that today on a totally different tangent but I was in my hotel and there was a silent auction going on and it was a picture of

[02:21:54] Muhammad Ali with the Beatles and you know I'm a big boxing fan and I remember I was up so I thought my lobby I'm shaving and I want to look good for you do thank you and I remember thinking to myself God you know from night about 1960 to 1980 Muhammad Ali had about the most recognizable face on earth you could argue that no athlete existed on a larger stage than Muhammad Ali in those two decades and yet he many ways he died very prematurely I mean he died you know a few years ago but given how magnificent his star was all that he could have continued to have done you know his quality of life really began to decline precipitously in the mid-80s and

[02:22:36] I remember thinking to myself like so he was at his best from age you know 18 to 38 if someone waved a magic wand and said to me you could have that life from age 18 to 38 but then it's gonna be a pretty quick decline would you take it I guess for me the answer is no but I realized that having never been there I don't know what that high would actually be like but I I think I'm just such a conservative person who's mostly optimizing on the back end of life perhaps that's wrong but it gave me a great sense of sadness to think about what would it have felt like to have been Muhammad Ali when you were 60 and to realize that you were once the most gifted physical specimen that ever walked the face of the earth and now you know you couldn't tie your shoes and similarly as you said you look at these guys who are in their mid 50s who were an enormous part of our lives growing up watching football and now even ignoring the CTE issue which is its own separate tragedy but just the orthopedic injury that I don't think gets enough attention

[02:23:38] I mean I think CTE is very important time so I mean nothing makes me happier than to see the attention that is getting but we don't see a lot of these guys whose brains are intact but whose bodies are destroyed yeah and look I never had a brightly lit star like that but I played sports and I had a great time doing it but I'm carrying around the injuries now that I sustained then that aren't going to go away and affected my quality of life and what I'm capable of doing but I can't dwell on what I wish I could be doing at age 50 I have to really focus on what I'm capable of doing now and maximizing it and in essence not giving a [ __ ] what gave up and I have to say I even for the for the sort of small-time you know good times that I had with athletics and where it's left me now I still want to trade it and this is like the small-time stuff because I said let me do a group of friends and long list the memories that I wouldn't really trade for anything so I guess I would still make that deal you know if I could take back that one cut that tore my ACL if I could take that that that one you know jump that tore my rotator cuff I mean sure I would do it but if I had to give up everything else so I wasn't exposed to that risk to do I don't think

[02:24:49] I'd do it and so it's a great question that you ask I mean I always admire the way you ask questions you ask the best questions I'm at one time you asked I wonder what the first human being thought when they ate an avocado you and Lynn were talking about health and I think Lynn was talking about some of the community health projects that she's doing huh and you said yeah you know I often think about what the first human must have thought when he ate an avocado

[02:25:22] I'm like [ __ ] thinks of these questions but they serve these are great questions and I actually just said this to my kids I was like hey the people really make the world different aren't the people with all the answers that the people with the questions so you know think think about some things that you know how can I change is what why does it work this way if you're asking the right questions you'll be making a difference it's not necessarily that you have to have the right answers you always says speaking of questions I will wrap this up because I'm really excited that tonight is my first Yom Kippur break fast I only had a handful of these to by the way when you told me that I had the opportunity to join you for that tonight

[02:26:03] I I stopped eating a day and a half ago in anticipation is so normally I would easily go 18 24 hours without eating but this time I'm going 36 hours because I just can't wait do I get to wear a yarmulke by the way or is that not cool you know this is an ngon yarmulke Yom Kippur it's a pretty low-key it's my in-laws were terrific it's one of their very close friends and

[02:26:25] Lynn and I have become friends with and she's been hosting it for the last I think eight nine years that we've been do they know I'm coming they do know you're coming right I did send an email saying I know if this is not my place to invite a buddy but can I write about it she's like of course she's gonna awesome she's great you'll enjoy it the and I I'm gonna enjoy this the first time I've actually fasted for Yom Kippur and I haven't eaten since you know 6 o'clock last night which is a new for me fantastic isn't amazing it works yeah it does I feel pretty good evolution at its finest last thing before we go you alluded to it earlier and it's I can't believe we haven't given more lip service to it during this discussion but you introduced me to probably one of the three most important sort of parlor tricks of my life which are the doctor bucks so how did you and by the way just for the listener and we're gonna link to it of course it's dr. buck bu KK in medical school you were walking around with the buck original I became pretty obsessed by the time I was in residency I had at least five I had the buck original had the cowcatcher

[02:27:24] I had the speed teeth I still remember all of these things I only I think I had the gnarliest but my Owen our Undersecretary of Defense was the one who introduced me to the buck teeth and I wish I could say come up with it but Owen was the one who introduced me to and the memory had to bite in the styrofoam cup oh my god photocopy it send it to him and then you get a bead and then you get your pair of box and back then like they were 40 bucks I don't know what they cost today but at that time for me to go massive change huge chunk of yes I was dropping because I'd be buying multiple copies of these like I wanted at least you know two of each of them because I wanted to keep them everywhere and I don't know if you know this story but when I got to residency it's kind of a ridiculous story makes me sound like I'm more of an idiot than I am I would wear the Bucs everywhere and I had convinced the entire pediatric tower at Hopkins which is called CMC that there were two

[02:28:22] Doctorate Ian's and we were twins and when we were kids our parents want us to get braces but Peter me I did and my brother I forget what his name was Patrick he didn't were identical twins were the same in every way were both now doctors at Hopkins but when you page dr. Tiye you got to be careful because you don't know which ones coming it could be the good teeth or the bad teeth one and I was so egregious in my desire to do social experiments with these things that like the day I got to Hopkins when we were doing orientation and filling out our forms I found the dental clinic and I went in with my teeth and I said hey I just hi my name is Peter TIA I'm the new dental fellow did you guys get my records and you cannot believe the discomfort in that room since they're so real right like they're so like if you're listening to this and you are even half curious what we're talking to sight-unseen just go buy a bunch of bucks and I don't think you could be more amused for 40 bucks now so you remember Ellen from medical school yeah so she had a faux pas party and you might have been there

[02:29:30] I don't know if I can't remember I might have been I must have been to inebriate yes so I had the bucks in my pocket and I show up at her faux pas party and she's there with Lal and we're in their kitchen night take the milk out of the refrigerator start drinking from it put the milk back I lift up my leg I let one rip and anyone goes it's a fashion faux pas party so anyway I had my bucks in later on and I was I was talking to someone and I you know when you when you flash the smile you have to keep your lips pursed but don't you flash the smile look on people's faces is priceless and you taught me the look yeah you just it's it's this sort of shy coy yeah then you flash those teeth and oh my god oh and Tommy the look I have to say he's sort of the buck master and then when I would take a bite out of something like a piece of the ham I purposely have pain Oh God and you know oh you okay oh I'm okay and so Lynn was at the party and she goes out Christ she goes she goes I overheard someone say yeah yeah I saw him and he seemed okay but then he smiles oh that's not the worst of it he's at the dental school so

[02:30:43] I got to the point where I would wear these there was probably a three year period where I wasn't not wearing them I couldn't go more than 12 hours without putting them on and it drove everybody in my life nuts yeah because the very first time I met my wife's father and grandmother and brother and sister was at like Easter you know one year right or whatever like after we've been dating for six months or something like that and as we're driving over there she's begging me she says please Peter I know you want to put the teeth in but just don't I was like look Jill you gotta let me be me you gotta let me be me I gotta put the teeth in and she's just she's like fine I'm not even gonna I'm not even to acknowledge it so we get there put the teeth in and her dad is a really shy he can't make eye contact with me like he gets one glimpse to this and he is in pure discomfort no he's just uh you know like not looking me in the eye and trying to talk to me and it's super awkward so we're sitting down to dinner they're still in and it's artichoke is the epitaxy and her grandmother's legendary Italian grandmother makes these amazing artichokes and she's unfazed by my stuff ooh Nuri she just she just it hasn't registered that it is that unusual and so she picks up a big leaf off the artichoke and she goes look

[02:32:00] Peter this is how you do it I got it okay let me do that and I and her dad at this point is under like he's beside himself in discomfort I have a joke contain it like spill the beans well cuz but that's what we've been dating six months she had seen every minute of it every day like she just liked it this was like it was more just annoyance with this and then her brother figures it out and he can't take so he gets up and walks away and he's laughing and then finally like I come Ida says look she pulls me aside and she goes you're not leaving here without coming clean so you can do it on your own terms but you're coming clean before we leave so I do and her grandmother says what everybody has said when I come clean which is yeah we couldn't understand how your parents had the money to help you go to college and loss or whatever medical school but you never got braces okay it makes member

[02:32:57] Carlos Rivera oh yeah I had put the bucks in when he was my chief resident at UCSF we were rounding in the ICU and I was presenting a patient and he thought he was in town a couple like two years ago and he was telling the story he goes dude I was looking at you with those [ __ ] teeth and I'm trying to remember what you're saying about this patient but I'm just focused on your [ __ ] teeth I'm like what's wrong with this guy anyway I used to be they are an incredible incredible device yeah yeah and so I remember when I was interviewing for residency because that's at the time that most I'd ever flown in my life because you were doing a you know a round trip every weekend basically and I it wasn't purely randomized but I would just decide on one leg of the trip with the teeth one leg of the trip without the teeth and I wanted to know how I was treated differently and I gotta tell you I was treated differently when I walk around without the teeth the flight attendant was nice to me and she wanted to talk to me and blah blah blah when I had the teeth in nobody everyone was so uncomfortable around me and I felt like a second-class citizen well again you asked all the good questions what's life like with the teeth we should do a second podcast just on the teeth yeah we should do it a video podcast yeah yeah for sure I also

[02:34:15] I would get to the point where I liked the way I talked with the teeth because you have you at you you get a different talk you sort of have a funnier way of talking we love ya your asses are a little bit more prolonged yeah work around yeah yeah yeah and it got to the point where in residency I would wear them during surgery under my mask even though nobody could see it just because

[02:34:34] I liked the way I talked with the teeth in that's a little [ __ ] up but I love it III never the best part of this story is at my engagement dinner which you were at weren't you the night before the wedding I mean you didn't get there in time I don't think I was actually we're not engaged what's the night before the rehearsal rehearsal dinner yeah at the rehearsal dinner the best part of it is a total surprise to me jewel shows up with a set of teeth of her own yeah you know which ones she went with the funniest snaggletooth she went with you too man all one word that's good that's great yeah for her Eric thank you so much for setting aside three on a Wednesday afternoon or whatever it is here to talk about this stuff I know that you know for many people listening we probably didn't even scratch the surface of some of the really deep questions but I also think that we gave people probably a really good overview of this this profession of yours which is in many ways probably one of the few professions that deals disproportionately with healthspan versus lifespan so much of medicine is really geared towards how do you extend life but orthopedics is one of these professions that that certainly disproportionately thinks about how do you maintain that quality of life and you know I wish everybody could be lucky enough to have an orthopedic surgeon like you my hope is that unfortunately that while that's not likely or real you've given people some metrics by which they can at least evaluate fee their own doctor no they Peter thank you and love love talking to you anytime first I'm gonna talk to you with headphones in a microphone but you know we're very lucky to be able to do what we do we have a medical degree we have a means of helping people and we see a window into people's lives it's a very privileged do and you know I you take that responsibility incredibly seriously I like to think I do as well and I admire all the work that you do you do incredible work for so many people and many of the principles that you have advocated over the years we've adopted into our practice to try and help people and so your legacy and your your tree spreads far and wide and helping lots and lots of people so I again I I have an incredible amount of gratitude to you personally for how you've influenced my practice and my ability to help patients again cope with their conditions and their injuries and live their life to the fullest so it's a great opportunity a great privilege and it's always great seeing it at any time but thank you for allowing me to share my perspective on my profession well thank you Eric and that feeling is mutual my appreciation for you is as deep as yours is for me thank you you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter Tiye MD com what's a nerd Safari you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
