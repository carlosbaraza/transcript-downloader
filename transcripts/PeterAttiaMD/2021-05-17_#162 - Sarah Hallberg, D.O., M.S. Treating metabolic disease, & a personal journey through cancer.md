Sarah Hallberg is the Medical Director at Virta Health and a physician who has spent nearly two decades treating patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. In the first half of this episode, Sarah discusses how she became a huge believer in the efficacy of carbohydrate restriction for the treatment of type 2 diabetes through her research and clinical experience. Sarah challenges the common beliefs about the role of dietary fat and carbohydrate on the plasma makeup of fatty acids and triglycerides. She also expresses the importance of understanding early predictors of metabolic illness—highlighting one particular fatty acid as the most important early predictor—before finishing with a discussion about how doctors might be able to personalize patients’ metabolic management in the future. In the second half of this episode, Sarah tells the personal story of her own lung cancer diagnosis. She talks about dealing with her grief, deciding to continue her work while prioritizing her family, and how she devised a plan to extend her survival as long as possible.  

We discuss:

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:10] hey sarah welcome to the show i'm super excited to be speaking with you today um this has the potential of course to be a 10 hour podcast which it won't be but i think that speaks to the um the depth of insight that you've got into so many topics that i actually want to talk about so um thank you yeah well in thinking long and hard about um how to sort of navigate all the threads i want to pull on i figured we would just start with the nerdiest of all topics which is something that i know you're so passionate about and yet i don't think gets nearly enough attention and that is basically the role of dietary intake of both carbohydrate and fats and the relationship that has on the distribution of fatty acids within the body so let me just start by asking like why is that even of interest to you well i mean it's significant interest because it really hits at one of the things people criticize a low carb high fat diet about is oh my goodness you know you'll get more fat in your muscles in your liver and it's going to lead to increased insulin resistance and thereby default going to lead to increased cardiovascular disease and we know that a therapeutic carbohydrate restricted diet brings down so many cardiovascular risk biomarkers that we're all used to hearing about okay it decreases triglycerides you know okay it actually can reverse type 2 diabetes in most cases and certainly significantly improve glycemic control in all but fatty acids that's not something that's talked about all that often and what is talked about all that often is this idea of you are what you eat right we hear that still every day remember you are what you eat and this example of what happens when you consume saturated fat in the matrix of a diet that includes carbohydrate restriction is so against that long worn out idea of you are what you eat and so fatty acids play a critical role study after study will show us in cardiovascular risk and in future diabetes risk as well but again it's it's not discussed because fatty acids are confusing let's face it okay and most people would rather just fall back on this idea you are what you eat which just really flies counter to what the evidence in the peer-reviewed published literature says so maybe taking even a greater step back from that sarah what is it that attracted you personally as a physician towards the management of type 2 diabetes because i mean that's how you and i got to know each other was through a company that you you're a big part of uh called verta health which i'm sure at some point today we will talk about um but what attracted you to this patient population and how is it that you stumbled upon the idea that there was perhaps another way to treat patients with type 2 diabetes that was not kind of the standard treatment which was chasing glycemic control with insulin or insulin increasing drugs well i tell ya it's by accident if you had told me 20 years ago that i'd be playing this role in the healthcare system i probably wouldn't have believed you so it goes back again to the fact that for a very long time i mean i've been in the world of obesity care for well over 25 years now and just the first half of that was telling people that the way to fix everything was to eat a low calorie low fat diet you know i grew up as a product of the 80s like so many people where that was you know that was the dogma there was no other way and of course entering into college and um grad school where i got both my bachelor's and master's in exercise physiology i mean that's what we were taught moving on to med school you know reaffirmed once again so when i went into practice as a primary care physician i'm board certified in internal medicine it was more the same but again it was so frustrating to me you know all along the way really to be continually giving this advice and then have people show up be worse you know i'm not making them healthier i'm making them or i'm watching them become more unhealthy and that was depressing and it was really quickly became just to the point where it was like i can't continue on with primary care for the rest of my life because i felt like a legal drug dealer i got really lucky here okay i i like to say a lot of my pivots are pivoted on anger right pivots in my career and i was really angry at what was happening on the primary care level um and as luck would have it have it um at indiana university health they knew about my background knew about my past work at obesity care and asked me to start a program obesity program and i jumped at the opportunity and i was lucky to be able to take some time off over the next year spend time figuring out what what was this going to look like you know how are we going to tackle the un tacklable if you will problem you know that is obesity and i started sticking my nose in the literature which is something that every physician wants to do but not every physician is afforded the time let's face it you know we are boom boom boom see patients there's just such a busy lifestyle in everything right now but i was given a chance to step back some so i had time to prepare for this and in that i discovered carbohydrate restriction as a means to weight loss initially um listened to some lectures by dr steve finney and jeff folek and i was like whoa that makes total physiologic sense and so boy did i dig deeper into this i read everything i could get my hands on and really came to the conclusion which required a lot of you know cognitive dissonance overcoming that what i had been saying you know for well over a decade to so many people was really not founded on good science and that the field of carbohydrate restriction while still relatively in its infancy at the time showed much more promise and so we opened the clinic as a carbohydrate restricted clinic but the fact of the matter is although people were losing weight what we were seeing that was so much more meaningful was that people's diabetes was like going away they were having normal blood sugar we were pulling them off of insulin at rates that i could never have believed had i not been the physician who was taking care of these patients i was astronauts now sarah just a couple of questions of insulin sorry just just to interject um did you first of all there's two questions i guess i want to ask you one were these patients primarily patients with type 2 diabetes or was it primarily obesity of which a subset had diabetes and secondly how much resistance did you have in your own institution when you showed up and said hey i know you guys brought me in to do this thing i'm gonna do it but oh by the way my secret sauce is gonna be this at the time very unconventional approach great question so as you probably can imagine when uh patients come into an obesity clinic most all of them if not all of them have some form of metabolic disease um you know the biggest being type 2 diabetes so we were seeing type 2 diabetes all of the time consistently daily and you're right i had to take precautions because again this was 10 years ago and not as much about carbohydrate restriction was known at that time certainly among general practicing physicians in any discipline really and so i knew that i had a head off the potential resistance that was going to come there was just no question of it so i actually went about and spent an entire summer meeting with all the departments in our local med center and giving them a 15-minute slide presentation of when your patient comes back says that dr hallberg told them to eat a lot of fat and not a lot of carbohydrates that i wasn't crazy that this was actually based on evidence and here it was and you know peter you'd be surprised i didn't get any pushback i actually pushed it even to the next level i was part at that time of the ambulatory quality committee at our institution and i actually brought up a amendment that all patients with metabolic disease should at least be provided the option of trying this if they wanted and it passed unanimously i mean people got it once they had time to pause take a look at the physiology behind this and realize okay yeah that makes a lot of sense so in changed my life right and again i i like to always say my career is built of inflection points of anger and as we were seeing these huge changes of diabetes and patients just resolving their diabetes i became really angry because i was like where is this where is this in the guidelines how come i've never heard of this before i mean this is you know i mean i hate to be like over dramatic but it truly is quite miraculous for a disease that everyone thought was chronic and progressive to see people recover from it um is quite astounding and so i decided that i needed to get into research so actually to start off with i called purdue university's nutrition program and asked one of the researchers there if they wanted to help me on just an early unfunded pilot study to prove my point looking at metabolic improvements and looking at financial improvements too because obviously if people weren't taking all this medicine they weren't costing themselves and of course the health care system as a whole as much money and so i talked about that study presented it at the national lipid association quite a long time ago talked about it actually in my ted talk and then was speaking at the obesity medicine association quite a long time ago and actually met dr steve finney and that really changed the course of my life as well so all this time you're sort of putting into practice what steve and jeff had been writing about for a long time and and obviously uh steve is someone i've been you know dying to have on the podcast and we were actually supposed to do it at one point in time and then scheduling got in the way um but i didn't realize that you had already sort of gone down this path and yet hadn't actually met him because i took the opposite approach which was when i started kind of implementing some of these treatments you know i'm just a bull in a china shop i just reached out to steve right away i might have been one of the first people to get a copy of the uh the book that he and jeff wrote in 2011 i think i got a pre-print of that book which i still have but the art and science book which i have it might have more highlights and post-its in it than any book i own uh because i think like you i was kind of going through the this can't be something there's something that's not um there's something so counterintuitive to this that i i need to read this over and over and over again to make sure i get it so it's funny that that's the case now tell me where did you know were you at this time going to ada meetings the american diabetes association meetings and and and when you would discuss what you were seeing in your practice with your peers who were also on the front lines taking a more traditional approach how is your experience being how is that met well it's interesting if someone if i was speaking with someone who took care of obesity patients for obesity they were totally i get it you know i'm doing the same thing to some varying degree but when you moved out of that space to other subspecialists the first thing was oh yeah their diabetes will go away but you're going to kill them with heart disease right or oh you know we all know it works i'll never forget one of the leaders in the endocrine movement said look we all know it works this is not a secret but nobody can stay with it and i was like you know i don't know here in my practice i have thousands of patients that would beg to differ with that um and so you know those are the feedback that i got and so one of the things was i knew that there had to be even more research done i mean you know we had wonderful pioneers in you know steve and jeff and um some eric from duke westman but we needed even more they needed to be larger trials they needed to really specifically focus on patients with type 2 diabetes because i was convinced almost from the get-go that that is the target population here because that's where we see the biggest improvements and so this chance meeting um with steve at uh obesity medicine association conference led to a dinner and led to funding of the large clinical trial that we're actually wrapping up in the next couple of months right now we're at the tail end of our five-year data collection of the longest and largest trial looking at nutritional ketosis as a means of reversing type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes which i'll just kind of stick in really quick here today actually happens to be the day that the pre-diabetes paper was published so i'm really proud to say this is the eighth paper already that's come out of this large trial started by a chance encounter at a conference and the we haven't published the pre-diabetes results until today so this was a um a paper that looks at the first two years of pre-diabetes um utilizing a remote continuous support to help patients adhere to a diet aimed at nutritional ketosis and sarah these are these are patients defined as pre-diabetic by hemoglobin a1c correct and that's um in the that's being defined as 5.7 to 6.4 is that the range that's correct okay tell people what that means uh i think most people are aware of what a hemoglobin a1c is but what does that translate to in an average glucose approximately yeah so we really start to get for example fasting that's the one most people are familiar with and once you get a fasting glucose over 110 you know that's the worrisome pre-diabetes range and i do have to say here though that doesn't mean normal glucoses are okay for everyone and i think you've had you know many people on here talking about the perils of insulin resistance and how it starts to cause significant problems in people who still have normal blood sugars and i just think that's such an important point and can't be overstated again but in this study we're looking at people who had insulin resistance long enough that their pancreas and the beta cells could not keep up with the insulin that was needed to keep blood sugar normal and their blood sugar started to rise not yet to the level where a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes could be made but once again where we see the impact of insulin resistance affecting the body's ability to keep blood sugar normal due to pancreas being overworked for far too long and and if we believe that i mean i don't know what the latest numbers are but i'm guessing it's still about 10 of the u.s population has type 2 diabetes is that approximately correct or is it are we more than 10 now approximately with also the caveat of much more concerning levels in different minority populations which of course hopefully we'll get a chance to talk about later is just a huge goal with improving health equity in this country so if it's 10 in all comers do you have a sense of what it is in hispanic and african-american populations yeah it gets even higher it's well into the teens in those and pacific islanders as well so these are populations that you know we need to be paying attention of course to everyone who has type 2 diabetes but we also need to be paying attention to who's at greater risk so what percentage of the population do we believe is in the pre-formally in the pre-diabetic camp which again i think what you said a moment ago is very important for people to understand if we go back to the podcast with jerry shulman which is one of my favorite discussions ever on the topic of insulin resistance i mean jerry really laid out elegantly the long time course of this disease and even you know even if you have normal fasting glucose and fasting insulin but that early sign of elevated postprandial insulin is really that early sign of insulin resistance that will then lead to postprandial glucose elevations and even that can still exist in the presence of normal fasting glucose so to your point by the time someone registers as a pre-diabetic quote unquote i mean this has been a process that's been going on for five to ten years what's what what is the what is our belief about how many or what percentage of americans just to make it you know american-centric for a moment what percentage of americans are in that bucket well i tell you you know studies recent studies will show us that over 50 percent of americans adult americans have diabetes or pre-diabetes and a study released a couple of years ago and i mean this this should shock everyone to its core based on nhanes data that 88 of americans are not in optimal metabolic health i mean let me say that again 88 of adult americans are not in optimal metabolic health and that is by looking at nhanes data and taking a look at the criteria for metabolic syndrome and so you know the 12 are those who didn't meet any of the criteria for metabolic syndrome okay i mean that's frightening yeah so it's good i was going to ask you and if that's exactly what it meant so just let's state for the for the listener what metabolic syndrome is we've certainly discussed it on this podcast but it would be great to remind people what are those 12 percent doing they have none of the following five right they have normal blood pressure they do not have elevated blood pressure and again and they're not on medication and they're not taking medication to lower blood pressure and normal is now being much more stringently defined but i believe the latest cdc definition of normal is less than 130 over 80. in our practice we advocate less than 120 over 80. they have normal fasting glucose and that's defined as less than 100 they have normal triglycerides which are being defined as less than 150 we argue in our practice that's very high and anything over 100 is elevated totally agree they have normal hdl cholesterol which for men is defined as greater than 40 milligrams per deciliter for women greater than 50 milligrams per deciliter and they do not have truncal obesity and i forget i think for men that's defined as 40 inches of waist circumference in women 36 i don't know if that's if that's still the latest well yeah and i will also point out one really important thing here when it comes to waist circumference too and the definition of metabolic syndrome and it a little bit goes back to what i was saying before about the consideration of minorities and different ethnic populations which is we have to take the um that into account even when we're defining metabolic syndrome because for southeast asians they are defined as having metabolic syndrome at a much lower waist circumference and for african americans we need to really consider as well because they tend even in the face of having insulin resistance they tend to have normal triglycerides and hdl and so again you know we can't be treating everybody the same but we often do yeah i'm glad you pointed that out i i still remember it was about 10 years ago when i learned that lesson which was you know taking care of an african-american patient who had about the most uncontrolled diabetes i'd ever seen you know hemoglobin a1c of 14 this is a person who's basically going to have their limbs amputated in the next hour triglycerides of 89 just oh yeah yeah just totally normal you look at their lipid panel you wouldn't think anything is wrong right and so that's the thing is they can get missed and so you know knowing this and educating people on things like this again goes back to our working on health equities um and it's so important and so often um not something people take into account and just going back to pre-diabetes you know the most frustrating thing i shouldn't say that it's one of the most frustrating things there are many things about our health care system i could enter into the most frustrating but one of them is patients coming in to see me whose lab showed pre-diabetes and i said oh you have pre-diabetes oh no no no my physician said i was fine and so the the fact that we don't appreciate that by the time you get to pre-diabetes there's some really serious things going on here you know their their vision is being impacted you know their nerves are being impacted you know these are things we can't just say oh they haven't they haven't gotten bad enough to bother with because they're not at you know the criteria for type 2 diabetes yet i mean we have to pay attention and so if that's one thing if there's any you know physicians listening which i know that there are don't ignore any elevation in blood sugar that means there's been a problem for a long time already and and and patients should be also hyper vigilant about this i mean i've seen patients in that pre-diabetic camp and this is using an example of a male patient when they're when their insulin sensitivity is restored and their blood glucose you know comes down by an average of 10 milligrams per deciliter they'll say wow i have better erections all of a sudden and that speaks to even the microvascular damage that's being done long before you get to diabetes you know i actually was exchanging emails with a really good ophthalmologist recently and kind of trying to ask how far are we away from being able to use retinal imaging as a screening tool for early early early microvascular disease because i think the hemoglobin a1c is just far too crude a metric for this and i actually have seen some interesting literature and i'm sure you've seen even more of it that suggests that this is you know if you look at the microvasculature in the eye it might be one of the earliest warning signs of when things go awry and so in an ideal world i would love it if you know we had you know tech that basically allowed for quick and easy evaluation of that so that to your point it doesn't really matter if your trigs are up or down and your waist is big or not like let's look at the actual place where the damage is taking place and make the assessment on an individualized basis as opposed to using these sort of population-based metrics which move in the right direction but for any one individual can be quite misleading yeah and then i i love the um eye discussion because you know one of the other i think really important questions is once we do get to damage can we make it better can we make it better you know without and skip some of the horrors of having diabetic eye disease for millions of patients i mean that is a really burning question for me um and one that i think we need to really explore yeah indeed so with that background let's kind of dive into some of this nerdy nerdy fatty acid stuff and and i got to tell you i find this stuff really interesting in part because i think it's complicated enough to make sense of just the eating side of this stuff in other words um you know just for the listener you know i think people that have listened to this podcast we've done a number of shows that have dealt with fatty acids people probably understand that there are saturated fats monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats the saturated fats have no double bonds so that means every carbon is fully saturated with hydrogen the monounsaturated have one and only one unsaturation so one double bond and then the polys have at least two of these double bonds but it's the manner in which these things can be made from each other that becomes quite interesting isn't it it's really the way that you can ingest one form and it can be turned into another so i'm wondering if the easiest place to begin this discussion is to introduce what the fate of a very common fat in our body is um which is the c16 saturated fat so can you talk a little bit about how abundant that is um and what our body's options are for what it's called let's start with the nomenclature what is what is c what does pure c-16 look like that's palmetto palmitolytic acid um and um so it's really interesting what happens and do you mind if i jump on and share screen here yes we can talk a little bit more about it yeah that would make it easier for everybody i'm sure i want to start by talking about saturated fatty acids in general okay and what we know is that going back here to the basics and looking at the liver when we have incorporation of saturated fatty acids into our triglycerides okay that is correlated with insulin resistance and adiposity okay likely reflecting accelerated hepatic denovo lipogenesis okay or also it can be what is actually returned to the liver so really too we certainly know that hepatic de novo lipogenesis is a big part of the problem when it comes to elevated triglycerides but we can also make these with some what is delivered exactly back to the liver and so when we see saturated fatty acids okay as a makeup of triglycerides or maybe even the phospholipids there we say oh my goodness that's a marker of increased saturated fatty acid consumption right these people are eating a high saturated fat diet and that seems to make sense and this is the problem with a lot of things in science in general um but and nutrition science is no different is that just because it seems to make sense doesn't mean it's the way things actually work okay sarah can i can i explain a technical point on this slide that you and i will take for granted but i want to make sure that a listener understands absolutely please do so when when a patient goes and gets their blood drawn let's just say they get a standard lipid panel it will spit out the following values total cholesterol equals 200 milligrams per deciliter ldl cholesterol equals you know 140 milligrams per deciliter triglycerides equal 150 milligrams per deciliter hdl cholesterol is 35 milligrams per deciliter and vldl cholesterol if i remember the numbers i just spit out would be 25 milligrams per deciliter in other words the vldl cholesterol hdl cholesterol and ldl cholesterol sum to the total and then the triglycerides are independent what i want to make sure people understand is those are all found within the lipoproteins so vldl cholesterol is the amount of cholesterol ester contained within the very low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol is the total content of cholesterol ester found within the low density lipoprotein etc for the hdl here's the part that's really interesting we always check these things fasting because we when it comes to measuring the triglyceride we want to eliminate what's in the kylomicron we want to eliminate the immediately absorbed triglyceride from the gut and by doing that we basically capture what you have on this photo when we measure a triglyceride for all intents and purposes we are basically measuring the 90 of triglycerides that are captured within the vldl so let me restate that because that was a bit rambling when you go to the doctor and get your blood tested and it says your triglycerides are 150 milligrams per deciliter that's basically saying look 90 of that 150 milligrams per deciliter is within your vldl cholesterol i there's some of that is in intermediate density lipoprotein but that's virtually non-existent there's a trace of that in the ldl cholesterol and even a smaller trace in the hdl but it's the lion's share is in the vldl cholesterol and as you're going to explain to us this process of de novo lipogenesis the conduit from fat being made in the liver and exported that conduit is the vldl particle that's that's going to become very important in this discussion absolutely absolutely um yeah and that's really important thank you for the the precursor explanation because it is real this is technical stuff and that is really important um for people to understand and so you know then the next question really becomes okay so if we have a high saturated fatty acid content within the vldl okay again it's being in the triglycerides the phospho lipid membrane wherever we find it where did the saturated fatty acids come from is it directly from consumption and i just want to first point out before we get into maybe more of the technical stuff some of the clinical trials that can help us understand this a little bit better and so this is one of my favorites um by dr brittany volk that was published a while ago and it's really great because this was a feeding study so you know they kept track of what the patients were eating it wasn't a free-for-all are they eating what they're were telling them to eat or not they provided all of their food and this was patients with metabolic syndrome they went through six feeding phases and so they did a run in with a very low carbohydrate diet for everyone less than 50 grams of carbohydrates a day and every three weeks they increased the carbohydrates in the diet all the way up to a 346 grams which was c6 feeding phase the other thing to note here is the saturated fat content so when we were at the low carbohydrate end here in c1 they were consuming 84 grams of saturated fatty acids a day okay so that blows away any um guideline on saturated fat i mean so far above what anyone would consider at goal and then we get down to the c6 and we're much less 32 grams again what happens to the fatty acids as people are run through these six phases and sarah just to be clear this is basically an isocaloric feeding study which means as you're ratcheting up the content of carbohydrate you're commensurately reducing at a caloric level the amount of saturated fat right i believe this study did not change the number of calories they were consuming or did it correct they did not okay and so what happened um to the um saturated fatty acid levels in the blood and for that matter others other fatty acid levels in the blood so what happened over these six phases okay so here we have saturated fatty acid levels marked okay so here's the baseline at that run-in okay and we see when we have the very high saturated fat level very low carbohydrate okay here we go and what's really interesting is what happens as we march along here down to c6 and if you remember this is much lower saturated fatty acid content of the diet okay much higher carbohydrate intake what we see is that it's actually the saturated fatty acid content is actually higher with the lower saturated fat intake and we're going to come back and talk to about the science behind that but i think it's really important for people to see this clinically and then maybe when we get into a little bit more of the nitty-gritty um it can make more sense okay i mean it's it's actually statistically insignificant in terms of c16 right which is the dominant saturated fatty acid so so palmitic acid it trended towards an increase as saturated fat dietary saturated fat went down um and such and carbohydrate went up but it didn't reach significance and um the only one that actually did significantly increase was c14 right yeah actually um see 16 1 as well and that one is we're going to oh yes but but yeah yeah no but as a saturated fat it was really just as a saturated fat yes yeah so but the point of this is we didn't have these really high levels of serum saturated fatty acids when we were consuming when these participants were consuming this very high saturated fat diet i mean essentially and this is important it stays the same if anything there's a trend okay to higher serum saturated fat in the low fat arm okay but certainly we do not see a rise in the high intake of saturated fat that's super important and again it goes against what i was saying earlier on you know you are what you eat well okay if that's true then when i consume a very high level of saturated fatty acids why am i not seeing that again in the blood in the serum why are we not seeing that and what's nice in this study is you've exhaustively looked at where the fatty acids are so obviously the most efficient place we store fatty acids is in the triglyceride but you also store it within the cholesterol ester and it's obviously in the phospholipid as well but regardless of where you look you see no association between dietary saturated fat and fatty acid composition with respect to saturated fat that's right that's right and i want to really quick draw attention here to one more that we are going to be talking more about and that's 16 1 that's palmitoleic acid and we're going to talk more about why that's important but as we can see here when we follow that across it significantly rises when we have less saturated fat and more carbohydrates and you can see that is statistically significantly different in every place that we're looking okay so moving on when we take here a low saturated fat diet low fat low saturated fat diet and we compare it to a low carbohydrate high saturated fat diet over 12 weeks this is from jeff volix group from 2008 and what i like here is you can see very readily with these pie charts exactly what the content of the two diets were so again we really have it flipped you know high carbohydrate low carbohydrate low fat here on the left to a very high intake of fat on the right and again below it the two different levels of saturated fat that we're comparing 12 grams to three times as high in the low carb diet at 36. so then sarah these are both these are both really low calorie studies was this an ad lib feeding study or were these deliberately calorie restricted uh how was the study done yeah these were both that wanted the calorie intake of the two studies to be the same so as you can see they're about 1500 calories apiece and were they deliberately calorie restricted yes okay so what we can see here is that what we have when we take a look at these two arms is taking a look on the right to the change in serum saturated fatty acids we can see in the carb restricted diet you know significant decrease versus the low-fat diet so again in the much higher saturated fatty acid arm we see a significant decrease down okay whereas we do see a drop in the saturated fatty low saturated fatty acid intake group but not nearly as much as we see with the carbohydrate restricted group once again you know arguing against you are what you eat and i want to now get in a little bit more to this what i think is actually even more important which is the change in the palmetto palm palmitic acid excuse me palmitoleic acid get all these palm uh messed up when i try to talk about it easier to just think of it as 16 1. yeah so so palmitic acid is 16 0 palmitoleic acid is 16 1. they look almost the same except that palmitoleic the 16 1 has that double bond at the n7 position and you're gonna explain in a moment which enzyme does that and why that matters right right absolutely you know what is it about this it's not a it's not a saturated fatty acid so why do we care so much what happens to 16 1 but it's pretty evident here what happens first of all and then we'll talk about why what happens is that with 16 1 in the high saturated fatty acid group it drops significantly where in the low fat group again low saturated fatty acid group it actually goes up and this is a statistically significant difference okay much more significant even as we look than the change in the serum fatty acids all right so now i'm going to pull up a graph of these results to look at it a little better and then i want to get into the actual science of it this is the very low carbohydrate arm on the left and it is the low fat arm on the right and so what we see here when we look at total saturated fatty acids is that it has dropped okay five percent between the um low carbohydrate group and the low fat group total saturated fatty acids what about the 16 1 and what we see here with the 16 1 and much more significant statistically is that we see between a low carbohydrate diet and a low fat diet that we have a more significant decrease in the 16-1 with the low carbohydrate higher fat diet now so there's a couple things going on here comments for there yeah yeah i think there's a couple things going on for people that are going to be overwhelmed by this table and i apologize if you're just listening to this without watching it on video i'll do my best to to to explain what's going on here so the the first thing to notice here is both of these groups of patients started out with quite elevated triglycerides so um they're in the first group in the group that was randomized to the very low carbohydrate diet their average triglyceride at the start of this study was 211 milligrams per deciliter that's sky high at the end of 12 weeks it was down to about 104 milligrams per deciliter it fell by about 50 percent conversely the group that started out in the low-fat arm also very high triglycerides to start 187 milligrams per deciliter by the end of 12 weeks they saw about a 20 reduction to about 150 milligrams per deciliter now this is where these tables get a little bit confusing because the table is showing both the relative and absolute reduction of the relative or constitutive fatty acid in this case 16 0 and 16 1 and 7 the two we're talking about what does that mean in english it means that when you look at the total amount of saturated fat reduction on a relative basis both groups saw a slight reduction but it was statistically more significant in one group than the other the low carb group was a 12 reduction versus 5 in the low fat group and on an absolute basis that difference was even greater because the low carb group had such a significant reduction in total triglyceride uh as well and that's the dominant source of where you're going to see these fatty acids and of course the reverse is true uh when it comes to 16 1. so let's now ask the question sarah what is it about palmitoleic acid that you think is such an important biomarker because we wouldn't be having this discussion if you didn't think we should be paying attention to this yeah i think it's a really important biomarker and if you if you would um allow me let me point out one other thing here regarding the triglycerides because clearly the low carbohydrate arm decreased more in the triglycerides okay the low fat arm decreased too which may come as a surprise to your listeners because we do associate low fat with an increase in triglycerides but i do want to remind everyone that this was a calorie restricted so this was around 1500 calories so that drop in the low-fat diet arm although maybe not what we were expected does make sense with the reduction in calories overall now let's go back and talk more about your question okay i think palmettoic acid or again that's that 16 1 is really not appreciated as the health predictor that it really is okay so let's go through i'm going to just jump ahead a little bit here so palmitoleic or we like to call it poa is a product of something called sterile coa desaturase and sterol coe de saturates is going to determine what is going to happen with some of the fatty acids in our system specifically what's going to happen to poa now what we know ahead is that sterile coa desaturates is actually an independent marker of triglyceridemia and abdominal adiposity so in other words an independent marker of all those things that go along with insulin resistance all right so if we have high levels of co-a desaturates activity you know right there we gotta start thinking things may be concerning even if someone has a normal blood sugar right because right now i think one of the important things based on our the earlier part of our conversation where we say so many times these things are missed you know people can still have normal blood sugars you know it's going to be really important you know number one that we make everyone aware that a normal blood sugar doesn't mean that you are healthy but number two what are some easy ways and some easy markers maybe that we can check to know that we're headed for trouble even before we have blood sugar go up okay so plasma triglycerides and let's take a look at again poa in those plasma triglycerides in the way of looking at it in quartiles okay so again low versus high and what we can see is the poa all right the byproduct okay of sterile co-a desaturase is much higher the higher the triglycerides are okay very important so if your triglycerides are really high again what's happening very likely is that your poa is elevated as well okay brought about by increased activity of sterol co-a desaturates and this shouldn't be surprising right because if you look at the very you know unfriendly diagrams of fatty acid metabolism one of the first steps we see in the conversion of or elongation of fatty acids is the conversion of c 16 0 palmitic acid into c uh 16 1 palmitoleic acid and seven through an enzyme that has two names i guess depending on the name of nomenclature right so delta nine desaturates desaturate the number nine carbon from the delta end also known as sterile coa uh saturates a desaturate which i think is the more popular name is is scd-1 right right and if you and if you go down that pathway what you're basically doing is bundling and packaging fat to leave the liver right yes and and and here is one of the that is an interesting point because the question is if we're trying to change the serum saturated fats into something else okay i mean the body is obviously doing that one would have to wonder is that a protection mechanism why do we want to do that i i yeah to me that's a great question sarah it seems counter-intuitive if i'm going to be obvious because we would think that a saturated fat is much safer it's inert there's no chance a reactive oxygen species can be formed out of it why is it our body even if we wanted to export fat from the liver which we could argue all the reasons that's not a great idea why would we go to the trouble of this conversion all right well let's go through it really quick and then get to answering that question because i think it's really important and really sheds light on why we need to be paying more attention to the all-important poa and of course the precursors and and enzymes that act in its creation so let's go through if you will this cartoon that i know looks really busy initially but let me just kind of run through it starting here in the intestine and remember you know we'll start off by saying our focus in health care and in nutrition recommendations for so long has been low fat low fat more carbohydrates higher carbohydrates well let's take a look in the intestine at those carbohydrates changing the focus for a minute so they come in rapidly absorbed carbohydrates or even our slowly absorbed carbohydrates our starches okay um and what happens when they come in right as glucose that feeds in again through glut2 into the pancreas pushing out more insulin insulin then feeds into the liver and what we get here okay is going through it a big big part of this is srebp-1 okay and i don't know if we need to get that technical but we'll lead here to that enzyme we were talking about the scd-1 or sterile coa desaturates increasing okay very important and it comes about through other means as well fructose coming in through glute 5 or glucose coming directly into the liver through glut2 they're all feeding into this by slightly different mechanisms to increase this scd1 now we're going to look more at the process in a different way so we have increased hepatic first of all saturated fat okay here's our 16 0 the saturated fat all right uh increase hepatic levels of this what gets turned on as from the past cartoon we get that scd-1 activity increasing that leads to this increase in poa all right coming down here what's the end gain here increased vldl all right same thing over here looking at it different we see again scd-1 if it's blocked we won't see that all right we'll see a decrease in vldl and this again has to do if this scd enzyme is blocked we're going to have an increase in the saturate a decrease in our poa okay but again what we have when we're consuming the high carbohydrates even if they're the again more refined carbohydrates or the less rapidly absorbed carbohydrates this is the path that we wind up going on 16 1 is our 16 0 saturated fat is elevated and it turns on this cascade leading to increase in vldl i'll pause there before we go on if you had any comments that you wanted to add here yeah again i think you know for folks that are watching this it's going to make a bit more sense and if you're not i just want to make sure we're bringing you along for the ride so you know in the liver when you are taking c16 or c18 but let's just keep the discussion simple and start with a saturated c16 it's it's the first committed step is going through scd-1 is an enzyme and it adds that double bond it makes a few more steps along the way but ultimately it is increasing a process of lipogenesis it is making more lipid it is increasing the amount of lipid within the cholesterol ester in the triglyceride it is being exported from the liver so in response to your question sarah is this protective i guess the answer looks like the body is saying well gosh i would rather get this fat out of the liver then keep it in the liver and we know that it's not fully successful in doing that because of course although it hasn't come up yet on this discussion everything we've talked about today runs hand in hand with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which is truly an epidemic at the moment but i suspect that the body is still doing its best even in the case of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to try to export this fat as much as possible the triglyceride is a very efficient place to store it i've always believed obesity is a protective mechanism i think that obesity is not the cause of metabolic illness but the result of it which is not to say that the inflammatory environment that comes with it doesn't pour more gasoline on that fire but i you know it is my belief um that everything we're talking about here is the body's aim to protect itself from an abundance of nutrition and so that's how i read this is the body is doing and specifically the liver which is arguably the most important organ in this situation the liver is really trying to protect us and it's saying i'm making so much extra fat right now because you as my individual are so far above your carbohydrate consumption tolerance your tolerance for carbohydrate consumption and this is the most efficient thing i can do which is turn that into fat send it out via the vldl get that into the adipose site and yeah you're going to be a little bit fatter and it's going to come with some downstream problems but in the short term it's protecting me the liver do you would you agree with my teleologic view of that i 100 would agree with it and again you know it's i think that we are going to have more and more details on this coming out very very soon in many research product projects that are currently ongoing but what it really comes down to is you know we want to know what an individual's carbohydrate tolerance is okay i mean that's key to personalization right does everybody need to be very low carbohydrate low carbohydrate i mean where does we can say population level what happens in large clinical trials but what's happening with the individual because let's face it peter and you know you and i as practicing clinicians know this when you're sitting with one patient in front of you you can go over group data from a clinical trial and that's important part of the decision making but the only thing that really matters is what's going to happen with the patient right in front of you we really want to know what the individualized reaction is going to be you know we know that this happens with a carbohydrate consumption above a certain threshold but what that certain threshold is in the individual we don't know and based on these pathways you know what is the marker we want to be looking at actually it's probably p-o-a surprisingly not a fatty acid but what this tells us is that when someone has consumed carbohydrates above their individual tolerance that poa level is going to be a great biomarker it's going to go up as again a protective mechanism in the liver our livers are really i mean you know we talk about livers all the time so related to insulin resistance it's just always amazing just how sophisticated and how our livers although we think of them as producing things that aren't necessarily good for us and that may be true they're also really working for us as well and so again i want to also go back on one other thing that you said um and the other thing that you said is so this comes you know before the adiposity and i think that that is such an important point and one i like to preach every opportunity i can get it but this is starting to happen before people gain a lot of weight okay this is a disease process in in of itself that causes obesity so you know we have to really take that into account when we're in the office with someone who's struggling for with obesity and i know peter you take this really to heart of approaching and treating these patients without bias um as i do but it's it's so important for other providers to be looking themselves in the mirror and asking themselves you know what are the biases i hold against patients who come to me struggling with their weight and what do i really know about the science and what it really one must conclude is that this is not their fault okay these are things that happened beforehand and they're suffering the consequences of it and the problem is the consequence is on full view for everyone to see it's not something that they can hide and that makes them so vulnerable to bias in health care and again one of the other things i come back to is part of our whole battle in health equity so sarah i want to keep digging into this idea because it's so interesting to me of having a leading indicator for you know this early early early warning sign you know i mean i we talked about it at the outset of this discussion which is you know in some ways the tragedy of using hemoglobin a1c as the marker of when somebody gets on the radar i mean you said it yourself patients will show up and nobody's ringing the bell until their hemoglobin a1c is above 6.5 but i mean that literally is happening 10 15 maybe 20 years after there were early early molecular warning signs and if measuring palmitoleic acid is one of them uh that's exactly the kind of stuff that i find interesting because in our practice we use cgm a lot so continuous glucose monitoring is kind of you know we don't you know non-diabetics are wearing cgm like it's no tomorrow in our practice because of that exact reason we're basically holding them to a very high standard of average glucose and high excursions and all these sorts of things i want to go back to something that you alluded to which is the association between pomelytic pal mittolaic acid and triglyceride is so tight that would we miss for example african-american patients do we know if they're failing to synthesize c-161 in the way a white patient is wouldn't we love to know that there's not been a good trial looking at that i mean one of the problems that we have in research in general is that we tend to focus on white people right um you know and actually worse middle or upper middle class white people so there are a lot of questions with this in specific populations there have been a couple of studies recently coming out looking specifically at what we're talking about poa and it's marker for future problems and predictor of future diabetes and other issues one was a study recently published called the panic study looking at levels in childhood and seeing how they translate to health consequences you know decades down the road and then there was another study i believe it was from the netherlands where they looked at poa levels at 50 to correlate them with c-reactive protein levels at age 70 right and what we see is what we would expect based on our our discussion here which is the poa was a predictor of problems down the road in people who were healthy when their poa was elevated or healthy so we thought you know what we really want to know ahead of time and i know this is very meaningful to you in your practice is i want the person who's healthy so i can get to tell them how to stay healthy okay we we talk a lot about you know trying to work on people who are already so so to speak behind the eight ball and we want to work them out and we want to regress their disease clearly an important goal but we also really if we're going to make a difference again with the individual and population-wide we need to know who's headed for trouble well i mean this is again i i i hope there's an ongoing effort here because i think this is the future of medicine right i mean i think the future of medicine has to be coming up with tools that allow us to take broad sweeping you know population-based insights and very quickly target individuals and if we have biomarkers like this that can say look the moment this is triggered above a certain level it doesn't really matter what your glucose is and your insulin might still be normal this is time to intervene and then of course the second part of that equation is what's the right intervention and how do we pair people to the right intervention um and again you and i have a very similar set of experiences which is patients with hyperinsulinemia and elevated glucose generally respond well to carbohydrate restriction my practice also focuses so much on the role of glucose disposal and non-insulin dependent glucose disposal through exercise and i know that um you know that that's probably not a surprise to many people is is sort of correcting the sleep exercise nutrition trifecta and then adding to that the the role of cortisol in all of this so i don't know i i think this is i think this is a very hard problem to solve that's the bad news but i think the good news is if you get this one right you get a leg up on every chronic disease so your risk of heart disease cancer alzheimer's disease all go down um and and so it's worth this enormous effort to to continue pushing on these questions and i think you know on that note too you know and when we talk about individualization and risk prediction before we're seeing our classic you know biomarker issues come up has to do i'll circle it back to carbohydrate restriction because we know very low levels of carbohydrate restriction can you know reverse the disease process bring about normal glycemia um in patients and be able to get them off of medications but we could put a risk predictor like poa into wider use okay which would give a person their individual carbohydrate threshold what if it didn't need to be as low what if we caught them earlier in the disease process and we're like hey buddy you go over you know 175 you know that's where trouble comes in rather than you know you need to stay very low um you know uh indefinitely because we've caught you on the spectrum of the disease you know so late and this is what we really need to do to control this to keep your glucose normal without the use of these many medications especially insulin i want to ask another question on this sarah um and and again i don't know if it applies to patients that you've treated with diabetes or those in the pre-diabetes category but have you have you treated patients for long enough on ketogenic or very low carbohydrate diets who showed up in a state of metabolic disarray ran through a lengthy period of this so you know maybe spent years on a carbohydrate restricted protocol and everything gets better so they you know the weight goes along for the ride but obviously and more importantly their metabolic markers improve and they gradually reintroduce some amount of carbohydrate back in the diet and all of a sudden they're fine almost as though you reset them during a long enough period how often do you see that and what do you think is the best explanation for that see it all the time and the best explanation for it is what is their insulin reserve what is their insulin reserve so you know the majority of people can go ahead you know starting out even at long standing diabetes reverse their disease get normal glycemia get off of all their medications and then slowly reintroduce carbohydrates as long as they have functioning beta cells okay the problem is you know the longer you've had diabetes clearly is a risk factor for this and we can you know we see evidence of that in the bariatric surgery literature as well i mean there's been so many studies looking at um beta cells um but you know and the fascinating thing is who is getting back some of their beta cell function in other words maybe their beta cells were only dormant and were able to you know wake them up again versus which are gone and not coming back i mean the fact that people were on the incredibly high dose of insulin okay starting on a very low carbohydrate diet and then they got better right away okay a lot of the changes swift but they couldn't get off insulin and it was just years went by right and they're just staying on this much lower level of insulin and then all of a sudden they come off of it i mean we logic would tell us that some sort of beta cell function has returned it took a long time reset the system help them heal you know i mean we don't completely understand this there's so many great scientists looking at this right now but we still don't have a certain answer you know because the answers on the personalized level is how many a minor dormant how many of mine are dead right what's it going to take for me to wake these up you know if it's impossible i'd like to know that because that sets expectations ahead of time right you can get a lot better but there's always going to be a little insulin in your life it doesn't mean if they are someone who doesn't have any insulin production capacity that they can't get a lot healthier but they may not ever be able to get off of insulin and so that's where it gets down once again into that nitty gritty personalization aspect and wouldn't that be nice to know but i think that the answer to the larger question is you know why is this happening that some people can start to eat carbohydrates not anywhere near to where they were but they're able to put some back into their diets versus people who can't is beta cell function and i think something in there that you said is very important that i don't think historically has been communicated well enough to patients which is that insulin while an amazing and important hormone is not benign and there's a big difference between taking a hundred units of insulin a day to achieve normal glycemia and taking 20 units of insulin a day to achieve normal glycemia and you'll take the latter over the former all day every day non-negotiable and some patients will say well gosh i'm still on insulin this hasn't worked and not realizing no you've had a five-fold reduction in your insulin requirement that's an enormous improvement in your health outcome not and let's put the economics aside the economics are enormous but ignore that for a moment just in terms of health outcomes uh the the negative effects of hyperinsulinemia um yeah and it i just want to say with that you know if we really think about the way we we manage diabetes okay rather than work to actually reverse the disease process and get people off of medication i mean management constantly leads to more and more and more insulin which we know i mean on the outward the appearance of it is that people gain more weight when they go on more insulin but you know if we really get down to the nuts and bolts when we take someone with type 2 diabetes whose glucose is out of control to the point where we need to put them on insulin the mandatory discussion that needs to occur is i'm going to put this medicate i'm going to give this medication this insulin that you're going to inject to you okay and i'm going to do that because your blood sugars are so high that they could acutely kill you okay put you into the hospital put you at risk of all these complications but i just want you to know you're more likely to die on insulin that's what we need to tell people that's the truth and you know that would have changed the approach a lot of patients want to take and it would certainly if if if providers were forced to look at it that way when they're staring each individual person in the face maybe they would treat it differently as well yeah i i i agree um so i want to talk about um something that that is you know been such a big part of your life in the last few years and people who don't know you may be almost surprised at where we're going in this discussion now but you know this discussion could basically continue down the path if we could talk more about diabetes we could end this discussion here and and people would say wow that's a really insightful uh thoughtful person but but there's a whole other side uh to to your experience with healthcare sarah that started uh gosh four year almost four years ago um and i'll tell it from just i'll tell the beginning of the story just from my end so you and i obviously uh met each other uh through virta you're you're you know an early part of the the creation of this this company which is basically scaling up a way to remotely treat patients with type 2 diabetes this is a company of that that steve finney is also a co-founder of along with jeff folek i believe i have a minimal involvement in that company i'm a small investor and and at one point was an advisor but it was during one of these advisory meetings that you and i happen to be sitting next to each other now we've met many times before that but i do remember this very well it was i think june of 2017. it was up in san francisco a large u-shaped uh table in the room and you know it's a two-day ordeal and uh you were sitting to my left and that gave us more time than most times to be chatting about this that the other thing and you looked in perfect health as always and at the end of the second day i said goodbye and see you next time and blah blah blah blah and then about a month later i heard from a mutual friend that you had been diagnosed with lung cancer and i just about fell off my chair so can you tell people what happened that summer the summer of 2017. yeah so you know i'll just start by saying i i've been someone who's taken taking care of themselves to um the max you know all my life eaten well i've kept my weight in a normal weight you know even nine months pregnant i would have still been considered normal weight um exercise like crazy competed in you know half marathons triathlons olympic distance you know i did everything right never smoked you know um never drank to excess um and you know it was it was june 30th so right after that it was june 30th of 2017 i was having a normal day i was went to exercise i had a big irb meeting in the morning went home due to my wonderfully full house of three kids and took a business call in the basement because that was that's always my escape place you know um where it can be a little less noisy and all of a sudden i couldn't talk and i i couldn't figure out what was going on i knew something wasn't right but i i couldn't speak and um all i know is that i hung up the phone at some point because i was embarrassed i was remember thinking there he's gonna think i'm drunk um and uh i hung up the phone and you know the next thing i remember was being in the car with my husband and him saying i don't think we could take you to urgent care i have just very flashes of this day and the next memory is in the trauma bay at the hospital the hospital that i work at where i had seen patients many many times and i'll have to tell you the other thing is the last time i had been in that particular trauma bay was when i brought my then four-year-old daughter in or my husband did i met them via an ambulance after a traumatic brain injury so it was like a very bad place for me although my daughter completely recovered and i remember screaming at my husband that they're wrong they're wrong and i wanted to see the computer because what had happened when they first came in is they thought it was a stroke and so my poor husband was all of a sudden tasked with you know are you going to give her clot busting medication or not because we think she's having a stroke but lo and behold the imaging showed a really large tumor in my brain and then they imaged the rest of me and it turns out i had multiple tumors in my chest um and so you know they presumed you know correctly at that point that this was lung cancer but i also needed emergency brain surgery and this is all you know i i remember most of this by people telling me about it so um anyway the next day i did had a virgin brain surgery and then you know i being a physician in lung cancer you know i was like that can't possibly be you know i have never smoked you know how do i have lung cancer i am the healthiest person i know i remember being in the hospital because of course you know you're on drugs and everything else and and shock and everything and i kept saying look at my nails these are the healthiest nails you've ever seen how can this be a person who's sick because somehow that was like just one example you know of how that's impossible talk about the stages of grief and denial right and being a physician and knowing what lung cancer meant the next thing that came out of my mouth is i want to move to oregon because i was like i know what this means for me and i know what this means for my family and i don't want to play any part in this i don't want them suffering can you tell folks what you mean by that not everybody might understand the implication of what you're saying yeah i wanted to go to oregon because they had physician-assisted suicide because i you know i knew i had treated so many patients with lung cancer i knew the horrible end i knew what this meant you know um especially when it spread yeah and it had spread everywhere i mean i had stage four lung cancer you know the day before i had been fine a hundred percent fine that morning i had exercised vigorously and suddenly i'm in the hospital recovering from a brain surgery being told that i have a rapidly fatal disease and you know all you can think of in that ma moment of panic is your family right and so you know my only thought was i don't want to watch i don't want them to watch me go i want them to remember mom and so i mean there began my so far almost four year journey of a new me you know i cancer changes you so i'm not that person you know and and one of the many things is sometimes at this point in time you know i mourn that person i mean one of the things that i think is very shocking for people to understand is that probably between 12 to 14 percent of people who get lung cancer are not smokers and they all tend to get a certain type of lung cancer you know lung cancer is broadly divided histologically by small cell and large cell or non-small cell i'm sorry and within the non-small cell there's large cell adenocarcinoma squamous cell and most of the people like you who are not smokers get this type of adenocarcinoma non-small cell and it is really shocking to think that given the prevalence of lung cancer and the lethality of lung cancer lung cancer kills more people than any other cancer and i believe that's true for male and female still to think that i mean by far yeah to think that such a high percentage 12 to 14 percent could be non-smokers uh tells us this the severity of this um i also think it's worth reiterating something you've said which is sort of the miracle of the fact that we're sitting here having this discussion four years later the uh median survival meaning if you took you know a hundred people with stage four which means a type of cancer that has spread from its original site of origin and in your case it went to your brain which is a particularly devastating place for this cancer to grow the median survival of people with stage four lung cancer is probably 12 months or less correct well it depends on what kind of lung cancer that you have but yeah i mean um and sometimes even eight months or less um and those were the stats that i knew when i was first diagnosed and you know one of the things that i'll say is non-smoking lung cancer is growing [Music] at scary rates it's being diagnosed and it hits people in their prime it's growing rapidly especially in young women so it's hitting a lot of moms much more common in women than it is in men although it does happen in men happens in caucasian and asian women predominantly and the interesting thing is most of the people that it impacts are thin and in shape or athletes do we have any insight into why no and and it's one of the things that's not being investigated as much you know when you look at okay you know what studies have been out there oh we get the typical you know it's radon it's you know um you know being next to a smoker i never was okay my father was a smoker he quit smoking the day i was born and never went back i was not raised around smoke um so you know you the fact of who it's impacting and and the fact that the the demographics of the people that it's impacting are the healthy people you know unlike what we associate with you know our epidemic of insulin resistance that's not who these people are we know that insulin resistance is responsible for a huge number of cancers and and cancer rises that's not this you know and so you know it's it's young women um and again who have presumably done everything right and it's just it's something that is not getting enough press i know the guardian did a big story about it about a year ago um but otherwise it's not getting the attention it deserves and these women really wind up with two different kinds of cancer they wind up with egfr driven cancer that's epidermal growth factor receptor or they wind up with something called alk-positive cancer i have the egfr specifically something called egfr exon 19 mutation and the thing i didn't know at diagnosis because again i had been focused on obesity and metabolic disease and diabetes for so long um you know i hadn't been seeing as many people with active cancer as i did when i was in primary care and so i was quite frankly behind on some of the newer treatments and newer diagnoses if you will and we're talking the genomics of cancer but for egfr cancer there was something called a targeted therapy this class of medications is called tyrosine kinase inhibitors and you know people can go on them and they can get better okay they can even in many cases have all of the cancer go away okay doesn't mean they're cured though because it always comes back and so after initially you know again going through all these i mean i'll tell you the the denial grief stage well i i wanna i wanna actually ask you exactly about that sarah i i wanna go back to what is it like when you are recovering in the hospital from the brain surgery because i assume they had not taken out the primary tumors in your lungs they were just alleviating the most life-threatening symptom you had at the moment which was a mass inside a part of your body that can't accommodate a mass which is why you had a seizure um so they take that out you're recovering from a surgery that by itself is difficult to recover from but then coupled with the knowledge of here's this disease and my lungs are full of this i what do you remember of those days overwhelming grief to the point of not being able to think and again it's it's you know of course i come and approach everything in life as a mother right i mean and i'm not saying as a mother only like fathers would do the same thing but you approach every problem in life through what it means for your children how old were your children at the time sarah they were 7 12 and 14 and they needed me they still need me um and so the grief is overwhelming about what i quickly realized is i'm gonna break my children's heart and there's not a thing i can do about it and to have that realization because it comes quick and have to sit with that

[01:31:48] is a grief i can't i can't even explain and so i mean initially i just was i couldn't handle the grief i i had to be denial in denial i came home from the hospital i had just been discharged from icu and i walked seven miles the day i got home and my feet was see i can't be sick i i just got out of this brain surgery i'm still on medication i walk seven miles today i'm healthy i don't know what you people are talking about what did your kids know at this time had your husband already spoken with them well sadly enough and i actually didn't find this out until quite a bit later they are the ones who found me in the basement so you know talk about not telling the children we had that was never an option for us so you know they knew i was having surgery that there was a tumor in my brain and that this was cancer this is not good um and that's a lot for a kid to unpack right especially a kid you know again it's hard for any kid to unpack but you know one of the things i remember when my kids were going through each of their own everyone kid goes through it the phase of what if something happens to you mommy what if something happens to you daddy right all kids go through that and the one thing we used to kind of laugh together my husband and i about that say oh honey your mommy and daddy are the healthiest people um we are so healthy you know you don't need to worry about that and and i remember that you know it's one of the one of the first things that you think of when you're put in this situation is oh my god you know they have to unpack this in that context and it's hard to be a team it's hard to be a seven-year-old but to be one whose mother suddenly had a you know diagnosis of advanced cancer and we it was hard decision on what to do but you know in talking and how do we handle the kids but the one thing we decided together i mean my husband and i um is that we were never going to lie to them you know we were always going to tell them the truth because i thought that the worst thing for a kid is to constantly be wondering if something if there's going to be a huge shoe that drops and so we told them we tried to open up the lines of communication they mostly didn't want to talk about it but we told them that we were making that promise to them and we have never never gone back on that problem and promise and never will i mean that's one that it's really important to me we may delay telling them something for a little bit until we really know the facts but as soon as we really know the facts they're going to hear about it so um anyway i mean you know and over time in grief you learn to accept many things you know my husband and i our dream had been to um retire to a farm and make um gourmet butter like that's what we were gonna do that was gonna be the second career right and you learn to make peace with that's not the case anymore you know our we always used to joke that the way we wanted to die was 95 years old on the way home from a skiing trip in a fiery car accident where our kids would not have to deal with the bodies right the creepers wanted to make sure it was on the way home a twofer it was going to be on the way home because we were going to be having fun up until that point um and um you know you so that's acceptance you know you're not going to retire you're not going to have all these things but you can't accept that you're not going to be a mom impossible now at some point i'm guessing kind of the problem solver in you started saying like hey i i'm going to learn as much as can be known about this and we're going to talk about this in the context of the asymmetry that exists i just had a discussion about this with you know we have a weekly meeting in our practice with all the providers and you know we just had this weird situation recently where you know basically a patient of ours who has another physician uh was kind of caught in the middle of a recommendation that turned out not to be the right recommendation and you know we were able to get them a referral to somebody else who basically got them out of a very unnecessary surgery and we were just sort of thinking man like we're so glad that that patient was able to dodge that bullet you know they were going to have surgery that they totally didn't need that's a very big surgery with lots of risks and we realized like the asymmetry of knowledge in medicine is so overwhelming that it is it it's it's it's not even just about money or education outside of medicine like a smart person still has a hard time digesting medical literature um and i know like i said we're going to talk about this but i i you know you very quickly must have figured out hey i have this egfr 19 deletion [Music] so we no longer talk about this as you have lung cancer or you have adeno or you have non-small cell we're really going to refer to it by its mutation and everything will come down to how do we treat that how long was that process for you to say i'm gonna i don't know if this is the right word but i'm gonna partition my grief and my problem-solving brains and i'll i'll do both of them but i'll i'll you know i'll move back and forth pretty quick it happened pretty quick um which is okay you know this is terminal right you have to come to to grasp with that but terminal when right and what can i do to control the when but when you say that sarah did you really come to that realization so soon because technically life is terminal i mean there's nobody listening to this podcast watching this video who isn't going to die so that's all terminal but when you say that do you mean that immediately and without question or reservation you felt that you would not live a normal life expectancy there was no hail mary out there that was gonna you know take you to being the 95 year old um yeah i mean i i think just the reading and understanding although the advances that that this was going to be terminal really soon you know in my life and i was only 46 at the time and you know my first thing was just please let me make it to 50. i'm 49. you're gonna be 50 soon yeah i'm going to be 50. um in the not too distant future so you know that was like my first one was just like okay let's let's but right from the beginning i'll tell you the when was 11 years okay and and that has not left i just i don't need to re be 95 i can accept all those things that i'm going to miss out on by not growing old i just need 11 years which to everyone was unrealistic but why 11 years because my youngest would be graduated so so immediately my goal was i can't settle for less than 11 years i have to make it to 11 years and so in became that like my war cry 11 years 11 years i have to make it 11 years and so you know it started i mean and and that started me on a path of so much so the first thing i thought in reading all the i mean read everything is i got to get this primary tumor out you know i'm considered inoperable but we know that having this primary tumor here increases my risk for mutations okay remember i said that the tyrosine kinase inhibitors or the tkis they work amazingly well but only so long you know somewhere between eight and say you know on average eight and with the more um advanced ones you know at the long end is like you know 24 to 30 months okay um so that's not enough time that doesn't get me to 11. so i was like okay you know this is increasing the risk for mutation which is how these develop resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors and remind me sarah you uh because i remember you emailing me probably by august and and starting to you know explain some of the details you had your biggest tumor was like five centimeters that's a monster tumor how how many tumors did you have it was six centimeters or you had six tumors i had it was six centimeters wow which is amazing in the sense that i never had pain from it you know it never i never had a cough probably because you were so healthy i think so because you know i this talk about being caught out of the blue you know there just wasn't this premonition of something is awry and i'm just not addressing it and so the standard of care sorry to interrupt was just that you know we typically don't operate on patients with metastatic tumors it's it doesn't the only reason they operated on your brain was it was an acute way to save your life i think it's hard for patients listening to this to understand that but that's sort of the that's the playbook in oncology right when a patient shows up with metastatic cancer they're considered not surgical candidates and this was the exception and not the rule you were going to be dead probably within days if they didn't operate on your brain but all this time afterwards you still have these this burden of tumors in your lung and now the question is can we improve your prognosis and maybe that doesn't mean you live to 95 but can we reduce can we make your cancer less resistant to therapy by taking the majority of the cancer cells out of your body right you know um and and decreasing the tumor burden because really quickly the tki got rid of every single small tumor i had them throughout you know like paint splatters on throughout both lungs and they were gone in a matter of weeks that's staggering isn't it i mean it is it's it's remarkable but the you know again the primary tumor was huge so um i had unfortunately the large tumor in my brain was not the only one i had two other ones that they radiated they didn't need to be surgically removed they were small they could be radiated and then i set about trying to find someone who would take out this primary tumor um can i can i ask you about the stereotactic radiation sarah that's i mean we glossed over that but that's not a benign process either did you suffer nausea from that what how difficult was your stereotactic treatment did you take it all in stride i did great with the treatment to the brain i didn't have any issues you know i did have issues at the beginning but they were more to the tki you know one of the things with every specialist that i saw you know they couldn't believe it or they told me if i saw them earlier it wasn't going to happen you know at least you'll keep your hair all my hair fell out like it wasn't supposed to happen like your hair is not supposed to fall out with tki's all my hair fell out anyway so the brain radiation went fine um and then i met a surgeon who was going to take out the primary tumor for the reasons that i was saying we just anything to decrease the risk of you know developing a mutation that keeps me from being sensitive to the tkis and so i went in you know for surgery in september and i can remember her saying we're gonna take this tumor out we're going to take out your right upper lobe unless of course we've seen that there's disease in the mediastinum but there was no disease on the pet scan in the mediastinum so she was feeling pretty positive about being able to take that out but i knew for several weeks beforehand that that was a possibility and just so folks know what we're saying on the on the right hand side you've got these three lobes here but they drain into these lymph nodes that are in this middle structure called the mediastinum and so you had this monster tumor that was going to require the entire upper right lobe to be taken out but if the surgeon felt that on visual inspection at least or maybe even sampling nodes that any of those nodes had cancer it was her opinion that this is really futile because now we know it's already escaped the lung it doesn't matter so so you went into that surgery knowing you could wake up with a huge scar in your chest chest tubes coming out and the cancer is still in you right and that happened um and that was i mean it was terrible i mean you know i kept apparently you know under the influence i mean everyone told me i was so hysterical screaming in the recovery room i'm a mom you can't let this happen to me i'm a mom that's all i kept saying and i of course don't remember any of this but they had to actually take me away put me in a private room and and that was all that i kept saying and um so you know i had to come home and learned to accept that um i now was bald and i was definitely fell into a deep depression but at the same time you know i refuse to completely give up i mean like for example i went back to work at the clinic the same month that i had brain surgery you know which sounds crazy but this is part of this whole process and then but after the surgery failure i i mean i was it was that was terrible um and then i didn't really recover back into my determined place until a really very specific moment and that was just a couple of weeks before my diagnosis i had been selected to be an aspen health innovator fellow which was i mean this is among the higher highest honors for your work you know this is the aspen institute is you know a place that brings together thinkers in all kinds of disciplines and you know to be chosen to represent people who are innovating in the healthcare space was i mean such an honor and in order to do that you had to commit to four weeks of leadership sessions in the next two years which of course at the time i was like of course sign me up but as that first session inched closer it was in november i i was so what do i do i couldn't make up my mind i literally didn't make up my mind for sure until i sat i got on the airplane and because i was ready to run back because it was like i'm going to leave my kids for almost a week i have terminal cancer and at that point i decided you can live feeling sorry for yourself and of all the things that you're going to lose or you can go out and live and your kids are going to be better for it this is what really made me decide your kids are going to be better if you choose to live and so that was the moment sitting on that plane seat crying never i've cried on a lot of planes since this diagnosis deciding i just chose to live this was a moment i made my choice now i got to stick with it and that's how i've tried to live my life since then because i you know i have a platform i had a platform i had done what i feel was a lot of good for a lot of people and it wasn't finished and i knew that this was good for my children and i'll tell you one of the most impactful moments of my whole life happened before my diagnosis and it was one of these times where we were at the dinner table and the lottery happened to be one of those you know hyper-inflated lotteries oh my god you can win you know bajillion dollars and so my husband and i were at the dinner table joking around about it right i mean we don't play the lottery but we were joking maybe we should buy tickets you know we could retire we could retire and here at the time was my 13 year old son at the dinner table and he got really upset about us discussing this you can't retire mom you're doing so much good for the world how could you even think of it i've never been so that is a defining moment in my life and and like i was like oh my god you know at the time i just i was so taken aback by that and certainly that weighed heavily on my decision to get on that plane and to continue doing what i'm doing and what i'm doing has morphed since my cancer diagnosis into an even greater focus on health equity because of my experience as a cancer patient and someone who is privileged because i'll tell you you have a much greater chance of surviving cancer if you are uh has privilege uh you know one of the lucky ones and i didn't realize the stark differences until i became a patient want to talk about that in some detail sarah but i want to also understand how it is that we're still talking today frankly in other words how have you managed to um stay in an equilibrium with this disease right i've always i mean let me let me share with you a couple of things that i i i've always struggled with when thinking about cancer i i'm not fond of the language that we sometimes use around cancer and that we beat cancer and that you know we can't give up and things like that because it almost suggests that the patients who don't survive cancer have somehow given up and i i just i i i just don't find that in my experience uh having taken care of many patients with cancer to be true i think um i just you know it doesn't make sense to me um and i think the way that you said it and described it earlier makes the most sense which is basically finding a way to co-exist with your cancer for as long as possible um and you've exceeded all odds i i want to kind of understand that journey a little bit more um you know it's it's one thing to to go through the tyrosine kinase inhibitor have this immediate response um that's remarkable but then get this set back you know three months later where your primary is not only still there but you actually realize now there's there's media style involvement um which basically means there's no question you have cancer cells elsewhere in your body it's not like they stop when they get to the lymph nodes so pick the story up for us in terms of what your ongoing treatment has been life like how have you stayed in this in this state of uh of equilibrium so to speak yeah so i haven't okay um on many occasions i haven't um uh but so so after the surgery um the next thing that happened is they found another brain tumor um there's argument as to whether it was there from the get-go or um uh whether um it was something new um but either way they decided it would be considered um that the first line tki that they had put me on had failed me um and so i got switched to i got more radiation to the brain and i was switched to um the newest tki happens to be called asamartneb or tregrisso i was put on that in november right before i went off for my first aspen leadership conference and i had decided that i do not accept being a sitting duck because what the cancer world then you know wants is for a patient like me to just sit and wait for the cancer to come back right that's what you're doing you know it's coming back there's no question about it and you know what's coming back soon and you know you are just waiting and i couldn't accept that as a mother i think i could accept it as a human but i couldn't accept it as a mother and so i went on a journey to find someone who could treat me in the most aggressive way possible who shared my view that sitting around and waiting for this to come back was totally unacceptable i traveled the country i saw everybody let me tell you first of all of course that shows i have means to do that right that a lot of other people don't and i actually along the way met another mother physician my age just a bit younger younger kids who had the same attitude towards it i refused to accept this we sort of became a team so to speak and wound up by complete serendipity meeting a group of physicians who really felt that the way to treat this long term was to be constantly battling it with something new so in other words you know the cancer dogma right now is you put people on something at the highest dose possible and you keep going until it doesn't work anymore that that's how we deal with cancer and then we switch and it's the same thing over again and the idea is what if we hit it with less and then change it up all the time right and this goes to the idea of beating the mutations before they can get you so thankfully i had a physician here at home who was willing to say okay that that is worth a shot february of 2018 2019 okay because it took a long time to get to this point right of searching trying to find something i started chemo um regular chemo i went through the regular cycles of chemo and then when i was done with that i immediately went to anti-estrogen therapy okay because i had a very specific mutation besides the egfr1 and there was a medication to treat it it just so happened to be a breast cancer medication but it was the same mutation for either cancer so immediately upon stopping um the chemo i went on the anti-estrogen therapy so i was put into early menopause with the number of you know regular medications lupron full of strand and then i was started on a medication called pablocyclib okay which again is primarily a breast cancer medication but was targeting one of my very specific secondary mutations i was on that for the summer and all this time i'm still on the tagrasso or asamartanib that never stopped as soon as the eight weeks of that was over with i went back on chemo but very different low dose chemo single agent very low dose which agent so the first one was cis platinum okay and you know everyone says oh cisplatin you know you're you know you're gonna do terrible on this i mean this is harsh it and it is but you know i did fine i did fine i was able to still you know i mean i'm not saying i wasn't tired you know i've basically been nauseous for the last four almost four years every single day you know it's just you learn to manage that you know so i learned to manage it i learned to manage you know being tired um and the things that came along i still traveled for work i still did i was still able to do everything um i just i can't imagine i can't i like i could tell you some really crazy stories of of things i had to do while traveling to accommodate how i was feeling that nobody knew about at the time but anyway um some really wacky stuff that you do but you just you manage you you figure it out right you improvise lots of improvising um and then um i got switched to another after eight weeks got switched to gem cytobeam or gemzar which again these are so crazy you just don't think of this because that's a drug that's typically used in pancreatic cancer right well yeah and it can be used in lung cancer i mean it just depends on the mutation i think that's the point right right right right yeah um that believe it or not there's no standard chemo for lung cancer it's can you believe that there's not a standard like standard of care regimen so the thing is i wasn't doing any outlandish things here okay these are all treatments for lung cancer okay i mean like like you said gems are is used more for other things but this is not an outlandish thing that's never heard of for lung cancer i mean same with cisplatin i mean um none of these things are you know you know i was oh my goodness we're gonna you know do something you know that's never ever been done before you know so to speak and at this point which is now the fall of 2019 where if you go and get a pet scan where do you actually have tumor in your body at this point so yeah let me back up for a second because well the quick answer is i had no tumor okay there was no tumor anywhere and to back up is that the tagrisso this is pre-chemo had stopped shrinking my primary tumor in march of 2018. so this was you know almost a year before i began chemo and so since they wouldn't surgically operate it to get it out i had it radiated again you know i was lucky enough to have a radiation oncologist who worked with me and um and like i said i tolerated brain chemo well the same was not the case brain radiation for lung to the lung yeah the radiation i had real issues um and interestingly enough you know we were leaving for to hike the inca trail in may of that year so i had had radiation that we were leaving to hike the inca trail and i started having kind of bad chest pain it was like like a day or two before we hiked the ink trail i was like okay i'm sure this is just reflux i'm gonna take some reflux medication and then i was like look okay if it's not if it's more you know what a better place to die than surrounded by your family you know on the inca trail and all the beauties of the andes mountains okay i can accept this let's go you know i didn't even tell anyone i was like going forward and um did that successfully you know um it was great my eight-year-old toodling along you know she was always the fastest of any of us we went with our friends and um uh i mean amazing experience i just have to say that those things especially if you can get kids in it i'll never forget that when we all got back and we went and checked into the jw because we were like give me a shower a very clean bed in a spa my middle child my daughter said to all of the adults i developed my third eye during that it was one of those experiences like you don't normally think you're going to get that out of a you know she was what 14 at the time you know that's that we were all like what but anyway so it was a super special time i was still having pain and then my rest of my family flew home i actually had to fly um from lisbon to switzerland because i had a conference i had to go to and at that conference thing started to get really bad um i made it through but you know not with again some funny stories that of how i accommodated to it because i was having crushing pain that homes turns out of course i had some rare i had this rare complication where actually impacted my bones and my radiation oncologist said the only treatment for this is to put you on long-term opioid therapy and i was like oh no thanks i will accommodate there was no way i was doing that so i had to get through that which was a which that was a little bit of a saga but anyway i had no disease then after that radiation none and so i was in this state they call it nad or ned excuse me no evidence of disease i like to always say ned right i hadn't i was ned for a really long time i had no evidence of disease it was a great place to be right still on treatment still trying to do everything to keep this from coming back and started gemsar and you know everybody had said all these terrible things about cisplatin and gemsar was 10 times worse everyone was like you'll be a breeze gems r is a breeze compared to cisplatin you you are really the exact opposite of everybody because yeah i mean we used to tell patients gems are is it's non-chemo yeah yeah everybody tolerates gems are i can still remember sitting because i was too feeling too crappy to drive my mother driving to pick me up to take me to chemo one day sitting on my front porch and throwing up in a plant on the way to chemo there are nutrients in there sarah that are very good for the plant so i wouldn't i wouldn't yeah right about that that's very it's very healthy part of the carbon cycle i'm sure but i was determined to you know keep on i was really close to getting switched to taxals which you know i'm like this is gonna that'll be better um and um so then had to take another trip um for another meeting and had lots of friends there and i can remember them standing behind me after we had eaten and they were pushing me up this hill in san francisco because i literally couldn't walk and i kept thinking to myself i'm a hypochondriac this is just because i'm anemic you know whatever i was super short of breath but i'm like okay i had convinced myself i was making it all up in my mind i fly back from that trip and the very next morning head in for chemo and they immediately said oh my god no chemo you know everything is a mess my i you know my liver numbers were through the roof my kidney numbers were you know high um i had pan cytopedia so bad um how anemic were you sarah so i was like six at this point okay i mean it was bad you know really bad the low sixes at this point right and just so the listener understands yeah the the normal would be 13 or 14 of the hemoglobin in your six so that's really low and your platelets were how low 23 which means you basically don't have the ability to form a single clot right you know i was a disaster and the funny thing is i was still up and doing okay you know what i mean i was tired i was shortness of breath with activity but i was doing okay and they sent me home and i was like that doesn't seem right am i crazy that i shouldn't be home so of course i call some of my other physician friends aha privilege right because i was getting sent home and they're like oh my god we're admitting you right now right so i actually get a backdoor admission to the hospital and a complete workup starting right then you know i had to be i had to have a thoracentesis drained a whole bunch from my lungs that was unknown when i got sent home so you had tons of fluid around your lungs that's tons of spoiled around lots of breath yeah um and once i was admitted i was promptly transferred to icu things were going downhill i had to be put on bypass so i had multi-organ failure i you know had respiratory failure liver failure kidney failure i was a big failure okay everything was bad and was this believed to be the result of your body's response to the tumor or the chemo it was the gems are so i got taken care of in the hospital i i just want to cry to think about the care i got it was so wonderful you know and i got i just had the best team i would have died you know nobody can believe that this was well over a year ago now and i'm healthy with no persistent failures um because i was near death you know and um i was in the icu for a really long time and everyone every day it went from i think your kidneys will rebound to 50 50. they're never going to be normal i was on plasmophoresis and it turned out i had something called atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and you know to just explain you know over 70 percent of people are either dead or on dialysis you know right away i mean it's it's got an incredible mortality right incredible it's incredibly difficult to treat um uh and so you know outcomes are you're dead or you're on permanent dialysis um and so i was put on a new medication after you know going through kidney biopsies all these kinds of things in the hospital um sent home uh did outpatient plasmophoresis for a while um and then things miraculously started getting better right not miraculously it was because of this medication i was put on um of course that meant an infusion every eight weeks and the worst part to me is it meant no one would put me back on chemo just just they wouldn't put you on gems or they wouldn't put you on anything wouldn't put me on anything and to me that was devastating because i said you know well kidney failure is one thing but you know having this cancer that we know come back is another so that was another hard pill to swallow and you know long story short i got better i went to um genetic pharmacogenetics which is where they actually take a look at what your genetic profile is in in response to different drugs and it turns out i had a genetic mutation hey i have lots of them it turns out i had a genetic mutation that didn't allow the gems are to break down so i was getting toxic doses of this and i was on a very low dose but the thing is that um i couldn't get rid of it so normally if you see atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome with gems are it's after months and months of treatment and i got this within four weeks why because i was getting mega doses of it because my body couldn't get rid of it due to this mutation was the explanation so you know and they said there's no reason you can't take any other chemo this is very specific to gems are but that was that sit in weight mode back to sit in weight mode and it took another year but the cancer came back in september of 2020 and

[02:13:10] here's my story from that which really made me so determined to work even harder for health equity here i am a physician able to grasp really difficult concepts able to read and scour the literature and know what i'm looking for able to call at a moment time you know anytime someone to help me sort through something i didn't understand or help maybe refer me to someone you know i had all the resources in the world and the reoccurrence was in september even with all my constant pushing and self-advocacy okay the one thing is i had by by the time i was diagnosed with cancer i was an expert patient advocate expert hardcore and you know one of the other advantages i had is it didn't take much to switch that and to become a self-advocate an advocate for myself so i was diagnosed in mid-september with a reoccurrence i did not get on a clinical trial until um i got started december 30th that's a four month delay that's a four-month delay for me and in hindsight now looking back before i was panicked right and i couldn't really i was like something has to get done something has to get done something has to get done i can look back in hindsight and say how many people die during that time how many people who don't have the advantages i had just die during that delay how many i shudder and i i just want to cry and what i've done is i've reached out to other cancer patients to say has anyone else been in this situation and i find out it happens all of the time it seems that we have a really good system as i experienced when someone is diagnosed with cancer they get a health nap a cancer navigator you know they get all these things and we're boom boom boom boom but when that cancer comes back it's kind of like the system seems to give up on you i had to advocate advocate the heck out of getting a biopsy done a biopsy that would be enough tissue to make me eligible for a clinical trial that would actually get me a full genomics report i mean that wasn't going to happen i'm telling you i had to get almost obnoxious about it and the stories that i'm getting from people are the same where was the recurrence in my right upper lobe so they had to get you had to get another lung biopsy to to do this and and can i ask you another thing sarah what has been you obviously have health insurance but i assume that there's been a non-trivial amount of out-of-pocket costs as well in the last four years oh yeah do you have a sense of what the out-of-pocket cost has been for your care tens of thousands of dollars which obviously speaks to another challenge um i don't know if this is still true but it certainly was true at one point that the greatest source of personal bankruptcy in the united states is healthcare uh an inability to pay health healthcare costs and a cancer diagnosis is so high up there i would have to believe that cancer is the leading subset of that as well so you know it just so now i'm like especially when i got feedback that i'm not alone in this it wasn't just me you know and again i always keep saying in the backdrop of i am um one of the privileged and and i was put in this situation and the fact of the matter is by the time the reoccurrence was diagnosed to the time i finally got treated i had progressed so much that i had compression in my bronchus i couldn't get up a flight of stairs without desaturating i mean this all just happened i was in horrible shape which of course again and remember i'm starting out you know before my diagnosis in general i was so healthy and so it just is which gives me an advantage in this which gives me a significant advantage in this but it goes back to that question of how many people just die sarah you're very um realistic about the fact that your time on this earth is less than it should be right a a 49 year old otherwise healthy person who's done all the you know done the right things for their health should have another 40 years on this planet and at least statistically speaking that's that's not doesn't seem likely it suggests to me that you're very cognizant of how you spend your time uh so i should take a moment to thank you for spending a couple hours with me here but how do you now think about the time that you allocate to your family to your work in the diabetes community and now to this third important pillar to you which is cancer advocacy how are you how are you how are you managing that and how do you how do you think about how to even balance that because i think time is the most important currency i think everybody can appreciate that in a vague sense it is the great equalizer um but of course most of us can't appreciate it the way you can because you have a real visceral appreciation for it that comes exactly with this type of an illness and so therefore i think that your appreciation for the balancing act of what you described earlier which is living your life to the fullest regardless of its duration that's your legacy that's what your kids are going to remember about their mom being the advocate for other patients so that in 10 years when another sarah halberg gets this diagnosis even if she doesn't have your education or your means she can have an extension of life the way you do i it's it's a bit overwhelming for me to think about how i would do that because as i put myself in your shoes my intuition is i'd want to retreat from everything outside of life everything outside of my family like i i would imagine uh and it's hard to put yourself in another person's shoes without being there but my intuition is i would say i don't care about anything outside of the walls of this house and i would take a selfish approach in some ways i think and you've done this very selfless thing which is continuing to sort of prioritize everything else as well how do you do that well a couple of things you know number one believe it or not originally it was it was actually hard to be around my kids when i was so deep in grief because and that sounds crazy right that sounds counterintuitive but they reminded me of everything i was going to lose right they were the they were what i didn't want to lose and so it was challenging and i i knew i had to overcome that you know and that that that was that was a big motivator for me to not be you know thinking about that um in thinking in that way and i i'm happy to say i i clearly have overcome that but um my kids come first you know i'll drop anything and everything if they need me now but i also think again and i go back to sort of what i alluded to before they need to see me um not letting not getting knocked out by the stressors and bad things in life you know i mean bad things happen to good people you know like i said there's been a pivot in every part of my career based on anger and i certainly am angry about this but what do you do with it that's that's what's going to be the important question in life you can take anger you can take all these things and you can get lost and buried in it okay or you can try to turn it into you know something else and i have to say i haven't become as big a cancer advocate yet and i'm working on it but the reason for that is and this was a question i had to ask myself a long time ago which is shouldn't you be a cancer advocate now was but i have a platform for diabetes and damn it that's important too all these people suffering from this is important so i can't just say i'm gonna switch away from a platform that i have to one where i don't yet it doesn't mean i'm ignoring it but it's like it makes me wanna work more again for health equity because it spans both right it has to do with both diabetes um and cancer you know um and and that is so important so yeah how i spend my time is really critical and i want to say it's not like i'm i don't want to paint the picture that oh my gosh i'm the superwoman i have a terminal cancer and yay life is great no you know when people ask how i'm doing okay if i say okay you know i'm doing okay there's never good or never great okay and that's just where i live right now i'm definitely not sitting around and feeling sorry for myself okay definitely not not enjoying things in life but great is hard to think about you know great is hard to think about now and you know the some people say well so cancer really helped me get a new perspective on life and what i care about and you know i'm happy to say i don't know that i got that okay i mean having cancer sucks and i'm still mad about it and you know sometimes i have to sit and have a pity party every once in a while because the fact of the matter is i loved my life pre-cancer and i think i was living every minute of it i think i cherished my children i cherished vacations i mean you know that i cherish travel and showing my children travel and that's you know that's a bit of a wonderful thing and it's also like a dagger too it's not like i've gotten some new life and new perspective that's so different from my old damn it i liked my old life and i liked the old me and it's still a little hard to get used to who this person is now she's still motivated she still exercises although not doing the things i used to she loves her children with as much passion as one could have but i'm i'm fundamentally different it's tough sarah you've uh [Music] you know you've you've said a lot of things that uh obviously resonate um um and i think we'll will resonate with a lot of people so i um you know i want to thank you from the bottom of my heart and uh
