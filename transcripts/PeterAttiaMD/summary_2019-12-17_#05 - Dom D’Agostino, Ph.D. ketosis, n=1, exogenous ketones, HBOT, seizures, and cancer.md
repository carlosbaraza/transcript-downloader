## Description

Original release date: 7/16/2018

In this episode, Dom D’Agostino, one of the smartest people on all things related to ketones, digs deep into the research and application of these molecules. We discuss ketone esters, diesters and monoesters, racemic ketones, medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), C8 (caprylic acid) on the exogenous ketone (EK) side of things. We also cover a lot of Dom’s fascinating work with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). Dom also discusses the strategy and tactics of the metabolic management of cancer, which includes, but is certainly not limited to, a ketogenic diet (KD). Cancer is covered throughout this episode, but if there’s one section to listen to, skip ahead to the 2-hour mark and listen to what Dom has to say about the Press-Pulse approach.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode with Dom D'Agostino:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Dominic D'Agostino, a neuroscience researcher specializing in ketosis, cancer metabolism, and hyperbaric medicine. The discussion covers the mechanisms of ketosis, exogenous ketones, cancer metabolism, and therapeutic applications. Key focus areas include the metabolic approach to cancer treatment and the evolution of understanding ketones as both fuel sources and signaling molecules.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Cancer cells produce excess superoxide anion under hyperbaric conditions [11:30]
- Ketones can replace up to 60% of brain energy needs during fasting [54:00]
- Glucose-Ketone Index should be maintained between 1-2 for cancer therapy [2:06:00]
- MCT oils can elevate ketones to 0.5-1.0 millimolar even with carbohydrate consumption [1:10:54]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Consider time-restricted feeding for metabolic health [2:06:37]
- Monitor glucose-ketone index for metabolic health [2:06:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Cancer therapy approach combining ketogenic diet with hyperbaric oxygen [2:12:53]
- Avoid antioxidant supplementation during cancer treatment [2:19:07]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Metformin: 500-2000mg daily for metabolic support [2:20:03]
- MCT oil: Can work up to 150ml daily with proper adaptation [1:15:15]
- IV Vitamin C: 25-100g for cancer therapy [2:16:50]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Maintained deadlift strength (500lbs x 10 reps) during 7-day fast [2:29:33]
- Low-intensity exercise recommended during cancer treatment [2:08:35]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Modified ketogenic diet: 25-30% protein [1:00:42]
- Time-restricted feeding window of 6 hours recommended [2:06:37]
- MCT supplementation can enhance ketone production [1:09:03]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Glucose-Ketone Index (GKI) should be 1-2 for therapeutic ketosis [2:06:00]
- Blood BHB measurements preferred over urine testing [1:27:45]
- FDG-PET scan recommended for assessing cancer metabolism [2:01:51]

8. **References & Resources**:
- ketonutrition.org website mentioned [2:37:10]
- Metabolic Health Summit announced [2:37:55]
- Nature paper on aspartate metabolism in cancer [1:06:48]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"The ketogenic potency is inversely proportional to taste." [1:49:55]
"Mitochondrial health and vitality would be the ultimate tumor suppressor." [2:34:31]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Long-term effects of racemic vs. D/L ketone supplementation
- Optimal timing of hyperbaric oxygen therapy with other cancer treatments
- Role of ketones in epigenetic regulation of other genetic conditions
