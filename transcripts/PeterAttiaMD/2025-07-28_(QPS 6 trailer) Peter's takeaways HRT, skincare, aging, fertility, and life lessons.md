## Transcript

[00:00:05] This would be the one where I've had the greatest change in my personal behavior. >> Highlight things you found really interesting. Anything you changed your mind on how you work with patients. >> Lazy and Peter don't typically go in the same sentence except when talking about skinincare. Actually, we came away with something pretty easy, right? Which is an AM and a PM protocol. Males are often the driver of fertility issues. To think that threearters of men are not even evaluated for fertility issues before proceeding to that is crazy. RAPA is being investigated as a potential drug to extend the fertility years in a woman. So if it's uh slowing the aging process of the human, is there a chance it's slowing the aging process of the egg? The estrogen drop during menopause is a major accelerator of facial bone and fat loss. and that women should really be talking about HRT early. The point can't be overstated that the role it plays in skin health and bone health.

[00:01:04] Nobody should ever die of ASVD. Like full stop, no chance. If you were walking around with an APOB of 30 and normal blood pressure um and you weren't smoking, I almost impossible to die of a heart attack truthfully. Honestly, I think a good life is what makes a good death. Anybody who's listening to this still has something that they can do about it.
