## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this clip from The Drive podcast:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features a discussion between Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Sean Mackey about muscle relaxants and pain medications, with a particular focus on Baclofen and Gabapentin (Neurontin). They explore the use cases, benefits, and limitations of these medications in treating various types of pain, from acute to chronic conditions. The conversation provides detailed insights into dosing strategies, safety profiles, and the context-specific nature of pain management.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Baclofen is described as a relatively safe muscle relaxant that's not habit-forming [00:01:23]
- Gabapentin has no lethal dose and works on the alpha 2 delta subunit of calcium channels [00:06:07]
- Maximum Gabapentin absorption is 900-1000mg per dose due to active transport system limitations [00:08:54]
- Chronic pain is defined as "pain that persists beyond the expected time of tissue healing" [00:10:31]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider context-specific healing timeframes before diagnosing chronic pain [00:10:31]
- Monitor medication benefits and consider weaning if not providing clear benefit [00:03:49]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Baclofen use for acute muscle issues (e.g., sleeping wrong, long drives) [00:00:49]
- Higher evening doses of pain medication to aid sleep [00:07:56]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- Baclofen: 20mg 2-3x daily, up to 80mg daily [00:03:49]
- Gabapentin: 300-600mg during day, higher evening dose [00:07:56]
- Pregabalin (mentioned as Gabapentin alternative) [00:05:16]

Warnings:
- Sedation risk with muscle relaxants [00:02:28]
- Fall risk, especially in elderly patients [00:06:53]
- Don't operate heavy machinery while on these medications [00:06:07]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Everything I'm doing is taken in the context of the person in front of me and the cost and benefit of the treatments I'm providing them." [00:02:28]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the long-term effects of Baclofen use?
2. How does Pregabalin compare to Gabapentin in terms of sleep architecture?
3. What are the specific protocols for transitioning from Gabapentin to Pregabalin?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] I want to talk about muscle relaxants. So the other thing that has been a real uh favorite tool of mine is blephin. Now it's not a particularly potent muscle relaxing. Um but it seems to for me and for the patients of mine in whom it works offer something that something really potent like volume doesn't bring all the baggage of of of a benzo. Yeah. or even a flexer where you can kind of get the drowsiness and frankly a lot of people just I mean I used to even get nauseous on flex roll but something about blephin I don't even know it's in me at 20 milligrams twice a day but it actually takes the edge off and where I typically find this beneficial is if I slept wrong and I get a kink in my trap

[00:00:49] Yeah or I've been on a super long drive and my QLS sort of flare a little bit and I know that if I had all the time in the world, I could go and stretch my way out of that. But sometimes I just don't have that time and I need to kind of get right back to doing something awful like sitting and just, you know, two or three days of 20 milligrams of backin B with a little NSAID and like I'm as good as new and I save myself the, you know, the real flare up. So what what are your experience with muscle relaxants?

[00:01:23] Beautiful case example by the way for yourself of how we would use those. Um, blephin is one of the safest to use. It is not habit forming like the somas. Yep. And others that can be uh like a barbbiturate can act and people can get highly psychologically dependent on them. The flexerils have a uh anti- have a triccyclic anti-depressant property about them that may sometimes be helpful for people in various mixed pain states but also can cause sedation. Y the blephin seems to be pretty benign. Um we don't typically use muscle relaxants for longterm chronic conditions. The data hasn't borne out. Now, with that said, so how many days are you comfortable with a person Oh, I'm I'm comfortable with a person being on backlan all their life to be. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's just everything I'm doing I I know I'm

[00:02:28] Forgive me if I'm preaching to the choir here. Everything I'm doing is taken in the context of the person in front of me and the cost and benefit of the treatments I'm providing them. Meaning there are costs with Backin. I don't mean monetary cost. It can cause sedation. What do typically or is it just individual? Like I think it's it's individual and obviously it is dose dependent. The higher doses more sedation. Um we can use blephin intratheally. We put in intratheal pumps for blephin. Uh this is a beautiful lifesaving minimal surgery that we do um for people with a spinal cord injury, intractable spasticity uh because to get the spasms under control with oral doses, you just can't get there. So we we put thread a little catheter into the CSF and we deliver blephin that way. Now, it again is a clean relative relatively safe medication, but I'm always evaluating long-term. Is this person getting benefit from this? Should we be talking about dialing it back and trying to wean? And if they're not getting benefit, then why should they stay on the medication? And I I know you do the same types of things in your practice.

[00:03:49] So um we use it we can use it in acute subacute we'll use it in some chronic conditions uh as a trial what's a trial month two months okay and then we monitor data on every single person and what dose are you comfortable up to 20 milligrams three times a day yeah up to 80 milligrams I believe is kind of the upper end I don't usually get there okay um you alluded to Neurontin earlier and you alluded to the fact that it played a role in my recovery because once we got the big stuff out of the way. I still had a couple of years of peripheral nerve injury. Yeah. And the only way to put the fire out in my foot was Neurontin. And unfortunately, it was initially it required four grams a day.

[00:04:35] I was taking a gram four times a day or something like that. Yeah. And the good news is it worked. The bad news is you're pretty much always tired. So I was very happy over time to get that dose down. And I think within 18 months I was completely off the neurontin and lo and behold never experienced although interestingly maybe once every year I get like an enormous surge of fire into that same foot literally one shot of flame that lasts seconds and it's gone but essentially never again right um is neurontin still a very powerful tool in the use of neuropathic pain you alluded to other drugs like anti-depressants as

[00:05:16] Well, um, in addition to a rather impetent anti-seizure med, but yeah, what else what else do you have at your disposal for this type of pain? The beauty of Neurontin or Gabapentin and it's um cousin pregablin uh which was introduced immediately after gabapentin's patent ran out. So conveniently, very conveniently um both have the same mechanism of action. They work on the alpha 2 delta subunit of a calcium channel in the spinal cord in the brain. That's a little um too jargony and technical, but think of them as agents that turn down uh the signals that are heading out that are in the spinal cord being processed and in the brain. So, they're really not impacting your nerve out out here or in your leg.

[00:06:07] Um they can be very effective. The beauty of these two drugs is uh there's no lethal dose. Like the only way they could kill the rats when they were studying it was to drown them in it. Yeah. I used to say or hit them over the head with the tablets. And I would tell a patient somewhat jokingly, the only way you can be hurt taking this drug is if you're struck by a truck that's carrying it. Um it's a little bit more nuanced than that because there are side effects. Yep. You can fall asleep driving. You can fall asleep driving. I tell people don't operate heavy machinery. Don't go, you know, doom buggy riding. don't blah blah blah. Um there is and in elderly patients in particular uh I warn them about falls because you can get a little unstable.

[00:06:53] Now pregablin can also lead to weight gain, right? Doesn't it also increase appetite? Both. Well, it's more I see water retention. Got it. I see a little peripheral edema in both. And they also both enhance sleep especially pregablin. And so there's there's a little bit of an added benefit to patients who were using these to also put the pain out at night when it can be most noticeable. Um there was actually a study I I I don't know if I'll ever be able to find it. It was sent to me that actually suggested pregablin didn't just make you drowsy, which was obvious, but but also promoted appropriate sleep architecture.

[00:07:34] I don't know the data on the sleep architecture and that would be something I'd be putting out to you or some of the sleep experts. Um I have uh I have taken it uh after surgery and uh I find that it makes me sedated. I don't find the quality of the sleep. I mean I could be I could be I could be totally wrong on that but No.

[00:07:56] Well, we both could experience that's it. That's it. It could just simply be my experience. The truth is uh I do tend to when I dose it I'll dose lower in the day and then I'll wall up a little harder at night for the very reason. So let's imagine gabapentin you know maybe in the day 300 300 600 at night and I'm trying to titrate that so that one it helps some sleep because you brought up an incredibly important point which is during the day we've got all these modulatory things we can do around our pain distraction for instance other coping strategies at night you're just trying to get into this relaxed state and that is the worst time for somebody with chronic pain and so the gabapentin and sometimes other agents can help with that. So yeah, I do use it to help people sleep.

[00:08:54] Um no lethal dose uh maxes out at around 900 to a,000 milligrams at a dose because it's it's taken up by an active transport system in the small intestine. Once you take more than about 1,000 milligrams, the rest of it's just passed out your backside. Pregablin is different. It it has a what's called a linear kinetic profile, simply meaning the more you take, the more that gets in your system. So, the only times I will typically switch somebody from a gabapentin if they're getting benefit is when they've maxed out the dose. They're getting benefit, but there's no point in giving them more. I'll switch to pregablinin where I can drive more into their system. And again, you're using these for the most recalcitrant neuropathic pain. Typically, I'm using these for the most recalcitrant pain in general. So, that's an important point. Um, while I can speak to peroperative pain, acute pain, subaccute pain, and chronic pain, Stanford we tend to see, we're a tertiary referral center. I tend to see we see people after they've seen everybody else. And so by definition, what's the We didn't even do this. I'm sorry. We didn't define chronic pain, but how would you put a definition on that? There's various definitions. Some like to put a time frame on it, which I think many of us believe is a little artificial. It's not 3 months or 6 months. It is pain that persists beyond the expected time of tissue healing. So it is nuanced. It's context specific.

[00:10:31] Meaning if you have an ingual oral hernia repair or a prostatctomy which you know should heal up pretty quickly and your pain should go away pretty quickly. But if you've got pain after couple few months that's starting to get to that point where I'm a little worried something's going on from a chronic pain. But if you had a total knee replacement, that is a massive massive surgery and you're going to have pain for quite some time. So I wouldn't call that I wouldn't call chronicity for a total knee. No, it makes sense.

[00:11:07] Totally makes sense. Context specific. Um, this gets into also some of the whole issue around opioid prescribing and these rigid time frames for surgery and and what have you, but persistence beyond the time of expected tissue healing.
