## Transcript

[00:00:00] I find that I sometimes I'm talking to people and the singular measure of life for a lot of people is just longevity it's just duration duration and I look at some of these people I remember when Paul Walker died and this is probably did you know Paul I never met Paul um shockingly cuz we were like intersecting car cultur stuff it seems like I would have been I have friends that were friends with them and adored them but you know when he died obviously it's it's super sad but there was some part of my brain that was like if you were to have um measured somehow the amount of experience he had had on planet Earth in that period I would argue very very few people had lived a bigger life or more of a life or had traveled more and met more people and had more experiences and had more heightened everything so you know what I would not want is a very boring subtle existence with no mountains and valleys for 130 years that just doesn't appeal to me at all and then I also am not overly sacon about death in general in that I always remember I remind myself it's sad for the people left behind it's not I mean if I believed in a higher power and stuff maybe I would have a different view but for me it's like you're alive and then you're not and you don't know you're not so there's no period of being sad that you're no longer alive so when

[00:01:36] I just put all these things into evaluating I don't know that I'm as sad as other people are cuz I think a lot of these people ended up living 10x the life of someone that lives to be 110 and then if I if you presented me with the options if I live like Senna to 34 or I live like some of my neighbors growing up to 105 I would pick Senna I I

[00:02:00] I I think I would and I even I engage in a lot of behaviors that are dangerous and and people scratch their head at and I just feel like this is the only version I want of it so whatever the consequences I am knowledgeable of it I accept it hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter AA

[00:02:30] oh this is delightful yeah man great your house yeah you asked me to come do a Senna episode I was very forthcoming and said I'm a three out of 10 on Senna but the reason I wanted to do it is so that I could pry and figure out what's really going on with the Senna Obsession yes yeah and I'm curious how much you're aware of it or not probably not it's probably at this point sort of like the

[00:02:56] David Foster Wallace fishing water thing like it's the water I swim women yeah so I don't I don't actually notice that I'm obsessed with Senna do you remember what year it started did it start with the doc no no no no I I mean I remember growing up like so so when you grow up in Canada for whatever reason

[00:03:15] Motorsports actually pretty popular in Canada and I don't know why it might be because of Jill VNV although I don't have any real recollection of vev so VNV died in 1982 I was 9 years old but I you know for whatever reason I don't even recall his death being on my radar but um indie car was incredibly popular and

[00:03:36] F1 was incredibly popular okay um cuz you always had the Montreal race you have Montreal for F1 and you always had mport you always had the Toronto uh like the Indie Car in Toronto race and because my dad was in the restaurant business um meaning he was buying beer by the truckload you and Molson was like the beer in Canada you know we would always kind of like they would give you get tickets or something like that so kind yeah so um so RAC yes and and and

[00:04:08] Toronto was pardon me I was going to say so the the 80s right which is sort of when I came of age I also think that there's just I don't know I just think there's some boys that get really into cars not to say that there aren't girls that do but I think it's it's a boy thing and like what did you have posters of on your wall and when it was it was cars and boxers yeah those are the two things

[00:04:28] I had posters of yeah I didn't have boxing posters but I loved those 80s boxers my dad was super obsessed you and I have even bonded over like the Tommy Hearns the Haggler the Sugar Ray that whole sweet era of boxing uh was huge in my house um and I loved cars from the jump my dad was super into cars my my mom and dad drag raced in high school my mom had a a record at the drag track for the Powderpuff Series yeah on a 68 chevel so crazy car people my dad sold cars my mom worked at

[00:05:03] General Motors my stepdad was um riding handling engineer in the Corvette group for the 84 vet that series you know I don't know what that or C4 yeah yeah so obsessed with cars but never overly obsessed with racing would go to B is to see any car cuz again cuz we my family worked in the automotive business we too would end up with tickets and you'd go and it was just like there's no TVs anywhere there's no coverage and you virtually just watch the profile of a car for one tenth of a second and I'm like I don't know I can't

[00:05:42] I can't buy in yeah it I think that um even today I would say F1 is one of the sports that is infinitely better from a total experience in terms of understanding what's going on on television especially given how good TV is now yeah that said I still go to probably three races a year sometimes four because the sound is even though nowhere near as good as it was in the era we're about to discuss right um and once the hybrid era came in in 2014 um you know it sort of I think forever took a little bit of you know what purists love about the sport away yeah so I'm so late into the F1

[00:06:24] Obsession my the first racing I started actually loving was Moto g p probably 20 years ago so very into Moto GP would watch F1 occasionally I'm like this is the stupidest sport they don't ever pass nothing happens and then I'm a drive to survive convert like I watch that have you watched the last couple Seasons yes

[00:06:47] I watch you think it's horrible no I love it oh my God I think it's I can't I can't stand how bad it oh my Lord what is the what's your issue it's boring as hell it's like a bunch of you don't about what did the first seasons have that the latter ones don't have um I mean I think that the first three seasons still kind of focused on the racing uh and I feel like they're trying a little too hard now to make it about the off trck drama the reality shess of it yeah yeah yeah I think the I think the people are I think some people there are clearly some people who you know like Max I love Max's approach to it which is I don't give a [ __ ] yeah yeah I'm not parti my way um but then there's there's too many people who are trying a little too hard I won't name names but sure sure you were just close to one of them recently um but I so the first season I was initially I was like hold on a second Mercedes budget is 4 or $500 million a year that's the first thing that really got me where I was like oh this is this is enormous on a scale that I didn't even know was possible relative to NASCAR indie or

[00:08:00] Moto GB anything it's 20x the budget of any other racing so I was like oh that's really fascinating then finding out about the aerodynamicist and how relevant they are and it and just how high-tech it is that all that interests me I love the technical aspect of that sport enormously what I think this show still does great is it really shows you the drama that's existing between 14th and 8th Place which when I'm watching the normal season I'm largely missing that yeah it's like I'm vaguely aware that pier and okan hate each other but not in the way that like a whole season can get me or a whole episode and so I think the show is really good at letting you know how much drama still happening below eighth place how how important it is that these teams finish in the points or to get one point so it's almost like

[00:08:54] I rewatch The season now caring about all the folks that aren't on the podium yeah yeah I I don't know what changed for me I feel like 2021 um 22 23 2020 yeah 20 2020 and 2021 were I think its best seasons actually with Max and Lewis the max Lewis season of 21 was exceptional the last perfect time for me to join the last two episodes of That season were two of the finest the season before I think honestly man on fire which was the groan episode which I think was 2020 I think one of the best single episodes ever obviously you know for those of us that were watching that live it was unbelievable uh again I think you know it's something we'll talk about today right which is you know when you're watching a sport like F1 or Moto GP or anything for that matter like there is a real chance a person could die and it's really frightening when you see some of these accidents and yeah but for the most part I don't know about you for the most part that's not even on the table for me and then occasionally one of these things happen and I go oh that's right they are going 205 mph it doesn't really matter how you build this thing yeah there is some likelihood that something maybe that's why because I've been a fan for so long I I still have the visceral reaction to Big shunts because there was a day when those were almost all fatal yes yeah I don't know what the the chart is from the 70s till now but obviously it's just been in a nose dive I can tell you basically in the mid 19 60s until the early 1980s so about a 16-year period of time F1 was a killing field right and that meant that on average probably two to four drivers died a year now just I want you to think about that in the context of what you watch today you and I have been talking all week about the many things that have changed so dramatically that it's almost impossible to reconcile that it used to be that way we were both watching Turning Point yeah a great doc you recommended and I'm watching it and again I have awareness of this I remember learning this but to learn that in one night of bombing of

[00:11:08] Tokyo 87,000 people died that's more than all of Vietnam by a factor of 30,000 one night yeah and you're like oh we don't have the appetite for any of that stuff anymore I don't think like I don't think if the sport two people were dying that would be you know one in 12 races we would see someone die I don't I just don't think it would exist now right so yeah um and again I wasn't watching the sport during that period of time but not long after I was going back and watching video of it right right yeah so when do you start like watching it religiously in the ' 80s like in the late ' 80s you're a kid and no are anyone you're friends with watching it with you or you're all alone on this no yeah not not really it's not a yeah it's not and it's not my obsession my obsession is much more did your dad watch it with you nope and by the way it was very hard to watch live because again another thing you take for granted today cable yeah you can watch things whenever you want like back then it was like always odd bizarre hours and stuff like that like you had to wake up at 2 a.m. yeah you catch it on delay by the way when I got to med school and became friends with a guy named Paul kti who actually you know haven't you had Paul on your show I know that name yeah I feel like you might I've gotten to that point 80000 people I'm like starting to get some names embarrassing anyway Paul who's no stranger to this show um you know when we met first day at med school immediately connected over both our shared Obsession for F1 and for Senna um it was that was like talking to a guy who was going through kind of a similar experience of like you know watching things at odd hours and things of that nature but um you look just as the 80s was kind of a golden period for um for boxing with you know the fact that you had Hearns Haggler Duran Leonard bonit like all of these guys that each of them are Hall of Famers and they were all fighting each other all the time in an era where it meant something to be the middleweight champion of the world the welterweight champion of the world Julio

[00:13:10] Cesar Chavez he a little bit later yeah yeah lightweight but yeah guy who fought 90 90 fights or something yeah I mean he was undefeated into his 90th fight it's insane um but F F1 was like that as well so when you think about the 80s you had you know Nikki laa at the end of his career still winning a champion ship uh in the mid 80s and then the arrival of

[00:13:33] Alan Prost um Nigel Manel of course Nelson PK and Senna and so you you really have this Golden Era of F1 I think in the late 80s and and and early 90s where it is you know insane depth of talent um also for what it's worth I just think the cars were aesthetically they're most beautiful during that period of time I it's not that I don't think the cars today are masterpie so tiny if you're me and you came into the sport post hybrid area and now you go like I walk through

[00:14:08] McLaren through the Boulevard and I'm like oh they're go-karts they were V10 go-karts back they were just so small yeah they were 500 kilo cars back then but still could with Boost in qualifying could make over 1,000 horsepower at 1,000 PBS yeah wow um which is actually a really funny story that kind of bring us to Senna right which is you know there are many things that made Senna special but his qualifying uh is the most remarkable thing and so if you look at his record right so by today's standards Senna wasn't around very long right there were most of the most of the drivers on the

[00:14:46] F1 grid today have already had more races than Senna did when he died he died in his 161st race okay so max is only 26 years old he's long past that number of races right Lewis is at more than 2x that number of races right and yet senna's qualifying percentage right to to how many times was he on poll position in there nobody's within a country mile he 65 polls yeah in 161 races that kind of framed it for me because again I only know that he won three titles and technically four I'm going to explain to you why he had one stolen from him but yeah with the um not turning around in the yeah turnoff area um yeah sure four um but obviously

[00:15:27] Schumacher's Rec record Lewis's record some of these records um it begs the question why is this the guy everyone's so obsessed with because he what had 10 years in yeah he di years yeah died for 10 years but when I saw that 65 polls stat I was like okay that's very telling that says a lot but before you explain that to me I want to know it would appear that and this is another thing

[00:15:53] I've come to love about F1 is P1 in qualifying to P20 is often 310 of a second usually a little bit more um what but let's just say within the top five it's it's the first three are often in the hundreds of seconds and then maybe six is a tenth yeah yeah the margin is so unfathomable people really if just take a stopwatch if you've ever taken a stopwatch and just try to double click it as fast as as you can and you'll start realizing how tiny aunds of a second you can't even get hunds of a second I used to play this game as a kid it was one of my favorite watch absolutely sit in class what was your minimum how could you how could you get

[00:16:41] I think my minimum was like 11 or 1400s I think I could get down I can't even remember I just remember all of us in a circle like doing it over and over again something going 08 and that's all freaking out but the notion that you have 10 different teams with 10 different approaches 20 different drivers I mean the amount of variables on the table are incalculable yet you slam it all together and somehow it's all within a second or it's all within a 10 you know three1 of a second or hundreds of a second that part is I think almost uncom incomprehensible well let's use that as an example to I think in the 80s the Delta was much bigger yeah not necessarily and and and by the way the Delta between teammates is the

[00:17:25] Delta that matters that's where you're seeing the Delta between drivers yes because you know let's let's let's use my favorite example which is arguably considered one of the most epic legendary stories of senna which is qualifying for the 1988 Monaco race okay so at this point Senna is the rookie on the team this is in the mp44 the car that to this day is regarded as the greatest car ever in F1 this is what you have this is this car here yep and um so what made this car special I'm shocked you don't have that tattoo but we'll talk about that later that's so some point we we should discuss that that would imagine that down my back yeah glorious your wife would be so excited so so so that car won 15 of 16 races between he and Pros yep and the race that it didn't win um Senna got taken out by a back marker so it's like that they would have won 16 of 16 races so the closest we've seen to that is last year's Red Bull which won all but one race but the reason most people would still argue that that was the technically Superior car was the that

[00:18:29] Red Bull did not win last year which was Singapore yeah they didn't lose because of some fluke like the car legitimately couldn't perform in Singapore because of the bumps in the road and the ride height yeah so now go so sen sen is the rookie on the team Prost is the two-time world champion the reigning world champion and um they're at Monaco which is generally regarded as the most difficult circuit yeah the margin for error is non-existent another feather in his cap right he's got the most wind he has won Monaco six times officially seven times if you include what happened in 1984 which we can talk about yeah this is where he puts it into the wall the 56 no that's in ' 88 in in 1984 what happened was he was he started at the back of the field he was an a Tolman piece of garbage car in rain but it was raining like cats and dogs and of course the other thing that makes Senna very special to your we keep adding to why is he special no one could ever drive like he could in the rain right and that's that's the real Three standard deviation yeah so you've got a field of world champions in Superior cars in front of him as a as a rookie not just a team rookie his F1 rookie year 1984 he's in the Tolman right he's driving a a garbage truck back there but it starts raining cats and dogs and he is by two-thirds of the way through the race he is closing in on Alan Prost and in the final lap of what would become the final lap he passes him but the referee you know the the the the the the stewards decide to Halt the race at the preceding lap and he is still awarded second place which is unfathomable as his first Podium the first major [ __ ] he receives from the FIA right exactly exactly this would become a pattern yeah um so then we should add to Monaco is the hardest track to pass on in the whole calendar today it's impossible to pass on back in the day you could pass because the cars were smaller okay you could again I would not advocate for getting rid of Monaco but one could make a case that the cars have outgrown the circuit right um but Monaco to this day is still one of the most exciting qualifying Oh by far yeah because the stakes are so high yeah uh and so so in 1988 Senna not only qualifies on poll something he would do repeatedly he does so by a margin that is deemed impossible to comprehend mhm now you have to remember who his teammate is his teammate is arguably one of the greatest drivers of all timean

[00:21:04] Prost driving the same car uh-huh and he out qualifies him do you know how much no 1.47 seconds wow 1.47 seconds consist through the the three qualies back then it quali ran a little bit differently um and um 1.4 yeah and so Senate was already on poll when he decided he wanted to go out and do one more lap and it's it's the stuff of F1 lore because the lap was not captured on camera so this was back when cameras were on cars kind of in its infancy but because you know back then you didn't have endless amounts of streaming video like the kind of the TV station had to decide who were we going to focus on this lap and because Senna was already on poll they didn't record the lap sure sure so all you have is the time sheet but you don't you know so you know he went this fast and um yeah he was he was out of the world so then the next day in the race he is leading by so much mhm that the team is telling him to slow down yeah they're begging him they're begging him to slow down they're like you know I forget exactly what you know there might have been eight laps to go and he's ahead by 30 seconds like I yeah

[00:22:15] I just recently rewatched the thing and at the point he crashed he was 56 seconds ahead of Pros yeah yeah yeah he could have pushed the car to the finish line and still won and um yeah and he he lost concentration for a nanc a very rare event in his life um and and crashed and you know so you know and then devastated so angry you imine the self-loathing he's so angry that he literally got out of the car threw his stuff and went to his apartment his apartment yeah for 3 hours yeah and nobody could find him yeah uh uh yeah yeah yeah so Joe Ramirez I think eventually went and found him and his housekeeper had to let him in cuz she was she was she was instructed to tell everyone that he was not around um so but that's yeah that's just an an insane example of and the other thing about senatur and qualifying is the reason he was so good at qualifying especially in that era is um the cars in that era ran a much higher horsepower during qualifying okay right they dialed them way up they dialed them way up in a way that they don't do it today today you're not playing with that today you're playing with tires fuel load and battery pack so basically today on a quality setup you can discharge battery much more and you basically aim to finish on fumes and no battery life right um but back then it was a totally different horsepower and you know you couldn't race at that horsepower because the you didn't have the reliability and truthfully a lot of drivers including

[00:23:50] Prost including La were like it's too freaking dangerous man that's way too much yeah well they're in the at some point right they're in the the 12 and, 1400 horsepower cly 1200 yeah yeah these are naturally aspirated v10s v12s the compression must have been earsplitting yeah I think at some point these things were redlining up to 18,000 RPM if you can believe that's even the physics of that is possible in a car out of a V8 or a V10 probably the v10s were probably the I mean that's more than a motorcycle motor reps too I don't know the Moto GP guys told us they were up to 18,000 didn't they well if recall there wasn't really consensus when the person said that uh yeah one guy said 18 another guy said 16 I but I don't know I don't know

[00:24:36] I think it's more around 15 but whatever who knows either way it's justable it's it's terrifying but Senna has so there's the record there's the dying early that's very James Dean there's a lot of elements that that um bolster people's fascination with them for me I like him because he seemed like an outsider the brazilianness of it all makes me like him more but also and I don't know how comfortable you're going to be with this word he's very sexy he's a very MC Jagger kind of rock star sexy aloof always like focused and not really a people pleaser there's I think there's an added element why we love Senna and these intangibles that aren't about the record and I wonder what personality wise you think of him well it's really funny because and this is I would bet that you have examples um where you will relate to what I'm about to say which is

[00:25:41] I think growing up and and through his life and death it was mostly about sen of the racer uhhuh it's after his death I've learned much more about him because remember he died in 1994 I was in college when he died uhhuh when he died like I didn't have an Internet to read more about like so much of what I know about him today is based on things I can read that I couldn't read then also I've become close to people who knew him well right um and so I can now learn about him as a person I know things about him that that aren't publicly known frankly um I've met his family right I i' I know his niece quite well um I've met his brother who is you know obviously one of the few people that was there when he died in

[00:26:28] Italy that day uh Joseph leer who was his trainer who was you know one of the closest people to him so in many ways like my appreciation for him today is tenfold what it was when I just evaluated him through that lens the other thing that you alluded to is I didn't really appreciate as I don't think many people did at the time of his life what he meant to Brazilians oh yeah it's it's outrageous and at a time where

[00:26:54] Brazil was struggling beyond belief yeah and so so just to give you an example of that like you know as you know my youngest son is named after him yeah anytime we encounter a person from Brazil who discovers that fact yeah it's like everything Chang come into my house for food yeah yeah and and and and and for someone in Brazil if you're over the age of 35 today you you know you take JFK 911 uh you know yeah that's what May 1st 1994 was because the entire country every Sunday would stop to watch this yeah it's not like the NFL here where a lot of people watch it no no no no no this was the religion yes the country stops everybody watches there was a Brazilian God on planet Earth that's right yeah yeah in fact it is it and because of the religious culture of Brazil right it's a you know it's a Catholic country obviously there's so much religious symbolism and and I think he is the closest thing to a deity for for for the people there and by the way you know a close second is Japan oh really yeah why do you suppose uh because of the relationship with Honda oh okay so all three of his titles were in Honda powered cars and the engineers at

[00:28:21] Honda loved him he was also other as I imagine the Japanese felt entering yeah F1 yeah like there weren't a lot of Brazilians well he's one of three maybe Brazilian F1 well it's really interesting so Nelson PK who is also Brazilian also a three-time champion um one of my favorite things to do whenever I meet someone from Brazil who's old enough is to say you know we obviously got talking about Senna blah blah blah what do you think of PK and they're all like piece of [ __ ] oh really oh can't stand them because he deserted the place or yeah he was like not proud of what he was he was also very unkind to Senna he referred to him as the homosexual from sa Paulo although he didn't use that word you can imagine what he said sure sure sure back when you could let those rip problem still have all your sponsors yeah yeah um so so yeah PK was very jealous of senna because of how much Senna was loved but

[00:29:14] Sena was loved because of how much he loved back he was so proud of Brazil right so every time he wins a race Brazilian flag is out right and he loved Brazil and what one thing people didn't know about him until after he died was how much money he was pouring into education in Brazil yeah so how did their salaries back then compare to current salaries like what when you adjust for inflation um probably reasonable if you were at the very very top so Senna was making a million dollars a race a race yeah and doing 16 races a year that's just base salary righton that's not that far off from what I mean Max is the highest paid guy in F1 today I believe he's making 50 million EUR uhhuh um so and keeping 50 million euros living in Monaco yeah anytime you hear their salaries you're like you really got to double it when you're trying to comp it to like baseball players or football players yeah yeah um Sena of course also had many sponsors right so so he was loaded but the family was already loaded he came from a wealthy family um so he was he was he was not without but he probably made somewhere on the order of a quarter of a billion dollars in his lifetime oh wow in the ' 80s and90s wow that's impressive yeah but there's there's some I have to imagine there's some archetype about him that you like beyond the racing and I'm wondering is it the outsiderness well I think it's the fact that he was look if we're going to get really deep and philosophical I think it's that he he's flawed right he's not a perfect person and nor did he try to represent himself as that right like he he he could be overly emotional um and I I think even though it's very sad and we should I'm sure we will talk about his death in detail um I do believe I I don't believe the most commonly held um view of his death which was that it resulted from the steering column failure I actually don't think that's what happened oh really no you have a different take I do have a different take although I used to for many years for probably 26 years I believed that he died because the steering column failed I thought I had heard that like is it an aileron what is the piece that was on the suspension that that had come off oh I'm sorry that's what actually killed him that's not in dispute okay okay yes yes yes no why did he crash why he crash yes okay and people have said I don't even know this that the steering steering column failed yes so um we should yeah so so the the conventional view the the widely held view of senna's death so maybe just to tell people how the circumstances of the death so he was in a race called IMA which took place um on a horrible horrible weekend April 29th April 30th and May 1st 1994 um going back to something we talked about earlier there had not been a death in F1 since Jill VV died in 1982 okay now 12 years later on that

[00:32:34] Friday during the first practice another Brazilian driver Ruben barello has a brutal crash he's just laying in the [ __ ] straightway what's amazing is he he was only concussed and split open but actually survived Senna was shaken up Senna was like that was in practice was an fp1 Senna was was you know this was like a you know a kid that he was mentoring and he saw him in the hospital and was very shaken up yeah the next day a rookie Roland ratzenberger who Senna also had taken under his wing and had actually introduced that weekend to Joseph leer his physio who was also Austrian Roland was Austrian and Joseph was Austrian so

[00:33:22] Sena had introduced them that weekend uh Roland was killed in practice that weekend uhuh and um this was the first death in F1 in 12 years wow I'm G to tell you a weird sidebar to this so do you know Craig T Nelson yeah he was racing that weekend there he was at that race um he raced prototypes for years oh

[00:33:48] I didn't know that oh he was so so he paved Willow Springs at one point when he was on Coach uh he has a lap record and a prototype there it was his life he spent every penny from coach on racing and he was there that weekend weirdly wow yeah racing and he said it was quite an eerie weekend as well yeah there are so many things about that weekend that are really upsetting one of them is that the race should have been cancelled after

[00:34:14] Roland's death so if a driver dies on the track in Italy the law is the race is done oh really yes Roland died on the track but the organ organizers of the race wanted the race to go on so they airlifted him out of there to pronounce him dead at a hospital oh wow but they were doing cardiac massage on him at the track he was absolutely dead Senna against the instructions of the marshals ran got into a car drove to where he died and was reprimanded terribly for doing so um Joseph told me that night he'd never seen Senna more more Angry in the entire time he knew him than that evening because of how pissed he was at how the marshals had been so angry at him for going to see Roland at the site of the accident which is a pattern of his right he also had gone out on P1 and kind of stood where that had happened and he's that's kind of a thing he did right yes he was you know this is the thing about Senna that's also kind of an interesting Paradox right like on the one hand he was the most competitive and he did things at times and we can talk about things where he's literally put other drivers and his own life's in danger out of pure competitive drive and yet he would be the first person to stop and rescue you and and help you if you were hurt and you know he you know

[00:35:41] Joseph wasami he was so angry he said how dare they tell me I can't go onto track to see a driver who is injured and ultimately dead when they don't care that we're driving around here like in other words like don't tell me who's taking the risk I take the the risk you don't take the risk you can grant me this yeah no problem and so ratzenberger dies that should have been the end of emila right like Sena should still be alive he shouldn't have died the next day because the race should have been cancelled is it also relevant he this is race number two of the season three of the season three and he hates his car hates the car he had gone to Williams thinking he was going to get the electronically adjusted suspension that gets taken away right so Senna in 1988 arrived at McLaren he's driving for what is the best team by the way this is another interesting metric I want I'll come back to this point but when people say well you go to you know just look at the stats like Lewis has the most wins and Schumacher and you know Lewis have the most titles I'm like put all that stuff aside there are other metrics even if you just look at the length of Life

[00:36:46] Sena was only in the best car four out of the 10 years he raised right so you you Al have to look at how many years was a driver in the best car all of these things Factor into it so sen is in the best car in 88 89 9091 he wins three of the titles in those four years although as he should have had four out of the four and then the tide changes this is always the case in F1 there's a regulation change and the power shift happens and at this point the power shifts from McLaren to Williams so in '92 and 93 Williams was so technically

[00:37:21] Superior to not just McLaren but everyone else on the field and Senna wanted to go Frank Williams the owner of the Williams team had always loved Sena always loved him he was one of the first people to see Senna race coming out of Formula Ford formula 4 all of these other lower classes um but there just wasn't a seat on the team at the time so

[00:37:44] Williams and he got PR yes specifically I won't race right so Manel races for Williams in '92 wins the title immediately retires Prost comes out of retirement takes the seat for 93 Williams uh says great we'll bring out Senna and PR says no way my contract has a clause that says I'll never race with Senna as a teammate again so Senna spends one more year at McLaren funny story there by the way is he was having a contract holdup with McLaren and to sort of flex his muscles a little bit he came to the US did a day of testing an indie car oh really and um uh actually was driving fast by the end of his first day of testing than any of the indie car drivers were driving wow cuz that transference hasn't gone as well in the last 20 years when F1 drivers have gone to Indie it's hard I mean has done well he win he he didn't yeah he didn't do as well as you would have expected given that alono basically won the 24 hours of

[00:38:48] L man his first crack out there yeah yeah so um so anyway so finally so Prost retires at the end of 93 um we we should come back to the last race of 93 at Adelaide with Senna and Prost on the on the podium together yeah and then finally Senna gets his wish which is he finally gets to go to Williams M he finally gets to go to the team that has won the last two titles and basically will be the most dominant car for the next four years although nobody knows it at the time but perhaps unbeknown unbeknownst to

[00:39:21] Senna because the F1 that year had taken a pretty hard rule change and removed um what's called active suspension mhm the car for the beginning of the 94 season was an undrivable technical debac yeah cuz they're scrambling to reinvent their entire suspension at that that point right right cuz they guys just got to ditch everything right and the car and so I've become really good friends with

[00:39:46] Damon Hill who was his teammate that year okay um and I actually had Damon on the podcast probably five years ago and and you know he's just such an incredible human being I think Damon's one of the most underrated world champions in F1 Damon won the the world championship in 1995 he's the son of Graham Hill a two-time world champion making him one of only two fatherson F1

[00:40:09] Champions um but you know and I've talked at length with Damon about what that car was like at the beginning of the 94 season Damon drove it in '93 so he knew what that car was like when it was the best car ever yeah and then he knew what it was like later and and Damon basically said look the the car was godamn undrivable it was so scary it was like being on a knife's edge every minute of every lap of every drive and he said he just pulled way back he was like so again maybe for people watching us who don't understand what it's like to to drive a race car the goal of driving a race car is to be at the limit of the car you're always at the limit of what the car can do and Damon was like you couldn't drive that car near the limit uhhuh because it yeah if if you got within 10 yards of the limit the car would like flip you into another planet yeah um but Senna still managed to drive it close to limit so in the first race of that year which was in Brazil Senna gets on pole which is it's hard to imagine how he could put that car on pole but it was like wrestling that car into pole position he's in pole he's leading that race and then with a few laps to go he actually spins out on a corner yeah just couldn't control this thing so next race he again gets it on pole no one it's not clear how he could put that car on pole again and by the way he's he's got Michael

[00:41:37] Schumacher a young Michael Schumacher just like biting at his heels and he's in the mlar oh he's in the Ben oh right yeah and that was kind of the best car that year yeah that was the best car that year um a lot of controversy about whether that car was cheating that year right he had believed it had traction control right that's right it probably did yeah it's weird that they would be able to hide that yeah oh yeah I know yeah in that race he's on pole but he gets hit from behind first Corner he's out of that race MH so now we go into

[00:42:10] IMA remember this is a 16 Race season two races are down and he has zero points Schumacher has won both of those races he's got 20 points yeah so he's feeling the weight of the world on his shoulders he has to be perfect for the rest of the he has to be perfect for the of the season and certainly he has to win this race in IMA I mean non-negotiable now up until that point in time Senna already has the record for most wins at emila this is a circuit he knows well it's a very hard circuit yeah um I actually just started driving it in the simulator a few months ago yeah kind of getting ready for my trip out there and it's tough yeah I I remember was it two years ago three it was just an entire yard sale lap one then a complete restart then another yard sell that one has spectacular crashes everything goes wrong right so you start out with what we talked about on Friday you've got baric hello nearly dies on Saturday ratzenberger dies yeah Senna is in no mood to drive on

[00:43:17] Sunday yeah so that Saturday night is Joseph's birthday Joseph Leber is his birthday is April 30th so these guys always celebrate Joseph's birthday yeah and on that night they're out at a pizza place and obviously it's just the most somber mood and they're not celebrating anything um and Senna is in incredibly angry about um the scolding he took for going to see ratzenberger yeah um and he is very unhappy with the car doesn't feel that the car is safe um that day he had spoken with Nikki LA and Nikki had encouraged him as now the most senior driver in F1 now that Prost had retired that he needed to bring back the driv association for safety okay so that didn't exist at that it had sort of

[00:44:10] Fallen by the wayside yeah and um this is something that Jackie Stewart had led in the early 1970s when they when the drivers sort of said enough is enough like we can't just be dying at this rate we have to we have to take safety we have to make it a high priority um and so agreed that the next race at Monaco they would reinitiate the driver's safety uh sort of group um and Senna said to Joseph that night that it was like kind of the first time ever he didn't want to race he didn't want to really race the next day and and

[00:44:47] Joseph said to him he goes look no one will fault you if you don't right now like and and and Sen said there's no way I can't race the people of Brazil need this and they're hurting way more than I am um so you ask me like why do I why am I obsessed with this guy it's kind of like the Death Wish in a way it's like but also realizing like it's bigger than him like he really felt like I don't want to do this I don't feel safe doing this yeah but there's a 100 million people who need me to do this yeah and they're in worse shape than I am did you read the Fountain Head ever mm

[00:45:27] M cuz this would be a good parallel the people I read the Fountain Head loved it the lead character is roughly based on um the architect uh Frank Lloyd Wright um but he is a man who always knew what he wanted always had a vision never compromised pissed a lot of people off Howard roor But ultimately was always right and I think that Marte when you're a young man is incredibly appealing it was to me like yeah maybe I just I know one's right I don't have to listen to anyone else and then I'll be proven I'm right at the end of it and I just wonder how much of his he's high level of disagreeability wouldn't you think like oh yeah PR was great at playing the political game the head of the FIA was also French clearly was helping him the whole with every dispute between he and Senna and Senna was just so disagreeable and outspoken and didn't give a [ __ ] if anyone liked him well that part of his personality yes but also there was a it's I'm going to win or it doesn't matter um and and so prost's nickname was the professor right and and the reason for that was among other things he was very smart and very strategic and very calculating and if he was in a race and he was in third place he would think to himself logically I'm playing the long game here which is I'm better off coming in third and getting my six or seven or eight points yeah here if I can't if I don't think I can win right Senna only wanted to win yeah like he would crash out of a race if if if even in the lead to take a shot at winning if you know he he just didn't care for second third or fourth well the mon incident that we already talked about where he was 60 seconds out ahead and puts it into a wall in his own description of that race which is kind of appealing is he was on a perfect

[00:47:40] Drive yeah like spiritually he was on a perfect he wasn't competing against anybody else he was competing against what Perfection could be yeah he was getting very close to having raced the perfect race and could feel it and could not stop pushing because it was within his touch right or grasp and so yeah that to to see that someone is in pursuit of something that's even higher than first place is is is appealing as a character type MH um but there's some punk rockness to him that I also think is in the stew for you I'm guessing yeah look I cuz if you're just a record junkie yeah yeah I think if you're a record junkie you would just have to have Lewis as your favorite driver if you're just looking at numbers or Schumacher yeah so here's here's an analogy right if you I don't know how much you cared for football when you were growing up but like Barry

[00:48:41] Sanders doesn't have the records right he's not the leading rusher he doesn't have the most yards he doesn't have the most touchdowns he has no Super Bowls like by any statistic Barry Sanders is not actually the best right but my son my son who obsessed with football and we read football books every night yeah

[00:49:00] I've already explained to him 10 Ways to Sunday Barry Sanders was the greatest running back of all time because there are intangible himself as well just shy of a record yeah didn't care about the records actually he truly didn't right didn't want to be in the public eye yeah yeah he's impressive he's the greatest running back of all time and um even though statistically there were many you know that were Superior and I think with

[00:49:24] Senna there's a there's a characterist of his driving and I do think most drivers would agree he's the greatest of all time so I I would bet that if you pulled current and past F1 drivers do you think Max would say so you know it's interesting I don't know what I feel like Max would say shoeer well I know

[00:49:44] Seb would say shoeer and I'm close with SE and Shoemaker we must acknowledge is on another planet yeah look I think you could make a case that the three greatest of all time would be Senna Schumacher and maybe Max yeah we might be getting to the point where we can start to say Max is in the top three

[00:50:03] I mean again it's hard I'm new to it so of course I'm intoxicated with the flavor of the day but Max to me even and when I watch different documentaries or learn the history of other drivers he definitely is ahead of everyone else and there's a kid who F came in at se a week after his 17th birthday won a race at 17 I mean that's yeah inconceivable yeah and of course it's hard you know I I I struggle to figure this out myself because like where does fangio belong in all of this like it's not just that he won five titles it's are you judging a driver against his peers because if so yeah fangio was really I mean five titles in four cars right it does matter what car you put him in he was going to win the title well this becomes the same challenge as uh evaluating boxers cuz you really have to look at who they were fighting right yeah I think I think Ali gets such a huge bump when you think about how formidable

[00:51:04] Forman was at the time um or these had with Fraser was Mike Tyson like you put Mike Tyson and and and and Fraser in a ring I don't know who wins that fight they're the similar so yeah the fact that this dude probably took on two of the out of the 10 best heavyweights of all time repeatedly I think is relevant yeah or a lot of these guys didn't really have but if you just evaluate them on physical prowess like the the further we get down the the evolution of athletes is such that they are clearly getting better as time goes on I think I think you know yeah so it's it's it's it's it's really it's always hard to to sort of have that discussion about like who's who's the greatest now explain some of these Kinks he has because I do end up coming across videos all the time where people are pointing out that like

[00:51:54] Senna had this very unique habit of stabbing the gas yeah which to me seems completely counterintuitive to what you'd want to do and I'm curious like if you know what his rationale what was that getting him and how unique was that it was very unique and um yes so to just so people understand what you're saying

[00:52:15] Senna had a habit of when he was coming out of a corner he so the way the regular Mortals like us drive is we come back on to throttle gradual roll roll it on if you come on too much you're going to lose the rear of the car and and that's the way you go so you're coming off the brake you're coming on the throttle smooth is fast is the Mantra smooth is fast yeah and if you look at the Telemetry of senna because of course in race cars you can you're measuring to the millimeter and to the PSI exactly what's happening to each pedal Senna did something very different which is when he came on throttle he was stab stab stab stab stab stab stab and then on full yeah so it was hypothesized that this was done because of the turbo lag revving the turbo up y so you would you would get rid of the turbo lag and he would get back to full power quicker than everybody else right so he was just like keeping it activated until he went full power keeping the RPMs as high as possible such that when he got back to full power there was no lag and he was gone yeah and um so people actually hypothesized that he would struggle when they went back to naturally aspirated cars uhhuh and here's the weird thing he kept doing it and he didn't struggle uhhuh so you know that's one of the things I don't think I have a great explanation for why he was doing it other than he had clearly always been doing it like this is how he drove carts yeah if his results were different it would be so obvious it's just not a good strategy right but somehow it worked yeah he his car control really was remarkable and that's one of the beautiful things about that era of F1 is the cars were so much harder to drive yeah and less down Force less down Force no power steering manual shift like a manual gearbox in fact if if anybody's just kind of doubting what we're talking about here you just need to pull up and we'll probably include it in the show notes a couple of onboard Senna drives yeah in places like Monaco where you have to be able to drive the car you know within most people would take it within a foot of a wall he would take it within three inches of the wall to maximize the size of the track for him and he's doing this one-handed no power steering while shifting yeah um totally different to totally different anim were those sequential Y at least Y and did they have to use a clutch yep they did oh yeah he's he's clutch okay clutch blip shift yeah there's also I just recently saw a great video of him driving an NSX oh yeah the loafers yes with the loafers on and he's just side

[00:54:56] Way's on the pedals and he's so [ __ ] busy incredible yeah and it what seems obvious is it might be his first time ever driving the car he's just driving at 100.1% yeah well he helped them develop that car so that's another reason why there's such a love relationship between the Japanese and Senna is the the Honda

[00:55:17] Engineers loved him um I've actually sat in his NSX so he actually had uh an NSX and it still sits at his brother's home in sou Paulo oh really and um when I met his brother he said you want to you want to come down and sit in the car and started up and I was like is this a trick question are you sure so where does he rank because like um to my knowledge schacher had an incredible engineering mind he was very very mechanical and they say he could help them develop the car um in a way that most drivers couldn't do where was senna's technical aptitude for actually developing the car there is footage of him actually building an engine on his go-kart and stuff very very similar and the and he was very very committed to giving feedback so where I think the engineers and I'm hearing this secondhand not firsthand but where where where people would talk about this was the feedback he could give to um the engineers was remarkable um you know there's a great story about him um you know getting injured right and not being able to to drive the next day during testing and one of the um other drivers having to come in and sort of You Know cover for him and Seno came in just to listen to How the other driver gave feedback to the engineers to make sure that it could even be trusted like he was mess up the car with that he just that particular about everything you be able to say and and and as someone who drives a car myself yeah like it's hard to put in words like how dumb I am like like I'll go out in a car and I'll know that it's not right but I can't tell you why I know this so I raced for a season um in the super tro Series in

[00:57:10] Lamborghinis and and by the way I have rebuilt engines and cars I am really mechanical but actually articulating what I think needs to happen I find to be like an entirely different knowledge that I don't have currently yeah there's just a lack of I can tell you if it's under steering or over steering I can tell you some basic stuff but the to come in and go like it needs two clicks on the suspension on the right rear for turn seven I'm like I can't do that I'm furious I don't that's that's exactly how I feel I can tell you about the balance of the car I can tell you if I have more too much or too little front grip or rear grip that's the extent I know and it's 10 years I've been driving and that's the best I can do and by the way I think it still exists dramatically in current F1 crop of drivers I think there's very few that can give them super specific feedback the way that like schoe marker or I guess Senna would

[00:58:13] I don't think there's a lot right now that can do it I know some personally that have admitted that they know very little about what's going on with the car but again I feel like Max when even when I hear him communicate on the radio I'm like well he's definitely a great above everyone else as far as his understanding of what's going on with the car and then Alonzo also seems to have like a really deep knowledge that he can articulate to them yeah but I feel like that's like this big chunk that no one really talks about all that much that I think is really important the like longtime champ seem to really have that yeah I don't know what Lewis's aptitude is I haven't been able to really assess that yeah let's go back to the day of the the day of the the

[00:58:54] Dreadful race so so um so Senate manages to somehow Wrangle pole for the third consecutive race of that season terrible car with the undrivable car that is on a knife's edge that he somehow manages to put on pole yet again and um he is you know this is this is uh he has to win this race and on the first lap he gets away clean and seven cars behind him one of the cars stalls on the grid gets plowed by another car immediate safety car mhm um this was back in a day when the safety cars were insanely slow they were like little Pinos today you know most people would notice that they have the fastest street cars available GTR AMG yeah and the reason for that is these cars have to be kept moving quickly to keep the tire temperature high yeah um again this is something that I understand that if you've never driven a race car you've never thought of because when you're driving on the street it doesn't matter but the temperature of the tires is everything if the tires are cool they are bricks it's like driving ice bricks under the car yeah so you you know people are watching F1 they maybe notice during a formation lap or during a safety car the cars will weave side to side that's to put friction in the tire you have to keep the tire warm and so you want a safety car to be able to go as fast as possible can we add one thing this is one of my favorite things to try to get people to wrap their heads around when they're learning about F1 which is you have this team that in some cases may have $400 million at its disposal they have literally the best aerodynamicist on planet Earth they're better than Adrien newi is better than anyone at Nasa right um the little tiny bits of carbon fiber Wing if you sit up next to close to a car it's it's boggling how advanced and technological this thing is and then the engine itself this 1.6 L motor that's making a th000 all of it is is so next level Tech but then you have to remember all of it has to transfer through four rubber tires that's right this is great neutralizing fact about Formula 1 it's like it doesn't really matter what you do to that car because at the end of the day you will have the built-in limits of a piece of rubber touching asphalt and they all have the same tires yes I think it's one of the most fascinating aspects of it is just how much tech leads up to at the end of the day four pieces of rubber on asphalt and you'll never transcend that aspect of it yes and today it's such a differentiating factor not because they use different rubber they don't they all have the same compound but the difference between say

[01:01:43] Max for stappen and Charles lir yeah is not necessarily who's faster over one lap where lir may be actually faster over AAP it's that Max is way better in in terms of getting more Pace out of a tire for longer yeah and that's why head-to-head there's no comparison between Max and Charles is one guy always knows how to maximize the life of his tire yeah they generally give credit to the car design in that situation you'll hear them go like oh Ferrari's rough on their tires they heat them up really quick which is why Charles is able to get poll position a lot but in a in a race they are their tires go out three laps before everyone else um yeah so it's hard to parse out like what is driver but then you watch their teammates I guess is the only way to really figure that out and Yeah Max is almost never entire trouble right yeah and this is actually I think dur during

[01:02:35] Lewis's Prime because he's obviously on the down slope of his career now but when Lewis was at his prime it was probably one of the things he did better than anybody else on the grid and it it's not a sexy thing so you don't get a lot of credit for it but when you can really quote unquote manage your tires it's a Remar workable Advantage um and you're right at the end of the day it's like all the engineering in the world still has to be transmitted through those four contact points it's kind of comical yeah so safety car comes out and this is again back in the era when safety cars were slow Senna was a very big critic of this so he was a very vocal critic of how slow these safety cars were and he would be on his radio yelling saying that thing has to go faster it has to go faster it has to go faster so they spend the next five laps or pardon me they spend through the fifth lap cleaning out these cars MH so as the safety car pulls in it is the end of the fifth lap okay so the sixth lap is the first flying lap of the race on cold tires this cold tires yeah now there's another important concept that needs to be explained which is the fastest lap of the race it's always documented today a point is actually given for it for qualifying no no no in the race oh oh yeah yeah yeah of the race yes in the race the person who does the single fastest lap gets an extra point provided they were in the top 10 yeah um back in the 80s and 90s they weren't giving points for it but it was still noted you can still go back and look up any race and say who had the fastest lap yeah it shouldn't be surprising to people that the fastest lap is almost always in one of the two last you know two or three last laps of the race why because the cars have the lowest amount of fuel MH so to put this in perspective also they're not conserving anymore yeah they're all out so a car today might weigh 700 kilos so they're much bigger than they were back in the day but they start the race with a 100 kilos of fuel mhm so just give you a sense of how much of the weight is fuel at the beginning of a Race So at the end of the race they're down to 2 kilos of fuel or 1 kilo of fuel so think about the relative change in weight and obviously that's why if you look at any race over the last 20 years the fastest laps going to occur in the last couple laps yeah like 15% reduction in weight so here we do flying lap number six first flying lap of the race and Senna is off like a dart and to put that lap in context uh a couple things stand out to me so uh

[01:05:18] Damon Hill explained this to me in great detail the curve where ultimately Sena would die on the seventh lap is called tamborello mhm it's a curve that no longer exists at IMA it's deemed too dangerous okay there were too many bad accidents there sen as being the final and most deadly um it's a high speeed it's now it's a very highspeed left-hander okay and it's an allout corner to death it's today a chicane which means they have slowed it way the hell down yeah um every corner has a driving line meaning there is a line you take to get the best angle and the there are a few times when drivers do not take the driving line and as Damon explained to me nobody took the driving line at tamborello because it was too bumpy oh okay and you know to be on a bumpy line yeah when you're going that that probably 205 miles hour yeah you would just choose to go a little slower yeah and drive on a smoother part of the track even though it's a longer distance so as they came through so T burella is near the beginning of the lap so it's tamborello is like it's like the first big curve of of of of the of the lap so as they come past the start

[01:06:32] Finish Line to lap six Damon notices that even though they're on really cold tires Senna takes the racing line through tamborello and he's thinking to himself what in the hell is he doing yeah like why would you take this risk yeah and his car is bottoming out so it is sparking like crazy yeah now we will never know if indeed Senna had a slow puncture in his tires meaning that he run over some debris during the four laps when they were going over where the crash was that was leading to a slow loss of pressure in his tires yeah or was it just that his car the tires didn't have enough temperature in them and that's why the pressure was so low but either way he is sparking like crazy taking the racing line through Torell and right behind him is Schumacher and right behind him is Hill and of course they're not going to take the racing line they're offline taking the smooth they part of the curve well at the end of the sixth lap Senna has driven what is either the second or third fastest what will be the second or third fastest lap of that race really on a full tank of fuel and ice cold tires wow that just gives you a sense of how hard he was pushing yeah do you almost think it's in response to having been rattled going into the race cuz I certainly have experienced this where you're like you're scared and then the inner monologue starts going [ __ ] you you [ __ ] [ __ ] you're going double hard like as a response to the fear do you think there was an all inness to it I think I don't know that it was in response to their fear I think it was he had to win that race and there's something that people didn't know until after the raceone there was that but also when he died you know what they found in his car an Austrian flag a to honor ratsenberg who died the day before so he always carried a

[01:08:26] Brazilian flag in his car every race and he would wave the Brazilian flag and he wanted to win that day not just because he needed to for his season but he wanted to be able to wave an Austrian flag for Rand [ __ ] so I don't think there was any way he was going to lose that race he was going to win that race at any expense and this is a guy who's normally possessed to win every race so you just take that up a notch yeah yeah and so as they finish lap six he's now pulling out from everybody they enter lap seven and this is the footage that people have seen a thousand times before doesn't matter how many times I see it I keep waiting for it to have a different entry I keep waiting for a different outcome and it never happens and as they're entering tambillo he drives straight off the track really straight off you do you see him attempt to turn so now I've watched this a 100,000 times and I will tell you what I believe is happening and I will also tell what

[01:09:25] Damon believes is happening and I think that in many ways even though Damon's view which is now my view and by the way it's also Adrian ne's view right so Adrian's written an amazing book for people who are interested called how to build a car okay which is the definitive book on car design he goes through every one of his cars that he's built so it's a chapter per car and obviously one of the we should add for fun you can debate all day about who was the best driver whether you think it's shoe marer right you can't debate who the best designer is he has 14 yeah titles or something it's sort of that's the most winningest human being to ever do this yeah it's it's sort of like um I was telling my son like we can debate who the best quarterback and running back and things are you can't debate who the best wide receiver is it's the only position in football for which there actually is no debate and that is Jerry Rice okay yeah

[01:10:16] J Jerry Rice is so in a league of his own in football that you know it's really a question of who's second or third okay um but you're right Adrien is in a league of his own and so so when you read the chapter on the fw16 which was the car that Senna died in um was that an Adrian car yes oh it was oh yeah oh wow yeah oh wow this is I mean Adrien has has has talked at length um about how difficult it was to how do you what does it mean when you lose a driver in your car and by the way um you know

[01:10:47] Patrick head Adrien newie to this day um if not for the statute of limitations in Italy would be in jail because the Italian courts found them liable for that really yeah but by the time they got to that decision the stute limitations had expired for whatever it was deemed manslaughter so Draconian rule but really short statue

[01:11:10] Yeah counteracted by but but the the view of the Italian courts was that this was a design failure of the car so let's maybe back up for a moment when Senna got to Williams he hated the car not just because of how it handled but he didn't like how he fit in the cockpit okay so again it's like all these things that he kind of took for granted at

[01:11:30] McLaren which was having a car that was built around him he gets to Williams and he doesn't fit in the cockpit right and he doesn't like where the wheel fits he's taller than most no no he just it's just his style he wants the wheel in a certain place and it's not okay so they actually have to extend the steering column by some 6 in to put it where he wants it okay well in doing so they had to make the steering shaft narrower than what the spec was called for really to keep weight down they adding l no to keep it at an angle that they that got it out of the cockpit got it where he wanted it okay what both Adrien writes and I have spent so many hours discussing this with Damon and I have gone back and watched onboard footage so many times and the best on board is from the car behind him which is Schumacher's car uhhuh this is what I truly believe happened as he entered tamborello which is a left ER he lost rear grip of the car when it bounced so the way these cars work they have a huge um ventur effect with the air between like there's a perfect amount of air that must be between the floorboard and the ground and when you botom out you momentarily lose all of that aerodynamics right all the down Force that's right yeah and so what I think happened is he's going into tamborello mhm and because the car is bottoming out either just because of how bumpy on the line that he is or and or because his tires are cold and or because he has a small slow leak of air temperat of of air due to running over debris the bottom of the car slides out uhhuh and I it's possible I am convincing myself I can see this on the shoe marer on board because I now am believing this but I really believe there's a split second where you can see the rear move uhhuh now it's worth explaining to people what that's called that is called over steer over steer is when the rear wheels of a car are moving or turning faster than the front wheels of the car over steer is a phenomenon that a driver will feel long before you see it so you will see over steer because you're spinning this way yeah but you feel it in your butt before that and you can almost hear it in the tires you hear the loss of traction so it's not surprising to me that you don't have to see much over steer for Senna to have felt it right so what do you do when you over steer so when a car is over steering this way you course correct by counter steering into it so if the car is over steering to the left you counter steer right and that snaps the back of the car in Direction and then you you're you're backing a little bit off throttle and you're coming back to throttle and you're going you don't have to be doing the throttle correction if you catch it quick so you could stay Full Throttle and counter steer back yeah what I believe happened is the car over steered due to a loss of rear traction sen a counter steered and it immediately regained grip and shot him straight off the track and what the Telemetry shows is that he went on Max break and hit the wall okay now um the steering column was broken when the car was recovered yeah and so the question is did the steering column break from the Collision or did it break beforehand yeah it's very hard to know but if you look at the lights and I have the steering wheel that he used the day before okay in in qualifying so I actually have the steering wheel so I can see what the lights were and if you look at the video of the lights you can see that he was counter steering before he left the road now I have heard very confusing reports some say that the wheel had no torque in it when he left the track and that would certainly suggest that the wheel was broken that the steering column was broken yeah but what you don't see is you don't see him turning the wheel also just the odds even though it was a smaller diameter than it was supposed to be the notion of torque breaking through steering a steel rod seemed really unique and weird like there would have have to have been some metallurgical issue with the piece of metal to begin with I don't think in a million years he could turn it hard enough to snap well and he wouldn't be at that point really it wouldn't be that it's it's a delicate move when you're counter steering it's not hugely abrupt but again if it were the wheel breaking you would see his hands doing this as he's going straight off and and you do not yeah also perhaps some unintended the front wheels could go in any direction that they wanted so he hits the wall H gosh I'm blanking on the exact speed that he hits um it's in the ballpark of 150 M hour by the time he's in full break so he's fully breaking on the way to the wall um I didn't see tamborella for the first time in person till 5 years ago it was my first time going to Ima and to to see the the wall that he hit after watching that crash 87,3 42 times I was blown away how much closer it was than I would have expected really on the TV it looks really far and you that's where you sort of lull yourself into a sense of oh God

[01:17:13] I just can't believe he wasn't able to slow himself down enough that it didn't matter but it turns out there's a ravine right behind tamborello and so Senna had many times petitioned for the wall of tamborello to be moved out one of his best friends Gart Berger had crashed there nearly fatally a couple of years earlier in 91 in the Ferrar and they were like we're going to we're going to abort this race if you guys don't move the wall out further yeah and then they said we can't move the wall like there's a ravine there right so they kind of the dryers were like all right well I guess we have to keep this wall here what was um what was the surface of the wall back then was there anything to nothing just a con Nothing by today's standards of1 just at literally a concrete wall yeah and so he hits the concrete wall the right front wheel comes off and it's actually the suspension Rod of that wheel that punctures his helmet um it's clear that he actually died at the track um I mean died a brain death at the track his heart was beating they were doing CPR on him and they airlifted him to the hospital um and he was not pronounced dead until that night with a beating heart but brain dead um you know

[01:18:31] I think you know I've talked with Joseph about that as well as like um you know when Joseph got to the hospital um Sid Watkins who at the time was the medical physician of F1 um how good were those guys Sid was I'm always trying to figure that out yeah no Sid was Sid was the real deal and and he was he was a part of F1 in the 70s he was was certainly a part of making F1 safer I believe I think Bernie eckelson brought Sid

[01:18:59] Watkins in to F1 in the late 70s um and he had done a lot to improve driver safety the drivers had enormous respect for him uh Legend has it although again Sid is no longer alive so I don't know if this is true but there's an interview where Sid talks about how the Night Before the Race he and Senna were talking and he told Senna you should just retire you got nothing left to prove this is after ratzenberger had died he could tell Senna was distraught he said to

[01:19:30] Senna you should just retire lets you and I both retire and go fishing yeah and Senna said I can't um and um and so when Joseph got to the hospital um Sid was walking out of the ICU and didn't say a word just looked at Joseph but didn't say a word and that's when Joseph knew he was dead he went in to see him and you know he said there was not a scratch on his body really not a scratch on his body so this other than obviously the head trauma and it where to go through his helmet it's not clear um fortunately there are no images of it this is one of the nice things about it is nobody's ever taken a photo of his his body in this like we don't we don't no God knows what happened to that helmet or anything like that yeah um so

[01:20:19] I don't know what part of the helmet was punctured but I know this Sid said that when he arrived at the body and they pulled him out of the car he he knew he was dead he he knew that this was an unsurvivable head trauma and I can tell it's heartbreaking to you that that happened um what is your overall assessment of athletes dying what is your relationship with that because I have a very specific compartmentalized view of all that and it may seem sociopathic on some level well I can imagine what you're about to say and

[01:21:00] I don't know that I would push back on it um look let's take a step back and think about things right you alluded to this earlier there's something about James Dean and Marilyn Monroe and JFK that you know creates a legend status in them and part of it is like they died in their Prime and they were at the peak and we never saw them get never saw them decline they didn't have to adjust to a non- exciting life right they didn't have to fight and Sen was truly at his best so his you know he died at the third race into the 94 season most observers myself included would say Senna peaked in 93 like his best season he even though he didn't win the championship in '93 he was in a very inferior car still managed to win five races and give us some of the most heroic performances we've ever seen

[01:22:02] there's a part of you that says there are worse ways to go the context is such that it is sadder than I think it would normally be in that one guy already died another guy almost died and he had those reservations about driving that that complicates yeah my you know verdict on the whole thing but in general

[01:22:25] I find that I sometimes I'm talking to people and the singular measure of life for a lot of people is just longevity it's just duration duration and I look at some of these people I remember when Paul Walker died and this is probably did you know Paul I never met Paul um shockingly cuz we were like interseting car cultur stuff it seems like I would have been I have friends that were friends with them and adored them but you know when he died obviously it's it's super sad but there was some part of my brain that was like if you were to have um measured somehow the amount of experience he had had on planet Earth in that period I would argue very very few people had lived a bigger life or more of a life or had traveled more and met more people and had more experiences and had more heightened everything so you know what I would not want is a very boring subtle existence with no mountains and valleys for 130 years that just doesn't appeal to me at all and then I also am not overly sacon about death in general in that I always remember I remind myself it's sad for the people left behind it's not I mean if I believed in a higher power and stuff maybe I would have a different view but for me it's like you're aive and then you're not and you don't know you're not so there's no period of being sad that you're no longer alive so when

[01:24:01] I just put all these things into evaluating I don't know that I'm as sad as other people are cuz I think a lot of these people ended up living 10x the life of someone that lives to be 110 and then if I if you presented me with the options if I live like Senna to 34 or I live like some of my neighbors growing up to 105 I would pick S I I I I think I would and I even I engage in a lot of behaviors that are dangerous and and people scratch their head at and I just feel like this is the only version

[01:24:37] I want of it so whatever the consequences I am knowledgeable of it I accept it obviously a family complicates that yeah you I was just about to ask you that question right so there was a there's a there's a the legend has it that that Enzo Ferrari used to keep tabs on his drivers based on different milestones in life and he would discount their lap times based on that so once a driver had a girlfriend two10 slower once he got married 510 slower once he had a kid 1 second slower and it's just like as the you know the as the stakes get higher you naturally just can't can't be all out anymore it's interesting so there's there's there's there's things I do where that crosses my mind and there are other things that simply don't and I think I am I think maybe from years of being an addict my compartmentalization is very strong psychopathically strong so I can be doing one thing as like I can rule out the whole rest of the world if I choose to so when I'm driving on the 405 in Los

[01:25:51] Angeles on my multi Strada and I'm lane splitting and I'm [ __ ] flying like I did when I was a motorcycle messenger those times I go slow down I want your little girls to have a dad for as long as they can but when I'm on the track just Monday at Kota no one entered my that's why I like the activity is not only did no one in my life enter my mind none of my problems entered my mind none of my anxieties entered my mind none of my goals in life were on the table it's turn to turn turn to turn present present present present and in the present it's just me and the motorcycle on the track and for me that buys me so much in the rest of my life it is like I imagine what people who do three-month retreats in India get from meditating it's just this very specific elevated

[01:26:46] Moment of clarity and presence that I don't know how I would get otherwise so on that situ in that situation on the track I don't don't ever think about it um I had a single moment where I had a race in Fontana and it was when our oldest daughter Lincoln was probably only about 11 months old she had never had a big cold yet or a sickness and so she was really sick which made her if you have kids you know extra snuggly extra doile and I remember like picking her up out of the crib and I was holding her and she was so snug and I did think I got to get on the road to get to

[01:27:28] Fontana and I thought I really should stay here the rest of the day and snuggle this little girl and the whole ride to Fontana which is pretty far from where I live in LA the conversation was okay you've gotten five trophies this year what are we after what is the number of trophies before the ego feels like you did it you're a you know you're a big boy you're a man what's the number we should at least know are we after 20 trophies are we after three is four enough and I do think that line of thinking does enter my mind on many topics like how many movies did you want to direct you should kind of know you shouldn't just kind of aimlessly be doing it or so it's interesting I bounced back and forth but I did decide after Fontana I'm like I'm giving this a rest I was also a dude in the same series died in Europe it runs the Super trao Series I think ran in three continents and a guy burned to death that that same weekend and so I was like all right we're not doing this we did it we're proud of ourselves we're a man we're all grown up and we're going to stop this and about two years ago I was like I think I'm ready to race again so it just changed what's your analysis while you're well I mean I think you you know I I completely hear that argument um and and yes Senna lived 10 lives in his 30 four years um and not only that I mean he's one of the few people who still matters in his death yeah he truly matters meaning you almost don't go through a single telecast of a race currently where you don't hear his name once yeah and and even Beyond just that in terms of what he stood for still matters if you look at the Sena

[01:29:14] Foundation right so right after he died well before he died he had spoken to his older sister and said you know I really want to get more formal in my giving cuz up until that point he had just been very quietly giving mostly to education right mostly because as you can understand the poverty in Brazil was so significant at that time but he said to his sister viven I I want to I want to make this more structured I want to create a foundation where we do this right and of course he would go on to die very soon after that but his sister honored that wish and now the Senate

[01:29:50] Foundation which has probably given over half a billion dollars to education in Brazil is one of the most important foundations yeah and so in that sense like he does live on he he he lives on in the sense that you know anybody who thinks about this sport knows like what greatness was right even even if you don't like him like I believe me I have a friend who doesn't even really like him that much it's hard to be friends with him sometimes I'm just kidding um but like you know he's adamant that you know Lewis is better than than Senna and um um and and he sort of has a negative view of everything Senna he's like he thinks of oh you know Senna was horrible when he crashed into Prost in Suzuka in 91 or it was 90 actually um and and but that said like you know his impact on the sport is is forever the other thing that's worth mentioning and I don't think anybody would dispute this his death did change the sport forever in the sense that it changed safe instantaneously it's not that he was the first driver to die and you could even argue that there was a comparable death in the 1960s when Jim Clark died Jim

[01:31:04] Clark was the reigning world champion when he died in 1960 uh in 1960 God 1967 I believe but the death you know in in the 19 first of all he died in a Formula 2 race back then drivers would drive all series it wasn't just like even if you were an F1 driver you still drove F2 to pay the bills like the sport was so much smaller back then right yeah so Jim

[01:31:24] Clark actually died in an F2 race but it wasn't seen by the world like by the time Senna died the sport was much bigger and it completely changed everything meaning the sport got so serious it was like nhart dying in NASCAR that's right we get a Hans device immediately yeah although it wasn't the Hans available before ear it was available but it wasn't mandator mandatory yeah erard refused to wear it right they all did they're like H goalies that wouldn't wear a face there again this male pride manchess yeah yeah and Hans would have saved him he had a

[01:31:59] Basler skull fracture yeah so upsetting you know it's interesting there's a a really eerie interview of Dale nhart the day Senna died because so it's May 1st 94 and Earhart's being interviewed having won a race and they're like hey you know we just want to take even though it's NASCAR totally different Ser like hey we just want to you know acknowledge s's death and you know erard said a lot of nice things and like he he loved him yeah yeah yeah he seems to be uh very unifying in people's love yeah so I you know I think about um dare we talk about because I think what's really it it would be incomplete to say it's all statistics based cuz it's not and so I think what dare we say in public why we both don't aren't drawn to

[01:32:50] Lewis I wonder if in exploring that it would reveal deal why we like the ones we do I mean it's it's all different for me right like obviously I have a very close personal connection to Sebastian vle yeah and also I had stopped paying attention to F1 after 1997 okay so um in 1997 jacqu VNV also Canadian and the son of Jill vnb so I you know grew up paying a lot of attention to jacqu VN because he was racing indie car before he went to F1 and um so when when VNV won the title in 97 I was in medical school and that was kind of a period in my life when I just decided like I'm going to start paying more attention to school than sports like I stopped watching football I didn't pay any attention to F1 at all

[01:33:42] Beyond like a little bit so here we entered sort of so hackin and won 98 and 99 and then Schumacher had that run of of five victories yeah I will say this deep down there was a tiny tiny part of me that didn't like schacher and held him and this is going to sound ridiculous held him partially responsible for senna's death because he was the one applying the pressure and he was driving a car with that I felt was illegal and Senna believed was illegal right so Senna also believed he was run outrunning a car that had traction control when his car was undrivable yeah but but we must also admit Senna had gone to Williams to drive a car that was going to have a huge technological advantage over everyone else so it's like anyone would have used whatever yeah yeah yeah but but the difference is active suspension was fully legal

[01:34:26] Williams just had a better although you know it's really interesting if you go back and look the active suspension of senna's car in 93 was probably just as good as the Williams the reason the Williams car was so dominant was it had the Renault engine that was incredible okay and the Honda engine in '93 the

[01:34:46] Ford cworth engine was was nowhere near as good that year okay and so Senna I mean again cuz he still managed to win five races in a season where his car was clearly outclassed um but the point is everybody could have active it's just McLaren and Williams had a better active than everybody else Williams also happened to have the best engine by far so it was hands down the best car but the detuning of the active was hardest on them to recover um but I think that um I didn't come back to paying attention to F1 until vettel's years okay so vettle won his first title in 2010 uhuh so he won four in a row also Adrian ne's cars right so 10 11 12 13 MH and then what happened is you had that huge rule change into 2014 and that created the new so every time there's a rule change right that's typically when you create a new dominance and that's when the dominance shifted from Red Bull to

[01:35:43] Mercedes yeah before it's now coming back to Red Bull cuz they nailed the engine right the the engine absolutely nailed the engine and Red Bull spent the next six seasons with a lawnmower engine and then it was only in 2020 that they got the Honda back and then by 2021 Max wins even though Lewis actually has a better car in 21 he does I would argue a much better car yep yeah yeah uh if I had to say first of all what I like about Lewis is something I also like about Senna which is this is an outsider he brings like a rock star quality to it he's like fashionable he transcends the sport I think all those things are cool uh it's awesome that there's a black Formula One like I can't help but love that but by the time I started watching it the Mercedes was just so dominant um you know I I I think and and and Alonzo was someone who came out last year and said this publicly which is like you have to kind of evaluate these people by did they win first against their teammate or did they win first against another team for Alonzo it's more significant if you run win against another team and if you just look at uh where Mercedes was finishing all those years it's one two it's onew it's one two and the fact that Lewis was complaining last year that the the Red

[01:37:10] Bull was so dominant when in fact there's just reams of data of him qualifying 1.4 seconds ahead certain times of second place you know um max was was the underdog like when I entered it was just very easy this dude's won seven years in a row I don't want to see that again and the car is so significantly better it's not you know it's not even remotely fair I would come to learn it's never remotely fair but at that time I was shocked with you know well this is an interesting point though that people ask me a lot about which is what's the difference between F1 today and F1 in the 80s and one of the biggest differences is um F1 has always been a sport about the limit of mechanical potential and the limit of human potential and how do you merge those but the difference is in the 80s and frankly into the late 90s uh or at least the mid90s the balance between driver and car was about 50/50 just to put a stake in the ground meaning it was 50% the car and 50% the driver that's unimaginable right now correct today it's probably 7520 maybe 80 20 yeah I mean with certain drivers you could put it up to 25 but in general right in other words the difference is if you put Max into the AL car today he wouldn't win a race can't win he can't win a single race no and the unless it's raining right but but here's the point right you go back into the 80s Senna is in a Tolman that first year and he basically wins Monica shoeer a orally right in the beneton car which is not competitive and he's pying well but yeah but he eventually did win in that but if you again if you just go back and look at how much Senna was able to do before he got into the McLaren per car before he got into the perfect car he was still clobbering it not every race but there's also there's there's there's another set of variables which I think made the racing back then more fun too is that the reliability was an enormous Factor too so like you could have the best car but every car is a dnf two races a season cuz the the reliability just wasn't there so that threw things into a much more unpredictable now when you see Max retire because of a mechanical failure how did this happen someone's getting fired this doesn't happen right but back then it was like every three races you lost a handful of cars grenaded their motor and right did all kinds of stuff yeah so that made it more interesting yeah I I think it's uh and again like you you look at the the dawnington right you look at these races where senna's ability to drive in the rain was just so magical there's a few dudes in Moto GP currently that are that way it's like it starts raining and you're like okay Jack Miller you're up you're going to destroy today on a way less competitive bike so Angel Angelo pello who just passed away exactly a year ago but Angelo who I never knew in person but I got to know him through video so i' FaceTime with him a few times uh and had the had the chance to speak with him several times um over the last five years prior to his death um

[01:40:35] Angelo was the team principal for dap uh which was the premier carting team of the 70s and 80s so Senna was so Senna and um and another guy Fullerton were sort of the two biggest names in European cing in the late '70s and early 80s and um you know I remember him saying that as good as you think Senna was in an F1 car he was even better in a cart really he said he was so good in a cart and so good in the rain that when it was raining he would usually try to petition the marshals to cancel the race and just give s of the trophy he's like why why bother ruining the cards today we know who's going to win just give Senna the trophy and then of course they would say no they race Senna would win I mean would you know double lap everybody yeah and um and is a cool aspect yeah and then that's I I'll say this like as a as a really really lousy driver it's hard to put in words how much more difficult it gets in the rain yeah I immediately go straight to the motorcycles cuz what when I watching Moto GP and watching them in the rain and admitting to myself they're turning faster lap times at that track than I can on dve yeah is so humbling and yes Senna on any track in a in the world full downpour would destroy you on the perfect day which is so humbling and again it's like what watching what he's doing and you can see there's there's some amazing video when he's in the John player special in 85 his liy every by the way yeah it is when he wins his first race in Portugal that year it is pissing rain uhhuh he is driving down the Straits and the car is doing this hydroplaning it's literally dancing as he's going down the straight and other drivers are spinning everywhere and anywhere yeah um that's that's a very special feel and by the way that's like you look at Max in the rain he's he's he's Head and Shoulders above the others he don't care well back to Lewis so so I can acknowledge that he is absolutely brilliant I mean the guy's absolutely brilliant he's so smooth he's so

[01:43:09] Savvy um if I'm critical he doesn't fight and so who I've ended up loving in Moto GP is like Valentino Ross is the God of all gods I think he's the God of all Moto Motor Sports what he did I don't think any car driver's ever done in his willingness to fight literally kick his opponent while they're in a turn um is is that X Factor that I'm so drawn to so and how many people don't like him for the same reason I mean how often do you encounter somebody who because again there are people who would say look nobody fought harder than Senna but then there's a subset of people that would say they yeah now he has those two incidents where he was crashed into to take him out of winning a championship and then he also crashed into somebody to secure his championship and for me I get it that's what he's there to do

[01:44:05] I like I have defended Max now listen when Max would not let czecho yeah that was he wouldn't help czecho at all which was such a bummer if any driver in the history of F1 deserved absolutely the help it was czecho cuz czecho fell on his sword and 2021 over and over again to help him beat Lewis the last race of the year he sacrificed his qual lap to tow him yeah and then he held up Lewis I mean this guy did everything did Max do that because he believed czecho had purposely crashed crashed in Monaco that year in quali no

[01:44:43] I well personally I I've not asked Max this but for me it's so Crystal Clear he's even been on the radio saying it out loud so we've heard him say it he's like no no I told told you I'm never doing that and it's true Max gets in a car and he's going to finish as high up as he can period nothing else in the world matters no other humans there's no paying back of favor yeah he can't he can't not try to drive as fast as he can at all times period I love it if you hate Mex of course you would hate that no I it's deplorable but I love him so I'm like no this is a he is a cyborg he gets in the car and he's got to get the very best outcome that's possible period yeah it's like the Scorpion who asks the turtle for you know the story of the Scorpion so scorpion and a turtle are on one side of the river and the

[01:45:35] Scorpion says hey can you help me get to the other side of the river and the turtle's like are you kidding me like you're a scorpion you're going to kill me yeah and he's like why would I do that like you're going to help me to the other side of the river and this Turtle thinks to himself well that's true he can't kill me cuz we'll both drown and sure enough the Scorpion hops on the

[01:45:52] Turtles back they're going across the river and halfway across the turtles like ow what the hell is that and he turns and he says you stung me and the Scorpion says I'm sorry it's my nature like you know he just can't you know it's and and yes I I think there's something to your so I guess I overlook it because I don't think he has the the capacity to be generous I think he has a single focus and that's what I love about him that's why I love watching him drive and he'll die it's so obvious he'll [ __ ] die in any given turn that 2021 season it the greatest thing ever it was the what a time to like I had only watched maybe two years up until that point and to land at that moment and of course I love Max people love

[01:46:32] Lewis I fought with many people over that last race which is so ridiculous I find it so do we have the same explanation which is like we always unlap cars what is everyone talking about the weird thing that happened was that they didn't unlap the cars quicker yeah and that I mean so so the the the purist would argue yes you should have always unla the cars they should have unla all the cars yeah so let's say they would have unla all of them we're in the same situation they didn't do it all great but what is what is absolutely standard is they should have been unla and probably earlier than they were and so the other issue that Everyone likes by the way when people refer to that as the greatest Injustice in F1 it only tells me how shallow their history is of

[01:47:15] F1 well also it's it's very reminiscent in my opinion of the pr Senna battle they always went to Prost he got the call every time and sorry but from my point of view Lewis had gotten every call that year absolutely every time they went into the turn at the same time would have been ruled a racing incident any other time Max had to give up his spot to Lewis 10 times that year and certainly if the roles were reversed he wouldn't he would have been going in with more points to begin with also he would have not given up a lap earlier in the race like there's a lot of things I think actually what you saw is like him succeed in spite of the fact that every call went to Lewis that whole season yeah to me that's the most interesting season because the better driver beat the better car yes that was the closest that's the that's the first time you really saw that in a decade yes totally um and it the evidence is clear through um what's his name our favorite finish man uh his teammate oh Tre yeah

[01:48:24] Bas Bas is winning races he's getting pole I love Bas but I think his post Mercedes career gives us a sense of where he's at in the pack yeah and so the fact that he was regularly winning races and getting pull position yeah um it's hard not to want to see them on the same team but I don't even think it would be that fun to watch yeah if you had to order who you think the fastest drivers are right now would you dare say out loud in public I think Max is the fastest uh by quite a bit I think

[01:48:59] Fernando is the second fastest again you're you're asking me not in this you're asking me who the best drivers are not thinking not taking into consideration their cars correct yeah yeah I think max they're all in the exact same spec model well that's even a difficult question for the following reason right which is different cars have different styles the Red Bull is really built around Max he likes over steer there's certain things he loves and and the way Max drives again this is another reason why I think Max is so good is he drives a car that um has a couple of features it's a car that can be driven very fast but has a very narrow operating window to be driven fast very hard to drive fast it's very hard to drive it fast and it's um I think in many ways it's a Testament to how far czecho has come that he is now at least three races into this season he's doing well this he's doing he's doing quite well yeah and and I think that um I think he deserves credit for that because a lot of other drivers got spit out you know gastle and Alban got abated I couldn't love him more I really

[01:50:12] I think he is like the most standup guy out there um I love Alonso for so many obvious reasons yeah so I think Alonzo is the second best driver on the grid um my question marks are I think it's possible Lando is insanely talented yeah I mean I would love to see Max and Lando in the same car to see what would go down I think that Lando has overachieved in that McLaren every single year and does things that are impossible I also love Charles it's interesting

[01:50:50] Sciences dominating him this year but in general I think and again we look at the poll position why we would say sen is so great like Charles one laps are some of the bests I've ever seen where you're like oh how did he just pull that out I think he's so special so for me I'm I'm confused whether I think Charles

[01:51:09] Orlando's faster well I mean the problem is Charles I think he makes too many mistakes in the races right like he's if you asked me three years ago look at all the guys on the grid how many of these guys will win a championship in their career I would have said Charles I would have said Lando I would have said

[01:51:31] George I'm not positive it will be any of them I mean it should be it's hard to imagine at least one of them not winning a title but I don't think it's a guarantee anymore I don't either it just really drives me mad to see them in such different cars uh especially Lando and the McLaren it's just like it's it was a dog it was garbage it was good for a few races last year you're like are they back and then this year there's no consistency so I don't know what it is but I was shocked to see how much faster he drove the car than Danny who I love Yeah shock what do you what do you what do you make of

[01:52:11] Danny's stint at McLaren I think a combin I and I don't I've never asked him and we're friends and I think that's why we're friends I don't ask him any questions about F1 but my uh armchair expert analysis would be a the car was built for Lando in the same way that the car's built for Max I think that's very obvious that the car is solely designed for Lando's strengths

[01:52:37] I think that's a big issue I also think that um third team in two years is unsettling and disruptive and I just don't know that he ever found his rhythm there I think some of it was mental but I was shocked I was quite shocked I mean he did win a race in Lando didn't which I love yeah and that gets into this other weird thing the magic of people who can win and not win it's like there have been basketball players that are as good as some of the guys that won and there's some people are winners and some people aren't I don't know what that magic thing is but like Lando as good as he is he just can't finish above second is so interesting and that Danny who is yeah disproportionately for how consistent he's driven of course he got in there and won it's just interesting and and it was a great race to win at Monza yeah yeah yeah was exciting yeah it's it is um and and I think you know I Carlos I think is is having a great year I want him cuz Carlos has been so inconsistent if there if there's something we can be critical of Carlos it's like he drives like a striped ass St three races in a row and then he crashes three races in a row and you're like what is going on with him but somehow the consistency seems to be there and I think the cosmic joke of All Jokes which is happening right now it's the only thing I think is interesting about this season is that Ferrari is getting rid of their fastest driver to overpay for the second fastest driver on Mercedes it's so Ferrari it's should be a t-shirt yeah it's incred what are they thinking watching this season yeah I who knows um I I'm also surprised that Lewis is going to Ferrari because I believe Mercedes will be a better team in 26 than

[01:54:43] Ferrari in other words I have more confidence in Toto in Toto than anybody else to turn that team around yeah uh and and I just think you know I think that the Ferrari of the Schumacher era is a totally different team like it's not it has nothing to do with the team today and that that team is you know I think Fred is more competent than his predecessor but um I still think that culturally that team struggles well someone was saying which

[01:55:15] I thought was kind of an astute observation I didn't realize is they said you have to realize Ferrari operates as a national team it's not like any of the other teams that is the nation's team it's in the newspapers what they should do there is some sense there that is much you know it's very unique to Ferrari that's why Ferrari was so successful in the Schumacher era which is it was not an Italian run team it was a French Run team oh really yeah so the all the leadership was was German

[01:55:47] French like yeah it wasn't being run by Italians a lot of people say that yeah it's it's more of a committee than any other team because of it being the national symbol of Italy you know my my WhatsApp group my F1 WhatsApp group um the the the thing that gives that group the most Joy is watching how bad Alpine is doing right now that's that's like that's the source of the most amusement and why did they did they previously hate Alpine yeah I think um I don't know look I I that's been the biggest drop in performance I've seen since I've been watching it Alpine last year to this year yeah but even last year they finished they were they were I think they really underperformed last year for what was expected right but those two were like getting into the points every other race now they're they're like 19 and 20 every race yeah they're worse than Williams or yeah I don't know I think there's just it's it's it's it's um it's very confusing why Alpine would do so poorly yeah um they they because they do well in other

[01:56:49] Series right like they're they're they're supercars and hypercars and prototypes like these other cars they they they do a pretty good job so um that's interesting and I just love how much those two hate each other that's amusing as well it is I think they're the most hated team and my my wife is obsessed with Pierre she loves him loves he's got a following girls love Pierre my he's having fun my wife loves her some Pierre is that number one for her yeah it is really yep and she's got a

[01:57:19] Pierre signed hat it's to Jill from the tripod did he sign at the tripod no you know that famously last year he was in an interview and they said what's your nickname and he said tripod stop it yes on TV and and my daughter loves Dany and she's got a Dany autographed hat and it's to Olivia and it's like oh she's obsessed with Dany and I'll tell you something really funny I I don't know

[01:57:48] Danny but I've met him a few times and the last time I bumped into him which was last year he well he knew who I was so he said hey Peter we got chitchatting blah blah blah and then he said How's Olivia doing and I was like what how how do you know and a year earlier he had met my daughter taken a picture with her and signed a hat for her that's impossible I was like how do you remember that I couldn't believe and I even asked my friend Luke did you tell him and Luke was like no

[01:58:21] Danny's like that he remembers details I was like that's freakish I will say this so I interviewed Danny and we got along really well and then we set up a hang then he loves Motocross so every time he's in La we I take him to ride Motocross and we definitely developed this friendship and it's been lovely and but then he came over to the house for dinner and he shows up with like three presents he brought my wife a candle he brought you know I show up and I've barely remembered to be fully rest when

[01:58:52] I go to parties you bring gum yes I bring all my nicotine products and that's it um but the thoughtfulness the manners I think he has a Persona on drive to survive which is awesome it's very entertaining it's cocky it's arrogant at times but real life Dany is like insanely sincere incredible manners clearly raised perfectly like the fact that he remembers your daughter's name year impossible but also not shocking for him um he's a really [ __ ] good dude impossibly good dude and by the way

[01:59:29] I think on average that's probably true of more F1 drivers than it's not well you know what I've learned from him that I really enjoyed finding out is that I think Max also has a Persona which is very different from who he actually is and and I've learned this from Daniel and a couple other drivers and then mostly the girlfriends of these drivers that I'll always I'm always mining for

[01:59:51] Max details whenever I'm talking to someone and across the board they are all like he's just the shiest sweetest guy he's like an introvert and he's shy and him being in on camera or having to be anything public it's just not for him so I think it it brings out this protective side of himself but in general unanimously agreed that he's a sweet shy boy which is so counter to yo it's hard to imagine I know I know you think about the trauma of growing up under that guy oh my God you know we did a whole on the

[02:00:30] F1 podcast we did a whole episode on y on Yos we're obsessed with Yos the amount of criminal activity he's been a part of is impossible like convicted for fracturing a guy's skull at the go-kart track with his own father so Dad and Grandpa beat a guy to the point where they fractured his skull um he was momentarily arrested for attempted murder t-boning an ex-girlfriend in an intersection at full speed and claiming that it was just an accident uh some other I mean the hostility that's just purling out it makes me really compassionate to Max I'm like God this kid really survived this and Ador him clearly yeah they have this incredible relationship I'm like my that was really nice and I could barely get along with him cuz I had so many issues I've I've never met Max uh but a good friend of mine knows know him very well and and has said like his cuz you could sort of think like what what is Max's superpower cuz he's so good in a car so he's he's he's just he's so head and shoulders above everybody else you don't realize it but he said part of his superpower is just that nothing phases him like and that's hard to put in words how big a deal that is in driving you know before we were recording I was showing you some video from my driving this week and you know I was tell you like like worst day I've ever had on a track right like spinning nonstop and the problem is

[02:01:59] I've never done anything in my life where the psychology of performance compounds more geometrically like the when you start making mistakes yes they they pile up in a way that is unique yeah and and it's like intellectually you understand I have to be a goldfish in this moment I have to forget what just happened yeah and you I at least for me on on this particular day I couldn't and it started in my first session so first session out

[02:02:28] I had a lockup uh and uh for people who don't understand what that means it means like the tires were a little too cold I hit the brakes a little too hard they locked we don't have ABS in these cars and now you can't turn I can't turn I can't stop I can't do anything and this circuit I'm on has no runoff so it's like when you lock up I had three

[02:02:50] NS to realize I it by the time I realized it I was actually off the track right and I mean it it I just never got out of that funk cuz you were beating yourself up for that partly beating myself up for it but then partly not wanting to lock up again because now you have a flat spot on the tire so now you're more susceptible to a lockup so now I had to pull my braking further back so now every session I'm comparing my Telemetry of this day to my Telemetry the last time I was on the track and my coach is like look dude you are breaking 50 ft too early yeah and it's costing you literally 8/10 of a second on this lap yeah and I'm like okay I'll go out there and I'll break 50 feet later which is where I used to break yeah and I get there and I'm like nope you're going to break a little earlier and a little lighter because you don't want to lock up again and it's like that's just one example of how like the psychology of it just destroyed me and then and then what happened was like now I'm second guessing myself here second guessing myself there spin the car here spin the car there and you you can it gives me an enormous appreciation for how awful this sport is it's a very lonely sport it's kind of similar to tennis yeah or golf or Bo yeah you know I do want you to start riding motorcycles because the interesting thing about the motorcycle is it really can only go through one way like you can't go slower through because now you can't hang off the bike as much like there's all these things that are kind of built into they have to happen the same way so even if you had a moment on a previous lap you can't enter slower cuz then you can't lean as much cuz you don't have enough centrifugal force pulling you out so it's almost like you don't really have the option if that makes any sense like in a car you could St through a turn but on the bike the way it works right is it has to be going through at a certain speed so you can be off it as much as you need to be and all these things otherwise you're just kind of driving it riding it straight up and down yeah I thought about that a lot after we got back from cot I talked to my wife about it I even sent her a picture of the bike that you want me to get and uh it's really funny she didn't even entertain it her only response was shut it oh like no way yeah like just like this is so dumb we're not even going to talk about it cuz you're you're so stupid that you would even think to add another dumb hobby to your life Fair yeah yeah yeah

[02:05:15] I'm way I don't even think she was opposing it from the standpoint of danger it's just you got too much [ __ ] going on you got a you don't yeah like you have too many things that you do and waste time and money on why would you add another one cuz it exists I have to do everything no but then I thought about it I was like well you know in five years I will have a lot more free time in 10 years the kids will all be gone like but then I was like oh but you know will I be too old to do it and and there are some old dudes out there I'm kind of encouraged I'll see some yeah but they probably started younger right that's for sure yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but it is uh it is quite special I you know the the best example I have of it is I was at lagona and I was there for three days and um the third day they were mixing cars and bikes we were sharing the track with some driving Club literally at the same time or trading off sessions trading sessions and so and I had driven my

[02:06:16] AMG um E63 station wagon up there for the track days so I was on the track for two full days on motorcycles and then half the day the third day and I talked to the the club guy I was like can I go out in a session in my car he's like yeah of course so I go out and I'm in the E63 that's a great [ __ ] car that's not a boring car to drive on the track it's 600 horsepower and you know dual clutch trans it's awesome and I did three laps and I was like this is so boring I can't even believe it and the acceleration is so weak up the hill and the breaking down the hill is so laborious cuz the car weighs so much and I was like never again will I mix those two days I can go do a track day in the car if I start there and it's fun but the comparison between the two is shocking are you going to come drifting again before Cota this year oh I would love that yeah we had a lot of fun should bring Danny oh yeah yeah I brought Seb two years ago yeah and it was incredible so as you you recall did he do almost as good as me you you did great but even even Josh

[02:07:33] Robinson who leads the the the drift academ professionally yeah he's a professional formula Drifter yeah and he runs this awesome school that people should all sign up for called the Texas drift academy by the way it's the main reason I still have YouTube ads on my YouTube like why I haven't subscribed to

[02:07:50] YouTube to eliminate ads is I'm holding out hope that I will see another ad as transformative in my life as that one oh cuz that was just years ago I'm watching car videos on YouTube and an ad comes up for the Texas drift Academy I watch the ad I go to the site I sign up for a class I meet Josh the rest is history yeah so now I'm a drift a holic yes and so sure enough we I go out with Seb and so so the Holy Grail of drifting is doing tandems right where one the one guy's drifting in front and the other guy behind him is doing everything and you know they're two feet off each other yeah and you know it might take a year to get to the point where you can do a lead follow tandem yeah Seb was doing it within three hours lead and follow yeah yeah and it was really funny at one point I I wasn't doing my lead follows I was out there doing my thing which is pretty cool like

[02:08:50] I'm doing the doing all my and then Seb comes out with me and he's like hey let me let me sit in passenger while you go and haul ass so I'm out there doing this and then the the funniest thing he said he goes is it okay if I give you a pointer yeah and I'm like dude are you kidding me yeah yeah it's okay if you give me point my ego can handle receiving advice from a four-time F1 world champion I can handle three times I don't know but four yeah right and he's like um you know lay off the throttle a little bit more here and just do this and then counter steer a little bit more this way and I'm like the fact that he could figure this out yeah in three hours and it's taken me three years and I'm still not that good it it you also realize like there are people that are just so much better it's it's actually part of why I enjoy my hobbies is I actually really enjoy being so lousy at these things you do I need to it's frustrating it's frustrating but it's you're constantly in a state of like the the learning curve is still so steep for me yeah I I suffer greatly on the bike I recognize it like the bike is one thing and I'm good and then I am in no way ever approaching the AMA guys or the super bike guys or it's just it's it's it's it's staggering and I have no illusion I could do it my ego in the car is I could do whatever they can can do if I had the time and had been encouraged to do it the car thing I have in my mind that I could have been capable of anything I don't and I and I don't know maybe it's possible when I was younger it's different but I have too much built-in self-preservation to ever be a good driver yeah I'm I am I am destined to be mediocre for the rest of my life I think that's the healthiest version yeah perhaps I just think like but when I'm with manual it literally goes through my mind where I like I can almost not accept that of course he would be much faster if we got in that one car I go but why we have hands and feet and I understand it so what's what what could it be the motorcycle I am fear limited yeah I am not going to go through some of these turns at 135 with my elbow dragging I just don't

[02:11:15] I don't have the the gumption to do that but in the car I have that ious sense of safety like I really I don't ever consider I can get hurt in the car so it's like I don't have a fear thing so then what would it be yeah but don't you have some concern of like just shunting and trashing the car even if you even if you're going to be okay yeah I'm real big on so yeah hit and run this movie I directed I did all the driving and that and yeah the stunt guys threw away like four cars and the pride I had was like yeah I didn't throw any cars away and I never threw away the Lamborghini I yeah I have a big thing that I I I my my story about myself is I don't crash um and the notion of having to pay for a race car I was in is is a real bummer but I don't even consider it's a possibility I have some delusion in that department I I have a hard time rapping like I even had the Arrogant fantasy I'm gonna try to do a TV show with Danny and

[02:12:20] I where we go drive everything so you snowmobiles motorcycles dirt bikes everything that you put gas in he and I are going to race and in my delusional mind I'm like I'm G to get I'm GNA get them on six of these tonight thing there's no way you can ride a snow meal as good as I do uh you know I I have have you you've ridden bikes with him though dirt bikes yeah yeah he's slightly better on a dirt bike than I am but I'm not good on a dirt bike I recognize that so where my fear kicks in is like being 30 feet in the air with already having several shoulder surgeries I'm out I like to trail ride I like to ride little tracks but I don't have that I know my limits but snowmobile razors let's go Ricardo I I feel like

[02:13:10] I'm just going to stick with cars you're gonna have you ever ridden a snowmobile never even though I group in Canada oh so fun so fun really good one for husband and wife the learning curve is very quick yeah my wife has no interest in speed period no she won't get in a car with me we were laughing a lot when we were at the track this weekend yeah about the bummer of your wife not appreciating how Val Valiant skilled you are behind the wheel that when she watches a drifting video she's not like oh my God Peter how are you doing this I know I bring all these I bring all these videos home of me driving and drifting and all she says is but why like why would you wreck all those tires yes it makes no sense that seems wasteful yeah and she's right yeah well what else can I tell you about Senna well let me just tell you something really quick hold on okay so this is what happened my wife was perusing Etsy does Jill go on Etsy oh yeah as does this one she loves Etsy

[02:14:17] I've never gone and looked around myself oh I could spend hours on Etsy okay so she found these for me and I felt like I didn't deserve them and I insisted that she get them so that I could give them to

[02:14:38] you I'm hoping it's the only piece of memorabilia you don't have

[02:15:01] is that an mp44 yeah these are sen cups wow that's beautiful pretty cool right so cool and then I bought this for myself but my arms are too Apel and long so I've decided to pass it on to you wow look at this glorious item look at that someone met made this this was on this you got this on Etsy as well yeah yeah yeah yeah how great is that that is

[02:15:36] I put it on very bummed that the arms only came up to Midway down my wrists I mean are you sure you don't just want to do sleeve roll up I'm positive I want you to have that thank you and the glasses much and that was a third of my suitcase I brought and now I have room to amass something else that's cool though well you know what's really interesting cuz I'm a real stickler for detail sure this is the season that he died really that's the helmet from this season he died he always ran the Brazil colors right there's no Devi he always ran this color um going back to his carting days okay um but this is the Renault engine the

[02:16:19] Rothman sponsor which which was only you so he only would have had this helmet for three races three races yeah wow it's a Beau you got a couple more bits of senna does how does Jill respond to the amount of stuff that's in this house I would want anyone who's listening to get to walk through your house at some point you can't go six feet without something significant from the Sena collection yeah I think um look

[02:16:49] I I I I've won the Lottery obviously in terms of just you've met my wife and and you understand like incredibly supportive and understanding yeah look I thought it was going to be a bridge too far when I wanted to name our son after him yeah that's a big swing that is that was a swing yeah yeah um how did you did you like um set the perfect evening did you try to like whine her and dine her before you broached it or did you throw it out randomly believe it or not I had a harder time with our previous son whose middle name is Fineman okay that was a harder cell I understand but for that one I had a subtle Ploy which was I started with a name that I knew she would never go for but that was plausible that I would like it okay which was

[02:17:38] Secretariat because I love Secretariat as well and so I was like look the greatest horse of all time right like no horse will even if another horse wins the Triple Crown at that point American Pharaoh hadn't yet won the Triple Crown again I was like no horse will ever win by that margin again okay the you know to be able to negative split 54 miles in the Kentucky Derby to win the Belmont by 30 lengths like literally F it's just I could go on for we could do a whole podcast on secretary okay I hope we do so so I was like it's a really fitting name yeah and she was like let me see how clear I can make this for you there is no [ __ ] way we are naming our kid after a horse a horse so then when I pivoted to

[02:18:32] Fineman she was like okay okay I can live with that as a middle name as a middle name yeah and um and also my brother had just named uh one of his sons after Pat Tillman oh okay which I thought was awesome too great book right read the crackower book yeah of course so so I think she was just probably a little beat down between the AA Brothers yeah by the time our youngest was was born and also by that point she had become aware of like all the stuff we talked about right like she you know she you know at that point not only had she seen the documentary but there are a whole bunch of other really cool things my wife loved the documentary and doesn't care about racing yeah it's a very good documentary it's not a I mean would encourage anybody who's gotten who's still listening there's possible there's nobody listening into anymore these things happen but if anybody is still listening and they haven't seen the documentary it's a no-brainer that you would go and see it now yeah he'll

[02:19:30] Falls very head over heels in love with Senna and you don't have to be a racing fan it's not a racing story it was nominated for best documentary I think for the Academy Award so um so yeah it turned out to not be that hard to sell her biggest concern was will people know how to pronounce his name well that would be a concern of mine because I every time I say eron I'm nervous as I'm saying it that I'm not going to get it right I I struggle with it how do you say it well it's funny we mostly call him Airy right because that's just easier but it is Aeron Aeron Aeron yeah forget it I can't do that she has a very legitimate concern and we're very very lucky that he his you know we have had two Brazilian nannies in the entire time that he's been alive oh so they have a shine to like they they just had immediate affection for this like little kid named after the deity yes well we named I pitched Lincoln for our first daughter after my Lincoln Continental which is like my most oh so it's not an

[02:20:36] AB Lincoln no it's not although very worthy of naming someone or Lincoln Nebraska or whatever there's uh there's some options but I have a relationship with this 67 Lincoln Continental which is it's just the most profound of any vehicle I have I've had it forever I've done everything to it I made a movie about it it's just very important this car and we thought for no real reason that she was pregnant with a boy we were both certain of it I don't know if you guys have ever you know proclaimed this without any reason but we were like yeah it's a boy Lincoln no problem it's going to be Lincoln and I pitched let's do

[02:21:17] Lincoln Bell Shepard they might lose Shephard but they'll always have Bell that was my kind of horse trading and we were at an ultrasound appointment and the technician said well it's a girl and we were both like no that's not possible and a very long time went by without either of us saying anything and the the technician said is that unex is that okay and we're like no fine we'll be happy to have whatever and then uh after that it was like dealing with the adjustment of okay it's going to be a girl and then I said and then the name I don't know about the name and then I will say to Kristen's credit she's like Lincoln's an even cooler name for a girl and I was like oh you're right so then once we named

[02:22:10] Lincoln Lincoln my friend who you just met on Sunday Steve dcastro who's a stunt coordinator and a stunt man when um Kristen got pregnant a second time he jokingly sent a text you named the first girl Lincoln what are you going to name the second girl uh Navy SEAL Delta Force Airborne you know making all these jokes and I'm reading this to Kristen and then

[02:22:33] I go hm Delta's a pretty badass name for a girl as well and she was like I hate to say it but he's right so then Delta came out of a joke but also Bell I was smart enough to give them her last name in the middle for a little added you know I have a friend who's got a Lincoln a Kennedy a Reagan and one other president as the first the political divide too I like that just just going for great presidents not not not not wed to not you read the grant biography by Chance the chernau one amazing couldn't recommend it more my sort of view as presidential

[02:23:15] Obsession kind of mostly is like well LBJ is a huge Fascination have you read those Carol books yeah those are great especially living here it's really Rel having LBJ Library and and all that stuff yeah and even what he did to the Hill Country and you know all the stuff it's fascinating but it ends there at LBJ no

[02:23:38] I mean it's actually it's it's a lot of LBJ and forward like kind of LBJ Nixon um I mean it's it's I the last 150 years I suppose yeah yeah Grant's super fascinating because he's an abject failure at everything in life except for war and his presidency terrible with money insolvent duped many times but he had a genius and it was just so specific and it was unrivaled like it's uh such a good book and it's like um maybe encourages you to figure out I I'm I think you and I are similar and like I want to be kind of good at everything

[02:24:20] I my appetite to want to do stuff is just so enormous that I'd rather be like pretty good at or even moderate at a bunch of things so the the Notions of like Specialists really interest me because I'm just so not that way at all I want to be able to like talk to anyone I meet and hopefully have a hobby in common or something I'm not trying to get super esoteric with like your brain surgeon friend that's over and I think there's some drawback to that but I am fascinated by people who just to Max I doubt Max can balance a checkbook or go grocery shopping he's probably not a great boyfriend but boy he can do that thing yeah speaking of Max I think you know a lot of drivers don't like to spend that much time in simulators like when they're away from the car they're away from the car and that's not Max like literally after he wins a race in the highest division of the highest sport When anybody else would be out partying he's on a Sim race competing against the Sim Racers around the world yes within hours yeah and it'll spend three hours yeah sitting there doing it yeah that's and that's just another aspect to it it's like I don't think anyone on that grid spends as much time thinking about racing I do I you know it's funny you know that we've talked about it I really would love to know what Max thinks of senna and how much he is historically aware now that Max's own Legend grows and look by the end of this year he's going to be a four-time world champion y he you know and even though he's only 26 years old and he could easily race another 10 years and eclipse every record ever yeah if he chooses to um you know I wonder where he sees his place and I wonder if he has an appreciation for for the you know the the legends of the sport yeah that's an interesting question because he regularly threatens to quit all the time that's the other really contradictory thing about him is he's really halfhazard about threatening to quit he doesn't like sprint races he hates those well I think you know Max quitting doesn't mean he wouldn't drive it just means he wouldn't drive F1 yeah it's interesting Max would drive Max and

[02:26:43] Alonzo are probably the two people who I think will drive forever I do a question of where yeah yeah Alonzo for sure like this is a man that's just and I makes me think one more time of Valentino Rossi in his last season racing and he was so he was like Alonzo he was maybe 44 still racing against these 19-year-old kids and he was going through a turn and a guy had crashed just before the turn and came off the bike and the bike was just flying unmanned and then another guy crashed and so two bikes he's in the turn already committed there's nothing he can really do one bike goes right in front of him and one goes behind him at the same time it's like the most impossible moment in all of racing motorcycles he's a foot away from the one in in front of him and a foot in front of the one behind him both of them flying would have T-boned him would have killed him and everyone in the real world normal people are like what's he doing out there he's already 44 not competitive yes nine championships he's done everything why would he be in that situation and his response was yeah that was close but uh you know if I'm not there I'm doing something else equally dangerous I'm somewhere going to be it won't stop so to him it's like yeah would have been in a rally car or would have been there it doesn't matter that's what he does it's it didn't even everyone else was like oh my God he just barely avoided death and for him it was nothing he's like yeah this what I'll be doing until I'm dead

[02:28:16] I'll be in some situation that scares the [ __ ] out of me I can't help but when wonder and I know that I'm far from alone in this in wondering what would have been had Senna not died that day um I think most observers believe he would have driven another four years until the next regulation change and at the end of

[02:28:37] Williams dominance so Williams ended up being the most dominant car the year he died so despite the fact that it was an impossible to drive vehicle for those first three races the the Brilliance of that team did figure it out and his teammate Damon hill almost won the championship that year in fact he was one point behind Schumacher going into the final race of the Year wow

[02:29:03] Schumacher crashed him out of the race crashed himself out of the race and in doing so Damon actually looked like he was going to win the race but it broke his suspension Rod so Damon ended up finish that finishing that year one point behind Schumacher um so he would have definitely won he would have absolutely won Schumacher won the next year it was close Damon Hill won the next year in the Williams and jacqu VN won the next year in the Williams so I don't think it's a an enormous stretch to say look Senna probably would have won four consecutive championships in '94 95 96 and 97 putting him at seven putting him at seven or eight if you include the one that was stolen and um you know there's talk that he always had a soft spot for Ferrari like every driver and

[02:29:51] Ferrari he have been not that but you know I could haveen him retiring but what a lot of people question is given his absolute love for Brazil would he have gone into politics right and would it have made a difference in the presence of Brazil right like this is a guy that was so loved like you you know there's no example we can point to of someone who turns to politics with that much of the support of a Nation now you know

[02:30:20] Pacquiao um I don't think Pacquiao was E I don't I don't know if Pacquiao was even as loved by the Philippines as as Sena was by Brazil really well because again I don't think people took Pacquiao as seriously right I don't think people took him I loved him yes incredible fighter yeah what a warrior but I don't know that people took him I don't know that the people of the Philippines took him as seriously as people would have taken Senna and and who knows like there's no reason to believe Senna would have been a good leader in that regard like we have no idea but it's an it's just kind of an interesting game of like what if um how involved would he have still been in Formula 1 after would he would he have been an ambassador of the sport like you know you think like I've seen these sort of you know AI generated images of what Senna would look like today and um you know I I just to me going back to your original thought of like uh you know to have somebody who dies in their Prime doing what they love okay it's not a tragedy in some ways it is in some ways but I always wonder what the counterfactual is like what what what what other what other spell would have been cast by this genius yeah yeah as I as I said I think in like kind of prepping for this and and stumbling upon the the pole record I think it did elevate my assessment of him I always thought he was definitely one of the greats but again you get into all this hypothetical it's like yeah I don't know what the next four years is you play the car lottery I don't I don't know what you know but the point you're making is valid which is the team was great and he was on the team but I do think that pole thing for me really pushed it in a direction of like okay I can I can concede that he was likely whatever that tie is yeah for you he's he's clearly above yeah and and I and I I will concede that I I think it's very difficult ult to compare drivers across eras you know if you ask Senna who was the greatest um well he would have said it was Fullerton right was the greatest guy he ever raced against in cing and if you asked him in F1 he would have said fangio really right that was his hero um and but don't we have to we have to give schoemer a lot of credit the fact that he goes to Ferrari which is a shitty team and just sticks it out and develops that car and then when I mean it's hard to under undercount him yeah I I

[02:32:51] I I I would say look if you if you put a gun to my head and said who's second best I'd put schacher yeah but and that could be Max right like give give Max another five years and maybe it's going to be Max number two and you never know maybe one day I will even say Max is the greatest of all time yeah it well the the fun thing ahead and I don't want it for him

[02:33:17] CU I want him to just be the most winningest champion of all time but Red Bull will have an evolution with the rule changes and I'm actually most excited about seeing Max driving the second fast car once again because I think that was the most exciting thing ever yeah that he just had to out Drive Lewis and did consistently yeah well my friend thanks for having me to uh to learn more about Senna he's certainly a uh yeah it's bigger than a he's got a some kind of a rhythm to him that's really intriguing have you been to Brazil there's an Artistry to him that schacher doesn't have there's some kind of artistry for sure to Senna that captivates the emotions a lot more yeah absolutely have you have you ever been to to sa Paulo no I have not been to anywhere in South America that's where they keep the cocaine so I've stayed away they F to table cocaine there guys are stomping on it in the background and then it comes right in the door I want to go I want to go desperately you should you should you got to come to interlagos with us one year we every single year it is it is uh it is the most incredible experience and you you know we also usually go to the cemetery every year as well okay he's buried there he is buried in sou Paulo um in a beautiful Cemetery in the middle of the city you know sa Paulo is so big it's hard to believe like we don't have a reference for that like there's no it's not like La Chicago New York big geographically or just pop okay both okay like was there like 25 million people there or something yeah probably close to 30 million people and when you're in this middle like our we always stay at a hotel in the middle of the city yeah and when you're in that hotel and you're in the like the top floor which is where the gym is and you're looking out for 360° you cannot see the end of a city oh wow it's so big wow and yet you know you see the highway named after him you see the murals of him on the wall you just you know it's and then here's the most amazing thing is when you go to where he's buried it's the most unassuming thing it's just a it's just a plaque in the ground and are there always people there um usually not every time I've gone now there's always hats there flowers pictures you can it's a clearly a place where where fans go yeah but it's very quiet um every time

[02:35:50] I've gone I've been alone or with the you know just with the people I've gone with with my I've taken my daughter a couple of times and um but it's like it's really I mean I know that sounds so weird for like it sounds like I'm too obsessed but it is the closest thing I would have to religious experience how do you where do you place all his religious stuff I mean you can't find audio of him not talking about God at some point I I

[02:36:21] I think it's um I think it's I I think he drew strength from it right like he really believed in his god-given right to win every race yeah um but but there's a duality to it like on one on one hand it presents his humility which is he's like regularly thanking God for this gift so that's humble but then for me as the cynical atheist I'm like but you're also saying God cares more about you than anyone else so there is also like a deep arrogance to it that like God has picked me to win a race so it's it's a push for me yeah that's interesting I have a hard time figuring out what I feel about that like feel if you believe in God and you feel chosen by God I don't know is that is that super humble I don't know I don't know I can't relate I definitely don't feel chosen um but you know speaking of listening to to to things that he talked about I it's amazing how often you hear interviews of him and you hear him talk about mortality like he wasn't he did not have a view of immortality he always knew that he was on the limit and his time could come and he spoke very modestly about that yeah well and the mom was super vocal as well right almost all the interviews she's in she's saying she hopes he quits after he wins or he said he was going to quit if he becomes the world champion but I don't believe him like that's that's a bit of a bummer too it seems like she was very fearful of that and that was the outcome yeah there's a there's you know the at his at his gravestone um one of the one of the things it says there is it's It quotes a verse from the Bible that he uh had called his mom the morning he died he hadn't had a good night's sleep he was feeling again he did not really want to be he was not in a good head space to race that day but he called his mom and shared with her something he was reading in the Bible about God looking after him and protecting him and that that sort of verse is there on his Stone um so yeah it's um I I don't know like I think it would be hard to make a movie that would live up to his life um I know that Netflix is actually working on um like a a docu drama he wasn't married when he died was he no he had a girlf love women right in the dock he's with another he like blonde and he likes meeting people on talk shows he seemed to date many of the people that interviewed him on a talk show yeah at the time he died he was dating a very very famous Brazilian model he had a

[02:39:04] Kennedy thing too like him out on the boats and everything the family's kind of Rich there was also some kind of Camelot Vibes to the family yeah yeah 40 years 30 years 30 years AG years which is another thing by the way I guess you don't remember the day he died because you weren't a fan you didn't follow the sport the very first

[02:39:24] Formula 1 driver I became aware of by name was shoe marer and mostly because Valentino Rossy wrote in the two-seater with him and said it was mind-blowing I was like oh wow so I think another example of feeling old is I still remember the day he died very clearly yeah like I remember I remember every detail of the room like I remember hearing it on the radio I I mean I remember what my radio looked like I remember everything and that's a little odd I'm sure anybody can relate to an experience like that where you think how did 30 years go by so fast oh yeah and then I think well in 20 years when it's the 50th Anniversary that's not that's not that far from now no two seconds yeah unfortunately we'll be sitting right back here yes we'll look a little different well hopefully not with your help they still look jacked and ready to race um but this has been a blast I um I think it's funny uh for people like now that you and I are buddies and people go like what's what's the thing is he your doctor I'm like oh no no I interviewed him cars didn't come up once we step outside and all sudden he's like what cars you got okay I got this and I'm like oh yeah it's all Motorsports it's like the greatest connector isn't it yeah yeah it's been fun well thanks for making time to yeah such a pleasure and thank you for these awesome gifts I mean Jill can complain but yeah I thought there's room for a little she has yet to complain to your qu to answer your question I I still have leash what a woman I know she's also gorgeous you really now you really yeah knocked it out of the park yeah we both got lucky it's it's it's it's it's you're fortunate when you have a wife that can tolerate your obsessions yeah anytime I watch videos of you talking about the questions you ask her I'm like okay yeah we got a very similar thing happen at home all right brother thanks for having me thank you [Music]
