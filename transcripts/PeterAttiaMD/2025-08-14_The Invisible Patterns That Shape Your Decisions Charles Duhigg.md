This clip is from episode 360 ‒ How to change your habits: why they form and how to build or break them

In this clip, they discuss:

- Mental Habits Are Often Invisible: Most habits that shape our behavior aren’t physical—they’re mental, automatic patterns we barely notice
- Hardwired Emotional Responses: Mental habits can dictate responses like getting angry when cut off in traffic, even if it doesn’t help
- Changing Habits Starts with Awareness: To shift a habit, identify the cue that triggers it, then create a different, intentional response
- Contemplation Is a Mental Muscle: The most successful people create routines that spark deeper thinking and insight
- Without Reflection, We Default to Reactivity: Mental habits form the foundation of how we react and live, making awareness essential for growth

## Transcript

[00:00:00] And we've talked a lot about behavioral habits today, but most of the habits that exist in our lives are mental habits. >> They're habits that we don't even recognize as habits because they're happening inside our brain. And they are incredibly powerful. These mental habits make me believe that when someone cuts me off in traffic, a perfectly appropriate response is to get angry, which does not benefit me, does not change the situation. I know that I should be zen about it, but it compels me to behave a certain way. >> So, let's say more about that. Let's say more about the the the mental habits.

[00:00:41] And I read something the other day, which didn't surprise me one bit because anybody who has meditated will know this. Um, we have an average of, I believe, 47 thoughts per minute. Wow. Yeah, that's right. you're almost one per second, right? >> And again, if you if you don't meditate or you haven't spent some time doing mindfulness meditation, you would think that's impossible. >> But if you've ever done the exercise of sitting there focusing on your breath, watching every single time you are distracted by a thought, you'll be like, "Yep, I can believe it's 47 times a minute." So, >> yeah, that actually sounds small to me based on my meditation. So we we've got this uh crazy thing that is just a thoughtgenerating machine that we can't control. >> Yeah. >> Um but thoughts are not thinking. So what translates us from thoughts to thinking where how do we form >> better habits or reformat uh maladaptive habits around that? >> You give a great example by the way of the the reaction to >> getting cut off like an anger reaction. >> That's absolutely right. So, so the way that we can the way that we can influence our mental habits is that we have to deliberately choose to figure out what the cue is and then we have to give ourselves a reward afterwards. They they operate by the same principle as as behavioral habits or physical habits.

[00:02:03] But it's a little bit more tricky, right? >> So oftentimes, let's take um let's take innovation. Innovation is one of the a mental habit that's studied. Why do some people >> manage to innovate on demand >> much better than others? Right? We can all be innovative, but some people they need the muse to strike. It takes them years. And other people, you walk in and you say, "Hey, look, I need 30 great ideas by tonight." And they can sit down and they knock them out. So, what's happening there? When researchers have looked at the lives of serial innovators, what they found is that the most important part of that is that oftent times the the people who are really good at it have built up what's known as a contemplative routine to spur that innovation. Now these contemplative routines can be something like every week I sit down and I reflect on all the good ideas I had last week just for 30 minutes and I try and think of good ideas for next for next week. Or the contemplative routine can be whenever anyone asks me to come up with 30 ideas the first thing I do is I go take a walk and I just think about it in my head. I'm not writing anything down.

[00:03:12] I'm not committing myself to anything. I'm just letting it percolate a little bit. I have a routine that I know works for me >> to spark contemplation. Because when you think about it, when it comes to mental routines and when it comes mental habits and when it comes to success, the most successful people throughout history are the people who can get themselves to think most deeply, right?

[00:03:35] Making the right choice is so much more powerful than executing really well on the wrong choice. So the question is, particularly in a fast-paced world like today, how do we get ourselves to think more deeply? This is the killer app >> for our brain. And the way that we get ourselves to think more deeply is to build these contemplative routines that we automatically fall into because those contemplative routines push us to think more deeply. And I can give you an example of this if if you'd like, of course, which is um and again we describe this in um in or I describe this in smarter, faster, better. Um there was a a plane Quantis flight 32 was a plane, an Airbus A380 that took off from Singapore to Sydney um in the early 2000s and it it perfect takeoff.

[00:04:25] The captain was a great captain. About 10 minutes into the flight, um, one of the fan blades in one of the jet engines detaches and it punches this enormous hole in the wing. It also hits another fan blade and that fan blade explodes and it was like the shrapnel from a bomb going off inside the the the plane wing.

[00:04:43] So within about 12 seconds, there's 14 major systems that are needed to keep a plane aloft. Within about 12 seconds, 12 of those systems had gone offline. No hydraulics, no fuel, no measurements on anything. So the captain, a guy named Richard Drebney, he has to figure out how to land this plane safely. This is the worst mid-air mechanical disaster in modern aviation.

[00:05:07] So what does he do at that moment? What he does at that moment is there's all these alarms going off inside the cockpit. There's all these red flashing things on his on his board. The computer is telling him you have to do these 10 things and as soon as you do those 10 things, you have to do five more things. you have to do 13 more things. What he does is he takes his hands off the controls for a second. He closes his eyes and he says to himself,

[00:05:31] I'm telling myself a story about the plane that I'm flying. And the story in my head is the Airbus A380. And it's really complicated because I have to think about fuel lines. I have to think about hydraulics. I have to think about brakes. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to change the story inside my head. I'm going to change the mental model that I'm using on where to focus and I'm going to pretend I'm flying a

[00:05:53] Cessna. Now, a Cessna is the plane that he learned to fly on. It's the plane he feels most comfortable in. And he actually sort of announces this to air traffic control and to his other pilots. And they freak out cuz they're like, "Why is this guy talking about flying a Cessna? He's in an Airbus A380."

[00:06:09] But that moment of contemplation allowed him to access that muscle memory, those habits of flying and he lands the plane safely. They touch down. All 469 passengers get off about half an hour later. There's not one injury on board. Now, they've tried to recreate this landing again and again in simulators.

[00:06:30] Almost every single time it crashes. So, what did Richard Drebney do differently? Why was he able to land that plane? And I've asked him and what he'll tell you is he'll tell you he actually doesn't know or remember exactly what he did in the moment. But by changing that mental model in his head, by engaging in this contemplative routine, which felt supernatural to him to say, "I need to be in charge here. I need to stop reacting. I'm going to choose to pretend

[00:06:54] I'm flying a Cessna." That unlocked all of these learned habits of safe flying that allowed him to land that plane. I'm Peter Aia.
