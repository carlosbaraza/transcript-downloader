This clip is from episode 355 – Skincare strategies, the science of facial aging, and cosmetic-intervention guidance | Tanuj Nakra, M.D. & Suzan Obagi, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- The 4 Types of Facial Aging – Skin, volume, gravity, and bone structure all play roles in how the face changes over time
- First Impressions Start Instantly – Aesthetic surgeons often assess facial anatomy, symmetry, and movement within seconds of meeting a patient
- Understanding Patient Psychology – Many patients don’t know how to articulate what they want, so doctors must interpret both words and emotions
-  Red Flags Before Treatment – Surgeons often screen for emotional distress or recent trauma before deciding if it's the right time for intervention
- The 5 R’s of Rejuvenation – Relax overactive muscles, refill lost volume, resurface the skin, redrape sagging areas, and renew consistently
- Home Care Matters More Than You Think – Strategic skincare at home reduces the need for more aggressive in-office treatments

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Okay. Um, all right. Let us move now into the really confusing realm of I show up in your office. I can't tell you what's wrong, but I show you a picture of me 10 years ago and I say, I want to look like that. And I should have brought a picture in of me so you could actually see it. But like I you've already described it without having seen the picture, right?

[00:00:29] I don't have bags under my eyes. My skin just looks better. Everything just looks better. Part of it is color. I I will admit 10 years ago there was no gray anywhere in my beard. We're not going to fix that problem. That's fine. But but aside from that, um like Oh, and the wrinkles in my forehead. Like I notice in pictures of me in the past, I had some wrinkles. Now it looks like I have a wrinkle farm, right? So, so go again, go over the changes, assuming I had that photo. How would you describe them pathologically? Or maybe that's too strong a word, but you know what I mean.

[00:01:07] So, I think um there are three basic changes that happen to every single person with aging. And we've touched on this a little bit and and we'll dive deeper now. So, there are skin changes, uh there are volume changes, there are gravitational changes. Um and and maybe we should throw in the fourth which is you know bone structural foundational changes. And so those happen to everybody. Um when we see patients in our clinics who are presenting the way you've just suggested we will spend extra time analyzing the individual nuances of skin volume, bony ligamentous anatomy, gravitational changes that are specific to your face.

[00:01:47] Um and then also we'll just rely on just general knowledge that we have about what types of aging changes we see at this point. And um it's a very um complex process. I tried to analyze this a little bit before walking into this podcast today. Like what am I actually thinking about when I'm starting to communicate with a patient? As soon as I see the patient while I'm, you know, making some nicities and saying hello and get to know them, I'm already analyzing. I'm already looking at their skin. I'm looking at the bone structure.

[00:02:19] I'm analyzing the facial proportion. I'm looking at areas where there's volume loss. It's obvious. I'm looking at the dynamic movement of the forehead and the face. I'm analyzing how much um heaviness is on the eyes that might be driving frontalis muscle tone that's causing forehead wrinkles. I'll be I'll be looking for facial asymmetries. So, a lot of the a lot of the physical exam that we do in our offices happens in the first 15 seconds because we're just this is what we do and it just happens quickly in in our mind. It's that big moment. It's that blink moment. You look at someone, you're like, I know what I'm going to do on them. Yes. Yes. The urologist doesn't have this advantage that he can't, you know, examine the prostate and the scrotal tissue during that first 15 seconds. Very good point.

[00:03:05] Yes. So, so we do that um when we walk into the room, that analysis already happens. And then because I've already got that sort of snapshot anatomic analysis already in my mind, then the next step that I'm doing is and I'd love to hear what your process is, Susan, but the next step is I'm now going into their mind and trying to understand their psychology and what their motivation is. And the problem that we have is that the patient doesn't know what words to say. Yeah. They're like me for them to communicate what's actually driving them. Y and so I have to pull that out of them. This was a little bit of detective work. Um a little bit of background. Um my parents are both psychiatrists. I actually went to medical school thinking I was going to go into psychiatry and then I rapidly pivoted into surgery and ended up where

[00:03:57] I am. But that initial love and appreciation for what's happening inside the neuronal processing and the subconscious is something that we actually work with every single day in our offices. And so um so the next step that happens in a consultation is I would say hopefully I I mean to me that's a that's a great thing but I I I don't know and not to be a downer I I don't know that that's true of every you know person who is who is dealing with with aesthetics. I would guess there are a lot of people who are just kind of doing this in a coin operated way. Yeah.

[00:04:33] Unfortunately, there is a there there can be a tendency to take a cookie cutter approach where you recognize this and here's a it's a knee-jerk reaction. There's wrinkles on the forehead, inject Botox. You know, there's gels, do a facelift. That's not the way that we should be practicing aesthetics. Every single individual has a totally customized situation anatomically, physiologically, and psychologically.

[00:04:58] And so our job is to try and figure that out when the patient doesn't have the ability to express. So sometimes this almost overlaps into pediatrics, which is something that I know you've got some history with in in in surgery, but you know, you're trying to do a physical exam and get history from someone who's unable to communicate what they're actually able what they what they want you to figure out. And so we'll I'll start asking questions, you know, did you like the way you looked when you were 20? If they say yes, that means that they actually like their natural facial proportions and they're probably looking more for rejuvenation. But if they say, you know, I always had a heavy eyelid and I never could put makeup on my eye, then I know that they're maybe looking for something that's a more substantial result in that particular area. That's just one example. And then um I'll try to get to know them from a just what do they what kind of what's their occupation? What's their situation at home? Do they have kids? Tell me a little bit about your life. I'm trying to understand their social history to to see if there's any red flags that would stop the process and say, "Okay, this is not the right time to be considering aesthetics. You got to get your mental health in order before we proceed," which is something that I would, you know, very openly tell a patient, you know, at the right time in the consultation. But, but if a woman came in and said, "My husband is leaving me," right? Which is unfortunately probably not an uncommon thing. Um, and and let's make it more extreme, right? A 50-year-old woman comes in and says, "My husband of 25 years is leaving me for a 20 year old."

[00:06:34] Understandably, she's in duress and she's probably comparing herself to a 25year-old. Would that be a non-starter in your mind? So, the scenario you described is actually very common. Yeah, I see this kind of situation all the time. And then um and this is why I schedule 45 minutes or an hour for initial consultations because once we start talking about that tears may start flowing because the patient is now in a safe zone talking to a medical professional who's actually listening to them. We were talking about time in a clinic before and so then then we start to fall into the role of a therapist and we're letting them express because I want to see how deep is this trauma. I'm trying to understand, you know, is this something that is now a non-starter or what should we do here? Because there are scenarios where someone is in that kind of scenario situation where um we certainly would not want to make any drastic moves or big changes or shifts.

[00:07:35] But is it appropriate to recognize that this person is you know desiring something that is a reasonable goal but the current emotional state is not appropriate to do the procedure to get there. So maybe we say look let's think we do something irreversible or so we do something reversible. Yes. Exactly.

[00:07:52] Because the fear, sorry to interrupt, but I'm guessing that the fear here is if you say no to her, she's going to find some guy down the block who will do anything. And it's better that you do something small and develop a relationship with her that will ultimately serve her interests, but but you can't give her everything she wants at the moment. Is that a fair assessment? Very well said. I is exactly right. We're trying to build that trust and build that relationship on the front end so that this individual who's trying to get from A to B, we're going to take them there safely. Whether it's, you know, over a couple of months or 10 years, we're going to try to get to that goal. And there may be some obstacles along the way and choices that we have to make, but we'll navigate it together.

[00:08:39] And it's all built on building that relationship on the front end. So the trust exists where I can tell the patient we are not going to do this maneuver right now and then that patient will listen to me because the trust has been built up enough that this individual knows that I have their best interest in mind and we're going to get to that goal eventually. And so so yes, this this scenario that you're describing, the individual might be best served with, okay, look, I think we can get there one day with procedures, but right now I'm going to refer you to a therapist. You have a lot going on in your life right now. Let's do some simple things that we're not going to regret like neurom modulators and fillers and some skin treatments or lasers, things that are low risk.

[00:09:22] They're not going to create any scars or permanent changes and then we can eventually get to that that next step. We're not going to do the facelift next week. Correct. Yes. That that's on hold. Um so so you know the first step is we do this kind of snapshot anatomic dynamic analysis. is not just a an a single image as we're looking at the muscle movement and then the second step is this deep dive into their social situation psychology and then um presuming that everything's kind of moving along smoothly and now we're getting ready to talk about what we're you know what should we do now then I'll spend time educating the patient on their actual anatomy because they've never actually had that information presented to them right so I will put the mirror in front of the patient and I will say Let's go through what I'm seeing with on your exam today together and we'll start at the top and I'll go through every little detail and I'll throw in little caveats like I'm sorry

[00:10:18] I'm not trying to make you feel bad about your features but you're here for me to tell you so I'm going to tell you everything. We're going to talk about your bones. We're going to talk about the wrinkles. We're going to talk about the asymmetry you never noticed which by the way is almost always the case.

[00:10:29] People don't notice their asymmetries. And so we point out these asymmetries to them and then after that kind of you know relatively um you know lengthy discussion about their individual anatomy. Then we'll start to say okay now you initially told me that these are some of the areas that bother you. Here's what we could do to fix your eye region, your cheek, your mouth, your gel, whatever it is. And I'll present typically options that go from minimally invasive to more substantial. And based on how the individual is responding to the conversation, I can usually at this point 20 years into my practice dial in like what is the appropriate scope for this patient. They don't really know whether they want a facelift or not. um maybe I needed to show them maybe I need to explain them the complications where the incisions are so they really understand what that procedure means and then if that seems like it's too much for them we will dial it back and I'll have to tell them look we're not going to be able to get the results of a facelift without a facelift but I don't think you're ready for a facelift so maybe we should start with something smaller and kind of taking baby steps and then just to conclude I I usually will end up finally telling the patient what they showed up to hear which is my opinion and that I won't give them my opinion about what we should do until we've gone through this whole process and I've watched their body language as we've talked about procedures. Sometimes

[00:11:57] I'll suggest something that's minimally invasive and they seem uninterested because it's not enough for them and I'll read that body language and kind of dial in the treatment for what I suggest for them. And so that'll happen at the end of the consultation typically. So, um I know that was a long answer, but that that does I would say describe my typical consultation. How about you,

[00:12:17] Susan? Yeah. Oh, pretty much everything that Tanish said. And I was so glad to hear that you would talk to the patient about their mental state at that time, too, because we do a lot of almost like psycho psychology and therapy with our patients. If they open up to you, then that's an honor to you and you have to take that and you have to help them through that issue. And my I have a psychology background as well. So I was biology and psychology double major in schools and I find that I use it a lot.

[00:12:48] It's so important. But um I approach patients very similarly but I try to put things in terms that they can understand. So I tell them there are the five Rs of rejuvenation and it doesn't mean they need all of it at that point in time but at some point in their life they're going to need one of them and they'll make it through all all five.

[00:13:08] And that is we need to relax overactive muscles. and I'm showing them on their face the movements. I will say we need to refill lost volume, whether it's through fat grafting, which is still one of my favorite procedures to do, or refilling with fillers. And I tell them, we need to resurface the skin because to me, the how the skin looks is absolutely much more important than how tight they are. So patients sometimes come in, they're like, I just want to lift here and they want to lift their lower face and their skin is terribly wrinkled and uh they have hyperpigmentation and sunspots and I'll tell them if I lift you now no one's going to notice that you look better but if I make your skin look better people are going to notice you look better before I even do the surgery so we have relax refill resurface we need to do redraraping so there are going to be times that you can't lift in I'm sorry fill enough you have to lift so they either will lift with devices such as micro needling radio frequency devices or ultrasound devices to tighten the skin or a faceelift of some sort. So those you need to do and then what people don't realize my fifth are is that you have to keep renewing because the aging process continues and the minute they leave your office everything you just did on them looks great and it starts to diminish and that's what we talked about a moment that's what we were just talking about the renewal was the maintenance.

[00:14:33] Absolutely. So you have to keep renewing because otherwise you're going to lose that benefit. And what do I mean by renewing? You definitely maintain your neurom modulators and your fillers, but they have to be strategically placed. You don't need a lot of fillers. You need to keep the skin priming itself and turning over. And so, you can achieve a lot of that at home. And I think people underestimate how much they can do at home with their skinincare regimens and then have to do less in the office. And that's my big emphasis. Do more at home and then let us do in the office a little boost here and there afterwards.

[00:15:06] And so those five Rs make it very easy for these patients to comprehend. And they might not need all that yet, but at some point in their life, they're going to have all those five Rs.
