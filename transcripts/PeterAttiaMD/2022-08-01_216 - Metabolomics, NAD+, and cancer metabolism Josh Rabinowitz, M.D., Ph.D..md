Josh Rabinowitz is a Professor of Chemistry and Integrative Genomics at Princeton University, where his research focuses on developing a quantitative, comprehensive understanding of cellular metabolism through the study of metabolites and their fluxes. In this episode, Josh focuses the discussion on three main topics: metabolomics, NAD (and its precursors), and cancer metabolism. The metabolomics discussion starts with a broad definition of metabolism, metabolites, and fluxomics before diving deep into glucose metabolism, lactate as a fuel, movement of lactate, and the regulation of these substrates. He then gives a detailed explanation of the electron transport chain and Krebs cycle and their implications with respect to both drugs and nutrition while also explaining how NAD is central to the process of energy generation. He then discusses the age-related decline in NAD and what current literature says about efforts to increase NAD through intravenous or oral supplementation with the precursors NMN and NR, including whether doing so provides any advantage to lifespan or healthspan. Finally, Josh ends the conversation talking about cancer metabolism and how one particular intersection between cancer metabolism and immunotherapy might provide a hopeful outlook on the future of cancer treatment.

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia hey josh great to see you again it's been uh i don't know i was trying to think about this the other day as it was about three years ago i think was the last time we saw each other in person at that uh there was some sort of conference in new york um a cancer metabolism conference i think right oh yeah the new york academy of sciences i think yeah yeah it was great um and we somehow wound up at some kind of mediocre bar in brooklyn and it might have been the dorkiest concentration of people talking about autophagy and metabolomics and all sorts of things there was oh yeah yeah that was actually the aacr brooklyn conference that's true um well you know it's really funny just recently i've interviewed a few of our classmates from med school max dean and carl desaroth and i think carl and i were reminiscing about how you me and carl all started our surgical rotation together in the same day and i i it's almost 25 years ago and i remember it like it was yesterday when we were all sitting in the room practicing sewing with our big goofy knots and things like that before we all got divided up into our surgical rotations do you remember that i definitely remember you i really do not remember carl from those days but i certainly remember you practicing a lot while i looked and said oh i guess that's what you're supposed to be doing if you want to become a surgeon the thing i remember most clearly is being in surgery with you and it was like the very end of surgery rotation and uh finally being given the bovie and immediately making a mistake and uh you know then i got the nice lecture you know we're happy to pass you on this rotation as long as you promise never to use you know a knife or bovee again so so um remind me whose lab did you do your phd in i did my phd with hardin mcconnell uh one of the great physical chemists uh together with mark davis the uh immunologist and so tell tell me and tell the listeners a little bit about what project you worked on for your thesis my thesis was about the physical chemistry of t cell activation and so at that point in time people had discovered that different antigens could activate t cells differentially and so i was really interested in how that happened and so i studied the process of antigens turning into peptides that could bind to mhc and then how the kinetics of the interaction between the peptide antigen and the major histocompatibility complex protein mhc and then the interaction of that complex with the t cell receptor determined whether people have productive or failed immune responses with the hopes you could then manipulate those processes to promote better vaccination or disease clearance and also to potentially treat autoimmunity and did you also have an interest at all in cancer because of course this would be one of the hallmarks of how immunotherapy would be effective in eradicating cancer you know uh it shows how bad a prognosticator i am at that point i really felt that like immunological pros just the cancer didn't hold that much promise and so i was really more focused on infectious disease and autoimmunity so shows you what i know it's wonderful to see that the world has turned out to be a lot better than i dreamed it would be on that dimension no but it's such an interesting topic um i had steve rosenberg on the podcast last year and it was just it was a beautiful and fun recap of how the immune system works in general but we were talking about it obviously through the lens of cancer and i think the part that will forever um humble anyone who tries to think about how amazing the system is is that these things have to be you know 9 to 11 amino acids long i mean the peptides have to be just the right size to be presented and then to be recognized and that just doesn't seem to leave a lot of margin for error i mean it is really a tuned system do you have a sense of why evolution ended up with such a narrow fragment of peptides that were recognizable as opposed to a broader range or as opposed to just a range that's different like why wasn't it two to three or 150 to 160 amino acids like is there a chemical reason because you're because of your background in chemistry i feel like you'd be more equipped to offer a teleologic explanation for this yeah i mean i do have an intuitive sense on this that you know our bodies work on the scale of you know billions of immune cells and billions of immune receptors that are made through recombination and that naturally pairs with billions of antigens and so you just think about this number nine and you think about the number of amino acids right they're 20 amino acids so you're talking about 20 to the ninth power of presentable peptide antigens and so these things are all tuned to be on the same scale this kind of scale of billions of billions in that case yeah exactly yeah so if you did it if it was like a three peptide it's it's really a small number actually there's not enough information there to you know selectively respond to a virus you know uh or a bacteria and if it was 25 peptides it's too much there's too much information there there's extra information anyway and this system i think was built to work on minimal or just the right amount of information yeah that's super interesting so at what point during either your phd or the end of medical school where we met up in the in the clinical proportion did you make the decision that you wanted to be a full-time scientist as opposed to a physician scientist you know i applied to do an internship knowing that i really loved research but i guess i decided as i did more and more medicine that medicine is such a noble profession but it involves a lot of doing the same thing right over and over again a lot of following the standard of care even for the most creative physicians and that ultimately like my passion is to come in and try to do something different every day to think differently than people ever have before and so that's what really led me to research i love the patient interaction part of medicine it was the uh doing things right part that was challenging for me sometimes yeah no i i think those of us that that chose the more medical side of things can also speak to the frustration of how creativity can often be stifled in medicine and that's in large part for good reason but i think it comes at a cost as well uh and i'm sure i think i'm sure on this podcast i've told stories about how frustrating that was in surgery at least surgery probably more so than most other disciplines tends to sometimes at least frown upon creativity and novel approaches to problem solving now if i remember correctly before you joined the faculty at princeton where you are now you went into industry straight from medical school is that am i getting my facts right yeah so um i was fortunate the opportunity to work with one of the great early biotech entrepreneurs alex zaferoni and so he and i started a company when i was straight out of medical school that was focused on fast drug delivery so what could you do by being able to deliver medications non-invasively on the time scale of giving an iv push in the hospital and so we did that through inhalation of small molecules kind of building on the concept obviously that if you smoke something like a cigarette you get incredibly rapid access to the systemic circulation and so we built that company alexa pharmaceuticals still exists has one fda approved drug so that was my first job what uh what drug did you drugs were you targeting with that you know our initial focus was migraine unfortunately we never found the drug that had the perfect combination of safety with rapid delivery and efficacy for migraine the drug that ultimately got approved was for acute agitation and so there's a set of hypnotic for acute agitation and i'd say it's really wonderful for the patients who get it they come in the er it's something people don't always know about agitated patients it's like they're agitated they're frustrated but they also want to stop being agitated they don't want to act like that and so they're very eager to most cases to take a puff of something and calm down in a couple minutes it's uh it's wonderful for them so this is kind of an unusual path right i i'm guessing that most people who experience that type of success that you had would want to keep doing it over and over again i mean hence the term serial entrepreneur what made you decide to take this lateral step to go into academics which would have made a lot more sense if you'd done it coming straight out of your phd you know i think i was lucky to get the chance to go straight from that job into a you know faculty position at princeton that's a rare opportunity to have because you didn't do a postdoc in there and unless they considered your industry as sort of a grandfathered postdoc yeah it was a very very weird version of a postdoc and it united me with my wonderful wife and at princeton on the faculty here and turned out well so you show up at princeton and they put you on a tenure track position which means they're giving you the types of resources to now start solving whatever problem you want what was the first problem that you said i want to build a lab around you know one thing that i learned actually doing alexa was about drugs because we studied every medication in the pharmacopoeia for whether it could be a candidate for rapid delivery could you make a benefit by delivering it rapidly and one thing i noticed is that so many of the most important medications work via metabolism and then starting out my lab i realized that there were relatively few labs looking at metabolism broadly compared to other you know really important areas of science like immunology or cancer or neuroscience and so i started my lab with a really simple question could we measure the classic metabolites you read about in a biochemistry textbook in one shot quantitatively and so that was the starting point for my lab and i guess the second question that we always had in our mind is can we measure the activities of those metabolic pathways so how fast are those metabolites flowing where are they coming from and where are they going i had lunch or dinner actually with one of our mutual friends navdeep chandelle who's also a previous guest on the podcast three or four years ago uh maybe a week ago and he was here in austin for a talk and we were talking about how in the late 90s he said and he was obviously studying metabolism he said if you were to rank me meaning nav was ranking himself right if he said you were to rank me and my work just across the spectrum of the stuff scientists were doing he said i'm bottom 10 percentile you know i mean nobody found metabolism interesting it was this was sort of the uh i forget the term he used but like this was basically the corner where the the kids went that nobody wanted to play with so if you weren't doing genomics if you weren't doing this other sexy stuff immunology you were you were really an uninteresting person but he just found it interesting and of course today as we're going to discover this is where the action is so you know nav was talking about that in the 90s we're now in the early 2000s was it still a little bit of that stigma that nav described that he was kind of under where he was like a totally underperforming you know loser in his own words or was that transition already starting to happen where people saw wait a minute there's something going on here you know nov is so funny and i don't think anyone who's ever met nob thinks he's a loser i'll say that right off the bat first um you know but uh i will say that you know metabolism as an area was definitely out of favor and it was a really strange thing because you had the academic current that metabolism was a solved problem right krebs was you know the culmination of metabolism research at the same time that metabolic syndrome was becoming worse and worse and worse in the population and i would say when i started it was still not a real popular topic metabolism but i think two things were beginning to shift one is the fact that people realized that you know genomics as a standalone was not going to solve health problems that it was really going to have to be supplemented by other technologies that looked at biochemistry broadly and metabolomics proved to be one of those that i think has been enduring will be enduring and the second is that you know the metabolic syndrome epidemic just kept becoming more and more obvious yeah so this is kind of where you're training as a physician becomes relevant because perhaps more so than somebody who didn't spend four years also doing medical school you saw the clinical problem that was sort of kicking you in the face even if it wasn't top of mind to a scientist yeah i think it's really true you know i just benefited so much from the breadth of biology and medicine that you learn in medical school and i mean it allowed me to start my lab working on bacteria which i had never worked on at all as a phd student because you know you learn bacteriology is one of the things in medical school and that was like the perfect starting point for building these technologies with a view all the way to metabolic syndrome and ischemia reperfusion injury right these huge medical problems but i really wanted to start somewhere tractable where we could get you know firm proof of concept so for somebody listening to this which let's assume that they have a greater attention span than somebody you're going to walk into at a cocktail party but obviously not necessarily the the depth of understanding of everything we're about to go into how would you explain metabolism to that person metabolism is the process that converts the food we eat into usable energy and the building blocks our body needs to grow or regenerate itself as well as waste along the way and so now how do you layer on the omic piece of that which is really what we're starting to talk about when people hear the word genomics they sort of understand what that means but i think when people hear the term metabolomics it becomes a little harder to understand so how would you now layer in that in in the context of everything that you're now beginning in your lab yeah so you know the bulk of activity and metabolism that makes most of our usable energy uh involves something like a hundred metabolites and so the first thing we really wanted to be able to do was measure those hundred metabolites really well so tell tell people some examples of those josh because i mean i think we take it for granted but like glucose would be an example of a metabolite what are some other metabolites that are important to understand if you're trying to study this system yeah so all the amino acids are other fundamental inputs that we get from the diet like glutamine is a great example that's a very important circulating nutrient other things that come in you know from the diet if you have vinegar you have acetate or else your microbiome can make acetate that goes in the body fats are obviously important input metabolites and then there are sets of intermediary metabolites these are things that are like glycolytic intermediates that people may have heard about in biochemistry fructose bisphosphate is a famous one of those pyruvate lactate that a lot of people hear about from exercise members of the krebs cycle like citrate is a famous one that exists in our circulation obviously in citrus fruits so these are classic examples of metabolites and then they're the kind of more effector or energy holding metabolites like atp nadh and adph got it so i kind of interrupted you there but you were kind of explaining how first you begin with sort of this survey of all of these metabolites yeah so we want to be able to measure all of these these are kind of the core components of metabolomics and part of the the beauty of metabolism as a system is that with some modest variation there's almost a singular solution on earth to how metabolism works and so when we learned to measure the metabolites in e coli at the same time we were really learning how to measure metabolites all the way up to human and so there are these basic components of protein and nucleic acids basic intermediates like fructose bisphosphate that exist at all of these levels and if you survey relatively comprehensively there's on the order of a thousand of them that have clear biological function so it's a big problem but it's a problem on the scale of you know knowing all the kids who go to your high school not a problem of you know knowing everyone in the phone book in new york city right so it's a problem uh that's right at this interface between the human scale and the computational scale so i wanted to ask you about that you already kind of anticipated perhaps almost a question which is do we think we have the complete solution set here i mean we clearly know all of the amino acids uh we clearly know all of the intermediate steps uh and intermediaries period of the krebs cycle do we think that that means we actually know every single metabolomic element or is there a chance that there are others out there that we don't know because we haven't looked for them or they're very short-lived for example and we haven't stopped and looked at reactions closely enough or studied the kinetics hard enough i mean this is almost a naive question in a way but i've never actually thought about it until now yeah it's a great question and we keep discovering uh new metabolites so you know groups around the world keep discovering new metabolites uh i would say it's a interesting yin and yang because there's this steady accumulation of new metabolites but i don't really think there's been a completely new and obviously important metabolite yet this century so i think at some level in terms of the metabolite finding part of the problem things were wrapping up around the time of krebs the most important part of the work anyway but in terms of undertale maintaining how the system really works and how we can choose the right diet to be healthy given our genotype given the disease we're fighting you know we haven't scratched the surface yet how many of these metabolites are really tightly a la glucose versus not that regulated at all they can kind of fall to zero and they can meaning how many of these things can change by log orders all over the place and how many are regulated so tightly that if you just fall a little bit out of that range i mean you did i mean one of the things i try to explain to people when i explain regulation and homeostasis is i love using ph as an example because you know the ph spectrum runs from you know basically 0 to 14 neutral being 7 but anybody who's taking care of a patient in the hospital knows that you know 7.4 is where we live as an organism [Music] almost unsurvivable to have an acidosis that goes below 7 or an alkalosis that exceeds about 7.7 i mean you know so for a system that runs basically you know 0 to 14 the fact that we can't as a species survive from outside of 7 to 7.6 or 7.7 talks about something that is so tightly regulated so in that field of metabolomics which ones behave like ph and which ones don't well you know ph is such a great example right and you have this giant logarithmic scale from 0 to 14 right and so even when you talk about you know 7.1 to 7.4 you're talking about something you know of a you know it's about a three two three four change in in acid concentration that's right and i think a lot of metabolites that are the important ones live typically in that two to three-fold range as being the preferred range some of them there's a lot more active regulation like glucose some of them there's kind of relatively passive processes that tend to keep them in that range then of course there are all sorts of other metabolites that may be some cool secondary metabolite that's made by a plant and some of us eat it some of us don't eat that plant and so some of us may have a lot some may have none but for for the big ones the biochemistry textbook ones i think you know this kind of a few fold range in the bloodstream is is a common healthy place to be are there common and consistent tools that the body uses to regulate are there principles that the body just adopts over and over and over again in the form of this regulation yeah i think there's one most important principle and that's when it's there use it up and so you know in a physics speak you could say this is a linear consumption of circulating metabolites or in chemistry speak people call this mass action just whatever mass is there you tend to take it in and so you eat a lot of what you eat after a little bit of processing enters the bloodstream and then it's the job of tissues that need these ingredients to use them and use them at first blush in proportion to their availability in the blood are there examples where that regulatory mechanism is not the preferred way to manage them well there's a lot of regulation layered over top of that in order to make the body work and you know the most important regulatory hormone in mammals i'm pretty convinced is insulin right and you know there are two ways uh to look at insulin i think and there's the probably the way that comes to mind first to you which is insulin is a hormone that acts to control elevations in blood sugar okay and it does that at the highest level by promoting uptake of glucose and preventing production of glucose but there's an alternative way to look at insulin and that's that we've evolved mainly to be able to survive lack of nutrients okay that this was the strong selective pressure on animals and mammals and that storing fat is very precious and that insulin is a hormone that says you don't have to use fat right now okay and so it senses that there's enough carbohydrate around and therefore it's safe to not release free fat from your adipose tissue does that mean that you think that an equally important role of insulin is not just the disposal of glucose into muscle and the cessation of glucose production in the liver but you're saying it's equally important as a signal to stop lipolysis to keep your fat in its fat stores meaning save this for a rainier day because you actually have the glucose here that i'm gonna deal with yeah that's that's certainly uh how i look at insulin right now and i think there's little doubt that you know biochemically and medically the suppression of lipolysis is a primary perhaps the primary you know function of insulin so kind of going back to the broad strokes of metabolomics you alluded to it briefly without i think using the term but what do we know about the flux of these things because when i think back to my even my biochemistry 25 years ago you know stryer's textbook which is you know the classic textbook at least it was then i imagine it's one of them still today we really studied it in a static way um and i'm guessing that that's one of the first questions you went after right which is what's what's the movement what are the what are the derivatives with respect to time of all of these things so maybe expand a little bit on this idea of fluxomix yeah i mean metabolism is a system in action and i think this kind of static view of metabolism which is probably never a view that stryer ever had in his mind but that got codified in the textbooks is one that kind of killed metabolism in a way as a topic of excitement and so you know metabolites are intermediates in the process of converting what we eat into usable energy and protein biomass and these things and so they're really you know relatively low in abundance and they're flowing very very fast so they're completely different than parts of our body like neurons that are going to sit there maybe for our entire lifetime okay here the metabolites are meant to be made and used somewhere on the time scale depending on the metabolite of roughly a second to you know roughly an hour maybe for metabolites in the bloodstream and so uh all the action is in the flow and so it's really understanding where things are coming from where they're going uh where we can learn about how metabolism works let's again just use glucose because one it's ubiquitous everybody gets it it's essential for life but it also offers i think a beautiful portrait in velocity so um i just had my blood drawn yesterday i draw my blood about every two months and um so you know tuba blood comes out and um let's say my glucose on that cause that's a snapshot right that's literally in that moment out comes five tubes of blood and it's gonna look for a whole bunch of things but one of them is glucose and my glucose because i did a finger prick at the same time my glucose was 89 milligrams per deciliter can you explain to people what that actually means what does it mean that my glucose at that moment in time was 89 milligrams per deciliter well i'm sure you were smiling about it that is like it's a super healthy blood glucose in terms of a level but when you think of that absolute amount of glucose right if you took all the glucose in your bloodstream at that level that's a few minutes of of glucose or energy for the body right so yeah it's probably that has four or five grams of total glucose exactly yeah 20 calories worth exactly so that has to be constantly replenished in order to feed your brain and the other tissues like activated immune cells that depend on glucose now this is what to me is remarkable if i had done that same test josh and i had come back let's make the math easy and say it was 90 we'd still say great you're healthy your fasting glucose is 90. now let's say i had come back and it was 180 milligrams per deciliter my fasting glucose there's a disease that i would immediately now know that i have that disease is called type 2 diabetes what's the absolute difference in the amount of glucose in my bloodstream it went from being 5 grams to 10 grams seems like a really trivial amount why is it that the body in the person without diabetes seems to be able to keep it at you know 80 to 100 milligrams per deciliter overnight while you're fasting but in a disease that's going to more than double your risk of mortality and increase your risk of cancer alzheimer's disease cardiovascular disease i mean it's it's it's really a problem for your health it's only doubling the amount of glucose in there and it's still a relatively trivial amount that needs a constant constant update how can we explain this delta of that seems so trivial in the absolute amount that could be consumed in just an extra couple of minutes but yet the steady state is still off by this factor what's going on why yeah i mean when you think about why is that a disease problem with only a two-fold excursion then you think that right the system has been built to have about the most circulating glucose that you can have safely right and i think a lot of the really important metabolites have been kind of pushed to the edge this way right and so we know that there are deleterious you know protein modification reactions like oscillation reactions that occur when glucose gets above this point so we kind of in evolution pushed right up to the highest and non-problematic glucose we didn't do that for a lot of other metabolites and that's why there's not a lot of you know part of why there's not a lot of other diseases like diabetes so that's part of the answer is that you know evolution didn't build a lot of wiggle room for your glucose to safely rise because having that you know good amount of glucose circulating is really valuable right you know every time your heart pumps it's sending that amount of glucose to tissues and that's productive on the flip side obviously there's a broader set of derangements in the body to produce this two-fold excursion in glucose right and so you know this has to do with you know things going wrong in fat and fat handling and so that's part of this whole metabolic syndrome that leads to the full set of downstream health consequences it's so interesting that the body doesn't just again i think this speaks to why the flux problem is the more interesting problem than the static problem because if you just think about this example in the static context you would say okay well at 704 and 3 seconds a.m your blood sugar is 190 but three minutes later if nothing changes meaning if your liver doesn't put too much glucose back into circulation you'll be fine the problem is not that your blood sugar is too high in that moment the problem is the liver assumes i i mean in part that that's the right level and it continues to do it because at that moment when you're not eating that is the only source by which glucose is getting into the bloodstream so we're maintaining this elevated cycle right it's it's everything from gluconeogenesis hepatic glucose output i mean all of these things continue to stay unregulated and i think that's only really appreciated when you think of time and the passage of time yeah i think one thing that's really interesting is that you can have depending on the details of how processes are tuned the same amount of production and the same amount of consumption and these have to be balanced for your glucose to stay you know anywhere close to steady okay so in a diabetic production consumption or balance and a healthy person production and consumption are balanced and they can even be the same amount of production and consumption but it can just be that you need a higher amount of glucose to achieve that same balance of production and consumption in the diabetic and that reflects often in my opinion at least you know underlying issues with how fat is handled that you either need more glucose to induce more insulin in order to suppress lipolysis in the diabetic okay or more glucose to out compete fat to get burnt in tissues and so ultimately i think a lot of what's setting blood glucose is competition between glucose and fat this is a very old idea called the randall hypothesis but but i think there's a lot of truth to it we have a lot of new data that's consistent with it and so i think a lot of these issues come back to making room for glucose to be burned by controlling the amount of fat that's being used by tissues so can you state for folks the randall hypothesis i'd love to actually talk a little bit about the the more recent data because as you said i mean this is i mean this is over 50 years old isn't it you know i'm a terrible historian so i'm going to trust you on that one but you know i think the essence of the hypothesis is that fat is somewhere between a preferred and the preferred fuel for tissues and there's competition between carbohydrates classically glucose and fat for burning and so when fat is available then glucose tends not to be burned effectively and that's a possible cause of diabetes now of course when you say fat you don't mean fat within adipose tissue you mean fat i mean then you mean fat that's available for use fat that's available for use and so that can come in multiple forms the simplest way to think about it is free fatty acids that are floating in the bloodstream and that may be the most important form of it but there's you know also adipose stores within tissues not subcutaneous white adipose which is typically a healthy place to store fat molecules but you can end up with what people call ectopic fat for example droplets of fat building up in muscle and when those are there they can compete with carbohydrate for being burned or you can have breakdown of lipoproteins from the bloodstream things like vldl okay that we desperately need to have broken down in order to have a good hdl and a you know a low ldl cholesterol tell me about some of the more recent evidence around why that hypothesis may be more compelling even so than when it was proposed yeah i mean i i think we've been doing experiments that look at you know what are things that can suppress glucose use in tissues and one thing we see is it's just very clear that fat does this we're certainly not the only people to do this i think there's a long history of this but it maybe hasn't been adequately appreciated just how fundamental that result is and if you turn off lipolysis different ways then you rapidly induce glucose consumption and if you provide other alternative fuels and we've learned that lactate is a very important circulating fuel and so it also will compete with glucose to suppress glucose use so the fact that you can have multiple different types of fuels either fat or lactate and any of them will suppress glucose use really makes me believe in this kind of competitive nutrient environment and that that plays a central role in determining whether you clear or don't clear glucose and how high your glucose has to go basically in order to be cleared so let's talk a little bit about lactate because this is one of those things where i you know now given how much i think about lactate read about lactate and that number of podcasts where we get into some detail either i was asleep through part of medical school or it just really wasn't presented in anything other than the following when your demand for atp gets high enough and quick enough you're going to basically take glucose and when you turn it into pyruvate rather than take the efficient path of shuttling pyruvate into acetyl coa through the krebs cycle where you can generate lots of atp requiring oxygen you're going to take a quicker path that's less efficient but doesn't require the same cellular oxygen and you'll turn pyruvate into lactate you won't get nearly as much atp and you'll also tend to generate a lot of lactate which tends to gravitate with hydrogen ions which tends to kind of poison the muscle a little bit and that's you know why it becomes rate limiting in terms of how long you can sustain that level of output maybe explain today why that's at you know the tip of the iceberg in a generous sense of the term well i think it's all actually really important stuff it's just only as you say part of the picture and i think the other part of the picture is that mammals have been wired to use lactate as a major circulating nutrient it's a super super fast turnover nutrient so when you think about that glucose and you're having you know a few minutes supply circulating in your blood lactate you have even shorter supply than yet that it's constantly being made released into the bloodstream and consumed and it serves as an almost universal nutrient they're transporters that'll carry it into virtually any cell in your body these are the mch or is it the uh the mct transporters neither yeah these are called mct transporters or so it stands for monocarboxylate because lactate has one carboxylic acid if you think of it as a chemistry perspective and so those transporters are ubiquitously expressed and they allow lactate basically to go everywhere and so it's the universally which by the way josh that already differs from kind of how we learned it in biochemistry class which was all that lactate goes back to the liver and the cory cycle turns lactate back into glucose and then just exports it down the glucose pathway via hepatoglucose output and you're saying i'd like to understand when that happens versus when each other tissue says oh great more fuel let me take in this lactate yeah i think the really important thing about lactate is that glucose penetration into tissues is actually heavily regulated it has to be heavily regulated so that if we go through a period of having low carb intake there's still glucose preserved for the brain and for other cells that particularly need it and lactate is the universally available form of carbohydrate and so and give an example like you know in a healthy heart at least in the fasted state it basically will not touch glucose all right but so we will use lactobacillus fatty acid with that preferred fuel is free fatty acids uh it probably also gets some fatty acids from lipoproteins and it definitely uses lactate and also things like ketone bodies but it is like a very clear example of a tissue other than liver that net consumes lactate just using it as a fuel to have you know access to carbohydrate energy now lactate is a is a is another metabolite that i pay a lot of attention to josh so as regularly as i'm checking my glucose i'm checking my lactate and unlike glucose the range is much greater right like the lowest glucose i've ever measured in myself is probably 50 milligrams per deciliter and the highest not including the time jerry reevan had me do an insulin suppression test at stanford and i almost died actually this is actually a ridiculous story because one of the ivs got blown and we didn't know that they were pushing glucose because i was just getting so hypoglycemic and um i could feel it you know you learn in medical school what hypoglycemia feels like and when you start sweating really profusely and this was like nothing i've ever experienced it felt like a bucket of water got dumped on me so i knew oh my god i'm really and i was like they got to push glucose and i could feel the iv was blown anyway to make a long story short when they finally corrected it my glucose got up to 240 milligrams per deciliter so like there's call it 250 right that's a you know a 5x range but with lactate i mean i've measured it as low as 0.3 millimole and as high as 20 millimole right so that's a 60-fold difference yeah that's that's a big big range but it probably depends a lot on your physiological state well of course the 0.3 would be you know at rest and fasted the 20 is you know kind of an all-out two-minute effort but the point here is that's a much bigger range and and is this regulated is there an upper limit to how high lactate can go or is it simply how much pain you can tolerate in terms of what is necessary to generate lactate like is there truly an upper limit i'm honestly not sure i mean you may be you may be right on the pain side of the scale right and um you know this this has to do with how fast it's production and consumption all right so you can have that excursion to 20. and you know that goes down cleaned up in a few minutes you know if you're actually you know completely resting so um yeah this is a very flexible metabolite this way when did people start to realize this that that lactate was a fuel because i remember first reading about this in about 2011 where people were starting to say hey neurons might like lactate besides glucose because at that point in time there were really only two fuels that a neuron would ingest right so under normal circumstances it was exclusively glucose and then george cahill showed in the 60s yeah but if you starve somebody you can turn up to 60 of that fuel stock into beta hydroxybutyrate i think it was bhp maybe it was acetoacetate but it was it was a ketone right so you'd be maybe 60 40 in favor of a ketone to glucose but that was really it and then there were these kind of whisperings and these you know animal studies that suggested no actually neurons will consume lactate where are we today on that front yeah i think it's still very unclear which cell types in the brain are the lactate consumers versus lactate producers certainly there's lactate use in the brain and is it more astrocytes neurons do we know i think it's really an activary investigation i mean i think i bring biases to it but i don't bring answers you know my bias is that you know we are a a neuron centric uh form of thinker right and we didn't evolve to make glucose a unique brain fuel in order to feed astrocytes we did it to feed neurons so i do think there's a special neuronal dependence on on glucose but you know as a lactate goes everywhere so it probably goes into both astrocytes and neurons as a fuel in the right circumstances and it probably can be excreted from both as a waste depending on exactly what activities are required in the brain at that time and that's really the beauty of lactate is it allows you a tremendous degree of flexibility that wouldn't exist otherwise and this was actually you know thought about a lot by a guy named brooks at berkeley who george brooks yeah recognize the you know uh ubiquitous uh potential for lactate as a fuel and i think you know we were able to contribute to that story by really showing it yes you know using using mass spectrometry to make it uh crystal clear that this usage happens throughout the whole body so what is the evolutionary reason in your mind for why the body would allow most tissues to love lactate as a fuel directly versus just having the liver mop it up at the same kinetic rate turn it into glucose and shoot that glucose out is there is there an obvious reason for why the current strategy is a better one yeah it's not an easy answer but i think there are strong reasons and i'll say that we've lately done experiments in yeast actually right and you know yeast make ethanol as waste and people always i think assume that you know yeast faced this exact same choice that um you talked about when you get to the level of pyruvate either do you spit it out as a redox balanced waste in humans that's done as lactate and yeast that's done as ethanol or do you take the pyruvate into the tca cycle we see that going all the way back to yeast that's a false choice the default is to spit out the redox balanced waste okay and then you can always pick the waste up and reuse it if you need energy from the tca cycle and so i think this goes back to the very earliest days of eukaryotic life basically that you want to be able to run glycolysis whenever you need to run glycolysis so use glucose whenever you need to use glucose that takes you to pyruvate you've created a redox problem okay because you have electrons from the glucose that are not sitting on the pyruvate and the first priority is always to solve that redox problem that's achieved in our bodies by spitting out lactate and you don't really want to hold that problem within cells in your body you want to get that all the way under the circulation so every cell in your body can work on this master metabolic challenge of keeping you know electrons balanced then whoever needs energy okay and these electrons are a super valuable source of energy can pick them up in the form of lactate and so there's been kind of this um false coupling of oxidative and glycolytic metabolism in the way biochemistry is taught when really our bodies uh and eukaryotes all the way back to yeast are really designed to be much more flexible to allow these two processes to happen in yeast completely independently because they really can just spit out ethanol to the environment in us quasi-independently so independently at the level of individual cells in our bodies so none of them faces this pressure okay and that's really good so if you have a bout of hypoxia okay you can release lactate and elsewhere in the body the problem can be cleaned up now in our bodies it has to be cleaned up within the body somewhere okay because we don't have any master release valve for this so all of our cells together have to solve this problem meaning the way that yeast can literally eject ethanol from their cell and get it away we can't emit lactate from our body we can emit it from a cell but it's still part of the broader system exactly and that's when you get into medical problems like lactic acidosis if you have a very fundamental metabolic deficiency or if you know god forbid someone put a bag over your head and you couldn't breathe right then then you end up in this crisis of redox imbalance but we distribute that problem across the body through this concentrating lactate in and out of cells and letting whatever cells that need carbohydrate energy use the lactate the system would be way way less flexible if you know only the liver could clean this up and it would be also way less commensurate with effective burst exercise okay you know the heart is super well perfused and if muscle is making a less well-perfused muscle that's far from the heart okay so it's hard to get oxygen there is making a lot of lactate of course it's very advantageous at that moment for the heart which is sitting on more oxygen than it needs to use lactate rather than fatty acids which are better long-term things to store for the future anyway so it's way way better to have the system designed this way and is that regulated than locally is that regulated at each cell like how is that decision made because how does that myocite in the heart know the energy of the entire system so that it can make the decision that is a in the short run counter-intuitive you know it's seems medically or maybe textbook med school counterintuitive but it's physical chemistry uh pure intuition well no okay lactate goes up and so it gets regardless how but how is the decision made are you saying it's just made on mass balance and yeah it's like it's made on me it's made on mass action and availability is substrate so there's no decision okay that this it's it's pure physics basically yeah okay now i see what you're saying so um it's basically a gradient problem across the board if you have too much lactate it flows out if you are short on energy it flows it so tell me more about lactate i'll tell you one thing that has i've become very interested in clinically is the implication of fasting lactate levels in the population so um if you you know measure a person's lactate level first thing in the morning you're going to see quite a bit of variability and it seems to be proportional to their metabolic health the higher that number the less metabolically healthy they are um it's not uncommon in someone who's insulin resistant to see fasting lactate levels approaching two millimole with no activity whereas in a healthy individual it'll be below 0.5 millimole what do you think that tells us about fuel partitioning and this problem of metabolomics yeah well i think there's a correlation between fasting glucose and fasting lactate but lactate is the kind of maybe harder to measure but perhaps even more intimately tied to the essence of metabolic dysfunction molecule and i think you know very much you know the way you said it that you know it it reads out a few things you know when lactate is high it reflects the fact that during these times of fasting when glucose is not really supposed to be being used much okay you're still using too much glucose converting too much of it to lactate and at the same time your lactate clearance system isn't working very well and typically that's because you're having competition between lactate and fat to be burned and you know so this all feeds into the syndrome of diabetes now there's another interesting push observation that i've made which is i wake up in the morning check a lactate it's 0.4 millimole i eat the biggest carbohydrate meal i can ingest don't lift a finger other than to feed myself i recheck my lactate in an hour it's one millimole why did that happen i mean we can understand the biochemistry right which is i have more glucose to metabolize but this kind of gets back to your point of med school biochemistry would suggest my lactate should not have gone up i'm taking glucose i'm making pyruvate i have endless cellular oxygen i should be running that pyruvate through the krebs cycle and i shouldn't see any uptick in lactate but that's exactly what i don't see yeah i mean circulating lactate is an intermediary in glucose catabolism and that's just the way the body works it's not what we were taught in med school yeah yeah and i wonder i mean do you have a sense of uh of how it's being taught today do you do you get the sense that that biochemistry students at princeton and stanford today are being taught what we were taught with respect to this sort of um more rigid model of lactate and it's as a as a metabolite well i'm probably chipping away at it at princeton but it you know i i don't know uh how much it's shifting at the medical education level yet probably thank god i haven't sat through those classes at stanford again but um i think it's something that we should see shift and and i hope we see the next generation of biochemistry textbooks talk about circulating lactate as an intermediary in glucose catabolism i think that's a really fundamental thing for people who want to just think about metabolism accurately to know and as you say it you can do this the self-experiment very simply and see it and i think it's a very interesting thing to consider from a prognostic standpoint you know when you go back and look at jerry rieven's five criteria for what was then syndrome x and what is now metabolic syndrome fasting glucose is still one of them you could make a case that fasting lactate would be more telling yeah i wouldn't be surprised i mean i think the challenge with lactate is that it is a metabolite that can get up and down faster and one response to stress is to rapidly convert glucose into lactate and so that's just part of your body activating but of course they're people who have stress at a blood draw and because lactate is a little bit more fluctuating this way they're going to be pros and cons medically in terms of using it as a biomarker you know i i don't think our problem with metabolic syndrome anyway is diagnosing it right our problem is preventing it yeah although what i would argue is i think we treat metabolic syndrome too discreetly and i think we come to it too late right i think we should be looking for things far before you actually have hypertension and truncal obesity and dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia and i do wonder with nothing other than just intuition if lactate dysregulation for lack of a better word might be one of the earlier canaries in the coal mine i totally agree with that i want to go back to something that we've talked about a couple of times you've mentioned it in passing you and i know what it's about but i think it's such an important part of where we're gonna go in a discussion that i almost need you to go into full prof mode and really explain two things which are obviously highly related in a moment you'll see the first is how the electron transport chain works so what is what is the krebs cycle doing and how is that feeding into this massive generation of energy currency and specifically can you talk about it with special attention to the concept of redox and i would encourage you josh to take as much time as you need because the more the listeners understand this the more they'll be able to understand nad nadp nadph nr nmn all of these other things that people really care about but i think unfortunately they've been conditioned into very glib understandings of these things which i think are serving no one any benefit without actually going back to understanding the root of this problem now that's a great framing so you know you can think of it this way fundamentally you know you eat three macronutrients carbs and protein and fat and in a healthy adult first approximation every carbon atom that you eat in any of those three forms needs to exit your body as exhaled carbon dioxide okay and all of that exhale carbon dioxide to first approximation is made in the tca cycle and the main way that nutrients flow into the tca cycle to become carbon dioxide is first turning into pieces that are two carbon units in size and so from carbohydrate the basic flow is glucose to lactate and then lactate to pyruvate to a two carbon piece that goes into the tca cycle fat is basically composed of pre-assembled two carbon pieces so they just get chopped up two carbon pieces at a time and the protein part is a little more complicated we can probably skip it okay so you end up with these two carbon units but we're worth just sort of noting josh that protein really the primary role of protein is actually the nitrogen side which we're kind of putting into these amino acids that are building blocks it's really less of an energy substrate but it does have that carboxylic acid on it that still has to go through this cycle and be exhaled but that's in other words that's why we'll skip it for now because it's really not a significant energetic component right yeah i mean i think it really depends on the kind of diet you eat right if you say if you're on a carnivore diet that then it's probably a different situation yeah it's a very interesting side discussion but ultimately you know unless you're gaining protein mass which of course wonderful for us guys anyway when that happens typically societally smiles on it um you know but other than that you know whatever amino acid carbon you take in in the form of protein has to be balanced with also amino acid catabolism so at that level it's not that different than than carbs and fat it's just a little different in that it can enter the tca cycle sometimes also as four carbon pieces but a lot of amino acids are broken down into these same two carbon pieces they're just 20 of them so it's you know no one wants to hear a discussion of how all 20 of them get chopped up um so ultimately you end up with these two carbon pieces and then uh they congeal with a four carbon piece and that makes citrate and a lot of one of the problems with the krebs cycle is that it has three names okay the krebs cycle in honor of the amazing biochemist who played a key role in figuring it out the citric acid cycle and that's named for this condensation molecule of the four carbon and the two carbon piece citrate um or the tca cycle and tca is tricarboxylic acid and that's because citrate has three carboxylic acids okay so you have this cycle that unfortunately has three names but that um it's probably three times as important as anything else in metabolism so maybe it's fair so ultimately as this cycle turns it's gonna spit off the two carbon pieces that came in as carbon dioxide and in so doing it's going to take the electrons that were part of those two carbon pieces and pass them to this famous cofactor nad to make nadh okay and um that h stands for hydrogen all right and that hydrogen is really one proton and two electrons and so there's another confusing nomenclature thing that you just can think of that h even though it may sound to those who've taken from you know freshman chemistry like h plus like acid this is an h with two electrons stuck to it so it's really what we call hydride or uh electrical form of chemical energy and so then the nadh that's made from nad there is what feeds in to the electron transport chain and those electrons then flow through a series of proteins that sit in the inner mitochondrial membrane the mitochondria have two membranes the outer one is kind of leaky and kind of not so important the inner one is super tight and has a ton of regulation in it and most importantly can be used to pump protons to one side or the other and ultimately it's the pumping of protons out of the mitochondria that's the function of the electron transport chain and in this kind of metabolic flux way that we talked about earlier the protons that get pumped out just flow right back in but as they flow back in they turn a turnstile and as that turns dial turns it squeezes adp and inorganic phosphate physically squeezes them together to make atp the master energy currency that we use to power our neurons for thinking our muscles from moving and so on so one of the things about this system that is just so beautiful is the transition from chemical energy to electrical energy back to chemical energy and i you know i've tried to explain this to my daughter she's 13. she's not fully in love with it yet but i know at some point it'll be a more fun discussion but it really is a miracle right like so much of biology just seems like it's hard to believe it all worked out but if you were gonna rank all the things that i can't believe it worked out this has got to be in the top five right it's like let's go back to the basics again you eat a piece of bread right you're eating glucose it has these carbon to carbon bonds and carbon to hydrogen bonds and some carbon to oxygen bonds now refresh my memory but carbon to oxygen is not a very energetic bond right you know this is an another thing where you have to be careful with the nomenclature so like co double bonds are spectacular bonds they're super high energy but that's where life or i shouldn't say life that's where physics and chemistry want to flow too they want to make these high energy bonds and in making high energy bonds you can release a lot of energy and so those are bonds that are very energetically favorable all right so they're the end state it's the ch bonds as you're alluding to that start out energetically loaded okay they're less energetically good in and of themselves so they have the potential to become something better yeah it's the it's the potential that i really yeah i'm glad you're i'm glad you're adding this level of sort of chemical rigor to this so yeah the point i want to make is the these these carbon-carbon carbon and hydrogen bonds have this potential that this entire cycle with three names that's so wonderful basically liberates it basically says we're going to take that chemical energy and we're going to liberate it through electron transferring apparati and then at the last second using that i love the turnstile analogy right we're basically going to quickly shunt it right back into a chemical bond which is the p binding to the adp to make the atp and now we have this energy currency that is going to go and do its own thing and it has lots of different ways that it unleashes itself so explain to people the difference between oxidation and reduction in chemical terms because i think people have to at least hear once what's an oxidation reaction what's a reduction reaction and then why we use the term redox synonymously with these two right so um oxidation reduction are always coupled okay and they refer to the movement of electrons and so when electrons go from substance a to substance b okay the one that gives up the electrons is oxidized it's subject oxidation the one that receives the electrons is reduced okay it's the subject of reduction let's talk about redox pairing so you've already brought up nad and nadh so talk about how oxidation reduction pairing works with those two to facilitate the electron transfer down this lovely chain of the inner mitochondrial membrane right so this is a pair where nad is the oxidized form nadh is the electron holding or reduced form and it normally exists in a quite biased ratio towards a lot of nad and a small amount of nadh and the way nature works is that whenever any para chemicals is skewed in one direction it's favorable to turn the one that's abundant into the one that's less abundant and so this makes nad a decent electron acceptor and so it's sitting there prepared to pick up electrons from these intermediates carbon intermediates of the tca cycle they're coming from carbohydrate and fat and take the electrons make nadh which then can feed into electron transport chain and that back end has to happen fast in order to keep this ratio skewed so you have mainly nad and not too much nadh and that's really important because when that nadh starts creeping up all sorts of things start going wrong such as well nadh going up will uh drive too many electrons in the electron transport chain and going back to uh nav you know he's done a spectacular job showing how that leads to production of free radicals and so when you you need the right amount of this but this is a clear way to get toxic amounts of free radicals if you have nadh buildup secondly it just gums up metabolism if you have too much nadh relative to nad and so then you can get into problems not having enough atp and so and then it can also make signaling things go awry now are there clinical scenarios in which we see that happen or are these more typically they're things that result from toxicities where you know like you know the classic thing you learn in medical school to explain the significance of this whole system is cyanide right you know maybe tell folks how cyanide works and i don't know if that's too extreme an example of how this system can be hijacked but but let's see yeah i know i mean obviously you know cyanide is electron transport chain inhibitor and so that leads the whole system just backing up a bit by bit and so you can't then transfer electrons from nadh into the electron transport chain and so nadh goes way up nad falls to the floor and then you have no way to make atp and that unfortunately leads to rapid mortality right um yeah and that's that's that's an interesting point because it speaks to this again comes back to the kinetics and the flux which is it it's not like cyanide kills you in an hour i mean it kills you in seconds it's really a sobering thought yeah atp turnover via this system is on the time scale of a second and so same for nadh and so these are things you're just whizzing through our bodies all the time and that we're constantly dependent on are there are there less extreme examples josh of things that will put that balance in the wrong direction kind of chronically i think it's a really interesting question i mean and i don't want to give the misimpression that you know the right thing is to have as much nad and as little nadh as possible right this is a first of all it's designed to be a dynamic system you know if you undergo intense exercise you're going to drive nadh up and this is a very healthy context for doing this transiently metformin of course is a super interesting medication and probably works you know mainly by slowing the conversion of nadh backed nad by impairing the complex one of the electron transport chain the one that does this initial electron offloading from nadh to make nad how well is that understood i mean this is you'll talk to five people who study metformin and they'll tell you five different things which i think just tells you how much we don't know but what is your view of the i don't think it's really disputed that metformin inhibits complex one is it i think the broader question is how much is that the main attraction versus kind of a sideshow right yeah i i'll say you know there are many people who know more about this than me but one thing that we tend to do in our lab sometimes take these kind of famous metabolic effects like metformin inhibiting complex one and just do a quick test of it and i say when we do that about half the time they look to be true and half the time they look to be dubious and metformin was a shining star in our hands and inhibiting complex one it was one of the cases where i really felt like you know it may do other things but it certainly does what it's supposed to do there it does that strongly and i think it's probably the fact that it does it in a relatively liver specific way due to the way that metformin enter cells of the body that leads to it first of all being safe okay there are many things that make it safer than cyanide but it is really crazy that you know it's the maybe the world's most widely used medication is from the electron transport chain yeah yeah and it's a mechanistic analog of cyanide right and so you have like one of the most acutely lethal substances and the most widely used drug working in a remarkably similar way and so i think the fact that there's a strong liver specificity is probably what makes it you know net beneficial for at least a subset of people and and what's the what's the what's the change that you saw in your lab josh between so if you were off metformin what's your nadh to nad ratio and then on metformin how much did it change that it depends how much metformin you use but if you try to approximate like a uh you do your best to approximate an actual clinical dose of you know say a couple grams a day yeah i'm not sure we did this in a way that i would consider clinically applicable so uh but but i'll say that it's certainly crystal clear that it goes in the right direction and so it doesn't surprise you that metformin would raise fasting lactate levels correct no i mean it certainly is aligned to do that right and that's just backing up further it's just basically creating more of a roadblock into the tca is going to give you more lactate yep more of a road back in electron disposal basically do you think that that's a neutral effect or do you think that that's a potentially deleterious effect of metformin that is probably offset in a patient with diabetes by the benefits that it has on hepatic glucose output it's a great question i don't think i know i mean i think having more circulating lactate can be you know a bit of a challenge for clearing fat right because they have some sort of competition so from that perspective i think you know being in a a lower state might have some benefits but then you know lactate is a valuable fuel as long as it's not getting to too high levels so i i'm not sure how that all plays out in terms of long-term health interesting yeah um anything you want to say about nadp and nadph just to round it out so people know the full uh yeah these are you know super uh important cofactors that um personally i'm very obsessed with um that are kind of they live just on the edge of what people who take biochemistry either in undergraduate or med school learn about or don't learn about and they're fascinating cofactors because in terms of their intrinsic chemistry all their intrinsic chemistry from the energy point of view is exactly the same as nad nadh but they have a different handle on them chemically that allows biology to use them in a different way and then the ratio is maintained quite different level from nad nadh so nad nadh is super biased towards nad this is much more of an even pairing which means that there's much more driving force to dump the electrons off okay rather than to absorb them up and so nadph is really to me second only to atp a master energetic building material and it's the building material that's used for example to assemble fat it's the most important one so as you take pieces two carbon pieces from carbohydrate and want to put them together to make fat you keep dumping in electrical energy in the form of nadph and then eph is used in all sorts of other really interesting ways to fight reactive oxygen species it's also used if you're trying to kill bacteria to intentionally make reactive oxygen species so this is where biology is freaking confusing and complicated and there's definitely the yin and yang that you have this awesome cofactor that's so important for fighting oxidative stress and also can be used to create boatloads oxidative stress intentionally when it's needed first of all that was a fantastic overview of how the krebs cycle works and specifically with attention to how electrons move through it and move through these redox factors which then brings us to i think a part of the discussion where a lot of people have an enormous interest which is i don't know go back seven eight years it started to become fashionable and it's only become more fashionable to talk about supplementing with nad i say that quote unquote we're going to talk about why you don't actually supplement with nad but is it safe to say that at least part of the impetus for this was the observation that as we age cellular nad levels decline and you've already made a very compelling case for why nad is important i mean i don't i i almost want to avoid the whole sirtuin side of this because i think that story keeps changing so maybe we can just unless you feel strongly or compelled to get into sirtuins we can put those aside for the moment yeah i love putting sirtuins aside aside let's let's just get to real metabolism and yeah you know i think the first principles in this field are great right that you know nad plays this super central role in energy generation that we all want to feel more energetic whether you know you want to be a more extremely successful athlete at age 21 or whether you want to feel at age uh 50 like i am or later you know like you're 21. um and so you think you know if we could just you know turn up the the burner capacity right this would be absolutely fantastic and then we have this data that nad is depleted with aging i'll have to say when we do those measurements we agree that nad is depleted with aging but it is a lot more subtle than you know you would think uh looking at the literature and so these are really quite subtle nad depletions you know we were talking about these ranges earlier and you know the kind of three-fold uh range where a lot of metabolites live on a daily basis some of them glucose that's their worst day right and as you pointed out some of them like lactate you know they may do the threefold all the time and then the 60 fold when you stress them nad changes we see with aging are like you know 10 20 oh wow i didn't realize it was that little josh yeah so i think um and i'm not saying that in some tissue of you know an aged human there might not be bigger effects but i think this is the first caution i would give to people thinking that they're going to fix everything through nad and so you know on one hand it's a robust finding that this is something that changes with aging that with a central metabolic role on the other hand it's something that happens with a fair amount of subtlety can you explain to folks how this is done because again i mean you know we talk about measurement sometimes a little too glibly right so pretty easy to explain how we can measure glucose and hemoglobin and lactate at the other end of the spectrum we've talked a lot about atp but but i what i think most people don't understand is it's very difficult to measure atp it comes back to what you said a moment ago this ain't sticking around a very long time right you're using mrs and super complicated physics to be able to measure these things where does nad fit on that spectrum and how do you actually measure it yeah i mean i think the good news is that nad um unlike nadh is not like one of these super transient metabolites and so nadh measurement is wickedly difficult but you know most of this nadh nad para sits as nad and it tends to sit around for you know um hourish time scale oh so you don't even have to you don't necessarily have to flash freeze tissue or things like that that's right you have some more flexibility in making those uh measurements as long as you're not irritating the tissue in a way that leads to you know massive nad degradation which you know people may do uh sometimes by accident but i think generally it's not that hard of a measurement nad obviously like atp it's a tissue metabolite not a circulating metabolite so you need biopsy specimens to measure it i'm not a master of the literature of you know nad levels in human tissues but my um not fully informed perspective is that there probably isn't as much as we should have okay and that's because it's hard to get biopsies from from people and if you if you took if you take blood if you take a whole blood and you look at pbmc can you look at nad levels in there with relative ease or is it too complicated because by the time you separate the pbmc you've kind of lost your window i think it's a really good question because there is quite active nad metabolism in immune cells so yeah i'm not an expert in this uh but i bet there's a way you could develop a good protocol i haven't followed you know how good the measurements up to now have been so most of what you've measured has been in tissue yeah typically you know we work a lot in mouse sometimes we measure human but more typically on the cancer side and yeah there we just take tissues and freeze them and you know extract metabolites to mass spec you're seeing a consistent clear decline in nad with the aging animal or human but it's i mean it's not a fold reduction it's a percent reduction 10 20 reduction and that's that's the most common thing yeah okay so this this generates a hypothesis the hypothesis is if you restore nad levels in the old organism to the level that they were in the young organism the old organism will feel and perform like the young organism that's one hypothesis another hypothesis would be if you induce supranormal levels of nad in any organism they will feel super normal so let's assume that both of those hypotheses are simultaneously testable what happened five seven eight years ago nad clinics started popping up all over the place and they started saying if you come here we'll put ivs in you and will give you nad so let's first explain why did they do this intravenously why couldn't they make an nad pill yeah so nad and its precursors are broken down in the gastrointestinal tract and so you know if you take you know nr for example so nicotinamide riboside orally it mainly will enter the body in the form of nicotinic acid or niacin which is a healthy substance so there's nothing wrong with it but you know except for maybe the epithelium or gastrointestinal tract you know the body is not seeing nicotinamide riboside and nad just to be clear because we're going to talk about nr and nmn in a moment but nad there's no way to orally take it right it has to be yeah there's no known absorption route for nad and i think it'll get broken down probably all the way to nicotinic acid although i'm not 100 sure anyone has proven that but it i certainly don't think it would enter the body any other way than either nicotinamide which is like you know a little bit closer to remaking nad or or nicotinic acid so what happens when a person receives intravenous nad what's the fate of that nad because uh you know one of the things in uh metabolism and biology is anytime you put something in a vein you bypass the liver with something called the first pass effect which in your former life was very important because when you had these patients in the er that you were giving inhaled drugs to it's not just the speed with which they were getting it it's that you didn't you could actually deliver the exact drug you wanted not a pro drug that could be modified by the liver so this idea of giving intravenous nad is at least theoretically interesting because you're putting the molecule of interest directly into the venous system so what's its fate i think and you may be more up on this than me but that you know it's going to get broken down partially right because there's not clear uptick mechanisms known anyway to get nad from the bloodstream into cells nicotinamide mononucleotide i think may be able to enter cells directly or nicotinamide ribosides these are partially broken down forms of nad but that are nevertheless meaningfully closer to nad than the normal things that circulate in good amounts in our bloodstream and that does partially i would say short circuit the route to cells making nad so they kind of can break down partially the nad in the bloodstream take these partially broken down nad precursors into cells and rebuild nad in a shortcut manner that probably has a good chance to bolster nad levels so in other words when you give intravenous nad there is no transporter to take nad into a cell but that nad breaks down into things like nr and nmn and in the vascular system we know that those things can get taken up at least into some cells do we know which cells have the capacity to do that or which cells don't i don't know that i'm the best expert to ask that but i yeah i think i think certainly at least some important cell types in the body can take those up and maybe pretty broadly but i don't know off the top of my head when the nr or nmn gets into this cell is it relatively straightforward that it will be reconstituted into nad like what's the um uh what's the uh energetic cost of doing that or you know how easy is that and is that is that the favored reaction at that point yeah i think it's a favored reaction which is the important thing and this is not a big demand relatively speaking you know the the big energy flow is through this nad and nadh exchange but the making of nad itself is not an expensive process per se and so yeah you get these pieces you can kind of think so nad stands for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and so it's two kind of nucleotide pieces put together and when you take in nr or nmn it's one of those two pieces but the more interesting side and the other side comes from atp and it's there all the time because all your cells have atp or you got much much deeper problems yeah and so you just snap it together and i think you end up with you know probably effective nad supplementation when you go the iv route in other words taking iv nad will probably increase into intracellular nad levels though not directly because there's not a transporter but it goes through this sort of circuitous route to get there so it might not be the most efficient way to do it but uh it this certainly corrects a statement i've made in the past which is intravenous nad is not a good way to get nad because we don't have a transporter that's correct but incomplete i think that's a fair summary from my perspective in other words we don't really know how much if you take a hundred units of nad intravenously infused we don't really know how many units ultimately make their way into a cell but it's probably not a hundred yeah i'm sure there's a fair amount of loss in the process i mean there's a very interesting protein called cd38 that's i think designed to control these kind of pathways okay and it's a suppressor of nad levels and it works i think by breaking down nad that's outside of cells and mainly there's not normally in physiology nad in meaningful amounts probably outside of cells but there is nmn in meaningful amounts since this is a protein that's super good at breaking down nmn it still leaves you with nr which is still so it's one step further away from being nad but it's still meaningfully closer than your typical physiological precursor and so i think it's positioned to as you say at least some places in the body boost nad today i think the majority of efforts to increase intracellular nad are done through oral uh precursors and the two are nr and nmn which as you said are pretty similar and are you aware of a more convincing argument for why one might be a more preferred substrate i i haven't particularly seen arguments that one is superior than the other i've seen some unpublished data that suggests one can be made more temperature and moisture stable than the other but let's put that aside for the moment would you consider these two a first approximation equivalent approaches yeah okay so now talk about something else that you said that also kind of news to me which is what is the effect of the gastrointestinal tract on these agents yeah i mean they get broken down and they get broken down um all the way to the level of nicotinic acid or niacin basically and this is the main way they enter the body it doesn't mean that you know there can't be a trickle of them entering some other way that has a physiological effect or that there's some local effect or some effect on the microbiome of taking them so they're you know biology is super complicated there are ways that these could be doing interesting health supporting things but i don't really think they're fundamentally different than taking a physician-prescribed niacin pill from the perspective of providing nad precursors now a physician prescribed niacin pill when people used to take niacin for hyper beta lipoproteinemia right which is really obviously no i mean there's probably still some patients out there who take niacin unfortunately but it wasn't uncommon to get a real flush from the medication now i don't remember what doses people were taking but i feel like it was on the order of grams not milligrams do you recall how much niacin you would need to give somebody for them to experience an actual flush i think it was a few grams i think that that's where my recollection is too okay so so is that the reason people don't experience a flush with nr and nmn because they're typically taking you know 500 milligrams to one gram and that's simply not going to produce enough niacin to reach that threshold yeah they're also kind of niacin pro drugs so they probably are delayed absorption forms of niacin so that may smooth things out enough so they may be better tolerated but i think this is how i'd fundamentally think about them is that they're niacin prodrugs your lab has done some some of the flux work on this correct what what are some of the most interesting things you've learned about how nr and how nmn when given orally end up in different tissues and what the effect is in the liver versus the muscle versus the plasma yeah i i think the main thing you see is that you know these are converted to niacin they will raise niacin particularly niacin heading to the liver out of the gastrointestinal tract so in the what we call the portal circulation that connects you know your intestine to the liver uh very effectively and that you know other than that their effect on like boosting their own circulating levels is somewhere between subtle and vanishing i'm still not sure which of those two it is but i i think they certainly remain in the bloodstream much less abundant than nicotinamide which is the thing the liver is normally producing to feed nad precursor to the tissues of the body and so there there's from what we have seen no clear route for oral nr or oral nmn to produce circulating levels of nro or nmn that are high enough to compete at least at a standard concentration level with nicotinamide the physiological precursor as a way of feeding nad precursors to tissues so basically at some level they don't change what's happening and what most your tissues are seeing that much if our measurements are correct where do you think you could be fooled on this i mean i know that's a question every scientist or every good scientist asks themselves that question right how can we be fooled by our measurements i'm sure you've thought about this where where do you see this the opportunities in this particular case to be misled yeah i mean it could be that you know there are local effects of nr or nmn on like the intestine that are really important it could be that their availability impacts the microbiome in important ways the microbiome can have big effects on health uh it could be that even though the amounts of like nr that may reach the liver or even lower amounts that may reach you know the heart or something are really small that there's a subset of cells there that are really in our preferring because maybe they're really deficient in using nicotinamide and maybe getting even small amounts of nr to those cells is meaningful so i think these are all possibilities that we're very much open to but you know my base assumption is that often the obvious is true and here the obvious would be you know the physiological system just isn't that impacted by this particular type of oral supplement do you think there's any chance that with chronic administration you'd see something different because i'm assuming in these experiments you're not seeing the effect of these chemicals being ingested chronically or are you no i think it could be i mean human can be different than mouse okay first of all is another important thing that i say and we haven't done these experiments in human i think someone if they aren't already should do these experiments in human uh and um yeah chronic versus acute so there's a bunch of variables that could alter things based on what you know now if if the hypothesis is true if giving well not let's not talk about the route if restoring intracellular nad levels at 50 to the level they were at when you were 20 would improve some measure of performance based on what you know today what do you hypothesize would be the most efficient way to restore nad levels yeah i mean i i guess you know iv is the promising way to do the restoration i'm i'm not very convinced about the first hypothesis and you know i think the big history of medicine you and i can debate it is that things are way more complicated than people can envision right that you know hormone replacement therapy is like one of the great examples right it didn't turn out to although it's being overturned well but i think you know i think hrt is one that i think if you go back and look at the women's health initiative um i think it got it wrong right i mean i think it was the randomized experiment but it was really misinterpreted so is this is wait to say a bit more about that maybe i picked up on the wrong thread of where you were going but i assumed what you were going to say was look the epidemiology in the 80s and 90s was that giving women hormones post-menopause was a good thing and then the women's health initiative came along and said no it's a bad thing i assume that's what you were going to say and what i was going to say was actually no i think that's actually misleading i think if you actually go back and look at the women's health health initiative it was just an awful example of how to misinterpret a study i think there was no increase in the risk of breast cancer and if there was any risk increase in the risk of breast cancer probably had nothing to do with the estrogen that the women were given when you actually look for example at the relative risk and absolute risk different in those cohorts so remember the women's health initiative had three cohorts you had your full placebos well technically it was two parallels right so you had the placebo versus uh estrogen only in women who did not have a uterus and then you had placebo versus estrogen plus mpa the synthetic progesterone so in the estrogen only versus the placebo there was a non-statistical significant reduction in the risk of breast cancer so there was a hazard ratio of about 0.8 or 0.79 or 0.81 something like that but it didn't quite reach statistical significance but trending towards estrogen actually reduced the risk of breast cancer in the estrogen plus mpa group there was a barely statistical significant increase in the risk of breast cancer i think the hazard ratio was i want to say it was about 1.24 1.25 um and the p-value was exactly 0.05 or 0.049 or something like that so at the surface you'd say gosh this is increasing the risk of breast cancer and what was talked about was it was it was a 25 percent increase in the risk of breast cancer but the you know to talk about the relative risk increase without talking about the absolute risk is obviously irresponsible if you look at the absolute risk change it was a 0.1 it was one in a thousand and that says nothing about a lot of other methodological issues with the study including the fact that in my opinion a more plausible hypothesis was that the mpa was more the issue than the estrogen but the estrogen gets all the attention right so estrogen causes breast cancer gets the attention and you know if you look at subsequent studies i don't think we see that to be the case so so i'm going to hypothesize or predict that in 10 years i think that we'll look back at what happened to a generation of women which i think is really unfair in that a you know basically an entire generation of women got deprived of hormones um because of i think a really poorly interpreted study but your point notwithstanding sometimes the obvious is not obvious sorry for the digression well i i mean yeah but like no i mean that was super interesting and and i thought there was some cardiovascular risk data in that study that was surprising but i i it's you know it much better than me yeah i think on the cardiovascular front there probably is a slight increase in risk with oral estrogen because of the hypercoagulability i also think it speaks to understanding the use case today very few women on hormone replacement therapy are given oral estrogen the preferred route of administration is is uh is a is a patch you know something like a vavel dot where you're given topical estradiol and you get all of the benefits of reduction of vasomotor symptoms the incredible benefits that you see on bone health without any of the hypercoagulability and cardiovascular so now we actually see the reverse now there's a very clear trend uh not just trend it's statistically significant there's a very clear reduction in cardiovascular mortality all right so that's a great example where you had to give by the right route of administration right in in order to get uh the net positive health benefit right and i mean i i think you know right and said to advil another one right people knew they had a lot of side effects but everybody assumed that they were kind of counterbalanced by the fact they were reducing coagulability and that this was going to be cardio protective right and i i don't know if you're going to tell me that you still believe that but no i don't most most people don't right yeah yeah and so so so really where you were going i think is you were saying look you might even just reject the outright hypothesis like this idea that yeah we do observe a 20 10 to 20 reduction in nad levels as we age you haven't even bought the first hypothesis which is even if i could magically deliver 20 more nad to a 50 year old you're not you're not sounding very convinced that that's going to improve quality or length of life yeah not at this point in time right i mean these these things involve such complicated interplay of different organ systems and it may turn out that you know nad supplementation is super valuable medically i am completely open to that and i would love that to be the case um but i think if so it's going to be because there are select cell types that are genuinely severely nad depleted and that we will need to figure out how to restore nad in those cell types and then we may see big health benefits so i think that would be fantastic and it's completely possible and it's possible that the general intravenous supplementation is hitting those cells and doing that but i think it's equally possible that it's having some adverse effect that's going to be net negative for people and they we don't know the science well enough and we certainly haven't done the clinical experiment well enough to give good health guidance yet so two things first a statement i i mean this is really interesting for me because i really stand corrected and i just want to apologize to all the people over the years that i've said intravenous nad is not getting in your cell uh i stand corrected it indirectly based on everything you're saying may actually be getting into at least some cells the second is a question right which is how would you even begin to tackle that question which is are there certain cell subtypes that may indeed benefit from nad boosting i haven't really seen a single convincing clinical study in humans using either nr or nmn that has made me excited about this and i'm not a stranger to putting things in my body without absolute perfect information right i mean i take rapamycin i've been taking rapamycin for four or five years i will be the first to admit i think we have very good evidence for that it's not perfect it's far from perfect we're never going to have a definitive human clinical trial but if i'm willing to take rapamycin why am i not taking nr and why am i not taking nmn and the reason is i just can't find a shred of compelling evidence to tell me to do so and i'm in the same boat you're in i'd love it if there was because it's a pretty easy safe thing to take so what study needs to be done to help someone like me a reluctant nader get on the nad train you know i think we need to first of all map better the basic pharmacology of nad in animals and human i mean that's quite doable and this is something that we as a field are doing and there are a lot of great people doing this and and but we can do more and better then we need to have the technologies to look at this at cellular resolution rather than bulk resolution so this thing we're pushing very hard to develop the ability to take a slice of tissue and say what's the heterogeneity across cells in nad levels i think that'll be very helpful because if we see that that's really scatter shot in aging and homogeneous and young then you have your answer that you know all that we need is for one in ten cells at any time to be really nad depleted and we view that ten percent reduction not as some tiny wiggle down but as one in ten cells being on the road to a catastrophic outcome okay and so um i think this is going to be a really important measurement uh and i think the field will get there over the next you know few years not instantly and then ultimately we need successful clinical experiments right and i think there there have been some really persuasive experiments in animals you know with uh for example i think their experiments on reversing you know bad outcomes after renal ischemia and so it'd be good if we could find niche experiments where there's a very strong effect in animals a very quick clinical readout right you have a ischemic renal event and you do the supplementation and you get a benefit or you don't so i don't think the right way how is it administered in that experiment i don't think i remember that one you know i i may not get the details uh of that right so um but i think i would just say conceptually we need to find the strongest animal proof of concept that can be translated into a small but definitive clinical trial and prove that this really can do something beneficial in the right context and then from there you can think about kind of you know expanding the indication to general health betterment who's the natural owner funding wise of this investigation i mean is is nih is this a question nih is interested in i mean indirectly through the itp rich miller randy strong at all have have already done an nr test uh in in their very rigorous tried and trued model as you know that failed right so nr did not extend life um is nih still interested in this question enough to continue funding it do you you know where is your funding for this level of investigation coming from you know we mainly try to help the real nad expert labs by you know doing the flux studies facilitating measurements but you know it's not the bread and butter of my life i'm probably about an observer at the same level as you of this this field broadly speaking um i think you know there's there's money in nih for interesting science and so uh this is too central to metabolism and too much public health interest for you know so you're not wondering you're not worried this is not going to run up against no and i think biotech is interested in this and you know there's very interesting ways to do this pharmacologically and so we may see those mature faster you know cd38 inhibitors obviously there's a whole different financial structure there right if you can make a patent approved you know medicine and all that economic incentive is is great for driving um first you know science answers and then clinical answers what are the top labs right now in your mind in in studying nad and it's and its precursors are ways to increase it oh gosh i i think i'm too much of an outsider to get into naming names on that i'm going to only get myself in trouble other than to credit other than to credit joe bauer for being a fantastic collaborator yeah yeah you'll fail to mention somebody fair enough fair enough okay let's pivot to the final thing i want to really get into josh which is cancer metabolism it kind of ties in so much of what we've talked about and that's how you and i reconnected five or six years ago at a conference and then obviously number of times since then so um you know the irony of it is right you do your phd in the inner workings of how the immune system works but you're not particularly interested in cancer at the time you you you come back to academia as a metabolomics experiment as a metabolomics expert and now you've kind of wound your way back to oncology in a way so um tell me a little bit about that journey right how did you go from this profound interest in metabolism metabolomics and flexomix to realizing a beautiful application for this is in the field of oncology yeah i think um you know part of it is really the human connection and i was so fortunate to be at princeton which is this kind of academic bubble where i could do my experiments on e coli and yeast and really set up these good metabolic measurements unmolested but then you know also we're close to pen and uh at some point i got a call from the head of the penn cancer center at that point in time craig thompson saying he wanted to visit and he just of course i just say yes you know it's a simple one and that was kind of a life-changing call for me because it brought me into the world of biomedicine you know again basically in the context of working on cancer metabolism and it was very natural because if you look at the history of cancer therapy right you know the first great rational triumph in treating cancer was anti-folates and sydney farber and you know his name memorialized on the dana-farber cancer center right and so this is really the origins of how cancer was rationally treated by targeting metabolism and it just got under-studied for so many years and it was a very natural re-entry point for me because cancer you can study as isolated cells uh in a culture dish much as we were studying e coli and yeast and so that was much more comfortable to me uh in you know the uh 2008 or whatever time frame then you know starting to work on mice and i'm delighted that we got back to mice a few years after that what year did craig leave penn to go to memorial sloan-kettering must have been shortly after he invited you over right yeah a few years after i think so yeah so so people like craig who i have not had on the podcast but i'd love to but lou who i have um you know when you think about cancer metabolism today i mean it's just a booming field right i mean i i would argue and no disrespect to people in different fields but that cancer metabolism and immunotherapy are really two of the most promising and exciting areas in the field today which were two things we didn't have a single word about in medical school right yeah that's uh absolutely true except maybe some anti-metabolites for cancer hidden somewhere in the pharmacology book you know but but um yeah i think you know one of the most exciting things is going to be the interface of those two fields also and we see this with you know microbiome composition being predictive of whether immunotherapy works amazing work from jennifer wargo showing that you know fiber can promote the effectiveness of immunotherapy and so we're seeing that connection also soluble or insoluble yeah tbd okay so we're very excited to work on that answer and then you know um there are different flavors of soluble fiber and so i have my pet dreams for how this may work mechanistically but i i think it's going to be an incredibly important interface wow so tell folks a little bit about what it is about cancer cells that makes their metabolism distinct from their non-cancer counterparts but within the same tissue even like if you want to compare adenocarcinoma of the colon or breast or prostate and look at the perfectly normal non-cancer cell sitting right next to it i mean we we typically talk about two hallmarks of cancer right we talk about the inability to respond to cell cycle signaling so this is why these silly things just keep growing even when they're told stop growing and then the capacity to metastasize to basically pick up leave go grow grow grow in a new site um but what is it about them metabolically that also uh is a piece of their signature well cancers tend to be glucose users and you know once you step back and think that you know in the fasted state in particular using glucose is a a weird thing rather than a default thing okay and that the default thing is to use fat and lactate then the fact that cancer uses glucose is very distinctive and they do this in large part because they're programmed internally to basically feel like they're always seeing insulin and this is through mutations and something called the pi3 kinase pathway the lou cantley who you mentioned you know pioneered and this leads the fact they're positive on this fdg pet scan so they'll constantly take up and phosphorylate and trap glucose or glucose analogs and is actually the most sensitive way to detect most types of cancer downstream from this though there's a ton of metabolic changes in the cancer cells and you know the most fundamental of these is the fact that in order to do the uncontrolled growth they have to do uncontrolled nucleic acid synthesis and this is the vulnerability that was targeted initially by farber but has been targeted by a lot of very important medications that are you know widely used still today you know pematrex is first-line treatment for lung cancer and if you get these medications right you can induce mutations through you know the metabolic stress on the nucleotide system and this can make immunotherapy work better and so that's a very exciting part and i think that part has gotten understudied as cancer metabolism has you know returned to the fore there's been a lot of focus on fuel usage cut off which is tough because like most cells in the body cancer cells can use a lot of different types of fuels depending on what's available yeah this is an important point josh because a lot of people i think would hear the first part of what you're saying and their natural conclusion would be well wait a minute if you know you do a pet scan on somebody and it lights up with glucose that tells me cancer loves glucose ergo the way to treat cancer don't eat glucose the problem with that logic is no matter how little glucose you eat you still have plenty of glucose in your circulation i mean even if you're in a complete state of starvation again going back to george cahill 40 days of starvation they still had three millimole of glucose in their circulation 40 days out so there is no way to eliminate glucose now an argument could be but you're going to minimize insulin so i guess the question becomes is minimizing insulin actually more important than minimizing glucose but the idea of starving cancer seems potentially overly simplistic right based on everything we've already talked about yeah i think starving cancer is very very hard as you say getting circulating glucose to go meaningfully down below you know the healthy 89 where you last measured yourself is very very difficult and even if you could do that it's not going to prevent the cancers from having access to internally stored fuel for a while in the form of glycogen and then ultimately to amino acid fuel and fat fuel and lactate fuel ketone body fuel and we've shown very clearly that cancer can use all of those things okay so they're they're all valid inputs they can't replace glucose in the test tube but you know it's not easy to cut off the cancer fuel supply especially not without cutting off some other critical fuel supply the immune cell fuel supply right which would be a disaster or the brain fuel supply which would be an even more acute disaster this idea that there's a way to exploit the metabolic i don't want to say limitation but i would just say quirk of cancer in a way that also augments the immune system say a bit more about that because that's both fascinating intellectually but also elegant in that it's mechanistically in line with a bias i have which is cancer is really going to be hard to you know get under control so you know hoping for a stalemate where you use multiple modes of action is probably a better strategy than hitting really hard on one lever again it's a bias of mine but you know at least i can acknowledge it yeah well i think we're seeing a lot of moves to try to make cancer into a chronic disease where the therapies are not so terrible and you know certainly hitting the nucleic acid side of cancer is when people are trying for you know maintenance therapy and i think we need to think about that whole side of cancer metabolism fresh because i think there are targets waiting to be developed there i think you know if they create nucleotide imbalances which is a natural thing to do when you hit that system then nucleotide imbalances are drivers of mutations and mutations in cancer cells are drivers of immune response to cancer so that's one very appealing avenue so in other words interrupt their ability to synthesize dna they will create more mutations more mutations is more shots on goal for the immune system exactly so i think that's one really exciting avenue another exciting avenue is to apply a very strong stress to the cancer while putting pressure on their fuel supply and so i think it's very hard to think that you're going to put so much pressure on the fuel supply okay that that alone is going to make the tumor slow or even more optimistically regress or something but if you come in with chemotherapy for example that's already targeted preferentially not perfectly right to the tumor and then you pair that with something like ketogenic diet which is lowering insulin lowering glucose then we at least see in animal models that this can be a very powerful combination we see that the tumors start to deplete glucose in response to chemotherapy whether that's because their vasculature is breaking down or whether that's because they have height in glucose demand because they're having mitochondrial damage from the chemotherapy i'm not sure but we see that chemotherapy lowers glucose in the tumor intrinsically and then if you come in with a diet that lowers glucose availability this becomes stronger all right and then you can get to really low tumor glucose and we see pretty big improvements in outcome in mouse experiments hopefully they'll translate to the clinic we have a clinical trial open on this now and what's the best tool we have besides the conventional and maybe it is simply the conventional in terms of ways to interfere with their nucleic acid this is synthesis is it literally just going back to old-school chemotherapeutics that do that well for the moment right yes i mean for the moment pematrexit is probably the most successful clinical agent but you know gemcitabine and you know other things of this sort are you know all well used as part of the armamentarium but i think we need to think fresh i mean i'll say on this front it's really interesting to me that when we were in medical school you know i thought we would not see a cure in our lifetimes for hepatitis yeah and look at that right now and look at that and that was mainly numerous i mean i remember being told like there are two things that are absolutely because i remember talking about this as why can't there be a vaccine for hep c and it's like you you'll never be able to vaccinate a flavy virus okay well that still turns out to be true but you'll never cure hep c and yeah lo and behold and this is just nucleoside analogs as the centerpiece of this right and so the fact that there's clearly untapped potential there now maybe that potential was maxed out you know 40 years ago you know when people were doing this hardcore for cancer from the cancer but not hepatitis perspective but but my guess is that that's all chemistry that's evolved a lot and this is a ripe area for for rediscovery well it's interesting you mentioned gemcitabine because of course that's you know one of the first line agents for pancreatic cancer and if i'm not mistaken you have a particularly keen clinical interest in pancreatic adenocarcinoma is that correct yeah it's the cancer that i've worked on the most uh it's obviously just a horrible disease you know it's definitely one of the cancers that gives cancer a bad name it's um it's the fourth leading cause of cancer death in both men and women and yet by incidents it's a fraction of that right it's it just speaks to how lethal it is um you know the last time i looked josh i would say that adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is 95 lethal and i've heard people argue that the five percent who don't die are misdiagnosed almost suggesting that it's pretty much impossible to survive pancreatic cardiocarcinoma which is the worst thought in the world um so you certainly picked a tough one to study yeah i mean i i feel a very strong commitment to it because of a bunch of reasons and you know but the just the fact that it's so terrible is a motivation and i think it's you know was a disease that for a long time people it's just so terrible we just give up and you know i don't think that's the right attitude for terrible diseases and you know i think the one of the hardest things in making biomedical progress is getting a clinical readout and you know the hidden positive and how terrible this disease is is the clinical readout is just sitting there itching to be improved and so there's the capacity to do really compelling clinical tests of any idea and it's a terrible disease most of these uh you know clinical efforts are going to fail but they can be done relatively fast relatively cost effectively and we're seeing progress i mean that's what's so exciting that you know fulfilling ox is progress a lot of patients tumors respond even more will respond if you combine two agents that were approved gem cytobean and abraxane which is a albumin bound form of paclitaxel with a platinum agent that triple combination uh produces uh regressions in most patients tumors um but they're not durable i mean that's they're not durable okay the duration of response is terrible right now but the fact there's response is promise okay and i think in the anyway normally from my perspective once you can start seeing response you're on the road we have to figure out how to make the response durable i hope that's where the metabolic part becomes important it's going to be some interface of the metabolic part or the immune part or a yet harder hit with you know chemo radiotherapy earlier diagnosis these are the hopes for for fixing this is there something about pancreatic adenocarcinoma that you've observed metabolically that is distinct from other gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas i think you know colon is also a terrible disease liver is also a terrible disease so all the gastrointestinal you know adenocarcinomas are unfortunately really bad diseases but at least with those stage one can be i mean certainly stage one colorectal cancer is survivable hepatocellular is a bit tougher you know you're but you're better than a coin toss but you know again coming back to pancreatic stage one is 80 to 85 percent not survivable i've always wondered what is it about pancreatic adenocarcinoma that is so difficult and is it simply that its rate of early metastasis is so early that stage one is just sort of as a misnomer term it's not there's no such thing as stage one i i think that's a big part of it it's kind of a soft organ the pancreas and you get the it's a very um invasive cancer and you can have local invasions so many places from that site plus immediate access to the portal system that's just seeding the liver it's just seeding the liver and so it's in an anatomically a really problematic location for keeping the cancer self-contained so um i think the other thing is that you know metabolically it's a very tricky cancer it's almost solely driven by mutations of the ras oncogene not saying there aren't other drivers but almost every patient has this ras driver and this is an instruction manual for the cancer cells not just to divide but to do a bunch of metabolic things that involve scavenging nutrients from the environment and taking in nutrients in non-standard ways and so it actually instructs the cancer cells to reach out arms pull in nutrients internalize them degrade macromolecule nutrients from the environment and use this as kind of a garbage recycling form of nutrient access that that makes them very metabolically pernicious the other thing that we see that's really interesting in new work and mouse models of pancreatic cancer is that they don't have to be very metabolically active in order to be horribly lethal so the pancreas is a master protein producing organ and then you may think of insulin is the most famous protein to come out of the pancreas right but the bulk of the pancreas is not you know beta cells that make it insulin that's only five percent of it yeah that's right the exocrine is the real gland and the exocrine pancreas is just making digestive enzymes like crazy it does by far the fastest protein synthesis in the body the cancer turns that protein synthesis way down so it's not hyper metabolic it's just that it has this huge capacity to make stuff that even when it turns it down still has enough biosynthetic capacity to grow and divide and grow and divide because it's turned down its main energy-consuming normal function of protein synthesis it can function with much reduced tca activity reduced atp synthesis rates and so it's amazing it's very efficient then very very efficient so it can turn down all these normal functions and it still has the capacity to reproduce the cells and make these horribly invasive and metastatic cells which are ultimately lethal of all the epithelial cancers today for which we don't have a cure which is almost every one of them right shy of like a gist or something like that or certain testicular cancers is there one that you're more optimistic about in terms of metabolic approaches to therapy it's a great question um i mean you you see pemetrexed being used effectively in lung cancer right and i think you see the cancers with mutational burdens um being the ones where you're getting the good uh immunotherapy responses whether they're ones that are particularly susceptible intrinsically to metabolic effects i don't know i don't think that's going to be the standalone heart of treating any of these cancers i think it's more going to be a key piece of the puzzle in getting enough either drug killing by preventing their metabolic escape mechanisms or enough immune activity and those may be kind of opposites so you may need also kind of cyclic therapies where you go through rounds of metabolic suppression in order to keep things calm while you can and then periods of metabolic augmentation that are really directed at augmenting the immune system uh and i'm i'm a big believer that you know there's metabolic limitations on immune response to cancer and that if we can overcome them we will have major therapeutic benefits you know you mentioned ras in the context of pancreatic carcinoma ras is rarely immunogenic in the pancreas right it's it's it's a driver mutation but the immune system doesn't produce back to the way we started our discussion it doesn't give us a beautiful little nine to 11 amino acid peptide it gets presented on an mhc class molecule right so it's a great irony of this whole thing yeah you need more shots on goal you need more antigens do you have any sense of how many tumor infiltrating lymphocytes are typically identified at all in resected pancreatic specimens i think it's typically quite the lymphocyte desert and there's a ton of macrophage activity in pancreatic cancer and so i think macrophage rewiring is going to be you know a big part of allowing lymphocytes to enter and these are areas where i think metabolism can be quite impactful well josh this is a super interesting i i hate that we're ending on somewhat a depressing note is there is there anything more optimistic that we want to talk about than pancreatic adenocarcinoma beyond you know the statement that hey look you know this is why we have the smartest people working on the hardest problems but um anything else within cancer metabolism specifically that you think boy 10 years from now like i'm really optimistic that we're going to have a new way to you know hack into their dna synthesis pathway in a corrupt manner that just spits out mutations um using kind of novel systems right you know i don't know if and against antisense oligonucleotides like just something that totally disrupts them in a selective manner you know i i think my big hope on this front is that we're going to be able to have some combination of directed metabolic immune supplements and diet that really work with therapy to treat cancer i mean cancer is such a discrete disease the clinical trials are so manageable and the fact that things are metabolically messed up in the tumors so incredibly clear and they're so clearly messed up in a way that's favoring the wrong kind of immune cells and so ultimately through either some sort of supplement or diet we're going to be able to reverse that and we're going to make immunotherapy work instead of for 10 of patients for a majority of patients so that's my uplifting thought for you is that metabolism will be part along with you know you know better pure immunological therapies of getting immune control of cancer over the coming decade and besides reducing insulin which is such an obvious strategy are there other metabolic levers to pull with the diet because really between ketogenic diets and cyclic fasting those are kind of the two ways that you do that do you see evidence of amino acid restriction or any other nutrient restriction that could potentially play a role i i think amino acids are you know complicated but they hold a lot of potential i think the type of fat can be important um you know the saturated unsaturated fat are really different and in cancer they're going to play you know different roles so it's very nice work from matt vanderheiden's lab showing that you know a higher saturated fat ketogenic diet could be more tumor suppressive in some contexts because the tumors have trouble making unsaturated fat in the context of hypoxia say more about that i wasn't aware of that so matt i know matt's worked very well of course is is he still at uh dana farber uh he's at the coke at mit so he's actually head of the the coke now okay this was oh i forget what cancer background he did it and i think it was in pancreatic at least in part but i'm not 100 sure okay so that's super interesting so a ketogenic diet that was higher in saturated fat posed a greater problem for the cancer cells because they couldn't make presumably the essential unsaturated fats exactly so i think this is a interesting strategy i mean those effects were relatively subtle up to now but you know it could be part of the picture um you know i think the really exciting part of the diet is also the parts that connect to the microbiome so i think the fiber part really working that out and maybe total protein matters in ways that we don't understand and needs to be much like you know maybe we need to not just think about cycling fasting and feeding but cycling you know for example there's a time maybe when you want to come in with a lot of carbs in the absence of protein and that may achieve something that creates a particular immune milia and then you know you need protein in the right timing after that so there's a lot of things we can do with timing of macronutrients that can be interesting and it seems like an eternity before we'd be ready to study this in a human clinical trial because the permutations are so many so do you feel like we have high throughput animal models where we can test these hypotheses and say you know hey this is one way to do this and um you know or we we've looked at 10 ways to do this in animals but these are the three most promising so we're going to kind of go ahead and do these now yeah i think you know the good animal models of cancer are still not that high throughput and there's a lot of challenges converting animal diet yeah and human diet right and so um you know we'll we'll come out with some work showing that you know some of the most exciting dietary combinations are absolutely effective in animals but they're not effective through the mechanisms that people thought before and it's you know it's because the even in animals trying to get the diets aligned so that you really isolate variables is tough but i i think the fact that we're asking these questions that haven't been asked before is going to build momentum and uh we're going to we're going to build this interface out over the next five year period in animals and we'll do clinical work you know as a field in parallel with that that has an impact and has an impact on patients lives within the five to ten year timeline i hope do you worry that the challenges of even if you came up with the right diet so let's just assume 10 years from now the answer is a cyclic ketogenic diet that has this much saturated fat this much monounsaturated fat this much polyunsaturated fat this much glucose on this day this much protein on that day like you that the formula exists right so this is almost an impossible thing but that it's impossible to adhere to in the way that you know a pill or a drug or an infusion is much easier or do you think that in cancer because the stakes are so high adherence will be unlike it is in any other field of medicine no we have to make it simple right i mean this has to be clinically um actionable and but you know i would go much more back to the first question that we asked you asked maybe when i first mentioned the potential of immunotherapy and fiber like is it soluble fiber is it insoluble fiber and then there really are different flavors of soluble fiber now maybe it's the gamish of them or maybe it's one in particular maybe it's one isolated bowl molecule that relates to that and then we have one isolated molecule tiny molecule that will more than double the number of complete responses you get to immunotherapy and mice one tiny molecule smaller than glucose okay we already have that as a as a metabolite okay and so i think we're going to get uh too it could almost be nutritional supplements supplements the dietary changes may be in a very acute way just the way the patient comes in the hospital for a you know tough about a chemotherapy or a tough surgery maybe we're going to go to a place where we take people's glucose in the hospital almost down to zero for 12 hours you know with a deep ketosis and some pharmacotherapy at the time that we hit them really hard with chemo and 24 hours of that it's like like night and day in terms of the overall effect but it can't be asking patients to give up eating and giving up the joy of food or another trial that we're starting now as a trial with sglt2 inhibitor plus a low carbohydrate but not fully ketogenic diet to see if it can put people in ketosis and then just looking forward to would this be a convenient way to get the benefits of ketosis in cancer patients while still allowing them to have a little bit of you know breaking bread with the family last question for you is totally random i don't know what maybe just think of this princeton is the only ivy league school that doesn't have a medical school correct i think that's right is there i mean that there's got to be a deliberate reason for that it has it's princeton is fantastic in everything do you know why it doesn't have a medical school and um is it just the proximity to pen or that it was assumed that there that's where the collaborations would be i mean princeton doesn't have a medical school because at its heart princeton is a hybrid of a college and a university and it is an institution that you know has the ultimate priority under undergraduate education uh it's um committed to that it's best in world in that and so i think in assessing how to be best in world at undergraduate education the princeton administration many times has asked the question is having medicine on campus part of that and the answer has always been no let's have a somewhat more pure intellectual environment and keep our focus on doing the very best training for undergraduates and so it doesn't have a business school either and i guess it's the same argument right there's no business school there's no law school so uh that's princeton uh it makes it very special and it's good to have special places that are you know distinct i think that's a wonderful thing are you at all a fan of richard feynman's work at a very uh light level i guess i would say that's the best way to put it but it doesn't there aren't places around princeton that you go to see where you know he you know what eating club he was in or things like that you don't you don't uh you don't look for the old places no i i i'm not i'm not a fan that way i guess they're um i read the giant biography of oppenheimer and they're filming uh the film of that on campus so matt damon was apparently on campus i i guessing he's playing oppenheimer but i haven't checked anyway so but i guess i've become a small op and higher fan after reading reading that intensive book i have uh three of feynman's books uh meaning like books that were actually his so i have uh his table of integrals from when he was in high school and then two more advanced calculus books one from when he was at princeton and then one from when he was his first professorship professorship at cornell um and that it's just they're sacred to me right it's like his scribblings like his notes all over these things signed richard p fineman and like what you know what his address was and things like that so uh yeah i've never uh i've never made the pilgrimage to to look for his eating club and things like that it probably doesn't even exist anymore but i just wondered if you'd been the been on the tour no but you should come down there definitely have been some uh you know awesome princetonians uh you know i guess my kids all went to nursery school in the building where von neumann built the first computer so you know there's it is amazing the amount of stuff that happened around here well josh so great to see you again and i hope it's not too long before i see you in person again but really appreciate uh first of all the amazing work that you've done over the past 20 plus years and uh and sitting down to share it with us today it's been fun i appreciate the opportunity [Music] you
