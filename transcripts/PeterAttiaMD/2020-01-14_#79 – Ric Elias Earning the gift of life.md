## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something

[00:02:13] I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:17] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription

[00:03:58] I guess this week is Rick Elias Rick is a dear friend and got to meet him in 2013 I had seen his TED talk which at the time was and to this day remains my favorite TED talk of all time and I was speaking at Ted mad someone there knew what a fan I was of Rick and a few minutes following my talk introduced me to Rick and it sort of became a love at first sight he is someone I consider a dear friend an amazing mentor and this podcast is really an opportunity to allow me I guess to through a discussion with Rick share so much of Rick's wisdom with all of you as listeners we begin our discussion by talking about the day that would change

[00:04:41] Rick's life forever but we also go a lot deeper then after we finished recording this podcast you know Rick said man I have never been pushed so far and so deep into what really happened and transpired that day and how it had impacted my life so I'm honored that we were able to have that discussion and that he was able to sort of trust me enough to share so much so broadly I don't think there's much more honestly that I need to say about this there's so many things that we talked about that go beyond surviving this plane crash we talked a lot about Rick's incredible role as a CEO of an enormous company his remarkable work in philanthropy but I think it's just better that you hear this one from the horse's mouth so without further delay I hope you enjoy my conversation with my dear friend recognize Rick thank you so much for making time I know you're super busy this week but your office was able to coordinate us getting together I was delighted it is so much fun to be with you today Peter Emma each fan of your podcast and we're dear friends so when you asked me to be on it I was on her a lot of people have heard me talk about you I wrote a blog post I don't know probably five years ago about how your

[00:05:51] TED talk was at the time and actually still remains my favorite TED talk of all time it's a very short talk and I'm sure for folks who haven't heard it yet we'll make sure we link to it but I can't resist starting with that story so let's just put the profundity niceties aside and just go straight to it

[00:06:08] Thursday January 15 2009 you're in New York City why were you here I was here because one of our partners DirecTV at the time was here and I was having lunch with the CMO the night before I had dinner with a good friend of mine and was having a couple small meetings in the morning and then I was flying home to coach my son's basketball team when I landed in Charlotte the flight was going from LaGuardia to Charlotte how many times did you take that shuttle that flight that's probably a common for a hundred times you know do you remember having breakfast that morning I went to play hoops and the Reba Club on the Upper East Side and it was a cold morning and it was snowing big flakes and I chose to walk because it was so beautiful how would you describe your life at that point in time how big was red ventures your company we had about 700 employees we've gone in this really nice growth spurt after really struggling the first four years we started in 2000 so we were doing really well but we were at risk of too bad things happening and not having a business so there was this kind of constant juxtaposition of this is not gonna last actually fill our employees enjoy the good ol days they won't last forever and they were annoyed by me saying that but it was the reminder that this was very fleeting would you have described yourself as a happy person like how would people describe Rick back then you know generally I'm a very positive person I'd like to think that

[00:07:34] I've lived through a lot of great things in my life some that have actually happened that's how I see where all them since I was a kid that's it I was super stressed and I was trying to build abysus so that we could tell it and I could go do other things in life your kids at the time were how old my daughter was in first grade my son was in second grade and so how were you thinking about balancing the incredible stress of running a 700 person company the travel that comes with that and then being the dad being the coach being the husband was that balance did it feel in balance to you looking back he was completely out of balance and it was I kind of rationalized myself around quality over quantity and I would literally tuck myself into at least I'm coaching my son or I was like many of us are doing those stages just really taxed mentally and my wife really carried the burden of raising our kids and I look back on it and it was 95 five when it should have been a different number geez yeah 95 5

[00:08:40] I can relate you were staying at a hotel that morning when you got up and then remember the hotel that was in the upper East because the basketball in the morning which it was priority like running a basket for 5:30 a.m. run which is great this is pre uber I'm guessing yeah mm so you probably took a taxi LaGuardia if you remember anything about your transit from getting through security getting on that plane anything about it it was hard given that it's such a routine for you yes I do remember because of that impact everything around it becomes kind of much more real but it's a wacky story I remember I was a little early which I never was and I went and got a soft-serve ice cream at McDonald's and I worked out really high that morning and that was the only place where I did this and you know I think that'll change at all eating area but I'm making love to this ice cream it just stays so freakin good I'm literally just enjoying my vanilla ice cream while I wait for whatever an hour for my flight and I started walking to the gate and it was so good that I turned around and when I had another one which I never done I can relate to that as well by the way although soft-serve ice cream isn't a particularly miss of mine but there are other Airport weaknesses I have trail mix is my airport weakness that's why you look the way you do in the way I look I don't know I would say the ice cream is probably no worse for you than the trail so they call you guys to board on the plane you're sitting at the front of the plane yeah it was a really kind of crappy there he was gray was cold it was we're kind of gone out of snow and rain so it was not the most pleasant day in New York so I boarded I was in first class so we board it first and I remember sitting in my seat and kind of processing okay here's all the stuff I got to do on the plane as soon as I land

[00:10:28] I got to do this and they want to come back and I think brain is super busy just thinking about the non never ending list of things to accomplish you listening to music or anything you know I'm not I'm just sitting there kind of vegging a little bit just thinking about life so 2009 we would have been sort of third generation iPhone and Blackberry were probably the dominant things which one were you using I had just switched literally like two days before so you're on like an early iPhone I'm early - and then the first row so you can't have a bag and there your legs they have to go up and so I'm sitting there and it was a little bit of a slow departing I think because of the weather things kind of back out I'm this afternoon it was number 230 or something like that and I remember kind of dozing you know the plane puts you to sleep and I was kind of going in and out of that as a plane took off and I was very cognizant when we kind of took off

[00:11:20] I was kind of in and out of consciousness right when we took off how long after the takeoff do you know something is not right so about three minutes I think we're about 4,500 feet up or something like that there's a massive explosion like a pipe bomb and this was ten years after September 11th but it's still September 11th and for all of us who lived through that and I had the really lucky seat because I can see the flight attendant kind of kitty-corner I looked at her we were still flying we were horizontal and I looked at her and she was calm her eyes were calm and

[00:11:59] I was like okay we probably lost an engine and for the next couple minutes Peter all you could hear was the engine struggling clawed like there was trying to restart it when she'd go look at the transcript that's where they were doing there was a really nasty smell going into the cabin so it smelled like a really high burnt yeah burnt like burned and kind of not he had turned the plane pretty quickly we were heading back into New York and my mind I'm like okay I'm not coaching today the flight attendants eyes told me all I had to hear which is is there gonna be a long travel day so when you're leaving

[00:12:35] LaGuardia you're up and circling around so you're sort of over Queens yes and you shouldn't be coming back over Manhattan right correct right correct so what do you see out the window I am in the irony so I'm not really seeing out the window necessarily I'm just literally for this two minutes just going like wow this is really bizarre I got to figure out who the coaches practice for my son I mean you know that's all I was thinking about was the next sign that something was wrong the reduction in sound in the cabin so about 90 seconds before we hit down so two minutes pass of this of the engine trying to restart right and then captain

[00:13:14] Sullenberger gets on the voice system for the first time and he only says three words he says brace for impact at the same time they turn off the struggling engines and he lines up the plane with the Hudson River you and I have been here long enough funny enough that it's no runway right at the end of a hunter River so I knew in that moment a hundred percent with certainty that we were gonna die I looked at the flight attendants eyes and he was no longer annoyance he was complete terror I didn't know this but in airline speak that means we're not landing at an airport and all of this happened in 90 seconds from when you to minutes so there's a two minutes from hitting to when he does that and then there's 90 seconds as he's gliding the plane down that you literally you're now at the very top of

[00:14:06] Manhattan when this happened all the way up yeah and you have 90 seconds to basically say goodbye to your life what is really unique about that experience is you are a hundred percent certain you're gonna die if anything I was saying to myself please blow up I don't want this to break him 50 pieces and drown in this cold water so you're kind of playing all this things out and you are just realizing that there's no suffering so you're not burning or drowning or something that wouldn't make it different but you have 90 seconds to say you don't know what that end is like do you I mean it's not to get to morbid but if I were in that situation I wouldn't actually understand what the end is I just seen enough documentaries to know that planes on land on water yeah they break into a million pieces they say spiral I didn't know how but I know what was gonna happen and at this point it's silent in the cockpit or are people screaming it was more silent than screaming I'm first Road so I can hear a ton and you go in to imagine the amount of adrenaline that is going through your system as you are literally trapped to your death for 90 seconds did you think

[00:15:15] I have time to make one phone call hey you know my phone your phone is up top yeah it was very cleansing I look back and I was raised Catholic so first thing that crosses my mind is like okay I'm not a practicing Catholic but you can repent and also to get things could happen right and I asked myself that question am I gonna do something that I I've chosen not to believe in this part of my life and I didn't and I said I'm not a hypocrite it may be meaning I'm going to live with the choices I've made yes which was interesting for me too after my relationship with religion and so forth but it was very powerful 90 seconds because the most important thing

[00:15:56] I realized was well this all changed in an instant I thought I had years and now it's all of how old were you I'm not there I was 42 how old are you 46 yeah I thought we tend to believe we're gonna live forever and it will all change in an instant and there was I really had a ton of regret about the things that I did not get to things experiences people

[00:16:22] I needed to ask for forgiveness from people I wanted to say again I love you people wanted to hug one more time and you're like wow it all changed and then there's no going back and there's no turning that back and that was one emotion the other emotion and also around regret was really how much I had allow my ego to become very active in my life and how I spent so much time in being wronged by people or just spending so much time trying to be right versus choosing to be happy I realized wow I've lived my life in a very wasteful way because so much of my energy has been spent on things that did not matter with people that did they think about all the fights you've had with pick your wife you don't even remember 90 you know 30 days later what you thought about yet you were so passionate about it you matter yeah you know and then the last kind of regret because that's what it felt like was this notion that I had not focused in the thing that matters most in my life I inherently knew that my most important responsibility was to make sure my kids were the best versions of themselves and I had completely delegated that to my wife in a very unfair way and I have prioritized not just work but just everything else and so those were regrets and I literally thought about all that but you know what was really interesting Peter dying to me was not scary I've always thought he would be a scary moment it was super sad because I didn't want to go I really liked my life

[00:17:59] I really wasn't done I had lots of regrets but it was not scary and that in itself also has been clarifying for me had you spoken or have you since spoken about this with the other people on the flight and do you know if any of them felt that I have not I have not I had so much support when I landed on love and all that I kind of stayed within my realm of comfort and then immediately after there were all sorts of things books and lawsuits and this and it all felt so disingenuous to me the US

[00:18:31] Airways send us a check for $10,000 and I refuse to I've seen your chat you've seen it it's sitting in jaywalkers library yes yeah it's you probably the only person that didn't cash that check you know what and just bad karma checking it's not the right thing no matter how big it would have been a million bucks I would have not cashed it

[00:18:52] I was given the ultimate gift and the ultimate gift was to say goodbye to your life to close your eyes to touch your own arm say I love you to wish for it to blow up and to open your eyes and realize that you had a second chance as the plane is coming down do you see the George Washington Bridge can you see it oh yeah I saw it more as we were going over it and you can see the cars at a scaly close place like literally we you see cars in a level you never see them in an airplane okay I want to see the level of detail detail again we almost took on that bridge I don't have you seen the movie but if he chooses to go to Teterboro we take out a bunch of buildings he literally made all this calculations that he didn't have enough thrust to get there and he said the only chance I have is to go in the water and then you will relate to this story because I know the struggle or your internal fight against Authority when it is not well-placed and we've talked a lot about this so when he communicates to the tower and said I'm going in the water and the tower goes like please repeat because they can't understand then him basically he was done with protocol he's like I'm gonna do my best to try to land this thing there's all sorts of mathematical equations here thing and we landed I think at 151 miles an hour or something like that if we air one 453 we blow up at 149 we tip the wind was like 12 and a half miles an hour's at 14 this came like there were so many things that had to be within such a small degree all compounding into a moment that you can land a cylinder with 158 people full of gas that's like hitting cement yeah I just know that from sort of the literature on people who jump off bridges and into water and when you jump off the Golden

[00:20:43] Gate Bridge which is something like 220 feet up much lower than where you guys are coming from it is like hitting cement and the only people who survived that jump are generally people who land exactly feet first they end up breaking most bones they break every bone in their feet ankles compress the spine but at least they don't pivot land sideways have a rib tear through their liver or something awful like that so yeah it's like a cement a wet cement landing I don't know if I've ever told you the story but about five years ago I met a guy through a friend we were in Houston and the three of us were having dinner and somehow it came up that this guy was in a helicopter crash he was the only one that survived there was a pilot three maybe three or four other people in the helicopter and him and there was a technical malfunction in the helicopter I don't remember exactly what it was but it was one of those things where it was clear they were crashing and it was clear they were all gonna die

[00:21:38] I mean helicopters just looked like the most unstable things when they're out of control and interestingly it was about the same length of time he had about two minutes of crashing and he hadn't heard of you so he hadn't seen your TED talk after the fact he did of course I directed him to it and what blew my mind Rick was the similarity in the way he described that two minutes he said he said Peter you'll think this is crazy but I just wasn't afraid to die but boy was I sad he was about your age he was probably 40 when this happened he was hurt in the crash I mean he broke both his legs I mean he was again the only survivor but walk with his life I'll never forget that how he explained something about not being afraid but just being so sad yeah makes me wonder how many other people on that plane would echo that same thought obvious I can't relate so I don't know what that means I feel like I'd be afraid but I'm looking at a man who's been through it and tells me that that's not what he felt it was blood or lucky ticket so when did you close your eyes how far do you think you were above the water you know when you fly a lot you can almost sense when you're gonna hit even if you're dozing off you feel the ground coming right so in about ten seconds left I can feel the countdown in my system and ten nine and that's when I grabbed my arm and I said I love you why don't you do that I think I've had a sense of needing comfort as you exit life I probably there was probably a lot of acceptance in that statement subconsciously prior to that were you someone who struggled with loving yourself were you hard on yourself no

[00:23:16] I've my many issues that's not one of them in fact that's interesting I'm very hard on myself I wonder if I would even have the foresight to think that it's a beautiful sentiment mmm what was the sound like it was he puts the tail and then kind of the nose just jams so it was a violin accident and then we skipped to the left I have my eyes closed I opened my eyes and I am completely disorienting because I'm expecting to being upside down like if I left my eyes open I think I would have been much more oriented and it took me a split second to realize that this look like a cruise ship yeah this plane sitting on the water kind of all around this when your eyes open the plane is still moving I don't remember I don't I don't think so I think I come to a stop or close to coming to a stop was there any part of you that thought this is death I'm dead this is an afterlife this is sort of a few circuits firing in what remains of my central nervous system but I'm actually dead like I mean I again what what is it didn't to me you would think that would be a very realistic it just was so quick right that it was confused it was unusual you know when you have zero probability or something and it happens you're like did that really happen and immediately we went into kind of holy cow we got to get out of here do you have a moment of realizing what has happened or do you immediately shift into business mode of okay now it's an emergency excavation now it's like all that stuff that nobody pays attention to and the plane is taking off the slide how does the slide work who takes the door off how many doors are there where is the nearest or all that stuff you guys go right into that mode and is it orderly is it chaotic are people screaming clapping crying what's happening that plane was not equipped for water that's why people were standing on the wings not on rafts I don't understand what it says if you look yeah here's wraps yeah but in the coach section there were no rafts because that plane was not supposed to go over water so that's why nothing deploy when you open those emergency doors only you can stand on the wings I thought every plane had that know if the plane had landed on the east side there's not the ferries and the hustle and bustle of where we landed that thing was taking water they evacuated the people from the wing because we were sinking so there were so many things there were a bunch of ferries around us as soon as we landed so you never felt like we were not going to be safe in that regard but on the esight I think it would have been different how cold was the water do you remember the feeling it was very cool but adrenaline takes over so it's only cold after what's it called in the moment and I'll tell you a story that I have really not shared with many people I think it we just had tired from whooping and staying out late and working and all this stuff and eating so much sugar beforehand the plane I'm kind of comatose sitting there on my seat as people are boarding late in the boarding process that elderly lady in a wheelchair in her is coming down the ramp and my voice inside of me and I've done this before says get up give up your seat and go sit in coach I'm 65 but you know what's the right thing to do and then I'm like I'm tired you know it's not a long fly and I'm being completely selfish and then her daughter's behind the person that is helping the lady I'm out there's two of them we can't do it and

[00:26:45] I'm pretty sure this guy won't give the secret so I rationalized myself to being completely selfish so once we are in the rafts and I know that this elderly lady's in the back of the plane I start freaking out because I know she can't walk so I start screaming where's the lady where's the lady we're in the raft and by the way it was really interesting in the raft and our side some people were completely frozen they couldn't understand anything some people were panicking in the raft and then there was a handful of us or like okay let's problem-solve and eventually the older lady comes to the front of the plane they bring him because they got to put her in a raft and I grab her and I'm sitting there and she's completely traumatized by this and I'm just thinking about oh my goodness my last act would have been one of my most selfish acts it was an interesting emotion and then when we got to the ferry we had to climb about 10 steps everybody evacuated I'm the bigger guy

[00:27:41] I'm saying I'll bring this lady up the guys were trying to hold her Peter I think something crazy happened as I'm going up this frozen ladder with no gloves no anything no jacket and I'm holding her basically in my chest my hand slips I was within a split-second of dropping and eighty-year-old in the water and I grabbed and it was a very all of this is happening can this woman as soon as I got to the top of the boat and she was safe we were all say I started crying like the river of emotion was insane what about others did they experience that I mean I'm guessing that different people are processing this at totally different speeds there are probably still people who don't actually understand what has happened it sounds like you've moved you're in post-processing on some level are you talking amongst each other no everybody as soon as one of the people on the ferry I grabbed the phone I really wanted to call my wife by then she was at the pediatrician with the kids and her sister called Aaron goes where's

[00:28:53] Rick and she's like he's coming from New York she goes turn the TV on and Brenda turned the TV and she thought that we all had died so she's crying at the patricians the kids are screaming and I call from a random number and as she tells the story she thinks at the police saying hey your husband died right Randy right number uh and I call and I say honey I'm okay and like she screams he's alive he's alive and it's a completely confused they just lost their bodies alive even so everybody were passing on this phone and all of that where was the crew at this time so most people ended up on the New York side some people ended up in the New Jersey side I ended up in the New York side and

[00:29:36] I think was Pier 42 and my guess is the crew is the last to get off the plane they have to make sure everybody's off and I'm guessing Sully is the last of the last a hundred percent and he ends up I'll tell you a quick story on Sully so we end up in by the way New York is an amazing city in so many ways yeah if something's gonna go wrong this is the city to have it happen you're gonna the best rescue you got believable the first responders by the time we got to the pier there were letters hot chocolate waiting for the Red Cross and all there were priests and rabbis and everybody and their kind and like it was amazing like we're sitting there and they're interviewing everybody because they don't know if I'll play whatever write them before they release anybody they need to interview everybody three hours later they release they start putting us in buses to take us to a hotel and

[00:30:21] Captain Sullenberger standing there what it looked like fully dressed stoic probably contemplating what in the world just happened and I went up to him there was nobody around him and I went out there parent said captain I didn't know his name I said thank you for saving our lives and Peter he said something to me that day that I say to myself all the time when someone thanks me for something I don't say it out loud much you know what he said to me he said I was just doing my job can you imagine if we all just kind of did our jobs at every level that really shocked me that that was his process so they put us on a bus and the media's there and all of the hot and we get to the hotel and there's food and they were amazing and they're like okay you want a hotel the Train is tomorrow and many people lived here and I looked at the lady and I said I need to get on the next flight at what time it's next flight and she'd looked to me like I got hit in the head like this guy has completely lost it and the way I said it to myself as like listen the probability of this happening twice if this plane goes down and I die it's me God is coming to see you right let's get this over with if it dies and I don't die

[00:31:43] Oprah Winfrey and I'm gonna share a stage somewhere and if I get on this plane I'll never be afraid of flying again did you fire out that night I flew out that name what did you feel like when that plane was taking off how did it feel different I remember the next time I took a flight which was maybe a couple weeks later and I had a seat again I got upgraded at first class and

[00:32:06] I gave it up and I wanted to sit in the first seat or coach and I wanted to see me on that plane and I sat on the left hand side of the plane and I just watched and I needed to relive all of that you know that flight I just wanted to come home my mom and dad picked me up because my wife was at home with the kids are young and our home got 60 people within an hour and they all came and like everything but nothing had really happened we were fine but it's just beautiful love and beautiful expression of supporting community and so my parents picked me up and there's media and everybody there and I like squirt around and I don't want any like people are talking to the camera isn't whatever and you can see when you look at the footage I'm like pretending I'm a normal passenger on the plane and my mom it's all a53 at the time she was 70 so she's about to turn 80 and I remember giving a hug to my dad and giving a hug to my mom and feeling like this was the safest place in the world a little lady hugging a 65-foot guy was the safest place and I remember feeling like a kid again I had asked my so kid and that was the only place that I could breathe it was so beautiful to embrace my mom in a way that again it started this journey of I am NOT taking anything for granted and that hug it was like the switch and there's not a day that goes by that I will not do something and remind myself

[00:33:36] I'm not taking this for granted and I love that hug with my mom my mom has fairly advanced Alzheimer's now as you know and so those hugs are not there anymore the same way but I am so glad I was able to be a kid again as it relates to hugging her we were together a few months ago and you mentioned to me that you had never seen Captain Sullenberger since that day you saw him on the docks and then you saw him for the first time you had just seen him for the first time tell me about that so one of our companies is the points guy and the points guy has a big award show here at the intrepid and he was gonna be the guest of honor and Brian who is the points guy and a good partner and a good friend he's like hey would you like to introduce him and I said I will be honored why had you not sought him out earlier I wasn't ready I have a big idea that I have I'm been working on and I'm gonna do something my way I just had said thank you to him that day and I know he had been overburden and I said the world will bring our energies again and so we're in the red carpet this big event hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people all sorts of things and he knows that I'm introducing him and he knows that I was a passenger and I'm like I am so curious as to how I'm gonna react I see him I shake his hand we embraced was locked before year introduced before and Peter not a word came out of my mouth there was nothing coming out of my mouth and it was amazing and he didn't have to come out of my mouth he could see my eyes what I wanted to say in a way that was so deep and he understood and I saw in his eyes a connection that to human beings can't manufacture it was really an amazing moment to see the person that saved your life and then to have the honor of introducing him a couple hours later give him an award how did you even think about and prepare for making introductory remarks in that setting did you wing it did you plan it I planned it but I didn't write it just like the TED talk and not a great memorizer but I need to have a framework and I need to let my heart go I told a few stories when I introduced him up that day of a very kind guy that basically gave everything he had that day to all of us and he was going on there and I talked about the first responders and I told the story of him doing his job as the core of this but what was unique to him as literally he had prepared for that moment his whole life and I went through his background as a as an instructor and maybe as a glide instructor all the things that he had done was because he will tell other pilots you're only a pilot when you lose an engine and he literally had prepare his whole life to be a pilot not for the tens of hours he flown but for the moment that he lost an engine that he didn't think it would be to so I admired him doing his job do you get the sense from all you now know about the details of that what percentage of pilots that fly commercial airlines could have done that under the same setting I mean we can never know the answer to that and I'm guessing the answer isn't a lot but I know very little about this of course but watching the movie reading the book that sort of thing but it seemed like improbable that a lot of people could have acted the way he did because of the length of time they had to process it with to me it was maybe I'm incorrect by the way because

[00:37:12] I'm not a pilot maybe I don't even understand all the nuance but to me the single most important thing was how quickly he could process information and make a decision about what to do and even a pilot with more technical skill and I'm not I don't know how much more technical skill one could have or need but if you took an extra 15 seconds to come to the same decision it wouldn't have mattered to your point earlier if he had tried to go to Teterboro no way you're plowing over land it not hitting the bridge on the way to New

[00:37:45] Jersey if he tried to turn to LaGuardia he's probably plowing through Manhattan at that point so I don't know I mean I just I think the answer's close to zero if not zero because there are a bunch of factors I think he because he was a gliding instructor I don't know how many of them are out there but it was what allowed him to place that plane in the water in a way because he had taught flying for so long and he had prepared pilots for this but more importantly there were all those factors that all had to fit within a very narrow margin so even him in other moments where other factors go and then there's a lot of luck one of those wings tips the water and we go through it so the odds of that kind of situation happening it's close to zero did you remember the scene in

[00:38:36] Saving Private Ryan at the end of the movie when the character played by Tom Hanks is dying and Private Ryan who's been saved basically is sort of coming to grips with the realization that in an effort to save his life an entire group of men have died and the character played by Tom Hanks basically says to him just two words earn this did you feel some sense of look I've always lived my life I didn't know you before this but I'm imagining you were not that different a person I don't think he liked you overnight became it the great guy you are today but did you feel a bigger sense of obligation to your community both your immediate community meaning your family but your larger community which is your company and then the even broader community than that which is the world around you means that changed in any way a hundred percent a couple days later in my own quietness I was trying to make sense of all of this now and I made a commitment to myself I made a promise to myself that when I die in six months six years or 60 years if you helped me live long hopefully longer hi I'm gonna ask myself one question and this is how I would judge my life and that question is did I earn my gift and I was given the ultimate gift because we in our evolution can't process death otherwise we would have never left the cave

[00:40:08] I left the cave I was given the gift and that gift is a responsibility not a gift who do you think was the first person around you to see that difference I mean I have to guess your wife must have just because of her proximity to you and how close the two of you are what do you think she noticed first once the dust settled meaning the months that followed and think about the clarity of not postponing anything not dealing with negative energy and focusing on what matters so my three thoughts that the plane was landing of no regrets I try to live a life of no regrets and by no means is perfect but if I was to I don't know index the amount of negative moments have held and my wife I bet you there under 10% of what they used to be

[00:41:01] I asked for forgiveness not because I may have done something wrong but because someone and was offended about what I did I choose to be happy not righteous I want to sort of focus on that a little bit because even just if nobody listening to this can relate to that I still want the benefit but I suspect I'm not alone when I was a kid actually in high school and I was a struggling high school student and I showed up and says show no potential but it was certainly not clear what I was supposed to be when I grew up all I wanted to be was a professional boxer but they made me take this aptitude test and it was not about sort of academic aptitude but more of emotional like where would he fit and I remember the result of the test was the strongest signal they had ever seen for someone who values justice and things to be in correct order and they were like well you've probably got a career in law enforcement a head of you son you know you really ought to consider joining the police force or maybe you end up going to law school and you'll become a judge but you really have this strong

[00:42:07] Ark of Justice you just want justice and I think that that's sort of a detriment sometimes I think it's because you do you get into these arguments with your spouse and even if you're gonna be objective in some situations they're wrong and and you're right but you're right this idea that what is the upside to that you could very easily just drop this case quote-unquote and get back to just being a happy existence with the world so were you someone who would argue a point if you felt you were right and because I've never known that side of you it's so hard for me to imagine you having any of that streak in you that I have for example I'm lying and hard like literally I would less than that I would be too passionate about certain things but think about it there's always three sides to an argument yours there's in the truth and if you start every argument understanding that you don't have the truth you have your truth it's really easy to surrender to that and most things in life are a shade of grey and not completely black and white and the problem is when we believe we're right we have made something black and white do you think that that is something you knew beforehand and choose to ignore or is that something that you somehow came to you as an epiphany as a result of this this is my mom's teachings but I ignore them oh yeah yeah yeah my favorite I plagiarized most of the things I said in being Puerto Rican and learning English when I came to college here I like I literally I'm constantly collecting new thoughts from others I had an original thought after the plane crash like mine like I could literally claim this set of words may have been order but I've never heard him and it is that I collect bad wines you know now I plagiarize that from you oh good yeah finally tell us why you do that because

[00:44:01] I love it I collect white wines is the trigger thought for not postponing anything and the thought is if you go to my house I have a lot of bad wine because if the wine is ready and the person is there I'm opening my best one this changes in an instant I don't want to leave with a bunch of good wine that

[00:44:21] I never drank and it's a way of living it's a way of living in everything so collecting bad wines means so much it just means taking the trip making the call taking the risk having the courage forcing yourself to things that you know you need to do I know you know this but I was 45 pounds heavier at the time when this happened and this was a commitment of me and saying I'm doing all of this it becomes very centering which by the way a little counterintuitive some would argue good thing you had those two ice creams like wouldn't you have regretted it if that planes crashing and you're like man I just wanted those two ice cream you know you can take these things to two different extremes and there is a bit of a contrast which is on the one hand you're you're living for the moment in which case we should be as hedonic as possible but at the other hand you've lost 45 pounds you were healthy to begin with but you're much healthier today you're probably 10 years younger physiologically which is a very forward-looking point how do you reconcile those completely at odds behaviors or no behaviors is the wrong word but viewpoints I still have the ice cream I think again it's a notion of balance I think it's defining the game mmm is your game longer or shorter today so there's a book that it's coming out called the infinite game and I believe in the infinite game before the book in the Simon senic and he's great he's a friend and he wrote this book it's very much a philosophy which I lived life which is the whole purpose of the game is to play the next game there's no winning there's no outcome there's no end so because I play the infinite game of life

[00:46:04] I want to be healthy enough to continue to play the game I can win the game of complete pleasure for a day a month a year but then I lose my ability to keep playing the game it's called the infinite game it's phenomenal yeah I've heard him speak about it I'm looking forward to it very much when I go back to sort of the winter and spring of 2009 you did mention in your TED talk that I don't know if it was weeks later or some period later you're a tourist site for your daughter tell me about that do you ever watch a movie ghost that's the Bruce Willis or know that

[00:46:37] Patrick Swayze yeah yeah yeah yes many many years many years and there's a scene in that movie where he's dead and he's the ghost and he's watching he's seeing life as is happening and I felt like I was sitting there and he was probably 2 weeks later something is a very reason and I felt like how was the ghost like I was not supposed to be there and here I'm watching my daughter and just completely bawling and people around me I'm like this supposed to be a happy place and I was bawling because I was giving that gift of seeing her on that stage and by the way it doesn't have to be a stage it doesn't have to be a play the magic of seeing your kids every day grow up if you want to choose to see it that way it can be equally powerful so it was a moment where I realized wow this is the gift is to be able to watch my kids grow up and he was centering around that of all my priorities it's my most important one how did your travel schedule in your relationship with work change as a result of this was that a quick change was it a gradual change

[00:47:50] I remember you sat me down six years ago and showed me your calendar and we walked through sort of the way you ran things tell me a little bit more about that today time is our only currency is the only thing that matters in our civilization we solve for wealth first but find any really rich person that is old or sick and they'll trade it all for more time right so it's worth pausing on that for a moment because most people listening to this think sure sure sure yeah yeah yeah that's easy to say but

[00:48:24] I've asked the following question to probably fifty patients and more than a hundred people I'm sure and the answer is always the same which is to ask someone who's at the age of 40 50 60 would you trade places with someone who's 90 years old in change for a trillion dollars and everybody thinks about it for a second and goes wall no I actually do the math

[00:48:50] I said we'll take your age now subtract it from the age of 90 take that Delta divide it by the trillion you're telling me that you value time more than this you could actually make a calculation and it's telling you how valuable time is to you when phrase that when most people don't appreciate that I certainly at times fail to appreciate just how much of a premium I truly place on time and yet but you know even today before we started this podcast I was lamenting the fact that I agreed to take a call as a favor to somebody and it like ate into an hour of my day and I was sort of like sometimes I just don't say no enough I don't protect time enough and yet if I did that calculation more I would so how did you calculate that and how did you implement it I'll tell you but you reminded me of one of my favorite stories and I tell this story to kids I go speak in a lot of middle schools on edges for younger kids and they're all cut up in all this material stuff and I said okay I'm gonna give you a million dollars but you have to give me your arms and all the kids no no no I'm gonna give you five million dollars you gonna give me your arms and your legs no no no

[00:49:57] I can't give you ten million dollars for your arms your legs and your eyes and the value of the story is you're already rich because you have your health money really can't buy that so value how lucky you are the talk is around the power of luck and most of the things that show up as unlucky things end up being lucky things in life if you choose to see them that way and so you just reminded me of that story so listen I waste no time I waste no time I only do things that I find our line to what I want to what I'm prioritizing or that I enjoy a lot or that put me on a path forward of what I want and as a result I am really comfortable saying no all the time I'm very thoughtful and polite I don't join any outside boards

[00:50:44] I have demoted friends that I outgrew so that I can make room for new friends I travel light I travel light through light because I need to figure out a way to increase the value of my time I have an amazing chief of staff who solves for 40% of the stuff that I shouldn't be doing and all that stuff so

[00:51:04] I put enough structure around me that I can be really efficient with my time but it's really finding always more ways to do it but saying no is everything how do you say no first of all if someone says hey would you come speak at this event my answer is pretty standard I'm honored that you would ask I'm humble that you would ask right now my priorities are my family and growing our company and as it is I don't have enough time eventually I hope to have time to do things like this and if you would have me I would love to do it does it feel bad to say no oh no because when you're saying yes you're saying no to something else so everything in life has a price you know so funny I interviewed a good friend of mine Jason Frieden and he said the exact same thing which is such a beautiful way to think about it is every time you say yes you're actually saying no to a number of things that you can't anticipate between now and then it's easy to say all do you want a or b it's hard to say you want a or door number being even know what it is and most times we don't know opportunity cost is really it's by the way one of the keys to business is not settling for good and waiting for great how many days a month do you think you traveled prior to 2009

[00:52:15] I went in tracted I was probably on the road 15 nights 15 mm-hmm and what is it today that's not vacation with my family yeah yeah yeah mean time away from family for Wow and it's literally decreased like one per year and I tracking eye tracking out ooh thanks to you good this is the first year I'm gonna break but meaning

[00:52:38] I'll be less than 10 days a month away from family I'm average through December 31st I'll hit nine point nine wonderful yeah I want eight next year that's that's the way to go we focus on what we measure it's just our brains are dissing so that's what they say it's a dream until you write it down and then as a goal the same thing the same principle do you think your kids at the time knew what happened yeah there's four six and seven right yeah they kind of understood that something really big had happened but it really impact him my son just did a project of his his identity in life and one of the central story was this story and I mean oh and he's 18 right so it tells you how hopefully he gave him context of enjoying life you said something earlier that I just thought was so incredible and I can't stop thinking about it this idea that Sully basically said you are only a pilot when you lose an engine like everything you've done is sort of preparation for that one defining moment of your life have you thought about ways that that extrapolates to what it means to be a father what it means to be a husband what it means to be a CEO what are the equivalents of the engine losing moment when the rubber hits the road and all that other stuff is just there to prepare you for that moment the easy answer on the business side is you're only a leader in a moment of crisis otherwise you're just in charge so and you as a leader have to prepare yourself for the moment of crisis and it's gonna come and unfortunately because economically we've been such a benign ten year period there's a lot of people that don't have the temperament to deal with what's coming they may be in a year maybe in three maybe next month it doesn't matter it's coming there's they're gonna be a year so that's the easier one is bringing your organization along to understand that when things change we're gonna have to lead and doing fire drills around it and doing scenario planning around okay what happens if we have a data breach what happens if we have business you won't have like all those things we do not constantly but we do it I'm enough to create consciousness about it and then time will tell when the crisis come are you gonna be able to lead or not that's

[00:54:54] I find that interesting when people call themselves leaders and they've never done anything in a time of crisis I'm like you're in charge I'm not sure leader yes I think with kids we like many other families have had to deal with our share of experiences with teenagers that are very very hard and our kids are in a good path and they're gonna be great but it hasn't been easy at all and has been really in Brenda and

[00:55:17] I talk about it a lot not only has it United us even stronger to help our kids through their situations but it is I've learned more about myself through being a dad because hard driving people like you and I think we know and when you realize that your key of being a father or mother is to find their gift and then to help them get to their gift and accept them for their strengths and their weaknesses and the last thing you want a kid to feel ashame and when we want something different for our kids then what they seem to want there's a high chance you end up shaming them without wanting to we're guilting them so I think for a parent to lead is to meet the kid where they are and finding their natural bent and encouraging it and making them their various version of themselves and that was not apparent to me when I signed up for this this has been with two teenagers that are super gifted and super kind but they are teenagers and there have to deal with a lot of stuff you and I didn't have to deal and it's not easy I'm dreading every second of it truthfully because I do think kids today live in a world maybe every parent says that maybe my parents felt the same way

[00:56:34] I who knows but I think it's I think it looks brutal to be a teenager today maybe what I'm telling you is that you're gonna have to grow up a lot to be able to do that well that's what we seeked a lot of help and it's been great and we have dug in and we've done a lot of research and we tried a lot of things haven't worked and it's a real commitment in by the way we're not out of the woods yet it's a it's a well I mean I'm just gonna get incredibly selfish for a moment and just ask for some advice so how do you handle things like electronics and social media like what have you learned and this doesn't necessarily have to be at the expense of your own relationship with your kids but even from other parents again you have a company of thousands of employees you have a purview into the lives of more than just your own what advice do you give parents who are trying to think through those issues I'll tell you an anecdote so last week my daughter's school had a trip to Disneyland and my daughter is one of the few kids in her class that does not have a smartphone or a cell phone at all so most of the kids do and they're driving up and it's my and another mom that are driving up in sort of the minivan and there's the four kids are in the back and three of them have a phone and my daughter gets my wife's phone and they're playing with it and at one point my wife looks back and she says all four of them are glued to the phones they're not talking they're not interacting at all it's like a road trip and they're all glued to these phones and so she sort of says hey guys let's put the phones away and you guys got to do something you got to talk you got to play a game you got a whatever okay well extract that moment for a second and you realize there is a lot of stuff that they're missing and you could argue look maybe they're getting things we didn't get that we're better for them who knows but to see the lack of basic socialization concerns me how do you or what advice you have to navigate that I don't have better advice than others I think kids should be kids meaning parents should decide what are the controls you can give kid a remote to the TV and say to whatever you want I think my mom said which I love raising teenagers is a tug of war you ultimately must lose because that's how they become adults so there has to be enough tension you can't lose at 13 it's at 19 they have but you have to be losing incremental yeah you can't be winning and then loose so it's a tug of war that you're the resistance so you also have to think about it kid specific every kid is different age specific but you also don't want them to be the misfit you don't so don't want them to be missing out and we kind of tend to project our reality into others they're gonna live in a world where your kids are probably never gonna drive your kids are gonna live with probably not even a cellphone they're gonna see screens and their glasses they're gonna do all this stuff that you can't even understand they're gonna live in a mix of a VR world and a real world do you want your kid to be able to be successful happy settle whatever it is your goal in that world not in 1982 of the VHS so you also got to remind yourself that this is a you can't hold on to the past so much and and you know I find very interesting have this conversation with lots of friends if you ask anybody what is your goal for your kid they'll tell you some version of the same thing happy well-adjusted contributing growing finding their passion whatever BS will talk and we mean it but then you watch the way we raise kids is over schedule to sports a trainer at this at that another coach pre SAT P SAT previous take it six times that didn't really help did stressing kids out to that extend and I go why are they so stressful we're making them super stressed this culture stressful enough and I think as parents we judge so much of our own self-esteem by what others think about our kids that we fail to understand what really is our goal if you really want your kid to be happy adjust or whatever you would do a lot of things differently so back to your question of just remind yourself what is it that you're trying to do and try to align to them it's a great point you make about you know I was telling you a story before we started about my son and that moment I had in that experience where I realized man how is it that I've let my ego become tied up in his behavior how is it that how he behaves in public as a five-year-old and when he has a temper tantrum I somehow internalize that as people are looking at me as a bad parent I mean that's it feels so silly to even say that out loud but I don't think I'm the first person that's felt that and that gets carried forward I think that is such a big part of the over-scheduling overdoing it it's hard and we make so many mistakes ourselves and we look at each other like what are we doing like it's a long race I do believe I think it was outliers or whatever but I do believe that the more you make kids feel comfortable and successful in the race they're on we judge ourselves against our relative said so put kids in situations that they feel like they are progressing and they'll find whatever their ceiling is in them all long enough time so many kids quit sports because we push them too hard too early and they're like this doesn't feel good this has produced no endorphins at home in the country right so I think a lot of the issues with kids in this age is the parents not the kids and we want to blame electronics and all the stuff that are issues but the issue is really that

[01:01:55] I don't think we're that honest as parents in terms of our goals in our action why do you think that has changed in a generation I mean you've spoken a little bit about your parents and it's kind of amazing right so they seem to be wise beyond their years your mom's comment about the tug of war that has to slowly be lost is honestly one of the most insightful things I've ever heard about parenting where your parents as educated as you are I was born in an Latin family and my dad is an amazing guy but my mom raised us four kids in six years and I think that the definition of Juan's life success is where do you come from and where did you in did you help advance the cause of our race the human race and you do that through your family first and if you're lucky enough through your community if you're lucky enough in a broader way like you are impacting a broader set of people but I think the ultimately goal of life is to make it better for others starting with your kids and I think my mom is the most successful person I know because of what she was giving versus why she gave us how old were you guys when you left Puerto Rico I came to the

[01:03:00] US to go to college so I came to Boston College in January in 1990 oh so your family stayed yeah born and raised yeah okay what was that like to show up in Boston at 18 or whatever you were ignorant is a wonderful bliss if I knew what I could marry I really think that ignorance is a blissed I showed up as a second semester freshman because it was the year after Doug Flutie and there were no dorms and my parents are like we're not paying for an apartment so I came with a second semester freshman and they put me in a plane they gave me 200 bucks my dad said go pay him in and I got on a plane I don't even know how to go to the gate by myself traveled a few times I put a Rico I and what I realized as soon as I got to Boston is I didn't really understand English and I was ill-equipped to go to college but overcoming that was the greatest gift why did you go so far into such a cold place why didn't you go to school in

[01:03:53] Florida for example or I don't know my uncle said Boston is great so I didn't he's great Doug Flutie said because I was raised in a Catholic schools of us in college was Catholic so it just I landed I'm like what in the world is this and I ended up in the freshest you said second semester so it's winter when you show and I five days before anybody at 200 bucks and I have lots of stories of like completely embarrassing things that happen as I went through this and because I was ill-equipped I was a misfit in every regard and I never faced racism which I did at the time I faced all sorts of things that I'm glad I did because it made me a lot more aware of what other people go through what had your parents or your mom even specifically done to prepare you for that moment taught me independence taught me that where are you in the birth order of the three out of four yeah did the two above you leave Puerto

[01:04:44] Rico for college my brother one above is in Kansas City as a doctor and my sister went and then came back after a couple years did you talk to them about it before you left technically my brother wrote my essays [Laughter] game something in Spanglish and he wrote him and I got in hopefully they don't pick my degree away if so we'll find somebody to give you an honorary one instead tell me about the remainder of those three and a half years though what obviously it's said she went a good path and you decided to stay yeah I came here wanting to go back to Puerto Rico and halfway through in him I love this country

[01:05:20] I love what this is about I worked at Fenway Park as a security guard I drove a limo in the summers so I was hustling making money my dad said I'll pay 1/3 you get loans for 1/3 and I had a academic scholarship for third but you're responsible for your own money so it was the greatest thing yet I don't know why I wouldn't do that to my kids because it's very different do you think about that do you think about your story of coming here as an immigrant having nothing is a story that many people can relate to and because of your success your kids have a privilege that you've never had how do you think about imparting on them some of the I don't know if lessons is the right word or internal fortitude or whatever call it what you want to call it how do you think about that

[01:06:06] I actually think about it almost the inverse of what you said I think it's really hard to be our kids I think we're giving them not privilege we're giving them a big big crust to carry and I feel a lot of responsibility for not burying so much of a shadow that my kids can't find their own son and we travel we travel in certain ways and whatever what are you sending our kids up I think it's really hard it's a lot easier to grow up the way I did which I can do better I think it's harder and you have to set up a different game you have to set up a game that they feel they can win and you have to get them thinking about the infinite game of there's no end here that's why so many of them end up in drugs and end up in other things because they say that's not something I can be successful I first of all I actually think you're correct I think both of the statements are correct so it's harder and easier and that the hardness and easiness pale are actually coexisting and creating that dynamic so you can't dim your own light I mean as you said especially someone like you who's been kind of given this gift we haven't even got to talk about red ventures which I want to in a minute you can't not be Rick Elias so how can they be your kids I think first of all it's not what you say it's what you do I work really really hard I want them to understand that working hard is part of the way you achieve things in life to me

[01:07:34] I don't have any issues with that and as long as it's protecting our family time and what matters to us I think secondly is how you treat other people the best thing that you can do to teach your kids how to live is to treat strangers with kindness they're watching your every action they're watching and by the way it's you are a teacher all the time and not with your words because they won't hear you but with your actions so every time you find yourself which we all do getting upset about something with over driver or a waitress because something was cold or a manager because they made you wait and you get a little righteous which we all do you're doing the opposite you're teaching them a behavior that it's not going to help them so I view our responsibility the best thing I can do is model hard work model giving and kindness model good energy to other people respect we're lucky to know a lot of people that others will consider super famous and I treat them exactly the same way that a stranger that is doing whatever job and they see that so those are the things the only things you can do and apologize for your success and you can't run away from it but you have to talk to them about not hey I want you to get into an Ivy League school and I want you to do all this stuff on you know I want you to find your gift and I want you to figure out a way to give that gifts to others again that I think that's so well said it's hard and I'm this is not a perfect right we're full of flaws in it were you ever a person that struggled to apologize before 2009 and if so is it easier for you to apologize today it was very hard I'm very proud I'm very competitive in those two things and I can rationalize anything as to why I was right you know what Peter I apologize for things I don't even know what I did because I don't give a if it's creating negative energy I can really easily say listen I am really sorry I offended you it was not my intent that's it but one and I don't seek to understand and I argue the counter-argument sounds like it does this really matter am I gonna remember it in six months is it gonna change anything just move on it's like a leakage of energy and when you leak energy it consumes time and that's your only currency imagine if you were like your toilet was running of $100 bills non-stop like that's the visual that's what a silly fight is you know you probably have the longest list of anybody I know of things that don't matter what is on your list of things that do matter what is worth fighting for what is worth being upset about those are two different questions so that's why you might pause things that matter and things worth being upset about

[01:10:11] I think injustice is worth being upset about and obviously based on everything you said it's not about your own injustice when the uber driver doesn't show up and when the waitress spills your soup that's not injustice it's as you know I'm attracted to places where this system fails people that can't help themselves that want to help themselves that's kind of our sweet spot and all our social impact work let's talk a little bit about that actually I think to whom much is given much is expected and I think the best way to do any type of social impact work is using your platform not just using your wallet if you can and so here I am I have a thriving company with a lot of young people that are exceptional how do I put them to do something that matters to them which is give back thickens our culture but also allows us to do something that gives us our real purpose which is leaving our woodpile higher than we found it that's what we talk about as a company that's the only purpose of the company we're not gonna go public we're not gonna sell this is the infinite game someday you'll go to zero hopefully someone else is running it this is a way that we spend our energy together the people we work with and the problems we solving all of that so when you put it in that context of none of this really ultimately matters other than advancing the game I am attracted to injustice is where the system is not working I'll give you an example we'll be undocumented kids they're known as daca now in the Supreme Court is here in the case and these are kids that were brought here without two years old four year old six year old illegally the parents brought them here illegally but we don't check education for primary school secondary school or high school so many of these kids don't even know

[01:11:50] Spanish or whatever the language is they never really remember being in the country and by the time they get to 18 we said sorry you can't go to college there's no federal financial aid because they're not citizens and then there is no in-state tuition in about 26 states so their chances are going to call it are basically zero and I'm not talking there's like thousands of these there was about a million of these in 2010 kids that were 0 to 18 that we're investing all this money so even if you want to take the Republican side of this which is a valid argument there gonna be a lot more productive if you educate them that's the whole reason to do this so they'll pay a lot more taxes so doc guy is Obama passes his executive order where he says ok if you graduate college and you are undocumented in here within these ages you can get a work permit so now going to college makes sense because he used to be that you got an education there was no way to get a job and that's what's getting debated right now there's like 600,000 of these kids with work permits we have about I don't know probably 50 of them working at red ventures right now so what I did is not many 50 well but we have 300 plus going through college that we're supporting so golden Lewis College got launched we did our first class of 12 and 17 and 25 and 30 we're now reviewing applicants for the next class and this is the first time we're using non dark sou if you're undocumented we're gonna take a stance for you and if you deserve to go to college you are gonna go our top 200 candidates Peter three point nine one unweighted GPA unweighted think about the waste of talent none of those kids are going to college tell me what happens to those kids if they don't go to college they end up working in a fast food place or just waste time waste of time many times they don't even find a job because they ever go back to the country that they were born in that's the problem they don't feel culturally assimilated they're American a lot of them don't find out that they're undocumented until they go take a driver's license or something they're like you can't it's very very cruel for these kids and they're they're your kids friends and they're as American as our kids are I find those kids did not commit a crime those kids did not have a choice to move here at two years old those kids have done everything we've asked him with the system what is this country all about isn't this the country where if you want to put in the work we give you a chance and so I find that to be a place that we put a lot of energy towards 18 to 24 there's about five and a half million young adults in the u.s. these are not on document this are citizens out of school or out of work terminally underemployed five and a half million and I think companies can do a lot more for them so we set up a 501 C 3 call wrote to hire where we're training these kids in coding in tech back tech and all this stuff and we're now opening the platform for the company so B of A and a bond and other companies in

[01:14:40] Charlotte are literally hiring this kids we train them as an adult in school for six months and we pay them to adult them we train them skills and then we put them in a two-year apprenticeship program and we hold their hands for two years we have another program called life sports eighth graders and title one schools in Charlotte are two years behind on reading Charlotte is probably no different than other places title one schools is assisted lunch and our belief is that hope has an expiration date and that expiration date educationally comes about that age in sports is a universal language so we have basketball soccer girls basketball where we bring this kids in out of the worst schools every day we give them usually their last meal of the day we give them an hour worth of reading because we think if they can catch up with reading they'll extend their hope and then we give them an hour and a half worth of exercise every weekend there's activities we have 250 kids now and the program we started it two and a half years ago we're going to grow we're going to below them facility so we're just trying to do our part like is our drops in the water but they matter and then for me matter after Kurt Hurricane

[01:15:44] Maria that I did something for Puerto Rico so we launched seven eight forward seven eight seven that's the area code so we're training right now we're training about 70 young Puerto Ricans in the u.s. that we want to reverse the brain drain so we're gonna bring him back we're giving them real digital chops and we're gonna move businesses to

[01:16:02] Puerto Rico so that we can bring people back to what are we go I want to go back to the first of those because you're not a dogmatic guy you're not a self-righteous guy you're a very empathetic person help me see my blind spot which is like you well no no you're going to have me I'm first-generation so my parents came to the country with the hundred dollars in the pocket sort of thing worked like crazy and now we get to live this better life and because I saw a lot of that I never really understood the sentiment against immigration now part of that is because

[01:16:36] I grew up in Canada so Canada very different from the United States on many levels if you were to try to explain from the standpoint of empathy what do you think is the view that sort of opposes immigration or opposes immigration reform because even though you're very clearly on this side you strike me as someone who can also see the other person's viewpoint I think immigration is one of the hardest issues for us to content because philosophically this is a country of immigrants practically this is a country that has lots of issues with its own people so this is not an easy answer that you say okay here's the solution to immigration and anything that we as a country decide as a policy will have pros and cons so I don't tend to profess that we need to have immigration and we need to have immigration reform and we need to have better controls and we need to figure out what we do with ten million immigrants by the way if we take all the illegal immigrants out of country we will not function because so many jobs that get done today that you and I rely directly and indirectly no one wants to do our unemployment rate is up four percent so it's not like we have 18 percent unemployment rate and a line of people who want to do this jobs and immigrants are doing them for half their money no there's no people that are sitting waiting to do a job aim this jobs no one wants to do right so I think this we underestimate but it's a real issue and I think we have to deal with those 10 million people I think kids should be dealt with separately these are the daca kids and by the way both

[01:18:11] Republicans and Democrats agree on the undocumented kids but they don't want to give it up because then you give up whole immigration issue meaning it's the thin end of the wedge yes morally slippery slope of this and so that's what the argument has been well I'll give you that but if we do this and I don't know if the answer is a wall or no all I'm not educated enough do we need controls we need smart immigration we need you know the fact that we have all this PhDs that we're educating at Stanford and all these places and then we're sending them back when they want to stay here that doesn't make sense right but it's not an easy answer and there's a really good argument to say listen we can't take our resources and you open up the gate with

[01:18:49] Mexico and you have tens of millions of people from Central America and all that coming in we don't have our house in order enough to be able to absorb that as much of a humanitarian as you want to be but there should be a thoughtful way that we allow different types of people to come in some decisions could be very easy which is any PhD out of our system some can be very humanitarian we're gonna bring in this amount of people some of them can be very thoughtful and in terms of skills of putting everything

[01:19:17] I again I don't know enough but there can be a lot around work permits like the problem here is that it's an underground it's an underworld if you brought it above board and you know about five years ago maybe six years ago I visited you bet red ventures and I got to spend a full day watching something you called a business review I don't know why I came for that but I knew I was really looking forward to it some we must have been speaking about the way you manage teams I think it's just interested the heck out of me and I was like can I come and spend the day watching and you were like of course we'd be honored to have you I'll preface this by saying I don't have a degree in business you went to

[01:19:58] Harvard you have an MBA but I was around a lot of Harvard MBAs and Stanford MBAs it's tough because I worked at McKinsey so I know I mean I've been around the block I can talk the talk a little bit and I mean at least know enough to recognize when people know what they're talking about I have never seen anything like I saw that day

[01:20:14] Rick your ability to process information to multitask to make decisions to sift through what was not relevant and to always be asking the jugular question in the setting and context of more information than could be processed by any person blew my mind and to this day more than five years later I still talk about that day constantly and when I ran into damn your partner your co-founder a few months ago it's the first thing I asked him about how are the business reviews can you explain to people listening how this idea came about because I suspect that anybody who leads a team in any domain will find this to be illuminating first I'm humbled by your words I'm not really sure that I buy all of that I think that I heard a quote that I loved and in life there's two kinds of people

[01:21:11] I heard it recently from a good friend of mine the humble and those that are about to be humbled I think our journey was such a struggle for the first four years and if you remember we raised two million dollars and by November we had no revenues and a hundred grand left and it took us three years to get back to zero so when you taste your own blood for a long enough period of time you realize that a lot of this is you got to fight the fight and you got to stay with it and you have to stay hungry and a lot of this from here is avoiding complacency and all the things that end up killing most organizations so really you had two deaths and probably that's true basically tasted death on January 15 2009 and you tasted death a few years earlier than that from a business perspective and for me I gave my word to my friends that I was gonna do all I could and I wanted to go to my reunions I ain't decided I'm gonna we're gonna hustle and we hustle and we in by the way I am so glad like there is such a rich part of who we are the the humility that you see in our building we we have this beautiful campus but I see car payment but people see success and stuff so the business reviews have evolved and continue evolve one of our basic and you know that I don't maybe tell folks remember what red ventures does even though I don't think that's relevant to the story I think if you were running any business with the same way but just give people it so it's changed twice since you were there but today we are a significant network of digital assets that all have deep integrations into the different service providers so we are trying to aggregate lots of services that consumer buys by owning assets like the point sky or Bank rate of all connect or health lines so we have about a hundred and thirty million uniques every month into our network of assets and then we do very deep integrations with all the services providers or all the card issuers all the banks everybody in healthcare and basically trying to change a consumer experience digitally that's a very different business than we were when you were there kind of five years ago I don't know if you remember but I don't believe that business should be run with values and I had this really interesting debate with Meg Whitman at the same event we were at and I didn't get to watch yeah and she's a much more accomplished deal than I will ever be and although that and she we were talking about culture and she said hey it's all about your values and then they asked me and I said to me values is a noun and I don't know how to run a business with nouns I know how to run them with verbs so we have a set of belief statements by the way we're not right just the way that we choose to use the word but we have a series of belief statements that anchor our culture and in the middle of that belief statement the core one in the middle is everything is written in pencil it's a wonderful belief statement because it helps us recruit if you're somebody who wants certainty you want all this stuff you're never going to fit in it allows us to evolve and change our mind because the world is changing so fast so we're not anchor and then it really gives us permission to experiment because everything is written in pencil the last one is we believe that are leaving the willpower then we found that is our purpose so that's the give us some of the others the first one is we believe in running up the escalators so that means that business have to play with pace this is not about speed speed V this is about pace the more reps you get the more you iterate through problems and business review is an example of a place that forces reps and what that means is how do you organize your organizational design how do you compensate people all those things really really matter running a company is really like an orchestra there's no right way there's no perfect song as long as the orchestra is in harmony where you get in troubles where there's dissonance in the orchestra you see instruments kind of going their own way so for us it's really important that we're playing at a high space that doesn't mean we work to 7:00 p.m. every night but we work our we're very purposeful we're small teams we're decisive we're okay most things in business are pass/fail yet we are trained our whole lives for grades and I think where a lot of leaders get in trouble is this is why people have a hard time prioritizing this is a pasta filled event I'll put in 20% of the effort I just passed so in the business really understanding what's pass/fail and what's great it's a really important kind of skill and you do that when it's bass field you just run up the escalator so that will be another example we're great people to work with we believe that we want to be great people to work with and I think diversity really matters in a company because you make better decisions people not only feel accepted they feel welcomed it is a way that it is important but I think what diversity does its lends the opportunity to create inclusion and if you think about a lot of our social impact work and all of this is about creating inclusion for people that are not getting access to certain opportunities that we were lucky to have so being great to work with is to being very very much attuned that we all bring something unique to the company into the table and so and so forth but since they're all written in pencil they're all going to change so explain how business review works I know it has changed by the way but even the example of the one I saw not that you could possibly remember that day five years ago or whatever but you were basically in a room and you sat in a conference table and there were business leaders basically all presenting to you and what the format how did it work it's 20 minute meetings no charts are passed nothing in color none of that a couple of charts on the screen are fine but you've got to be able to get to your point right no big

[01:26:35] PowerPoint decks were being passed out no and you have to start the meeting okay here's the problem we're trying to solve or here's what we're trying to talk about like you have to define your problem and then you went through it and then we conclude it with something so there's many ways to organize meetings

[01:26:50] Amazon does it with you've got to write something I think it's five pages and you come prepare to the meeting there's no right way of doing anything as long as people understand how you are going to calibrate work but the pace of this was like nothing I'd ever seen because I remember when I was getting ready to come forward and I wanted to sort of be mindful of what I was about to see so I could if nothing participate by asking a question that could be helpful I remember them saying okay so it's I forget the numbers 27 meetings and I was like what do you mean 27 meetings and they said they're 20 minutes each it's a 10 hour day you know there's an hour break in there and we keep it everybody understands the clock there is no uplay to the clock one person would stand up there and explain some problem about hey we're doing this deal with AT&T and it's got to look like this it's gotta look like this but boy we can't get this deal done because blah and you would ask five incredibly pointed questions and I was like wow I mean that's amazing because ten minutes earlier you were hearing about something totally unrelated and you could pivot so quickly to this and then you'd exit with a plan which is okay great here's an idea you're gonna go back to your counterpart at AT&T this is gonna be the idea you're gonna pitch boom boom boom boom boom boom boom we'll see you in a month let me open a window

[01:28:03] I think it's an interesting thing I learned this from a good friend of mine that anything you do in life should be a three-fer meaning at least a three-fer some things can be a for fer and most people are happy to get a twofer and what I mean is you can do something that has many purposes the quick example is you're gonna go play golf because you play golf that's a one for if you go play golf at a beautiful course that's a twofer at a beautiful course with your best friends and with great weather great so in business the business review is a fourth fear for us it's a way to force prioritization it's a way to train people how to present it's a high stakes in bar your team was so impressive you're absolutely right about that I've watched people I mean I am a real stickler for having information presented and it just kills me to watch people who can't get to the point and there was not one example in 27 meetings of somebody who couldn't get to the point I think our strength is there's 2025 year olds at red ventures that have been trained at a level because of all this exercise that it's great it's the best business school for a lot of these young adults the third is it forces decision making a lot of those things were tough decisions and the worst decision is a null decision so it forces decision in the fourth is that acculturate s-- so is it very much there were teaching moments there were things that happened you should have with certain things some things they X so I'd like to set up as an organization if we're going to invest that kind of energy and time something that has currency many different directions how did you sharpen your sword to get to that point is it literally just the reps its reps intuition is nothing else and having seen something before and when you start getting all this pattern recognitions because you've seen so many times a movie and the key is not to see the movie Peter I think is to be introspective about what happened in the movie so a lot of times I'll finish a negotiation I'm like oh I screwed that up I did not read that key I was too aggressive last night I had a dinner and it was really great in the last five minutes I fumbled it as soon as I got in the calm like what did you just do I don't want to make you talk too much about it but can you say a little bit more about what it is that you think you fumbled when you do a lot of interpersonal skills the other person is talking to you non-stop without words and a lot of this is knowing when you stop in my last two statements I lost some of the momentum I got with the other 55 minutes and I just knew it in their eyes that doesn't matter right it's just part of the journey so my point being is you got to be super self awareness is really important in life self-management is the key to success most people I got I'm self aware well can you self-regulate can you self manage can you think about all the things you think about him and you teach around longevity and nutrition and all that it's the self-management part of that matters I would take it one step further

[01:30:51] I mean I think the self-management on the emotional level might be the single most important of them all to manage how you eat and exercise I think is much easier than to manage your thoughts and your emotions in terms of how you interact with the world that's not true yesterday morning I had a negotiation someone flew in before I came to New

[01:31:08] York and he was a pro and the moment he said that I'm like oh this is gonna be a good one he was a master chess player so I knew every time they asked something he wasn't asking something so you're constantly going okay what's the question behind the question what is it that you're trying to angle what is it you're trying to find in good negotiation is when you can find currency that they value more than you do and then you find a way to make it work for everybody when someone is a very good negotiator and they're trying to do that then you can almost play the inverse game it's like can you create an impression of something so that you can create value for something so that you can get something else and then you're reading what they're doing so it's really fun do you teach this deliberately to your teams because I got to tell you I don't think that reps alone are sufficient in other words you could put me into a hundred deals to negotiate I don't think I could ever extract the insights that you seem to extract I think you're doing something at a meta level that few of us do which is it's what you said it's not just seeing the movie it's knowing what the movie means and knowing how to recreate pieces of the movie in subsequent movies that's a totally different skill I don't have it I know that to start by the way

[01:32:17] I don't think I'm great at it I think there's much better people so this is a journey that there's always someone better than you so I'm in this constant journey I want to get better at all this aspect so the moment you think I'd finished negotiations discussions were like oh there was a prod to day one it wasn't me that was a masterful event it was happening that you kind of laugh about where you're sooo attune to it every interaction is a game of influence with your kids with your spouse with everything else and it's not a negotiation negotiation means someone when someone loses is you're constantly trying to influence with your thoughts and then you're allowing others people to influence you what type of person do you run from in business negative energy selfish what are the telltale signs of that because when that's obvious those people usually don't even get in the door what are the subtle signs of that like for us pronouns really matter we versus I or yes but it's de sortie on when you say are you taking the credit for things so you may use the we but it's all about you right so it's the next level of all of that so how do you internalize things I'm looking for people that I really ambitious for something bigger than themselves and in that journey they want to do well they want to provide whatever it is men but it's much bigger if someone is interested in just one thing I think we all have a competitive tribe for example so when I look at people I'm trying to understand and this is a little bit of one I'm trying to explore and the current podcast we're doing with all the super athletes is what's driving your competitive spirit and I've kind of honed it down and again I played the rises from somebody so but you're either driven by competing and killing a competitor think of Muhammad Ali or somebody right like he needed to see the other person stand over them you're driven by fear failure

[01:34:07] I just interview an erotic and the first episode of this podcast and you can tell he's like listen I was driven completely by fear but what you see is the first person is a warrior and the warrior unless they evolve they know they'll lose the last battle and therefore they quit and you see it in sometimes in boxing they come back for one more and that's when they lose on whatever the person that is motivated by fear eventually taps out out of exhaustion and the more successful that they become the heart of the fall they're like I got a run and I see a lot of friends of mine who quit at 48 50 52 and they have all this gas in the tank and I realize how many of them are driven by fear of failure and they just don't want that the value of success is so much less than the pain of failing that they can't take the trade anymore the success became too significant the third in where I'm like really focused on is is the people that love to compete because they just love to get better all the time it's a race against themselves one is a good race against somebody the other one is a race against fear the other one is a race against yourself and I find people that have that energy have a better balance about it in can run the longer race and if you see people like I know a lots of guys that are in their sixties or seventies that are still refusing to let the old man or a woman in is because they're driven by the game by getting better professionally how much of your energy is into your business versus your philanthropy not time but energy it was zero percent six years ago it's probably fifteen percent now going to go to thirty eventually will be fifty what do you want to accomplish philanthropic lis that you have not yet accomplished and not just necessarily at scale is there a problem that you have not yet gone after because a you haven't acquired the knowledge B you haven't thought of the angle at which you can have the most leverage but there's a problem that's nagging again because there's no winning you're just advancing something forward

[01:36:15] I am very motivated by reversing a bunch of the trends in Puerto Rico I'm not gonna solve put a Rico I made early do anything but I think I can do something to start reversing some of the trends I think the bigger opportunity I see is how the companies become a force of good how do business leaders see themselves and their responsibility to be a force of good in their communities I think this platforms their businesses are so powerful not just monetarily but as engines of people in problem-solving in access to opportunities that I want us to become a bit of a beacon of like wow you can be successful and be good at the same time and they don't have to come against each other do you think that public companies can do that is that part of your decision to stay private I just I don't like Authority so I'm hate having a stock ticker and on my head so that's why I don't want to be public but I I think public companies today this is a

[01:37:11] Milton Friedman kind of challenge and Simon talks about it in that book it's a shareholder at the center that's changing look at what the Business Council just announced in the last couple months hey there's a bunch of stakeholders here this are pendulums that swing when we get a fairly far left precedent in our country this stuff may change and so there's our pendulums this is this is not new what challenges you the most in your business today you get a great challenge you play basketball it's still such a huge part of your life you are so competitive with yourself in basketball what are you trying to sharpen your sword in business

[01:37:46] I mean you talked a lot about negotiation obviously I can sense in you this passion to be better and better and better at that and to understand the relationship in the dynamic because obviously the best negotiation is one and when both people win what other skills are you honing the answer you may not like but I feel like I'm over my head right now this is so much fun I'm like trying to run the matrix we are in seven industries from financial services to healthcare to entertainment we're building a lot of tech and I'm not a techie and we're a techy company we have 800 engineers and I'm not announcing how many total employees right now 3,200 we have 200 employees in London we have 110 in Brazil so you had to know countries you know gotta know markets and most challenging is we grew organically for a long long time so we were almost like a culture of settlers so you came through our system and we've done a number of acquisitions and now we become a culture of immigrants and when your culture is your competitive advantage which I think a hundred percent it is and you have added so much newness to it you know leading our way through it is really challenging and I have no idea what I'm doing I'm like Forrest Gump I just show up every day I give it a really all my effort and I can't get fired which is good and if it goes to zero it goes to zero I don't care somehow I wouldn't bet on that no for sure I am a hundred percent sure that if

[01:39:10] Rhett ventures went to zero no no no I'm not sure already okay so I could in 30 days he'll be super happy or go to zero I'm farm purpose and something else none of this stuff really matter there are a few people who can say that with more certainty than you but of course that's probably exactly why it doesn't happen

[01:39:25] I'd certainly bet against it if you go back to the morning of Thursday January 15 2009 and you could run into yourself as he's leaving his hotel rushing to the airport and you couldn't tell him what was going to happen but you could say anything to him what would you say they'll miss that flight that was the most remarkable remarkable gift I ever gotten and I feel bad there's people that were on that plate that will never fly again and know there are people on that fly that still can't sleep well and I am really sorry for that I'm really lucky that the way it landed in my system was it gave me a urgency can be purpose it give me humility it gave me a game to play which is a game with no regrets Rick I can't thank you enough I don't know what I did deserve two hours your time today but you've given a great gift to a lot of people and honor to be here you are one-of-a-kind I learned so much from you every time and thank you for being different you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at Peter Tiye MD com maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what
