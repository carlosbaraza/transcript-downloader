The conversation centered heavily on understanding various performance metrics (V02 max, FTP, lactate threshold) and how elite athletes like Christian and Gustav optimize their training and racing. A significant portion discussed revolutionary nutrition strategies, including the ability to consume up to 240g of carbohydrates per hour during competition, far exceeding traditional limitations.

**2. KEY MEDICAL/SCIENTIFIC POINTS**:
- Elite athletes can maintain race pace at 90-95% of VO2 max for extended periods [1:12:58]
- Maximum lactate steady state can occur below 2 mmol/L in elite endurance athletes [1:22:04]
- Carbohydrate absorption can be trained to exceed traditional 60g/hour limits, reaching 160-240g/hour [2:09:15]
- Hydrogel technology enables higher concentrations of carbohydrate delivery (12% solutions vs traditional 5-6%) [2:14:11]

**3. HEALTH OPTIMIZATION TIPS**:

Universal recommendations:
- Standardize testing protocols for consistent measurements [1:34:03]
- Focus on proper warm-up before maximum effort testing [1:44:33]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Train gut tolerance progressively for higher carbohydrate intake [2:14:11]
- Consider timing of day for performance testing due to circadian rhythm effects [1:37:08]

**4. SUPPLEMENTS & MEDICATIONS**:

Would you like me to expand on any of these sections?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] seems like most things in our body is actually extremely trainable if you if you if you really and that that's also comes back to the nutrition part as well where exactly also the training programs we have today also is very have not seen the same change as nutrition strategies have done over the last years as well so that means also that the power numbers that was output maybe 5 10 20 years ago

[00:00:21] I'm not so sure if that's the limitation we're going to see especially late in races right this is where it's going to make a bigger difference it's not going to make a big difference at the beginning of the R but it could make a huge difference at the end hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:00:41] AA OHA thank you very much for coming uh to Austin on your way uh I guess you're on your way to Arizona yes on my way to Flagstaff so also thank you very much for having me again yeah well as as I mentioned last time we spoke um I had a lot of notes we got through I think 1/8 of them so there's kind of a lot to to to cover today um and of course as we've been sitting here for the last 15 minutes or so um we've already kind of started the podcast unfortunately and I want to go right to where we just left off but I'm going to resist the urge and kind of bring it bring it back a little bit so um you know last time we spoke really about sort of the most nuanced ins and outs of of cardiorespiratory

[00:01:23] Fitness um maybe just for the person who didn't catch that episode can you give kind of the the one minute version of of of what you do and why you're um certainly one of the few people that would be poised to kind of talk about what we're going to talk about today oh uh I'm not very good at the let's say the the pitches or the one minut pictures but no um what I do is that my background is from engineering and it means also that this principle have guided me quite a lot through my journey in enduring sports or in sports in general um and um it I I very much we we embarked on a journey 10 years ago more than 10 years ago I would say now 15 years ago where we started to do what I would call

[00:02:12] Extreme in-depth and longitudinal studies on two of the arguably fittest athletes in the whole world um and um yeah I think that pretty much resembles we we we we are obviously a large part of that also involves technology development simply because at we are because we are at the edge of basically what we have available information research on and that means that in even in some cases we have to develop technology to allow us to even um progress the understanding of or or yeah getting our more granual understanding why things are the way they are yeah so in many ways you're kind of an applied scientist yes and your laboratory is is is is both a a CET lab and and then a racing environment where Mo you know most of the athletes you work with are triathletes correct uh well yes and no uh I would say that it's actually quite spread it's a mixture between triathletes cyclist Runners um yeah track and field uh to uh even

[00:03:17] Sailors which is on the ex let's say on the explosive end of uh of the domain actually not endurance but yeah I feel like we're going to use a lot of terms today we're going to probably throw out the word anob threshold lactate threshold V2 Max FTP so I just want to make sure everybody kind of understands those things so let's just take them one at a time um can you define FTP or functional threshold power for folks yes um there is a couple of definitions of this already which is I I have to say that it's um it's bad when you have good um terminologies but they start to get diluted but the original uh definition of FTP U by the authors I think was Andy kogan and that was that basically it's the you you take you first actually have to do a 5 minute allout effort and then basically there's a short pause in between there and then you go to a 20 minute all out effort and then you subtract uh 5% from that to find your

[00:04:15] FTP so typically it would be your 20 minute all out minus 5% and the reason for that is to try to get a ballp parkage IDE of what your let's say your power your sustainable power output is possible to do over uh an hour but as we have learned over the years is that one we figure out that this is not as accurate always because there are a couple of other things in there and also

[00:04:38] Unfortunately they have become different ways to doing it like some people they just do a warm-up and then they do a 20- minute all out and then they subtract 5% and that's already different yeah we used to sometimes do 20 minutes and subtract 10% so we would do a gentle warmup yeah for an hour yeah then do 20 20 minutes and then subtract 10% so yes we're already kind of but I guess the spirit of FTP which is maybe what we want people to think about and not get mired in the details is it really approximates kind of um an energy zone right that is you know more than just an allout but clearly less than what you could hold indefinitely and it's directionally about the highest output you could have for an hour um and there's different ways to approximate it of course yeah and I think maybe more importantly to that point is that uh as long as you do something consistently so you keep the same protocol you could say okay this one thing is the the original let's say thinking and that went into devising this kind of protocol but I would say more importantly is rather to stay true to the to the principle of how you do it so as long as you do it the same way each time this is more important yeah yeah and then how does that differ from another term that is used U interchangeably but I believe erroneously which is critical power uh so critical power is more is something that you normally more uh extract from that you do multiple uh multiple uh allout efforts and then you apply um uh reverse extrapolation to this to basically figure out what is your uh critical power so it's more it's a more of a little bit more advanced mathematical approach to it but you do uh typically you would say that there there there are different concepts to this uh I personally have to say I like the critical power approach a little bit better and what is it trying to approximate so critical power is basically uh where you uh try to let's say you're mainly you could say you try to divide uh something into two zones or well that's that's a that's a crossover simplification but you you dis you distinguish between let's say a non severe and a Severe state or basically where you are again also in the same way as FTP trying to figure out what is the power you are capable of staying at for a prolonged time and basically where you go into a territory where let's say the small changes has a huge consequences yeah huge consequence on on the duration that you're capable of holding it yeah and where does critical power typically lie in relation to FTP again this depends a little bit on how you test FTP but I would say that how maybe FTP have been used over the last uh or let's say a little bit like or deviated from how the uh authors originally devised it I would say that it actually is not too different and normally you would say that critical or functional thresold power uh would lie slightly lower in in in let's say in power output than critical power um but again it depends very much on let's say also in critical power there are today I don't know how many different definitions there are of critical power and how you should do the protocol there um but it means that um normally critical power if you look at it from a metabolic perspective it sits somewhere between your uh your maximum laed steady state or call it anerobic threshold uh and uh V to Max so it's typically more close to uh V2 steady state or uh and so on but that's introducing another term that uh just doesn't uh bring Clarity to we we'll Define those in a second um so many of these metrics FTP power um are are easiest to think about in terms of uh cycling because we use power meters um do the same Concepts still apply in swimming and running yes uh I would say um and I one thing that is I think for the sake of Simplicity it sometimes it helps to refer to like say one condensed number so you use for example you can say critical pace for for example in running and and swimming and the way of testing it is not too uh let's say uh different to what you would do in cycling um but one thing that I one one thing that actually happens in the process is that you actually have access to more granual information and you are dumping down information a little bit when you call it FTP or you call it critical power because more importantly I would say is that when you when you make when you when you present a critical Power number on only or an FTP number only you have taken two-dimensional information and and made it onedimensional meaning that you only look at the y- axis and you you take away the information that is quite critical I would say and that is how long are you able to to sustain something so for example for critical power testing I would say again also when you first do critical power testing it's more interesting to know let's say how fast or how far are you able to get over 1 minute for example 5 minute and 15 minute and then actually see what happens in the next time you do it for the 1 minute the 5 minute and 15 minute because this is actually quite crucial to understand also the balance or what's happening with the different balances in in the body uh also FTP uh obviously there you have already most people uh think of this as a 20 minute power so it's even a little bit more condensed or even simpler uh information but um as we will probably come back to is the balance when you're training there are two things that normally can happen one is that you you you increase your general capacity meaning that both power and capacity or one or the two are increased um the other thing that happens there is that at some point we are all time limited and this is where we need to Pivot so we need to Pivot or as say prioritize what is more important for us is it the more explosive or speed or is it more endurance and then it's becomes more interesting for how you guide the training training to to understand what's happening between this different power or Pace and ations yeah okay you mentioned two other terms there anerobic threshold um let's start with that how do we Define it uh well that's probably in the same way today that we we we say something we just say call uh you now in the world of chat GPT and everything we just call something AI it's it's a it's basically an extremely broad term uh that try to Encompass more or less the exact same thing that we already talked about basically the let's say the the difference between where something is steady and where it goes over to unsteady or basically for where you can hold something for a longer duration and where it goes to um shorter duration it's a misconception to think that anerobic threshold means basically when you become anerobic because that's not the case yeah it's a Continuum of course it's not it's not a switch Yeah

[00:11:48] Yeah and again where does anerobic threshold typically uh if we're just limiting this to make the discussion easier and talking about say cyclist with a power meter where does an iic threshold tend to sit relative to FTP uh so again obviously because this is a more but if we if we then let's say bring it over more to lactate as a as as a as a tool for uh trying to figure out where this is uh and again this opens up a let's say a a whole new uh um world of definitions but to to to try to answer it simply I would say that typically anerobic threshold when you use lactate and let's say that you use for example gold standards or maximum lative steady state this would normally sit below the critical power of FTP so at a lower power output so for keeping track we've got kind of critical power FTP at yeah well and also what's important here is that when we say anerobic threshold is that when we talk about the differences here the differences here depending on this will depend a little bit on what kind of athlete you are whether you are let's say you are a high power athlete or an endurance athlete so if you're a high power athlete typical you will see that there are larger differences between this so the percentage difference between this will be larger our endurance at least it will be smaller but we're talking you could basically call this minute differences we're talking percent differences it's not like these are going to be 10% apart in terms of power anything like this we talk about percentages uh like from a couple of percents to maybe five worst case maybe 10 okay and then lactate threshold just adding more definitions yes so lactate threshold uh this is is where we are uh onto the this is actually I would say the laed threshold has probably um is probably more of a result of limitations in the let's say measurement method yeah because uh we know that laced is something you produce all the time even when you're are sleeping so the difference here is more where you're looking at where you find a first infliction point on a laced curve when you do L an increase in intensity so one thing that is Maybe easy to get wrong here is that it looks like when you do increasing so if you start low enough power or low enough Pace it looks like oh there is no increase in lactate production uh it is the the but the problem or let's say the problem is the way we we measure we don't measure like that in the muscle we measure in the bloodstream and for it to basically be reflected then on the instrument you need to have there needs to be a large enough Lac production in the muscles where you're not able not where you're not able necessarily to metabolize the lactate uh immediately and it starts to get let's say uh transported um uh out into the bloodstream and it starts to reflect also as an increase in in lactate there so um but but it's and the differen is also is that depending on protocol this will change so that's also a little bit of the challenges when you also start to mix uh something external with something internal as well and so if we did a um a lactate protocol um a speed or power escalation right I think we talked about this on the last podcast which was you know kind of the way we used to do it in swimming is you I think we would do 200 yard swims so you do a 200 yard swim at a very modest Pace come back check the lactate rest do it again 5 Seconds faster per 200 go and do it again just lactate D and you got a plot so Pace on the uh x-axis lactate on the

[00:15:29] Y AIS and the curve is very distinct right it it is very very flat and then it is not and you would we would draw these tangent lines between the two and then that point was the lactate threshold um where would that typically lie assuming we did it on a bicycle so it was really easy to do the power checks um first of all how long a duration would you have an athlete do this if you were doing it on a on a on an ergometer um would you would you say we're going to do you know 3 minute efforts or something like that is that is that appropriate to generate the lactate performance curve it depends again how you're going to utilize it uh if you're are going to use it for actively let's say controlling the intensity Outdoors for example using a lactate meter I um then then I would say it really doesn't matter because then you could say that even taking into account that there's some lag between what's happening in the muscle and what's happening in the blood exactly because the thing here is that here you're looking for more let's say um not necessarily here also it's important just for me to say initially that when you find for example a lactic concentration of LT1 and lt2 for example or basically at and LT for example or at lt2 but we basically say lactate turn point2 and lactate turn point1 so the first one and the second one and then uh when you do this it's also a misconception to think that your your lt2 is always a constant value because this will be influenced by many factors we measure a concentration in the blood and blood uh or let's say not it's influenced by hydration and all things like this so for example if you have a change in hematocrit and we won't come into that but you can easily from the beginning of the session towards the end of the session see changes in hematocrit of more than 10% and this all where as you get dehydrated yes uh so this will already influence uh the lactic concentration but again this is where you to use it as a guiding principle it really doesn't matter how long your steps are if you if you basically what you're looking for is to find a concentration value and then you go out into the field and you're trying to figure out where this is so you are you basically said okay uh if you figured this out to be for an endurance let say it for sake of Simplicity we say 1 M and 2 and a half Millo so 1 Millo at at like the threshold or LT1 and then two and a half at at lt2 or anerobic Threshold at by the way I would we usually saw them a little bit higher than that we usually saw the the actually I didn't really differentiate between LT1 and lt2 I kind of looked at the single inflection point just using a two line um usually people were kind of in the 3 to four range was where that inflection point so that you're saying that corresponds to lt2 yes so and this also comes back to a little bit what kind of atlit you are SW yeah this was mostly swimming that we were doing you can imagine here uh that uh I found swimmers by the way had the highest lactate capacity where but yeah for for basically for how much like how much like they would produce and tolerate and tolerate yeah any idea was that it could be just a small sample size but uh could no it very often it depends on what kind of swim is if you look at a 100 meter swimmer for example then you would typically look at a swimmer that has a very very short uh they say duration I say so call it 2 to 400 yeah breaststroke butterfly individual medley I don't think there was anything that ever I I never saw higher numbers of lactate in myself or other swimmers than in those I always assumed it was two things it was individual medley you're using every muscle in the body so you just it's like cycling or running you're hemorrhaging lactate into the system uh and then secondly at that distance 2 to 400 I mean you're really in the Pain Train of you know you're you're you're clearly not able to do this fully anerobic so you're sort of maximizing aerobic and then topping up anerobic but but that was sort of why um I I sort of assumed I mean literally I measured un several

[00:19:23] Elite swimmers lactates over 20 Millo yeah that's that's probably not uh I think think very often it helps uh to think that metabolism is basically the same there's not or the body is the same no matter what kind of sport we do and that's why sometimes it makes it more universally easy to understand if we think of what kind of sport we do as as a function of intensity and duration so as long as you find a sport so they say that you compare a spot that has a certain intensity and duration so let's say for example if it's a 200 meter or 400 meter you could say that then you are typical in the range of let's say for the fastest swimmer typical let's say two to four minutes for example if you take a 1500 meter Runner and you look also at the lactic concentration of them you will also find actually pretty much the same values let's say among also tracking field beats that does, 1500 M or 800 M as well um and as the moment you start to go a little bit longer then you will not you will actually start to see that this actually start to oh this is not the case anymore and this is also where it helps to also distinguish between lactic concentration and and and let's say the highest value you're looking for and also lacate production because lacate production it's it's it's even more complicated we can't really measure lactate production we can only then we need to integrate for time so you have to do a let's say a a pre-measurement a postmeasurement and then also obviously here there are again uh many weaknesses to an approach like this but you have to D drive it based let's say more on calculations than than really that you can measure it directly um how high you can get elac concentration is also avilable because it obviously tells you something about how much you are able to buffer in in your body too yes so uh again um what we see coming back to the main question of basically of um uh how do you use or lock dat and then basically for the sake of where you do a profile and and and testing this is where I would say that um for endurance athletes like for example marathoners triathletes and others which has a very very long duration and they don't have very much top speed this here is actually not uncommon even to see where the second infliction points even validated by maximum lactus steady state that actually can even be below 2 milles and is that does that let's just translate that into kind of English for people um one of the challenges of talking with you is I enjoy it so much and I sometimes forget that there are other people listening who might not care nearly as much as you and I do about some of this minutia but it's just it's

[00:22:04] I can't get enough of this stuff so let's make sure people understand what you just said you just said that when you look at the most elite endurance athletes these people have either some combination of such low lactate production Andor such high lactate clearance that frankly the need to buffer it becomes secondary they're producing such a high degree of power they're generating so much work with so much aerobic efficiency that their steady state lactate doesn't even need to hit 2 Mill which of course you can sit at 2 Millo all day long and not notice it from a from an acid base standpoint is that is that a fair assessment of what you said um or implication of what you said maybe yeah yeah because I think also what what what I think for uh for those that are a little bit more into the uh let's say into the details um I think also again here is important to come back to that is a laced concentration and one thing that we also do know in Elite athletes is that Elite atlast has a higher blood volume larger plasma volume and other things as well so this means basically the absolute lactate could still be higher exactly so lact production can can be higher but basically it shows up as a smaller concentration in the body uh but what we distinguish between is basically at where comes the point where you are continuing at the same Pace or power but now lck it doesn't stay steady anymore so if you if you measure after so same Pace same power but after 5 minutes after 10 minutes and so on basically then you'll then you'll start to see that like it still continues to rise it doesn't stay stable anymore so this this is this and this this I think is probably one of the few concepts of where you can say that okay if you test it this way it becomes very easy to translate um let's say the communication between people because at the moment you start to talk about anerobic threshold this is more like okay are we talking about how do you define it is is 20 minute power is a 60 Minute power what what kind of duration what kind of protocol and all these kind of things but uh that's one and the second point also is that what happens because obviously when you are an endurance athlete like a TR atlete or on marathoner for example is that you need to have a sustainable energy supply for the duration of the event and obviously the faster you can go of your potential for that duration the more beneficial it is so that means also that you your utilization uh so we will come maybe come back to this a little bit because

[00:24:32] V2 Max is one of the terms we're going to Define so utilization normally just to take that term then or let's say partially let's say take Define utilization utilization is basically normally you can do it as whatever you want you can do it as as race bace oxygen consumption at race bace versus your v2x but very often in scientific literature we Define this as for example your oxygen consumption at uh maximum La steady state versus V to Max so for example if it if it was uh then it could be that your max like the steady state you see the oxygen consumption there is for example 80% of your view to Max wow is that is that what you would typically see in an elite athlete that they're Max that's low that's low for a marathoner you would go even higher so for a marathoner like the elite marathoners you're talking about 94 95% of the view to Max for Christian gusta when they do iron mens you're also pretty much around there and again also this this is some of the things that I really let me just make sure we get people to understand that because that is as you know now that I have a V2 master I'm testing my V2 Max all the time and I'm also testing my V2 at submax levels all the time as well and looking at how that corresponds to lactate levels yes so um why don't you define V2 Max and then we're going to come back to this point because I want to make sure people can internalize and maybe even one day experience what you just described so V

[00:25:58] CO2 Max is normally defined as the maximum oxygen your body is able to consume uh over a minute a full minute um but this is also something that is debated is less of let's say protocol uh influenced but it is still you can still go out and do for example uh efforts out in the field and you will be able to produce higher numbers than what you would be able to do on a standard graded exercise protocol so this is also a little bit of where it's it's it's not that's been the case for me yes right you know I've shared with you my D I've shared my data with you so um my I like to do it on my bike on a hill so take a take a hill that's going to be you know it's not too steep 6% grade you're in the saddle the whole time and you're in the Big Chain ring and it is go For Broke and make sure you're dead at the top 4 minutes of climbing and that produces a V2 Max there's going to be a level usually near the very top of the hill in the last minute where I reach the maximum volume of oxygen that

[00:27:08] I'm consuming now indoors I for some reason hate doing it on a stationary bike so instead I do it on a StairMaster um so now I'm just sprinting upstairs doing the same thing um I get a comparable number but it's a little bit lower now what I haven't done yet and I was going to try to do it before we met today but I kind of ran out of time I was traveling last weekend I have a prediction which is I think I would have a VI a higher V2 Max running on a treadmill even though I'm very inefficient running because my heart rate is always higher when I run than when I cycle do you think that would be the case normally I would say uh that should be the case um but it it is also um where that can also be other factors also involved in it uh like one of the places where uh this is something that quite U um P me is that for example Formula One drivers they sit in for almost I say one and a half hour with extremely high heart rates um but having looked at that

[00:28:19] Telemetry very closely yes a lot of that is driven by the g-forces it's because I've I mean the first time I looked at an F1 driver Telemetry I was like there's a mistake these are just errors like these aren't real numbers because I had never seen such rapid changes from low to high to high to low um and then I realized they were all corresponding to either very very strong break points or very very fast corners and then I you know obviously the only thing that's common to that is something about 5G on the body is dramatically doing that now it would be very interesting if we could do it I don't know how you would do it would be to measure V2 and see if it has a commensurate change what would you hypothesize so this is I think also uh when when you are doing uh this so it could also be like jet fighters as well but yes I would imagine that's even more pronounced for them yeah well and we could actually measure that because they're already in a mass yes exactly so so you could say that in in in dog fighting for sure then I think you will actually be pretty much maybe same as as

[00:29:29] Formula 1 but but I think that if you're just P pushing really high G forces uh in One Direction then it would maybe not be as even if it's a prolonged one the reason for that is because I think that the gForce is obviously you're trying to counteract that you're mobilizing every bit of muscles that are in your body in order to to to to to stay exactly where you need to stay and to be but there's a slight difference which maybe you're about to get to so I apologize if you are there's got to be also a part of that heart rate that is coming from the compromised Venus return to the heart due to either the Vol Salva or the actual impeding of the inferior vnea right so I would think at a high enough

[00:30:10] GeForce part of that high heart rate is stroke volume has gone way down because preload is way down again I sorry I should make sure every understands what we're saying um when you fill the heart less with blood um you don't stretch the muscles out that's called preload so the heart needs to be preloaded with lots of blood volume so it can get a good squeeze and anything that prevents that either dehydration or literally forces that are preventing the blood returning to the heart could make you know make that high heart rate really a product of tiny tiny little uh ineffective beats yes um and that's also we we we've done some studies on that actually just also there are Al some other very in high gForce athletes no actually in in in say in similar because it's quite interesting to see that what happens also with the muscles so when when obviously when you come over a certain uh so when you do work or do when you do you produce a certain amount of power obviously two there are forces involved and there is velocity involved these forces uh requires a certain amount of recruitment of muscle fibers and these muscle fibers at a certain point will actually start to cause vasel constrictions so they actually start squeezing off the blood supply they normally Act as a pump they actually help pumping blood around in the body promoting uh preloading but the interesting thing is that we do see that where you also get in the area of anerobic tral is actually where you are starting to come to the point where you're squeezing off the blood flow as well in the muscles and this happens around ball Parish obviously there is a fairly large Ranger but ball parkage around 30% of your one

[00:31:56] RM so there you got another way so you should never experience that on a bike right because in theory you know it's hard to imagine you could ever come close to 30% of a 1rm force on a pedal stroke Could you um that's true yeah that's true well well I mean maybe there's an extreme moment you're you're at a 16% grade or something like that I guess it's possible huh yeah for sustained efforts obviously you can for short efforts you can get very very close but but but but but for sustained ones yes I would agree um but coming back to coming back to uh uh running versus uh running versus the bike uh so which was the let's say the place where you where it started um normally I would say that yes in in running uh you would at least a submaximal efforts have a higher uh view to

[00:32:54] Max the only thing is that we see that in people that are less say somewhat balanced train so they do they spend I say a fair bit they spend some time on the bike they spend some time on running then normally there are more muscles involved for a longer duration in cycling than it is in running so when you test Christian or Gustaf if you were to have them fresh on two separate days and on one day you put them on the bike and on one day you put them on the treadmill and you have them do a V2 Max test what would be the approximate difference you would you would see in them uh actually when I started working with them then it was then it was uh then it was close to a significance significant difference between uh cycling and running and even more in swimming so then higher in swimming no lowest lowest in swimming actually and that comes also back also to one other thing also because one thing is also when we talk about preloading and how how this also affects it one thing that also is is is um uh one have what what I actually work stupid enough to to teach

[00:33:59] Christian and Gustav this in long time ago and that is if they wanted to have a very high view to Max obviously if you're trained you will see this immediately on the breathing patterns but if you are if you basically what you can do to to create an artificially High View to Max is that you basically you you when you come pretty close to your your allout effort if you try to restrict your breathing let's say for a short short time there you will create a depth and this depth will actually boost the numbers even higher but so this is our this is the V2 Max hack for everybody watching how do I boost my cuz my my hack for boosting V2 Max is weight loss right it's like yeah just figure out a way to lose five pounds in the week leading up to the test and you're you know it goes up and obviously knowing how to train for it right I mean if you train in those intervals so you're saying if you restrict breathing um as you get close to that failure

[00:34:51] Point each Breath You Take becomes that much more of an oxygen explosion and and and even there you can even train your itself also to the point where it will have a you're not talking about marginal differences in your V2 you can Spike the numbers up to extreme numbers if if you if you practice this a little bit that aside I think it's important here to remember that that's not equivalent to getting fitter it's just a way of basically manipulating something in the body and you're cheating a protocol yeah um and it's not your let's say V to

[00:35:21] Max for those listening to this who have a bet with their friends about who's going to have the highest V2 Max this becomes their little trick yes then definitely you can do this and you will get some really nice numbers that's that's true how how much of a a boost would you get like let's say you're a person who just doing the protocol normally is 60 yeah what what with with no other change other than this breathing trick what would you take that to I I think also one one thing I want to add here just before answering that because I think also here is V to Max for me uh in the same way as power you can look at it in relative terms and absolute terms as well so obviously losing weight and let say it's 5 L and based on the weight that comes out to 60 yeah so I would say that in this case here uh it will probably it comes very much down to technique but if you practice this a little bit that you can boost it above 70 what not a problem wow I thought you were going to say 64 65 or something like that I I I I've seen I've seen some

[00:36:21] I've seen some crazy numbers it is basically I don't need I don't even have to go into the raw dollar you just see it on the screen I say okay now he now he's playing wait a minute though it doesn't that sort of fly in the face of our definition of E2 Max which is it's the highest oxygen consumption you sustain for one minute and I mean because to me that would be like because

[00:36:41] I know when I do my test um I think I'm always checking for 60-second average and I'm not ever just looking at the peak so because it's it's very noisy data so in this breathing technique don't you just get a really big spike that is otherwise noise in the one minute best effort and no so it would be a little bit more prolonged than that if you create if you create a an oxin uh depth in in your body but one thing that

[00:37:09] I think also here is important to because this is also one of the things that is a little bit challenging when you read a lot of research too is that very often we take that research for for for granted or it's good and then there there is a lot of things that around it that we don't have access to or we don't know and also one thing that also is sometimes a challenge is for people to understand also whether the technology they are using one is it good for what you really are doing here so you can get a lot of machines that can do measure some kind of uh oxygen uptake or ratios and other things but it doesn't mean that it necessarily is a good instrument for what you want to do and the second part of it also is that we have to understand like where are we measuring and obviously in this case when we do oxygen measurement we measure it on the exhaust and not in the muscles like and that's also an an important difference here because if we go to the point and I think maybe we we're going to run out of time if we continue on this path here but if if if basically you look at uh cell or or basically cell respiration the numbers you'll you'll see there in well it's since I remember this from our last discussion we're we're not limited at the cell no so so again here I think it comes more down to just staying true to some principles that yeah and that mean that obviously a great like the good thing with VI to max testing is that they're the generally um accepted standard for doing this is a graded exercise test and and you go through that and it will produce fairly um comparable numbers uh for most people to relate to there will be some differences what are some of the mistakes you want people to look out for because again people listening to this podcast are no stranger to V2 Max we talk about it as an Inc you know if you were going to sort of say I need to know 10 parameters of my body for Optimal

[00:39:01] Health V2 Max is on that list every day of the week yes so if even if you are listening to this and you don't care about triathlons or cycling or swimming but you just have the desire to live as long as you can and as well as you can you have to know your V2 Max and you need to optimize it and make it frankly as high as you can with whatever time you're willing to devote to training that said most people aren't going to go out and buy a V2 master and they're not going to you know geek out and do this stuff on their own they're going to rely on going to a place where the V2 Max is measured in a stationary fashion either on a treadmill or on a bike what are some things that those folks need to be aware of when they go to a center to test this as far as mistakes that people make so for example

[00:39:40] I've seen many people go and do a test and I talked to them after and I go how exhausted were you at the end of the test and they say well it was okay I could have kept going and I'm realizing okay you didn't do a maximal test um other mistakes I've seen are people who don't have a long enough warm-up time you know the the the total test took 5 minutes and I'm like well you didn't you didn't come close to sufficiently warming up so are there any other things that you would just have people have in the back of their mind when they call a place up to say hey I want to come and do a VO2 max test but before I give you my hundred bucks I want to understand the protocol yeah and then of course the question becomes also to what extent you're able to to influence this as well because there are some practices that they they want to done in a very rigorous way they even almost prescribe what you should do the days leading before and then other where you just come in and they just put you through a test and then you get what you get so what should folks look for if you were sending somebody to just a a public place where they could go and do this they're not coming into your lab where you're going to administer the test um what would you want them to be looking for so uh what I would normally do is is a one I would try to create as some standardized protocol from time to time and that means not only the testing itself but also what happens a little bit before without it it becomes too invasive into people's lives like standardizing what you do the days before and all these kind of things I think this is Impractical for most people like if this is a very important metric for you like the like one of the key metrics you use in order to understand how have the previous period influenced you and you looking for marginal changes then then it becomes very important also how you standardize the days before but I would say for a normal person I would say that I would uh keep a standardized protocol for how so I would come in there let's say at least trying to eat pretty much the same uh every time I go there and that means uh that means making sure you are well fueled as if you were going to do a important training session that means um normally more carbohydrates make sure you're well hydrated and obviously also that you are um to the extent you can influence it or you can you should be able to influence it but make sure that you also had a proper sleep so you don't come in like completely tired and things like this reasonably well rested Maybe not the would you or like training the day I would say that as long know I this is where I would say more it's more important to use your experience and to to to have enough understanding of what makes you set up for a good test the day after so for some some people that exercis is uh irregular and and there are more time in between obviously if you're going to do a little bit harder exercise the day before anything like this you'll come into the session and you even you even feel sore in the muscles this is not ideal necessarily for the ability to mobilize uh for other athletes uh that are well trained then it's completely different then it's more like okay how what would I do the day before a competition or anything like this doesn't have to be an elite level but more like you think a little bit like what do I want to do in order to to make sure that I I've gone through the different stuff and I feel ready for the day after so on the day of the test itself I would I would one is important timing of the day this is important to try to keep somewhat consistent I would say because of the Circadian rhythm you know that for example your your uh temperature levels in your body this fluctuates this is maybe one of the easiest observable differences in a human basically as a call it as an indirect measure of the Circadian rhythm where we basically see that you have a minimum point that happens typically in the morning just before you wake up and then you have a maximum Point typical in the afternoon and there is of course plenty of research suggesting that aerobic exercises are best done normally a little bit in the afternoon when you are typical also around the highest uh highest uh core temperature or natural core temperature the minimum point is easy to measure so for people that has the like like now it's become very popular like in inour France and other places trons you see these people they run around with this little temperature temperature device on on on their body um uh and it's very easy to observe if you use it 24/7 this is very easy to observe basically when your minimum point is the maximum point is influenced can let's say can be masked by noise and other things activities and other things you do so it's a little bit harder to see where it is but let's say you put them 12 hours apart as as a as a guiding tool but now I'm already getting to the point where it gets a little bit let's say more detail but I would just say keep the timing of the day the same so it really doesn't matter if you do it in the afternoon or you do it in the morning as long as you keep it consistent uh then uh from there I would do a proper warmup that's important how long do you think that should be for uh a an untrained for for a person who's like modestly trained let's assume we're not doing this on someone completely untrained but someone who's you know recreationally trained versus relatively

[00:44:33] Elite so again here I would do a warm-up much in the same way I would do uh training session so I would I would normally stick to a standardized warm-up protocol where you start out maybe for example 6 minutes very easy this can even be walking then I would do or or basically pedaling soft pedaling then I would do six minutes with a little bit more effort but it typical it should be more something that you would be comfortable doing uh as your long sessions that that that you do so if you are out and you do like say the longest sessions you do is an hour and obviously if they're all out then it would be a little bit too hard but then you should more aim for something I could do for like this would be an easy session for me but I could do it for some while you could for some people say this is your

[00:45:12] Marathon let's say b or where you do more of a like longer rides and then I would do a short effort around 3 minutes uh that sits somewhere where I wouldn't at this time I wouldn't look too much on my power meter or or my heart rate or anything but more by feeling where you feel okay this is where my normally where my thres would be and then I would probably also do let's say a couple of short short efforts um that are let's say progressively towards VI to Max so let's say one two three maybe two to three efforts that are somewhere between uh 10 10 15 seconds with with with with with equal rest in between and the reason for this for this is that it's easy thing but don't you exhaust yourself now before you do the V2 Max then well no you don't uh there are two there are two let's say the little fatigue or let's say the little fatigue that you possibly would induce with this is easily offset by other factors that will much more contribute to your V2 Max in when you start doing this so that means also that after I've done this one

[00:46:16] I would just again go back to easy very short easy effort so you's you get a total warm up of 20 minutes something like this in between there take a toilet break or anything like this but don't keep this rest too long because obviously now you're going to cool down again if you don't go to your V2 Max test now so that means also like have a small sip of water something like this if you want to do that also before you start your warm up it can be good things if you have something carbohydrate based you consume a little bit of that some people would say ah I don't like this because it could it could influence the depending on how you do this influence the RQ yeah uh but then again this is something I would say that sub maximal yes maximal it won't do that very much because at the closer you get to your your your metabolic steady state or maximum metabolic steady state and then above basically things starts to basically hom yeah we tend to do these separately now so we don't use the day of the V2

[00:47:12] Max test to do the fuel partitioning test um so we want to measure fat oxidation on a totally different day um like we'll usually separate by a day even right so you'll do your V2 Max test on Monday and we'll do it like this kind of way where we you know again agre completely like you should have all the carbs in the world we actually like to standardize the fat oxidation test to a fasting test okay and just that way it's just always the same it's like you're going to do it in the morning you're fasted um it's a submaximal effort we're not pushing you to maximum uh because we're just we're just pushing to see what your maximum fat oxidation is I think this is a good way to to to open up let's say a little bit the door to to how we where we are because again we are at the edge cases where basically we don't have we have to do the research ourself but one thing that you what one thing we have to consider is that basically when we do this kind of when we do gas exchange measurements for example to understand a little bit uh substrate metabolism and and what's what's your preferred inlab test do you use parvo no we we use uh uh device which is uh it's an actually I'm still on all device there are two devices I like to use one is the Yager oxyon Pro with a mixing chamber and this is important yeah uh the par has a mixing chamber as well but but we have the oxyon Jagger Pro and when I've been testing in the US for example on Elite athletes Olympic athletes then we have used the parv simply because that's the one that has been here Europe is more used yagger uh we don't use the well maybe I shouldn't say that we don't use the to CPX which is the successor of of

[00:48:45] Yager Oxon Pro um but um this this is this is one of the devices uh we use also the AEI moxes but this is more of a call it um for specially interested people uh and then we use we use also the V2 Master actually quite significantly and more and more of the testing actually have gone over to the V2 Master we have been fortunate enough to work with them for some while so we have the C the let's say the CO2 version as well but this is where it uh let's say it has been in

[00:49:16] Alpha mode and it requires also completely different skills than what you would normally require but um the reason also why we do that is again also for one of the reasons you experience is that you see that your V2 Max is maybe a little bit different when you are out in cycling and do efforts and it's not inside a laboratory because also we have to remember that V2 Max is is on the one side we say it's the highest oxygen consumption over normally as say normalize over one minute we that is a result of how much muscles that are involved in the work there so obviously modality will influence this quite quite a bit as well so that's also why there is which is why I was surprised when you said the guys were lower in swimming than cycling and running even though I realize that their efficiency in swimming is relative to the world's best less than it is in cycling and running where they would be closer to the world's Elite um but I would have just thought more muscles would have meant higher O2 consumption yeah so so actually let me shed some light on it because I said like I started with actually just on that one that was basically when I started working with

[00:50:18] Christian and gustab where they are today is that basically there are virtually no difference between swimming cycling and running it's it's it's same Max more or less on the the three disciplines but it has again to do exactly like you said you can manipulate your V2 Max by that you're targeting let's say typically shorter duration efforts and so you you you you you start recruiting more learn to recruit a little bit more and also train uh let's say fibers that you are not normally used to use so much and this is also something that is highly plastic much more plastic than we ever have thought it was before to the point where we we have a one of the we have yeah we we have some uh leading researchers in in

[00:50:58] Norway that have they've solely focused on V2 Max and let's say they they went into schools where they done this for decades uh but where we even sat down and we looked at the data and thought something has to be wrong here and that comes actually from the period when we switched from Tokyo at Olympics and then onto Ironman and basically we saw a decline in V2 Max for me not unexpected but more like there hasn't been dat on this so it was actually quite nice to to the decline how much so the decline uh in absolute or let's say in relative view to Max and so it makes more sense for people is that Christian and gusta typically like the highest numbers we have had on them are are very very high uh highest numbers ever measured in history but I mean 90 well

[00:51:42] Christian uh we've had measurements with him actually and invalidated uh but on him we we we have exceeded um in absolute terms 7.7 7.8 L per minute in auction uptake so at what 75 kilos uh no so then he at that time he was around 80 kg so just let's say around around uh 100 ml per minute per kilogram in auction uptake uh so uh Gustav is a little bit smaller so he has a little bit a little bit lower uh oxy oxygen uptake than than than what Christian have but he has t he has at the highest he clocked in around let's say 94 4 ml per minute per kilogram something like this at the highest but I would say that this is not beneficial for what they are doing of course yeah for again I I I realize that just I mean I think anybody who's done this type of testing and done this kind of work it's um they'll have an appreciation for what those numbers mean which is to say I'm trying to come up with an analogy for another sport to explain what that would be that would sort of be like just I don't I don't know how to compare it to non-endurance sports right like it's

[00:52:57] I don't know it's like it's like it's like saying um and in an NBA basketball game occasionally they score 100 points like it it just doesn't it's it's it's like it doesn't it it doesn't compute it doesn't it doesn't really compute um that that that they could that they could utilize that much oxygen yeah so the interesting thing there and the good thing about it is that this was something we we we we reproduced over three months but the train tring at that time was presumably geared specifically towards V2 maximization it was short distance it was interval based well actually yes it was uh but this is also where uh one of the things that is that

[00:53:40] I I one place I I I I I where we resonate a lot is that we both like V2 Max is the single best metric we probably have for anything that is related to human health and performance um but it is a little bit more nuanced than it is also where we understand that there a little bit more Nuance than that I'm I'm not talking about it as pure as a predictor for your race performance because that's a different domain but where you could also say that you could still be healthier with a little bit lower vew to

[00:54:09] Max and I'm now I'm not talking because about that you put yourself to some stress and all things like this so that's becomes negative longer term but it h but it's it's vew to Max is a one-dimensional also unit again we talk about something on a y- axis yes we normalize it as a millit per minute so you could say that has a second access to it on xaxis or time access to it as well but we don't say how long over with duration don't get into capacity exactly and this means also that you can trade off some of your

[00:54:39] V2 Max uh and and I would say that the best the very very best predictor is capacity like capacity is maybe the single best one for everything but the problem is that testing for for capacity is such a Brute Force Endeavor that it it's not practical it it it is really not practical that's why V to Max is the most like I would say is the single best predictor of everything in a measured in a practical way uh but for for Christian what was really nice when we when we did this this is not only it was not only actually where we measured and and I can say that we are at Edge where there are things here we don't understand there are still things we are researching and like you said introductory I'm in the applied world and in the applied World means basically uh much more experimentation and understanding what happens here with some individuals my sample size doesn't come from the population it comes from the share amount of data that I gather on these at so it's not like a single view to Max test it is so many view to Max tests that there's probably no other human in history where they have been through this testing protocols over time and where we where we can correlated to also a range of other uh metrics as well both uh uh internally but also external metrics and that means that for example here to give to put this into context the good thing is that when we do testing I normally not only have

[00:56:05] Christian into the lab I have also minimum of let's say one or two athletes as well into the lab and our Protocols are quite extensive so this is also one thing that you we already talked about that protocols can have an influence on testing and what you do before the protocol will have an influence on your

[00:56:20] V2 Max that's exactly why we're discussing should you warm up or should you not warm up yes you should because it would normally give you let's say a better result when you are warmed up but that means also that the protocol will also have can also then have an influence on your vew to Max measurements and we normally do the view to Max measurements at the end of our test which is you would say ah but that's normal yes well we also do that simply because it also more normally simulates what they're also going to see in on racing so normally what happens in racing is that you normally also will go closer to let's say complete exhaustion when you get towards the end of the race and this is why it's interesting to test it there but we don't only test it like once we even repeat it so we do two vi2

[00:57:01] Max test just 10 minutes apart and even this year we did even three tests let's say with let's say with less than or 10 minutes apart as well interesting thing here is that what we see is that you normally don't get your highest view to Max on the first one even though you exhausted we even see that even in in second one more interestingly to also just observe here is that then you would think that I say intuitively you can say that okay uh you would maybe also then see a higher carbon dioxide production as well don't that's actually lowered that has to let's say call it some priming effects in in more in general terms but also what we do see is that there are some substrates as well that actually do influence or micronutrients also that actually also can help boost your V to Max as well such as long story short uh beetroots obviously have been like something that people have found quite interesting over a long time beatroot beetroot yeah uh so they use beetroot concentrates and and the main let's say think let's say behind this is that when you take when you when you eat nitrate so which beetro is normally rich in uh and the body let's say uh uh converts this to nutric oxide this helps D for for vation so so V delation you can think of this almost like a Plumping so in our in our body we already said that from our previous conversation that basically cell respiration is not the limitation to your V to Max so there are other things that are limiting factor uh that means also that for example your cardiovascular uh system meaning also actually your ability to transport blood around in your body is going to be important so the reason for why for example one of the reason for why uh when when you then use um some uh supplements like uh uh that that are highly enriched in nitrat so you get a nitric oxide boost is the this with actually it's almost like Plumbing you're opening up the plumbing and it allows you to blow to say to circulate faster throughout your body uh but one of the things is this is hard to reproduce in Elite atlet like in amateur atlet we normally see that this has a positive effect how much should have an effect oh uh then I have to go back and look a little bit on on on the stud for real effect like 5% something measurable let's say something like that and then take that with a this is a supplement these are these are not people that are out there literally eating endless beetroots you could buy as a supplement and yeah concentrate so now would it be anything increases nitric oxide so that's the thing because one thing that we we don't see this we don't see this effects in in in in Elites for example and this is obviously one of the benefits when we do a more longitudinal studies with such let's say granularity and indepth measurements we do and one of the things we see there is that when they used uh because uh betro concentrate or nitr nitrates are considered erogenic Aid um but when you do all these measurements we we leave out the guess work and we see well over all the testing we do we have not seen a real effect out is at least not on V2 Max maybe other places but it doesn't seem to have any effect because they're already optimized in that regard Pro probably probably maybe or maybe there are other limiting factors instead so then we we were approached by a company in uh that is called plasma and they actually focus more on the other part of it actually the C let's say the Catalyst that actually let's say help because you have to convert nitrate into nitric oxide and there's a cost to this so what they did instead is that they made um uh from Pine bark extracts instead they made a adaptogen or they extract an adaptogen that helps cataliz this process and the interesting thing with this uh with this adaptogen is that again now we are a place where we don't have we can just look at the observations and repeated observations over time and we can't necessarily explain 100% yet so it becomes more speculations but from those what what what we can only speculate or or hypothesize is that what happens here when they use this plasma is that I remember when we got this first presented I was thinking like okay we we we we've tested nitric oxide or nitrate it really didn't give an help so why should this really give a help or basically give any make a difference the interesting thing is that Christian and gusta were quite positive so they say okay fine we're going to use this we we're just going to test we had a bunch of them laying around there and they say okay let's let's try it I said okay fine uh Christian or gusta was the first one to say immediately that he felt it did something with his respiration but he couldn't and then also it's a little bit the placebo as well of like okay how much of this is Placebo how much of this is real like you get something new and oh yeah maybe and you're looking for something in your body and and and

[01:01:54] Christian also but he he observed a little bit like a different effect to him he felt more like he normally uh felt quicker ready for the next effort using this but I would say that these record measurements that we did came in let's say in the in the tail of when we started using this and that was a little bit the shock because what we also saw at the same time was that the efficiency so the biochemical efficiency in the body also went down the the interesting thing was the RQ was heavily on the CO2 side was was uh slightly uh reduced the

[01:02:30] V2 were heavily increased tell folks what RQ is and what the reduction would imply uh I would say we are talking of let's say that at the end normally you would say that uh for a V2 Max test to be valid like one of the criteria is that you shouldn't meet like 1.1 in RQ so meaning basically me you have 10% more production of CO2 than consumption of oxygen yes in Elite athletes this is sometime hard like in the best trained

[01:02:56] Elite atlet bringing them to 1.1 during the test this can actually be quite challenging so if you have a short warm up protocol they are not well warmed up and all these kind of things then you would be easily be able to exceed this but if you do it more in a simulation like we did or you have longer protocols before you normally see that this is a little bit surpressed so let's say that

[01:03:13] Christian normally on a V2 Max test or let's say at the end of the V2 Max effort he would he would he would basically click in at let's say 105 and after we started using these supplements we could see suddenly not 103 or 102 we basically dropped it by 10 points so basic to 0.95 but preserving the V2 no so CO2 was basically not as much changed so the V2 was increasing yes so V2 went up quite a bit so first obvious but the good thing here is that now I have two other athletes obviously in the lab at the same time so I have one atlet comes in before Christian so I already do the dynamic calibration of the machines before I we have a lot we also have a long simulator just because we are working with Edge Edge cases so we need to independently validate the machines as well so this means basically we have a large gas tank with a reference gas and then you Bas in like beyond what is used for just a calibration but we have a separate system where it basically have a lung simulator where we feed in for example 6 L of oxygen 6 L of CO2 and we know this is the exact amount in in the bottle gravimetrically calibrated and then if we don't get this out of the machine then then there's something wrong with the machine independently of the calibration but the good thing here is that uh despite this first added in numbers are where you expect them to be depend let's say based on the training we did before Christian comes in basically we start to see some numbers that are crazy and you start to look like did I did I do something wrong here in the calibration process or anything like this but then also when you validated afterwards uh as well you basically know this is the numbers are good and then this we did then over a couple of uh we did this this was in

[01:04:49] December January and February over nine tests more or less we saw a little bit over time that actually V2 Max started to come down a little bit because what this indicated also was that his biochemical efficiency was not optimal either what that means again is that if you look at basically his oxygen consumption versus his power so so the power power was higher as well but the ratio was not the same as it was before V2 had gone up much more than the power not well yeah well well enough suggesting efficiency is going down yes efficiency going down and this was then uh uh that means that okay so if efficiency go down well how can can we somehow get an understanding of this and this of course on these test they actually are using a temperature pill so we put a pill up their ass uh and also at the same time we have multiple of core sensors around in the body to also measure the temperature of the body as well and where we basically see the same thing we basically see an increased heat production for the same power output basically indicating the same you can basically think of that the reason why you have gas exchange is because we call this indirect so it's like it's not useful oxygen it's actually the worst thing you could possibly have because you're also utilizing more fuel so now you've created a scenario where for the same amount of power not just you need more oxygen oxygen is free you're going to need more glucose uh well actually not more glucose but because since the since the RQ here is basically uh also now in favor you actually are able to oxidize more fats oh that's interesting yeah so you're saying because the RQ came in the same you're going to hold carbohydrate metabolism constant and you're actually increasing fat oxidation yes and that works out perfectly in the stochiometry uh pretty close it's counterintuitive it's counterintuitive well if we go this is like this is a rabbit hole I would like to go down into but but but but we'll D gently we'll Del very gently for the four people that are still listening to us yeah because the diff also the difficulty with this is that you'll if you just look at purely the RQ of where basically the threshold is as well for elite athletes or for any athlete that you have in the laboratory like from some literature you would just said okay if you have an AR let's say around again talking about thresholds a lot of like it it's you'll find several places in in research literature where they basically just use an RQ of 0.96 as a proxy for your anerobic threshold for example yeah but this is something that you also see is different if you basically take an athlete in your training for short course or basically for sprinting you will basically see that then basically you are have an RQ that is higher than 0.96 if you go to extreme endurance at this this actually gets closer to 0.94 93 92 even so the implication of this is that if you then measure the lactic threshold you will actually come into a

[01:07:38] Zone already at 0.92 0.93 where you actually starting just as a function of time now you'll get a higher laced concentration in your body and if you take that lactic concentration now and you and you calculate the volume of lactate that is available in your body you'll actually see that the volume of lactate now becomes a significant contributor to actually your energy production but you have to know plasma volume pretty well to make that calculation right yes so plasma volume but this is a good thing we have our own machine for measuring carbon carbon monoxide rebreed so we do regularly also testing of basically their blood volume plasma volume and hemoglobin mass as well in when we do this testing as well and of course you want to know also uh something about the water content in the body as well but this you can there are different W go stand is probably double label water and we've done this as well but the point is that what to to to give you to give you an example um you can easily um easily at 0.92 0.93 go from let's say if you consider normal laced levels or let's say and if if we then take it into volumes it would mean that let's say your let's say energy um energy that or the energy contribution from from l dat could be for example five but if you just stay long enough there basically you would say that okay if this were the levels you're talking about now 13 14% ngg contribution from lactate and the problem with this is that all the tables we have today which basically look as a ratio where you use

[01:09:10] RQ to say something about the ratio between carbohydrates and fats we normally say that well this is good up to an R of one but above one we don't do it anymore because exactly lack dat and other things becomes a too large in contributor to it so this already tells us that we have to be also cautious when we look at RQ and just go let's say crudely into a table and just say Okay this means this is your fat metabolism this is your carbohyd metabolism because it is do you feel we can do that safely up to one no not even no no no no not even I would say that for for for elite athletes if you're endurance athlete I would already say that I would start I would already start uh be skeptical around let's see in the low 90s very interesting so where sorry one other question there where are you seeing what

[01:09:57] RQ are you typically seeing for maximum fat oxidation not obviously percent of fat oxidation which is low but in absolute grams per minute Max fat oxidation at an elite athlete who's on a high carb diet you're typically seeing that at what RQ oh then I have that's that that's a longer time since I basically really paid a lot of attention to that because

[01:10:23] I would have to imagine that that corresponds very closely to their race Pace wouldn't it no because here it also gets a little bit more complicated simply because one of the things we do because we also we also do isotope is isotope tracing also of uh of substrates as well so we use we have used quite a lot of uh carbon 13 or 13 carbon over the last years uh and we added that as a tracer to uh glucose and fructose for example to look at basically how or basically how much of exogenous carbohydrates or to to use some more common term how much of the carbohydrates that you you that you ingest that you're able to utilize because obviously you have you have gly and your own fatty acid yeah and and then basically you you won't understand how much com and this is also where exactly when you look at even V2 Max this starts also to become where you understand that in our context this is a little bit of um less valuable less Val purely because if you took Christian for for example or gusta and you tested them just before race you went to so you did exactly the protocol we just talked about did like the stepto warm up just a couple of short effort just to make your body ready then you did graded excise test to

[01:11:41] VI to Max okay fine you went out you did your racing and then basically at the moment you come over the Finish Line you test this again or even half an hour afterwards I don't think that it would matter a little bit but not that much you will basically see the race pace is actually now coming to the point where it's extremely close like your utilization from the beginning of the race to the end of the race have completely changed like significantly you're saying fuel utilization yes your not only your fuel utilization but also actually at where your but that would also imply fuel utilization but also your threshold sits now so closer this this is hilarious it was about an hour ago that we got off on this tangent in response to what you said which was at the most elite level their race pace is above 90% of their V2 Max yeah for maratonas for atast maratonas yes and also for Christian and Gustav in in in when they do Iron Man racing this is getting let's say indoors domain we can't we can't push it we can't push it all the way because it has some this is just impossible for me to wrap my head around right this means that someone whose V2 Max is 5 lers per minute if they're Elite which means they're obviously pretty light they're they're going to spend an entire

[01:12:58] Iron Man at 4.5 lers per minute no the thing is that what will happen here is that this will actually come down so your V2 Max the V2 Max is declining and therefore it's okay okay that's that's what I wanted to make sure of Cu I was like how in the hell can they hold 4.5 lers per minute or in their case 7.2 L per minute so this is the difference this is the interesting thing because this is the difference the consequence of aiming for Iron Man is that you want to have min minimal decline in this yes and you need a lower V2 Max because it has to do with priority and training you can't prioritize having like a high one minute power or five minute power simply because it's too far away from specificity of what you really need there so if you start do building good sessions with where you basically are looking to increase your one minute power five minute power that's obviously going to have a cost for the whole week that you are doing of training yeah so so so let's talk about that now in the context of the Olympics right so so you talk about an athlete like

[01:13:54] Christian or stuff where in theory they want to be able to go between three distances in theory Olympic distance half Iron Man Iron Man yes let's remind people what the distance is Olympic is 1.5 km swim 40 km bike 10 km run Elites are doing this in an hour 45ish yeah okay half Iron Man is well let's just do

[01:14:19] Iron Man 2.4 M swim so 4K swim 3.8k yep swi yep 112 bike so 180k bike y Marathon run 42k yeah the best in the world are doing this in sevenish seven and a half what are they doing it in yeah seven seven like Christian is so actually the record holder still he actually did that on his debut and his still stands um but what was the time seven then it was that was 721 seven and a half to eight hours and then half Iron Man is you take that every one of those last distances and you cut it in half so just under 2 km

[01:14:58] Swim 90k Bike uh and call it a 21k run so roughly twice the Olympic distance in some regards Less in others um and again they're doing this in three and a half hours y so these are three very different events is it possible to be elite in all of them uh so this also this is also quite quite interesting because um one of the main differences I would say that differs them as let's say call them as um or compare to the specialists in the in the sports is actually not their metabolism if you look at their uh V2 Max on running cycling and uh swimming you will actually see that they are equally or higher than than their peers in those spots but their efficiency is not the same and this comes probably most down to the fact that they have to do three different sports you you you don't get the the same time of just pure stimulus mechanical stimulus from from doing something and optimizing it because you have to change and it also has some priorities also as well you kind like in in running you could say you want to have uh you don't want to compromise on your leg stiffness at all in cycling this is a little bit more beneficial to do this for example so here you have to strike a balance between the tree which makes it very complex but in in swimming they are higher than the than the highest V2 Max that I measur on on Elite swimmers in the world but the difference is also I had the the efficiency is unbelievable in difference it is it is so poor it is so poor it's actually funny uh I think we talked about this last time like I I had one of the best swimmers in the world in The Flume and tested him and he is a big guy 195 100 kilogram close 100 kilograms muscles all over and then Christian in in in Into

[01:16:45] The Flume at the same basically same velocity I don't remember exactly what this velocity is now but basically this big guy and The Flume is an endless pool it's it's a it's a stationary swimming pool Endless Pool where often people think of this a counter current where there's a lot of turbulence in here we are talking about something which is this is a this is virtually laminer flow that goes through so it's a big Canal which is circulating the water on the outside it comes back in the front and you have even honeycom structures in the front and the back truly replicates swimming stationary so it's the closest thing we have to an aot tunnel for swi same yeah yeah does it allow you to use dye in the water or anything like that bubbles I assume you use to you can yeah yeah so so the thing the thing here is that when you look at these two guys now swimming so you put them at the same speed same speed okay and and and and and and uh the elite swimmer he is even retired um he is basically consuming 25 he's first of all like Christian 8 kilograms this guy closer to 100 kilograms and that's not because of fats like he is lean he's well trained still and he's so all things equal he should be much higher in his VO2 at that moment more muscle much more muscles involved and bigger like bigger proportions he's utilizing 25% less oxygen than Christian in an absolute term in absolute terms yeah so this is this is so on a relative basis a third less oxygen yeah yeah yeah which is still crazy yeah yeah here's my thesis on swimming I think of all the main of all the three big Endurance Sports I feel like swimming has the most potential for r radical change in Performance Based on drag avoidance right so so all all of these sports but especially swimming and cycling come down to propulsion versus drag running is less so because these speeds aren't high enough relative to air obviously swimming just so people listening understand why I would say that swimming is much slower than running but the density of water is what is it 1300 times that of air so you don't need a high V squared to get a lot of drag just based on the density of the medium you're in which is water so in that sense cycling and um and especially swimming really come down to this ability to avoid drag right and that's why in a time trial you know position matters so much on a bike and how can you generate power even if you have to compromise your power there so it's I feel like in swimming there could be like a massive breakthrough if a technique emerged that reduced output or power or forward propulsion by 10% but reduced drag by 20% you know what I mean like I I just again I'm so far from the sport I don't know but like to me I I would really be curious as to that because again remember this happened in cycling in the 80s where prior to that nobody was paying attention to bike position and then Franchesco Moser comes along in 1984 smashes the one-hour record with all this crazy Arrow equipment and then of course you got into Borman and all these guys getting into more and more crazy Arrow positions where their actual power went down relative to what they could have been in a in a less kinked position but of course their speed went up because the the you know the CDA goes down and I just wonder like do you ever think about that in swimming which is like is there is there some major disruption where we just have this dramatic change in technique to have a bigger positive impact on frontal surface area than the negative effect it might have on propulsion yeah so this this then touch us up on let's say uh one of my favorite

[01:20:24] Ara and that's bio feedback in cycling we have extremely good tools for Bio feedback today you have a power meter and you have a GPS so just these two combined for example speed and power perfectly like we we talked about last time when you were out riding 200 wats constant and basically you see you getting faster so you you have this direct bio feedback because you as long as you ride enough you will basically start to get a very good feeling for when you sit at a certain power and you start do different things sudden you creep up like half a kilometer power or one like for person when it start start cycling or they cyc a little bit like for them they it doesn't become interesting enough yet because there are other things that is basically more challenging for them to to master but for people that do a lot of biking like yourself it it's it's it's it's where you exactly start to pay let's say attention to those let's say even half a kilometer per hour maybe even you're getting below that as well where you start to really pay attention to this um and then over time simply Al because wind and other factors makes a difference too running this is also a place where we have have really good biof feedback tools you have your watch you running and you can have a look at it and now we have also really good power meters in running as well how does that work so most of these are there are some of these power meters in running today that requires some of them requires an insole so you put basic insole inside and they basically measure the force it's a force plate inside your shoe yeah and then you have other ones that are more motion capture devices so they basically you rather input your body weight and since basically when you're touching on the ground with one foot you're basically caring your whole weight there so as long as you have a good enough motion capture device that are capable of let's say detect or that are able to capture the three-dimensional accelerations you can then basically also say some well you know you know the force because you basically have to carry your weight so that's so but so you can directly measure this with a force plate um insole or you could indirectly do it with motion capture but I assume the motion capture only works on a treadmill you're not going to be able to no so the motion captures today they are become so small there are basically a small device that you tach you a shoe and they are when we validate these in are these commercially available products both of these yes so if you if you me if you if you go to a laboratory and you basically test this you will basically see that so we have been for a long time been working together with stride uh I started working with them when they were in beta stage and we've gone through there but basically they are so accurate today that when you when you um measure uh on an athlete first of all do you have any idea how much you just ruined my wife's life like do you have any so how many minutes do you think after this podcast am I going to be on my computer ordering these devices jamming them on her shoes you know she she's running the

[01:23:05] Boston Marathon next year and uh I'm convinced she's actually going to run it faster than she did her first Boston Marathon 20 years ago because she actually now works with a running coach and her qualifying time this year um was only one minute slower than her qualifying time 19 years earlier um and again it's just because she's more structured in her training not because she listens to a word I say she doesn't but she's like finally at least agreeing to use heart rate and velocity for Tempo training so now like she's not listening to this podcast obviously she one of her friends will probably hear this and tell her to listen but she is now we're we're going to implement power training for her running yes and she's going to curse me all day long because she doesn't want data but how could you not do how is every Runner not doing this I I think this has to do with with a lot with with tradition and also that even when power meters were introduced it's easy to look back and say like why why why didn't we have this before or even how power there's so much information we can extract from a single power meter today which is I say Beyond people's uh comprehension still we only use the power number that is there and we use it even in a onedimensional context FTP for example or critical power uh the amount of information you can get out of this is crazy because we are not going to talk about this today still kind of use normalized power and other no we never use it no we only go by raw numbers I only work by raw numbers all the time so

[01:24:33] I don't condense it down to a single metric I use only raw numbers but the the implication here is that uh even when you look at studies that are looking at gross gross efficiency for example in the old days or even today uh there are like one thing you consider is a net mechanical Power so the interface between basically looking at your gross mechan or let's say gross gross efficiency is where you take VI 2 and we already there most people understand that okay you have a difference between net net net oxygen consumption and gross oxygen consumption and you would ideally like to have the net oxygen consumption but there are other things there but in cycling actually also what we only consider there is the net mechanical

[01:25:10] Power you don't consider the gross mechanical Power and should you really look at the let's say on your biochemical efficiency you you should not look at the net mechanical Power you should look at the gross mechanical Power but that's even before we start to get into vectors power vectors Force vectors and other things uh even in a threedimensional plane as you do cycling because this is something we can extract from the P meters today so in running so in running yes so one of the you have you have more degrees of freedom there's more inefficiency there's probably a lower relationship or a more strained relationship between between gross and net power this is maybe one of the reasons for why it is not as widely adopted uh in in running as it is in cycling because it is still debated what really is running power how do you really quantify uh and this is something that even I I even discuss with with the with the team at Stride so when we we are having our regular calls and we are diving into the topic then even we also sometime um I would say have our different opinions on on on how this really should be looked at because if you want to translate this into running then you have to look at only at the let's say the propulsive power like could you imagine seeing this I mean have they put these in Olympic sprinters and seen the

[01:26:23] P numbers there no it has let's say put this way commercially available this has its limitations because since you do motion capture you need to do a little bit of filtering you can't you can't take out because it's going to be so much noise exactly because as you said you have so many degrees of of of

[01:26:38] Freedom if you're going to Output all let's say all the vectors that basically you were able to measure with let's say just with strain gauge based P meters on a bike today people wouldn't be able to utilize that's why you condense it down to a single P let's say single number that is there for most people but if you had that if you had that Force plate chip in their insole you could at least capture uh Force normalized to weight with each step right yes so what do what you can do and this is validated so if you for example run on a track a track which has Force plates or you run on

[01:27:08] Specialized treadmills that has Force plates integrated in them you will basically see that the curves are the same so this is the way let say this is the external validation of the device is good uh both in terms of that it captures uh the the the force curves but also here with when you have motion capture devices you can also capture the foot path as well so this is something we can visualize in 3D today after the event when you're doing running we can see what happened there fresh fatigued throughout race when it's Technical and other things but I think the reason why this is not as widely adopted is because in science this is still debated on how do we really capture how do we really capture and quantify uh mechanical or power for running stride have taken uh smart approach to this uh to make it let's say commercially viable and that is that they qu output it as a um let's say call it a metabolic power so if you actually went on a treadmill and you went running and you looked at it versus your oxygen consumption you will basically see that this this matches perfectly with cycling that's without having a bicycle near you at all so you can say well this is what you expect so when you at a certain power then this would have a certain metabolic cost but what how I use I I I don't like it because I don't like let's say modeled numbers I want to have a raw numbers so in my case I basically I'm extracting basically the let's say the net and the gross mechanical power or the positive and the negative mechanical Power because these are the components I want to have because I have V2 master I have metabolic devices so I I don't need a metabolic equivalent I want to have the raw because I'm using as an interface to

[01:28:37] Gorge the difference like for example on a Formula One car what really matters in the end there what hits the ground yeah what really matters in the end there is how fast can you go around the track for the full event with the a certain amount of fuel because there is a limitation to how much fuel you can have in your car like that's the that's the true input and the true out output your engine output in this kind of is actually secondary it's easy to think we want have the biggest engine but big engine without efficiency is still bad so this is the engine it becomes more of a device to measure let's say you look at the power and you look at how efficiently are you able to translate this fuel out into speed over let's say the event or velocity so uh the for me having access to the net mechanical

[01:29:18] Power and gross mechanical Power and then you have the metabolic devices this allow me to on the one side look at when we change something in running so let's say you change for example your shoes or you change your your training you can now I can have a much more granular understanding of am I influencing the biomechanical part of of of of the training or is it the biochemical part of the training but in order to do so you have to have that interface that basically let's say distinguishes between gross mechanical Power and net mechanical Power and the interface between gross mechanical Power and net mechanical Power is only the let's say work efficiency like how efficiently are you working but not metabolizing or or moving because you all in the end you have to take this power and and and and be able to Output into into into and can you if if you're looking at a cyclist for example can you make a a statement using something so simple so if you had 10 different cycl list and you all you did a VO2 max test on all of them and you each of them you end up getting a number which is going to be let's normalize it to weight so you line them up in rank order from the lowest to the highest in in milliliters per minute per kilogram and then you look at what power they were at when they achieved that V2 Max and you normalize that to weight to watts per kilogram it's not going to be a onetoone match the interesting thing is that when you are getting close to view to Max then it's getting close to a onet toone match actually but a submaximal it doesn't a submaximal you would normally see in running simply because it's a weightbearing uh sport wait just to make sure I understand that are you saying that the rank order will be identical for v2 Max and watts per kilo at V2 Max in uh in running uh in running and cycling at maximal effort so basically at V2 Max pretty much the same yeah but

[01:31:06] I feel like my personal power at V2 Max is lower than many other people's at a comparable V2 Max like I just feel like I'm very inefficient yep meaning I have I have a higher V2 Max than a pvo2 max if that makes sense yeah and that's because probably there is a lot of arobic contribution in there as well that basically supplies let's say that let's say that Gap that you observing there too oh you're saying I'm an aerobically not trained enough and that's why my power yeah yeah I'm too aerobic not anerobic enough yeah great

[01:31:38] Point that's a very interesting point so so so so the thing here is that at at for for Christian gusta obviously being Balan or we trying to keep exactly the training as balanced as possible between the three Sports there you will normally see at maximal effort that actually that the power also is pretty much the same um the let's say the mechanical Power is pretty much at the V2 Max but as you go submaximal effort then that's where you start to observe the big differences because in cycling you would see that uh as you go down in intensity um so let's say you go at how to to to explain this simply basically because it's a weightbearing weightbearing uh spot you would uh going from 15 to 16 km hour let's say 17 18 19 20 and and so on basically what you see but this is also observable exactly from metabolic cart as well and that is when you go at a let's say a low intensity you will see that your oxygen consumption also is higher at a perceived lower let's intensity in running that it is in cycling because cycling is not weightbearing so it's easy to go down to a very very low intensity still keep on normal Cadence because you can keep a Cadence of 80 90 for example and it feels comfortable feels comfortable and EAS in but going down to those kind of cadences running is Impractical because it means walking you not running anymore so you're walking so you can say the modality is changing more in running uh or let's say what what kind of muscles are involved are changing more in running than it does in cycling so this is this is um uh but coming coming back to the question original question of of basically why isn't this more uh U running it is gradually getting more and more attention there more and more people using it um I think what is still to be determined is to agree on let say on a common standard for what number should be outputed yeah I guess in cycling you know one could ask the question so when the guys are on the bike are they paying more attention so let's just talk about them doing a 4-Hour ride in an Iron Man are they more concerned with because you're triangulating between RP heart rate and power how are they prioritizing those things how they feel what the heart rate is and what the power meter says how are they regulating effort based on those things in a race in training or racing race oh in racing

[01:34:03] I would say that then they only because then we use also other sensors as or let's say in training we use also many more sensors and then we limit it a little bit more in racing simply because it's not practical to to to do it there um but I would say that uh in um this is also very interesting topic because then they touch a little bit more on psychology but we'll come back to that another time uh but uh in in racing obviously first and foremost you it's Iron Man racing is so long it's so long and with all this practice you know they say you shouldn't be be slave to the numbers for sure because you can have suddenly your hero day where you just are able to go faster than what you normally do so you need to listen to your body so I would maybe say that RP is the most the most important one you could say in in in some some senses RP is also a place where you can also talk about one dimension two Dimensions because RP is normally um let's say if you take kog when he when he did a two two-hour Marathon uh or sub 2our

[01:35:07] Marathon if you put them on a treadmill and you did a normal step test on him and you asked him when he was at 21 kilm per hour and you ask him how does this feel he would say so let's say that we we for the sake of the discussion we say that seven is round threshold or anerobic threshold something you could let's say if you related to FTP something you would be able to hold around an hour for well trained athlet or what you would test for when you did a 20 mm protocol and then you substract the 5% to extrapolate it to that if you asked him at 21 km power okay how do you feel here and he gives you an RP score he would maybe say ah this feels like a 6 when a 21 kilm power actually slightly above if you ask him at the end of a marathon how do you feel and he's still running the same Pace he will say probably 10 this is a nine to a 10 because we forget again there's another dimension and that is a duration let's say the fatigue component that comes in there that's why it also helps sometimes to ask I would say that you when when I ask my when I ask Christian gusta at least but also his heart rate might be different there too when you throw him on at for a minute at 21 kph and he says rp6 his heart rate's probably a lot lower than it would be two hours later at that pace right that's also that but that brings us back a little bit also to uh exactly uh utilization as well because one of the things that you would probably not be able to do you won't be able to get yourself up to a maximum heart rate at the end of a race even so your max heart rate you could say in many ways are limited at this time but this is also when you then say okay but how on Earth is it possible to ride at 4.5 L at when you have a 5 lit V2 Max this is the key obviously in endurance boort like you want to increase this robustness so when you're finding this Optimum of between of where should my V2 Max is this is what basically happens with specificity that you're tuning this down exactly so that basically where you start and where you end becomes far less and there's a whole range of let's say implications to this because it comes down to so why is this important could you just have a higher view to Mex in in like coming into the race and just have a higher V to Max well the problem with that is that the heart also is a muscle and it's

[01:37:08] Al it's not very efficient muscle so even the heart has an energy has has a it's not an insignificant it's actually a significant energy uh consumption as well and if you have a heart that actually is trained for something different than what you really need it means basically also your heart is going to use energy more inefficiently than it would do how much lactate does the heart generate probably you are better suited to answering this to me than me I actually I I actually that's it's it's I probably read it sometime but I I've never done any research on that I looked more at the I say when we broke down the body into uh into components is more like where I looked at basically the energy consumption the mitochondrial density of cardiac muscle versus skeletal muscle I mean they're both similar in some ways they're striad muscles but I've I should know that I mean your intuition would be it has to be very rich in mitochondria right yes then that's also why the heart obviously prefers or is a uses lactate also as a fuse or simply because it is probably full of um or let's say the I I don't I I've never done a muscle biopsy of of the heart dis it would be interesting just to see what's the ratio between type one and type two fibers there but I would hope almost imagine this is probably one of the muscles where you are as close as possible yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and I learned recently in the podcast with

[01:38:32] George Brooks that um that we can actually shuttle lactate into the mitochondria for oxidative phosphorilation I was completely unaware of that that would explain of course why the heart could could richly use lactate yes and and this also comes down toig is it m mik mik's constant but where you also look at the affinity for different substrate also for different muscles as well and where lactate has uh most of these muscles let say or let's say l has the highest affinity for most of these muscles as well especially like the heart but uh but I yeah um it is if if if if you're going to bring this back up that's also why actually a lot of the research when you do apply research like we do a lot of the times um we can't actually use a lot of the research that is there to base our decisions on like for example if you I think we I don't know if we talked about monoc carbal oate Transporters last time or not but one of the things that is there is that like this is also a place where like if you want to understand something you can go in and you can do a concentration measurement or you you look at something you look at you and the problem very often with research is we get a partial view of something but it's only partial and it's not a complete View and that means that for example that means that for example that um that most of the time for us to understand what really works and doesn't work we have to work with just raw numbers like for example we talk about caletri so we want to understand like what kind of substr are being utilized here and how it this is one thing that we basically see when we're using isotope traces and we start to dig into this and we can also talk about actually maybe creating artificially lactate creating like lactate as an artificial fuel so in the same way that you take glucose yes and you create supplements based on uh fructose and and and and and glucose and you you uh use this as a fols or for for that sake ketones or beta hydroxy buite then basically the implic lactate actually is very interesting in that Con in that context simply because it ex it is extremely energy efficient and that is in the end limitation for elite athletes how difficult to deliver orally I assume it's delivered in ass salt uh well that is what we this is actually something we started discussing uh because you could the interesting thing of it is in assault is that it could also then in that sense has a little bit the same effect as bicarbonate so you could use it as as as a as a buffer yeah let's make make sure folks understand the the the the the chemistry there so I was going to actually ask you about this and then we got off onto another topic is so I want to come back to that exact question but we'll preface it with this question people ask me all the time hey you know I understand Peter that as I my my workload increases my production of lactate increases and as my production of lactate increases my capacity starts to fall off because as lactate goes up it's buffered by a hydrogen ion or it's it's married to a hydrogen ion and that's what creates the acid part of lactic acid um and it's that hydrogen ion that's causing all the trouble it's not the lactate we can consume we can tolerate endless amounts of lactate just can't tolerate and lactate is crucial in metabolism yeah yeah we just can't tolerate the hydrogen that comes with it and it's that hydrogen that actually paralyzes the actin meas and filaments prevents them from disengaging and that's what leads to that seizing up that you feel the rigidity you feel when you're at and when you exceed your lactate threshold so the question then becomes well can I buffer this and everybody and their brother talks about hey what if we you know took lots of

[01:42:31] Tums you know anything that we get could get sodium bicarbonate into our systems my looking at that literature which I haven't done in a while was that this this strategy didn't really pan out that that there wasn't really a great way to orally ingest enough bicarb to make a difference obviously intravenously you could but that's probably illegal anyway

[01:42:52] I mean I don't think water would permit that um but even if you weren't concerned with that and just asking the theoretical question unless you're on a stationary bike it's not practical to have an IV drip of bicarbonate to buffer your hydrogen so what is the state of buffering agents to reduce and lessen the impact of of of Lac lactic acidosis uh so so this is uh uh this is a little bit of a complicated uh domain simply all the other simple domains we've been discussing today yes no the the the reason for that I've been very fortunate over the last decade to be involved in ex like Edge a lot of edge case researches plenty that uh let's say we are maybe year we are or not maybe we are years away uh before this will be published not necessarily because we don't want to publish in it but but there just remains work to be done to understand it and for example again this is ALS Al a place where um uh where we have some indications now but where some of my colleagues they have actually also tested on larger population but Gustav's highest view to

[01:44:06] Max actually is done under bicarbonate uh utilization not Christian but gusta how how is it administered so so the way it was administered is that there is a company in Sweden uh called Morton uh and uh what they did uh this is actually something that is going to be studied now also in actually in in health let's or let in medical settings as well because it actually has some quite interesting uh applications there too uh but uh how this was administered is basically that it is packed in a hydrogel and this allows you to byass oh so you get rid of the gastric P you bypass the gastric pH and you get it into the intestine using the same mechanism you basically pack your let's say the the the um the agents into a vehicle to to to deliver it where you need it more efficiently so this means that we can go to concentrations that are significant what have you seen is the difference in his lactate tolerance with and without this buffering so this is a place again where obviously the sample size is still limited sure but in him in a in a super in a worldclass elite athlete so the interesting thing there is that here we have two different cases and that's for example I have some athletes that have almost twice as high lactate concentration in the blood when they're using so this is the this this is why I said this we are opening a can of uh yeah proverbial can of lactate buffered worms yes exactly because uh we also have them to remember because then we have to come back to the technology where do we measure where again so this brand is called Morton Morton is in

[01:45:50] Morton salt uh well I mean yeah well it's it's it's it's it's um uh it's written M uh M no o r t n Morton uh and they basically they are like people go crazy over the gels and everything during races they have a gel that is actually based on the same principle so actually without we open up that box as well but basically Christian gustu sits comfortable you not eating 160 gram of carbohydrates per hour and basically this is then Quantified using isotop traces as well so they don't only eat it and it starts packing up in the stomach they they utilize it so yeah insane we're going I want to talk we're going to I'm going to save time to talk about nutrition because I want to ask you about that so this is a commercially available product athletes are using it and what so do you have a sense of why some people find like Gustaf seems to find huge benefit from it sounds like

[01:46:43] Christian does not yeah well I wouldn't say that Christian doesn't but it depends a little bit on let's say the setting we are using it in in as well and Tron is inherently complex in the sense that you have three sports that you put together VAR varying intensity all the things that are happening there uh which which makes it a little bit more complicated and then there also is some benefits but also or let's say but can also potentially be disadvantages with it but the benefits that also comes with it is it actually also increases your plasma volume fairly instantaneously as well simply because you you buy you're just pulling yeah as you're pulling fluid into the plasma yeah but in but the studies early studies that have done on this and then which will be published on this basically shows that there's a positive effect of using using bicarbonate now or using for example the moton product we we have studies now on larger population d by some of my my colleagues which indicates this um then on top of that but what I would say is that um we don't fully understand why it is like this it's so one interesting one in interesting hypothesis I presented to the to to to the research group is that if because on one side what we think is that okay this this this this this increases the buffering capacity so we we think okay if it increases the buffering capacity then you can basically do more and then you can go more anerobic or tap more into your anerobic or glycolytic resources uh because one thing that we are fairly sure about is that you're never going to run out of glycogen really like you come to a certain level and the body will rather start to sense that it's really really low and that's why you're shut down you don't shut down because you basically depleted every gram of glycogen in your body uh that's one and then there preserving mechanisms on by the way that's easy to verify with a muscle biopsy at failure right no the problem no the problem with that is that even in muscle biopsies you will see that if you basically do sampling just across one muscle so even yeah it's so heterogenic that even in well trained a so if you wanted to do it you would need to biopsy multiple times multiple sites simultaneously or even make somebody radioactive and start to do nuclear magnetic re res yeah measurements on on people yeah so so it's it's something it's so impractical to really study that you have to go more by again coming back to for example first order principles like for example uh looking at gross efficiency and then calculating as as basically how much subsid you're using basically is already involving inaccuracies to it that's why you just have to sometimes just say okay we're going to look at oxygen consumption versus a c let's say mechanical Power output and then you just say we don't care about whether that's RQ correlates to this value you just have to have the raw value vales but back to the bicarbonate bicarbonate and and so on one way we can one way what we can observe for example is that when we we do blood glass anal analysis so when the atlet are exercising so through out basically a longer protocol we are taking blood samples to look at basically the pH level in the body and what is interesting to see there even for Christian he does not have a doubling in his latic concentration so

[01:49:47] Christian have almost unchanged almost unchanged uh lactic concentration in his in his block what level of exertion yeah whatever even all any given power any given power so the interest or any given V2 yeah okay yeah so so the but the interesting thing here is that um the interesting thing here that is that for uh this this is easy to think now that when an athlete has double thetic concentration in the blood then it has to be double the contribution from the glycolysis it's not we have to remember we measure in the blood this is a concentration metric and the the state can be completely different other plac so here's just a crazy idea have you ever done a muscle biopsy on the two of them to see the relative differences in monoc carboxilate transport density on their muscles no that that that we have that we haven't done but I I but think about this is I mean just for the listeners to understand what we're talking about right so the so the the

[01:50:44] MCT transporter on the muscle cell must play a significant role in determining the relationship between intracellular lactate and intop plasma lactate and I I you know it would be in an athlete's best interest through training to increase the density of those because the more you can get lactate out of the cell the more presumably you're going to get the hydrogen with it out of the cell we probably have a greater capacity to buffer lactate pardon me we probably have a a better capacity to buffer acid in the plasma because we have the respiratory drive to get uh to to adjust bicarb than we do in the cell where it's you know that hydrogen is really poisonous so you know it just makes me wonder as a hypothesis Maybe Christian has more MCT density and that's why he is less impacted by this buffering strategy I don't know it could be the other way around like I I just I wonder if all things equal that would be it's just so hard to believe that two worldclass athletes could be that different in their response so I think one of them one maybe so one can be MC

[01:51:52] Transporters yeah for sure one can be but I doubt it to be significant yeah it's hard to imagine that's 2x difference right and the reason why I doubt that to be significant is because if I look at purely the biochemical efficiency first order principle looking at oxygen versus Power output cross mechanical powerp this is so close that it can't explain it alone one other difference that is there and which is maybe larger but I don't know uh uh um but maybe are closer related to this is for example exactly plasma and blood volume because the blood volume and plasma volume in Christian and gusta is beyond significant in difference why they're not that different in weight are they 80 kilograms versus but still it is it is it is borderline where the word significant doesn't do the word just or the difference again also one of the places where we don't have any definitive answers it is just different but then you can say well wouldn't have had implications on for example the V2

[01:52:58] Max and stroke volume cardiac output well actually that's the interesting thing because if you talk about stroke volume I would agree yes there is a massive difference again significant doesn't really does do it justice we would talk about massive differences in in in in in stroke volume but not in cardic output the card output what's the max heart rate of each uh this one is uh so Christian uh let's say ball Park is around uh 80 maybe 170 180 uh I don't remember I would say 170 eight something like this Gustav around 200 yeah yeah so this is one but also more interesting here as well is that Christian has a much larger also hemoglobin mass than what gusta have but the but one thing we also have to remember is that if you look at it if we create a performance stream model L and we put V2 Max on the top of this one where all these different factors are contributing let's say contributing factor to your V2 Max in in the end that's why we say the V2 Max is is the

[01:54:02] Holy Grail or or such a good um metric because if there's something broken somewhere in the system here it trickles up it trickles up yeah but it doesn't mean that if something is broken here that that's a good metric even though we could say that it is been used in research and other things so with what the then let's say one let's say probably one of the most plausible explanations for why there are such big differences in Christian and Gustav in terms of let's say uh or where the biggest differences comes from more is that gusta has to circulate his blood much quicker than what Christian does not relatively speaking but in absolute so the absolute circulation of blood per let's say per so the cardic output has to be at least the same for uh for uh gusta maybe actually a little bit higher than what it is for Christian but Christian compensates in other ways and that's also interesting thing then basically when we talk about all these different things whether it's MCT or other things are in the body is there are so many mechanisms in the body that we see that when you come closer and closer to Elite level other systems have to start to compensate for you to take the next step in people that are not well trained then you can basically do what whatever is and the body will just prioritize to develop what is the easiest to develop but at the elite level it seems like more like now it starts to be like a really hard priority and that's even before we start discussing epigenetics let's go back and say one thing about temperature um there's some reasonable data suggesting that a relatively high dose of acetaminophen can certainly improve heat performance so tolerance you know race paace tolerance in in in in warm temperatures that it may even perform output right and again nobody knows why is it improving performance I.E absolute output because it's actually reducing and blunting body temperature and the temperature itself becomes a bit of a governing mechanism on output or if it's just blunting pain and pain is part of the uh wall that we face um but any curious if you have any experience with you know high doses sort of one to 1.5 gram of acetaminophen in any of these athletes no we don't we don't use it have you experimented in no h one of the reasons why we don't do it is because uh

[01:56:27] I believe at the moment you start manipulating you're trying to MIP you can always say that like what is not MIP like already when you're using exogenous for example uh BB Yeah by car carbohydrates for that sake or anything like this you can already say okay uh well this already also has an let's say an effect um but I would say that the problem when you try to go in and you try to acutely let's say um do something in the body it means basically that you're trying to Target one part of one system of the body and you don't you don't consider the other ones to be uh important what I more believe in is that for example if you if you talk about heat for example in heat tolerance uh if you have more of a natural Appo approach to this and you build this into your protocols this means basically that let's say whatever is in the body that is there in order to help increase your heat tolerance have to adopt to this so for example um um saying that pain is something that is trainable for example and there are many mechanisms that are involved with this I and using using for example supplements to try to lower the pain for example or the perceived pain or something I think this is it's a place where one talking about for performance enhancing drugs it's interesting to see that for example despite or let's say post let's say the big doping scandals that were in cycling everybody thought that okay now time the the the the to of France will become slower y did short period and suddenly just became faster became faster became faster I don't think this is because people are doping more now than what they did before there are probably some cases where people still do doping or they are really like venturing into the gray gray area but obviously we have found techniques and other things that are more powerful than using performance enhancing drugs to get to this level I'll share two with you I'm curious to your thoughts yeah okay so um we're going to talk about nutrition in a minute you already alluded to the fact that your your athletes are routinely able to consume 160 G of carbohydrate per hour on the bike on what during competition you know a 100 years ago when I was competing in anything we kind of we were stuck at 60 like it was really hard to get past 60 grams per hour so for ultra distance things like I did you you know it really became a bit of an energetics problem you had to start figuring out ways to get fat in the in the me in the substance that you were consuming just to get the additional calories even though you didn't really need fat because you have enough of it it's glucose you're limited by um I very recently literally the other day asked

[01:59:27] Lance Armstrong we were talking about something unrelated I said by the way Lance back in the tour how many grams of glucose were you consuming per hour you know what he said he said we didn't even pay attention to it we just ate when we were hungry right so like and again this is not saying that the only reason those guys were exceptional is because they were using blood products no they were using blood products and they were exceptional and they trained really hard but their knowledge of nutrition was very pedestrian to what it is today you know as you know if you wait till you're hungry to start fueling you're not fueling in an optimal strategy at all so that to me is one enormous advantage in the pelaton today I think that nutrition science has evolved so much that you know what these guys can do I I've heard rumors that they can put down 200 gram per hour that they've trained themselves up to that level I think a second interesting difference in the tour today and I'd love your point of view on this as well I think people forget how big cyclists were 20 years ago relative to today if you look at the GC contenders in in in the era of Lance Armstrong right if you if you look at I mean uh look at you know Yan olich uh Ivon baso

[02:00:50] Lance himself I mean these were guys that weighed 70 kilos Lance raced at you know he'd start the tour at 74 and finish at 72 kilos like these are normalized human beings if you look at the the GC contenders today these guys are 58 kilos I mean they're very small so in cycling if we think about it as watts per kilo it's not that they've gone up that much on Watts their absolute wattage is sign significantly lower than what it was 20 years ago they've just gone down so much on weight so I'm wondering what you think about those two factors that are clearly Stark differences between the world's best cyclist today and the world's best cyclist 20 years ago as as a way to bridge the gap between the use of drugs then versus not today yeah so there there are also a couple of other interesting topics here as well but uh but I I think yeah nutrition obviously fueling speed out in other end like it's it's crucial and it doesn't help if you uh try to do something with your V2 Max on things if you're running out of fuel doesn't help to install a larger engine in a car if your tank is yeah exactly so the just I think one of the biggest differences is exactly like you point out like the attention to nutrition today in in the world tour for example is in a completely different level than what it was long time ago uh and I also over the last just over the last five years this have also made like a big big change as well like people are trying to make because there large teams so they're even trying to devise tools and let's say methods and other things that allows them to let's say scale this a little bit more the benefit I have working with a couple of athletes is that we can go on a completely different level than what they can do again so we we can we can even like use metabolic measurements even out in the field to do snap measurements basically just to see what is happening and become extremely detailed on what we do even looking at basically post exercise even what's happening there post or pre pre pre meals post meals what even happens with your resting metabolic rate because even this changes throughout the day and to keep up the consistency over time you need to fuel accordingly yeah but coming back to the question and that is that I think one nutrition yes this is probably one let's say one of the main contributors to why or I would say of the two this is the main contributor to why they are racing faster today than what they did uh 10 years ago even or even five 10 years ago um I further I would say that the wats per kilogram this is a place where

[02:03:30] I feel that there will we will see a change again I think actually that the weight of appes will start to go up again but the reason for why we start to see this dip going there is because if we look at more trying to understand like why did we end up with the training programs we have done and so on obviously it's a very empirical uh approach to it practical approach which very often is extremely good when it just gets enough time to evolve but at the same time also what haven't happened is that we have adopted our straining or training strategies uh in let's say in intact with let's say the availability of information Technologies and all things that helps us do better fueling because one thing we also do know is that in order for any growth to take place in the body you need obviously oxygen we already talked about that but we use oxygen obviously as a proxy to understand metabolism and Metabolism again is also so a function of growth so when you do when you do training over time you're obviously trying to signal to your body you need more muscles it to be more efficient in one or the other way and if you now start to limit or you put a cap on on on let's say fueling in order to drive down your weight this will also start to impair most likely growth or let's say ideal growth as well you become do we see this in triathletes

[02:04:45] I mean cycling is an interesting sport because you don't really get a benefit from weight reduction if you're a time trialist for example in fact it's the opposite you actually it's Watts more than watts per kilo that matters but obviously if you're in the grand Tours all three of which are basically built around climbing watts per kilo is ultimately the metric now we can debate whether you can get a more optimal watts per kilo at a slightly higher weight than a slightly lower weight but you know clearly you're not going to see people winning a a grand tour at 80 kilos or 75 kilos I think those days are probably gone but in

[02:05:23] Triathlon how much of an effort do these guys put into their weight so this is actually one of the interesting things because if you talk about what's per kilogram Christian actually is what's per kilogram have gone up with increasing his weight and we he said he's 80 kilos 8 80 kog yeah and his FTP is uh well if I'm going to convert it to

[02:05:43] FTP it would be probably in the range of 4 and yeah if I did him on a 20 minute test probably yeah let's say for the sake of Simplicity 424 something like this probably if if we tuned him like if if that if if that was how we did testing and we started to standardize that maybe even higher I I don't know it's really hard to say because we don't do FTP testing um but what and his power his what would be his average power in a an Iron Man for four hours so for four hours typically there they would be around uh wait let me see if I can guess you said we before we started the podcast you mentioned he was they were holding 4444 44 to 45 kph or even slightly above y in the most extreme cases so he's got to be at 360 to 370 watts to do that well that's where aerodynamics come in and we are able to lower the numbers because obviously staying at 360 370 will have a quite big impact also on energy utilization and heat production as well and for example coming also back to the question of basically using supplements to try to mitigate pain or lower your temperature we also know that this is not necessarily good but really also here's a question like just as I thought of that one probably we're not going to continue on that path now but using for example um supplements to try to lower your temperature I think this is where it's important to ask yourself a for first order principle where does that heat come from the heat comes from basically mechanical Power does it is it lower in mechanical Power or because I think the argument of the acetominophen literature is that the body is bumping up against a couple of set points that are acting as Governors to Output one of them is pain one of them is temperature the body does not want to let you get too hot and obviously doesn't want you to tolerate too much pain acetam menen potentially blunts both of those you're arguing yeah but if part of the way it's blunting energy output or or temperature is by reducing in mechanical work gross mechanical work then you're going to probably pay a net mechanical work price yes and also let's say also capacity price you could say in in some in some regards to me it's just I I have no idea what the answer is I would just want to test it in training you know again like literally alternate weeks with without as a placebo test with with a c medin without a c medifin with a c medifin without and just get the sense of like because again at your it's a you get a 1% difference it it matters yeah but also here is like one thing that is there because if you also use let's say [Music] um for for example like this is this is this is The Wonder of the body like one thing that happens obviously if you start to use a lot of carb so you go to 160 grams we we even cropped in at the highest numbers uh we have measured is is is in excess of 240 G per hour of of carbohydrate utilization that is so so can you tell people what 240 gr of carbohydrates looks like if it were food uh let me think um like do it in pasta or something like that like how much pasta is 240 grams of carbohydrate no I to to make it simple it would be probably as you took pure gel and you filled this glass and you drank it pure

[02:09:15] G okay so take those pure little nasty disgusting energy dels gels and fill your 16 o glass there with it and drink it yeah which I mean again I like and and and what form are they consuming the the the carbohydrate in normally they would do it in the form of of of basically drink mix so as they they how do they get that much liquid in their body uh yeah well so that's a part of it you you basically you take normally they would consume around um I would say around minimum of 1.4 L but say around two a little bit more than 2 lers per hour good Lord so so what's the con what's the glucose concentration in that liquid in in that one um then I have to calculate so we could just do the math if you said 2 lers 200 that's 12% that's a 12% mixture yeah approximately probably yeah yeah which again that also completely flies in the face of traditional nutrition science which says 5 to 6% is the limit for gastric tolerability and is the sweet spot for absorption right at 5 to 6% your Max and now again that's a different problem that's optimizing for water absorption into the cell not your primary Point you're probably overdoing it on liquid and you're trying to maximize glucose into the cell but but also absorption here is because this is also where it's interesting or important then to go back to also a little bit like what is this research like who is this research done on as well and it's not done on these trained athletes yeah so okay first question how long did it take you to train the athletes to be able to tolerate that because if if someone's listening to us today and they're saying I heard I heard I heard these guys talking about the 12% uh carbohydrate concentration uh which again just means for people listening that means 120 grams of glucose per liter that's twice the standard what you'd see in an energy drink um and then I'm going to drink two liters of that every hour uh I think within two hours a normal person is going to be puking their guts out like they simply can't get that volume of glucose out of the upper um gastrointestinal tract so is this is this just like any other muscle where you can train yourself to exceed capacity seems like it seems like most things in our body is actually extremely trainable if you if you if you really and that that's also comes back to the nutrition part as well where exactly also the training programs we have today also is very have not seen the same change as nutrition strategies have done over the last years as well so that means also that the power numbers that was output maybe 5 10 20 years ago I'm not so sure if that's the limitation we're going to see especially late in races right this is where it's going to make a bigger difference it's not going to make a big difference at the beginning of the race but it could make a huge difference at the end um talk to me about formulations what are you I mean again back when I was swimming great distances one of the challenges I had over a 12-hour event was literally fatigue of the same flavor so part of the challenge was how do you just mix things up and after a while sweet becomes horrible and you actually want something salty but then salty becomes horrible like how are you managing the the actual practical implication of this so again uh this is this is a place where uh we or more than they made actually their gels to be as neutral as possible and because it is formed as a hydrogel it actually encapsulated the let's say the sugar inside the hydrogel meaning that the perception of sweetness is much lower than for any other gel you will still perceive it as slightly sweet but it's much much less wait sorry this Morton gel is a significant driver of their calories as well as the bicarb yes so no so there are two different product because Morton has the bicarb product which which which actually also is encapsulated so in hydrogel but actually with carbohydrates but then they have the dedicated fueling products which is basically consist of a drink mix and uh which they which Christian and Gustav are mainly using but they also also have gels as well so it's more practical obviously to have a gel and silly question the the the bicarb capsule how they're swallowing a capsule while they're on a bike drinking no so they what you do is that there this is a two component two component or actually three component uh let's say mixture you have the hydro gel which is basically in a dry format in in a s and then you have the Bob tablets and then you basically you take water so you add water to this so first you add water to the to the uh to the hydrogel mix and then basically you are forming the hydrogel and then you take the b cup and you mix it into the hydrogel and in this way you're and whisp it around and then basically this way you able to bring it into the stomach and actually uh uh yeah uh able to deliver it uh without it actually causes any problems I I I will actually

[02:14:11] I can't say actually too much in detail what kind of concentration we are on after the moment I will come back to this a little bit later because this is probably things that uh we will publish but put it this way 19 gam of Bob for example as you you will that would be like a standard dosage you can go to 22 gram of Bob as pure and you will you can take this and this doesn't require very much training what is the base of the carbohydrate in that brand that they seem to like is it straight dextrose multitran no this is it is very very mainly fructose and glucose what's the ratio I think I had this it's a little bit of a time since basically we went through let's say the details of the let's say looking at the at the balances between this but let's say it's a 40 60 so it's basically high fructose corn syrup yeah yeah yeah it's it's like the let's say the the the let's say the call it the the genius part of it is actually not the carbohydrates itself it's the it's the packaging mechanism exactly that's that's the difference so if you were consuming 60 gram per hour spare spare the money and buy orange juice or even put inside and drink it the the the the where it really comes up where it differs itself is when you are really starting to push the limit of the concentration but you can even take you can even train yourself today this is something we know you can even take Hony today and you can mix it you can train yourself to go to higher values than what have previously been published like pure normal products but if you want to get to 160 this is when you need to you need the technology yes exactly so with with with uh so again no fat and no protein any amino acids throughout that whole race no we we this is something that was also done research on but we ended up in the end pure glucose and fructose and it actually has to do with actually how oxygen is being prioritized in the body because we have to limit we have to consider two things here it's easy to think that while you're only racing at 80% of your V2 Max or 70 or 90 whatever percentage it is of your V2 Max but that's a little bit of a short circuit because what we have to think of is that this oxygen like more oxygen is going to contribute to more heat as well so it's not like you have you can just go whatever I'm racing at a solo percentage of a V2 mix so I can go whatever and do and in the beginning because it always will accumulate towards the end of your race that means already from the beginning it's critical how you pace and your efficiency as well because every inefficiency you have either it's biochemical anything like this it will basically end up towards the end of the race so this means also that at the moment you start let's say putting any other uh substrates into or nutrients into your mixture that the body have to prioritize somehow in the system that means also that there going to be less oxygen available for Pure propulsion and in the end it's a pure propulsion that really sets the winner apart from the rest of the people there so you basically want to peel away every absolutely everything that doesn't contribute to Pro to to forward propulsion use every milliliter every mole of oxygen purely for that purpose and nothing else because oxygen is one of the limitations and that's comes through whether we we we talk about different kinds of substrate and these kind of things which is still also a place where we we we don't know we are actually doing quite some interesting research on different kinds of of of substrates from from glucose fructose uh have you looked at BHP bet hydroxy butter yes so we looked at BHP as well and and one of the things because the thing here is that if you purely look at the stomry there are interesting thing here but the problem is that we cannot only do stomry we actually need to know the ENT and we also need to know the Gibs free energy that is aail and ideally even the entropy but but not okay so the Gibs free energy if you're making the BHB yourself much more complicated but if you take it purely exogenously and consider it an additional substrate above and beyond glucose do do we do we have reason to believe that we're going to get more ATP per mole of oxygen no because the the the Practical limitation of this is that if we think when you do racing you could have a let's say if you think of this more first first order principle again so if you do racing and this was actually one of my first questions because we have been working together with one of the leading Brands uh on or may arguably the leading one and they are situated here in in the US but one of the one of the um limitations that you have to look at is basically when you are racing this has a certain fuel demand so there's a certain amount of fuel that needs to go through the system there yeah and that means that in in the context when we talk about glucose and fruct we we are looking at basically trying to replace as much as possible we said okay glucose fructose or basically carbohydrate seems to be a very very oxygen efficient fuel source when we when we when you do movement but that means also that in order not to run out of this we're trying to replace as much as possible or this to be able to race faster because if you said this is the certain this is the fuel source I have available in my body I'm going to raise this fast obviously I cannot go faster than this so certain power Dumber certain duration will deplete this energy source or basically bring close to depletion of that Source okay so that means okay instead of then switching to other source or you're basically always using other sources as well but trying to get more from that Source means basically you have to replace more of the power so more of the power now we have to create an environment where more power can come from the same source so that means that for example if you are at around let's say you were originally around at 80 gam or 90 gr let's say 80 g for Simplicity so 80 gram of carbohydrates and you have a biochemical efficiency of 20% for example that means is basically you're getting out or if you say 4.2 let's say you can get basically so 1 G basically would be then the equivalent of let's say one Jew per second one watt more or less like this you can get from that one so if you double this from 80 to 160 now that means basically now you can get double the amount of what's coming from from from carbohydrates yeah the problem with with with ketones is that you the strategy is not to basically fuel the amount you are using in a race you don't fuel with ketones in the same way like if you go to 70 80 or even 100 milliliters of of of of of of Ketone consumption in an hour you're going to have so high levels of ketones in your body that you will start to feel almost like you are getting diabetic like you feel like you're you're Bonk like this state a feel of bonking almost so so the thing that is there is more like it's inducing a state in the body rather than you're actually fueling using it because you in order to fuel so let's say your idea was that you're going to replace what you're losing from your body because that's driving your body also out of homeostasis as well so so you you you're going to try to keep homeostasis as much as possible or try to keep the state of the body as unchanged as possible that would mean that you would need to ingest like so large amount of ketones during a race that that it's it would be crazy and then you have the also the issue with the salt if you're bringing in with a salt versus an EST um okay a couple of things I wanted to chat about so one we talked a little bit about this before but let's kind of go back to it so so in remind me did Christian and Gustaf both compete in Tokyo Olympics no uh yeah both did compete in Tokyo Olympics yes and and how did they do in Tokyo uh

[02:21:33] Christian won uh Gustav came seventh eightth seven Seventh Place yeah and then they after that Olympics they went back to Iron Man distance for the next three years Y and then gustoff did not compete in Paris he had an injury Christian did I think you said he was 12th correct um and how much of that was the mismatch in distance again he's much more optimized for Iron Man Olympic distan is you know that's like asking a marathon runner to go and run a 5k very unusual um what was the process like to get ready for that and what was the difference in his personal performance between 2024 and 2021 so uh to

[02:22:21] I think obviously uh we we went there because for two reasons one we we we thought it was possible to get back on the podium and I would say even let's say even after disappointing wrests I would say that we are more convinced today that it's possible to go back then where were but there are other reasons for that come back coming back to that sorry meaning in Los Angeles you're saying you're not writing off even in parisia even there yeah yeah so if we then look also back to there Christian already had in training put out far better performances than what he was capable of getting out on race day uh I would say that there are two things that looking back at uh let's say the process leading into uh Paris that uh um that for me explains most most of this and one part of it is we one of the differences leading from let's say from

[02:23:13] Rio leading into Tokyo was that we took a massive shift in how we did intens control and again now we talk about intensity control that doesn't mean necessarily about talking about just threshold anything like this means exactly like pinpointing different intensities and and working on them in order to optimize the human body and then how we how we find this one thing that we did actually we we got maybe a little bit too let's say complacent complacent the last year and that is basically we have done so much that it's more like okay we we had more projects so it's also one place you just think that okay you are you getting really good at controlling the intensity and these kind of things so we we we we stressed it a little bit so the the key that really made a difference between

[02:23:58] Rio to Tokyo we became sloppy at the last year Rio to Tokyo or Tokyo to Paris no so so from from Rio to Tokyo we we we that was a massive shift from basically becoming let's say from going from unknown to to basically Olympic champion to basically where we the last year uh I would say in particular let's say the two let's say last year we were much more sloppy on simply because you just think that okay after you done intensity control for so long time you will think that you have such a good calibrated body for this that this is we made the same error actually already in 2017 to 2018 where 2016 to 17 we saw massive improvements in performance from 17 to 18 we have done so much measurement we locked other things like this just thinking okay they they they must have a good feeling for this really good calibrated to a couple of months we saw that okay this doesn't work we have to go back to the practice the same error we did the last year going into Paris purely in terms of performance Christian basically put out performances that was

[02:24:55] Far exceeding what he did on the Run uh in in to in you know in Paris in Paris he lacked around 4 minute per kilometer over the 10K that was that was a difference between the first place and the 12th Place should I say that again four four minutes per kilometer four minutes you mean four seconds Sorry 4 seconds four four seconds per kilm four minutes would be between them and me yeah so yeah so 4 seconds per kilometer yeah 40 seconds he lost on the Run yeah you could say yeah around there so then the diff but one of the differences that also were between Tokyo and Paris was that Christian actually sat and he didn't had to when he came out of the water we Christians let's say swimming have never been his Forte that's been the worst discipline that he for him and the same actually made like this was also in we are an arena where we would see even bigger differences so the poor swimmers in uh Paris some of them even even didn't finish they they why I mean we heard a lot of people heard about how disgusting the river was how did that create more separation between the good and the uh like the excellent and the good swimmers so it's the current in the water there was a massive current in the water basically to the extent that if you if if you said it was still water most of the trly basically set a 400 meter record World Records swimming the first 400 m usually that closes the gap between people when the current is strong the only problem is that you have to turn back up so you go you then you go head correct and then the problem also with this because this is in a river you can normally set it If This

[02:26:28] Were basically a place where you just knew you had laminer flow so you had lemoner flow and it was homogeneous all over the place then you could say that really it wouldn't make that much of a difference or should not little bit it would do simply because the swiming let's say in distance is the same but the duration becomes slightly longer and if it's a slight longer duration you open up a little bit more of a gap but even more the challenging part with with the with with Paris and the S was also that it flow is not especially in the S not homogeneous it is highly autogenous meaning basically if you look at the swimmers there and you see that they basically come around the first boy they start you see and they aiming for the boy next turn suddenly people go in a large Parabola because they they don't they underestimate actually how much more uh how much more current they up current they have to to basically point in order to get around and this and and and and then after that as well when they get closer because there are two bridges that went across the river as well and basically around this one you would normally think that the current is actually slower next to the pillars that are into the water the fastest swimmer was suddenly in the front there suddenly became second or even down into the group simply because the the people that went couple of meters two meters further to to the right there swam suddenly past them they they fastest swimmer suddenly it looked almost like they were came had good speed and suddenly standing still almost where they had to deviate out from the pillar and basic so it becomes a far more tactical race and more let's say how how far did he come out in the water after the leader in swimming oh I don't remember that was quite significant that was uh I I to be honest I I don't know I don't I I only thing I remember is uh from that is that he came out I think let's say of that long because also what happens here in instead of that you get a pack that is swimming it gets a long long line instead and that's also challenging in this in this context as well uh because you get a completely stretched out field instead of that people come more like in patches out of the water um uh so in I think Christian came out of from the last guy in the first group he was I think 17 20 seconds behind him but out on the bike he became a were I think 40 40 seconds down uh from the from the lead group and one of the differences that we already anticipated from the first year to the second year also was that one thing that

[02:29:00] I think people got a little bit shocked over the first year during so that was basically during the test event was how quickly in that course that the groups behind basically catched up with the lead groups in in the bike on the bike yeah yeah this was a this one thing we knew that basically the people that obviously were in the first group they had they would benefit everything from basically going a little bit harder and maybe even starting devising strategies where they even got domestics like this is an individual race but people actually starting getting domestics and sacrific people in the races from a nation perspective to be able to keep up let's say a different racing strategy because they're allowed to draft in

[02:29:37] Triathlon now yeah so in in short course Triathlon you can draft there you can draft this is the difference between that and long course like Iron Man racing so uh what how so what does this mean what did this mean for Christian it meant for Christian that basically uh in Paris versus Tokyo he had to Pedal 30% harder for almost three no three fifth of the race in order to just come back into the group and you don't get 30% for free for basically 25 kilm 30% extra power for for uh for uh for 25 km that has a massive cost so even though we could say that his his Fitness have increased beyond what it was before which made her confident that if this had been a pure time trial in let's say where you had like a normal swimming conditions this kind of thing he would be faster than what he was in Tokyo but because this is a place where obviously the Dynamics is completely different that extra Fitness 30% how I mean I'm surprised he could even do that yeah that's but that's that has an implication when you get out on the run because obviously here this is not a time like you where you go all on the bike what was his 10K time oh um 30 High something I think uh yeah around there let's say was it 30 low let's say around 30 minut I have to go back and check sometime now head a little bit different place so fast good Lord yeah um last thing I want to just chat with you about um is is kind of where you are using AI today or where you see AI going to make your insights better and your efficacy better so with all the data we collect um one of the things that I would be able to discover quicker with

[02:31:32] AI uh is that his utilization went up too high in the months or let's say in the month leading into the Olympics um whatz so meaning basically where here you are trading away a little bit on your anerobic to let's say anerobic capacity and power or say at least anerobic power maybe not capacity you don't want to trade that way but let's say anerobic power uh in order to increase your aerobic power slightly more so let's say of your V2 Max you're able to raise sustainably an even higher percentage of your of your v2x so that means also substit utilization would normally then be improved as well whether that would make a difference I to be honest I don't know uh because of how the race played out um but that that's one um the where AI really makes a difference is that uh for me we have used AI for for some while we we started developing our own systems um um I think this must been back in 20 20 uh and that is that with all the data because of all the in-depth research we have done we we we obviously have a lot of data and interesting findings that where we can build AI systems that allows us to take new data that comes into the systems in real time and help us highlight what is important what is not important like if there are things that that we need to prioritize more or I can even put attention to this so AI for me is also where actually where I think research just purely in terms of longevity in terms of human health everything will really supercharge us to a completely different level like researchers and other people that I work with today and one of the main limitations when they come in and they basically see the work we do is that said okay the reasons we is insane it has a depth to it that basically is unmatched but it's not because they don't have necessarily they say the the competence in a group or anything like this to do it but it's just the sheer amount of work that is required in order to utilize it or even even use it in a study in yourself and when you have ai like a lot of work that actually is done in research today is still manual work we there are plotting that is still done manual there are measurements that is still done manual but where instrumentation AI really can change this to to the point where I'm not talking about where once you let's say one one one one study uh can done can be done with maybe one more instrument or something like this but where you can use a multitude of extra of instruments and the and and be able to dig into the data on completely different levels than what you could do do before a will not replace how we let's say uh the let's say the decision making but it will help us in terms of information so B basically extract patterns you might not otherwise be able to direct your own statistical analysis towards yes and because you can also Imagine here AI how we train today is that for for for a normal person I I don't have a PhD in mathematics I don't have a PhD in machine learning but the good thing is that we can basically take and you're using large language models to do this no we we we used it we let's say we have built an agentic system so large language models is basically interface for us so I would use that for example like I would say that I want to to look at data in a certain way so I I'm using more the llm or NLP to inform which agents that should be uh utilized in order to understand uh or to dig into the data so I still have to produce the question I still have to produce the question like for me like AI for me is basically just an autonomous system I know this is a big debate on whether how intelligent these systems are but one of the best cases is that because I work so much in edge cases I always meet basically I so there was a study that came just came out now and people say oh it seems like AI has the possibility came out of Stanford I think it was and it was quite a lot of research involved it and they say that AI has the possibility to seemingly to produce quite a lot of novel ideas on par with

[02:35:39] Humanity but where I would say that well it depends on what kind of perspective you look at it and also where I would say that if it doesn't have data that has been trained on for this the best thing it can try to do is interpolate between data it already have access to that means edge cases or basically cases where you are in let's say in the domain where you need to ex extrapolate they they greatly suffer this you can see again and again and again so uh uh but the good thing is that you Empower a group of people or even a single human with PhD level capabilities in mathematics in in in in biology physics all these kind of things so you use the

[02:36:20] NLP you ask a question and basically it can it can Target this kind of data like even programming like is a limitation for many people today they are able maybe to formulate great questions but they don't have the capability or the resources available to to really put or execute uh uh and and look into it but when you have ai suddenly now you can without necessarily skills in programming other things you able to formulate the question and you can ask the questions into the data and these different agents can now suddenly employ like extreme level uh competence from multi-domains by the hands of a single user into the data and give you Insight back that otherwise would be impossible even for large research teams and so in as you think about 2028 right if you think about the next four years if you had to just sort of speculate wildly what percentage Improvement do you think this will bring not to the insight but to the actual performance um I think that okay first to answer it a little bit more high level I think that uh today like nor Norway have been a superpower in winter sports um and a lot of the reasons has been because of the technology research other things that have gone into for example purely optimization of skis you could come to the Olympics you can be a better trained athlete but you want win simply because the way the technology makes a difference on the skis for example I think AI will be or I'm I'm convinced Ai and the systems we are building now will have the same implication on Purely

[02:38:00] Human Performance and training meaning that if you basically don't employ AI at some point you will be at such a deficiency so you have great people what what is important for me to say here there are some like coaches are very often extremely Advanced almost like super call them super intelligent in the space of exact making people fitter they are maybe not or not even closely remote to let's say the understanding of of everything we have talked about today in terms of even knowing exactly the definition of such a or of a of a widely common expression like or terminology like FTP but still they produce some excellent athletes because they have observational skills and develop an intuition of what works and not works through a lot of experience empery and so on that they are brilliant but AI is not a conflict to them rather again a superpower where they can employ their level of understanding into much better questions into what what what what what is happening here with my athlete so it shouldn't change the way you do coaching but it increases the Precision of what you do in the coaching and the the biggest change thus in in in performance will come to even better consistency in the training not that single workout that is so much more brilliant but purely in the consistency of the training and adaptations you do to to to the training programs is there an area in particular that you see the biggest gap between where your insights are your coaching insights are today versus where you hope

[02:39:38] AI is going to close a gap yeah being able to be far more proactive than what I am today I still even though I would consider myself as one of the let's say leading uh on using technology technology and um and also in let's say res applied research when it comes to uh uh Elite Performance I can still say that I am I'm only able to utilize in the in let's say in the daily life a fraction of the data that we are collecting then you can say well why do you collect all the other data well very often it's becomes Insight you come back you learn something from it that you otherwise wouldn't be able to well then you're going to have training data you're going have great training data but being able to be proactive and make let's say adjustments and individual adjustments much more proactively will be one of the biggest differences and this doesn't go only apply to Elites this applies even to amateurs or normal people well it's been a fascinating discussion thank you again for for making the time to swing by on the way to Flagstaff and uh uh as always just enjoy talking about this stuff and hopefully uh hopefully folks enjoyed this as well even though admittedly it was a little technical at times thank you the same [Music]
