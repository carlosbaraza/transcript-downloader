## Description

Gary Taubes is an investigative science and health journalist and a best-selling author. In this podcast, Gary explains how he developed a healthy skepticism for science as he was transitioning from being a physics major to beginning as a science journalist. He talks about how he was particularly drawn to sussing out “pathologic science,” telling the stories behind his books on the discovery of the W and Z bosons and cold fusion, emphasizing the need for researchers to perform a thorough background analysis. Gary then describes how his work came to focus on public health, nutrition, and obesity.  He provides a great historic overview of obesity research and provides his explanation for why the conventional wisdom today is incorrect.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Gary Taubes:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode explores Gary Taubes' journey from physics journalism to becoming a prominent voice in nutrition science and obesity research. The discussion covers his early work investigating cold fusion and pathological science, before transitioning to his groundbreaking work questioning conventional wisdom about obesity and nutrition. The conversation particularly focuses on the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity versus the traditional calories-in-calories-out paradigm.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Discussion of VMH (ventromedial hypothalamus) lesion studies and their role in understanding obesity [45:00]
- Explanation of hyperinsulinemia's role in fat accumulation [50:00]
- Analysis of ob/ob mouse models and leptin research [55:00]
- Critique of epidemiological methods in nutrition science [35:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Question conventional wisdom about diet and health [1:20:00]
- Consider individual responses to different dietary approaches [1:45:00]

4. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Discussion of ketogenic diets and their evolving acceptance [2:45:00]
- Analysis of low-fat vs. low-carb approaches [2:00:00]
- Examination of the role of insulin in fat storage [2:15:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Bad scientists never get the right answer... it's too hard to get the right answer for you to go in being sloppy and slipshot and lazy and ambitious and get it right. Nature isn't that kind." [1:15:00]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. How can we design better studies to test competing obesity hypotheses?
2. What role does insulin resistance play in the carbohydrate-insulin model?
3. How can we better measure body composition changes in dietary intervention studies?

The episode provides valuable historical context for current debates in nutrition science and highlights the challenges of conducting good science in complex biological systems.

Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect of this analysis?

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:09] hey gary how you doing i'm good peter how are you i'm i'm good as well i feel like it's been uh a very long time i don't know the last time i actually saw you i i don't know it's been how many years uh probably three or four san francisco we'd virta offices oh yeah yeah yeah yeah god that's maybe four or five years ago now who knows yeah we were certainly younger speak for yourself come on um oh yeah that's true you may be aging the other way i forget that so um look there's so much to talk about but i um i want to kind of start with some of the stuff that probably a lot of people forget about you which is uh long before you were writing about nutrition you were writing about other disciplines of science and um i'm kind of just curious how you got interested in this whole thing so remind me what you studied in college you went to harvard and did you study physics was that your undergrad uh yeah i was a physics major um i actually started off as an astrophysics major and then uh got a c minus in quantum physics and my advisor suggested i change my um major so we switched to applied physics and i spent my senior year taking writing courses for the most part what drew you to physics in the first place were you a good student in high school uh yeah well you got to be a good student in high school to get into harvard i read science fiction books growing up this was the 60s you know we all wanted to be astronauts now our kids want to be billionaires back then they wanted to be astronauts so i read science fiction books i studied astrophysics i have an older brother as you know who's very smart and i was studying physics and i was competing with him and so that's what i did problem is my brain couldn't wrap itself around the concept of a was it a short not a hamiltonian was beyond my ability to comprehend so that was the end of that so the whole time you're studying physics you're thinking um i want to now apply this and i think you went to stanford thereafter to do a masters in aerospace if my memory serves me correctly i did and i was still thinking astronaut weirdly enough um and at stanford i actually lived with a few naval pilots and uh in the same housing you know apartment building and i realized one that there really wasn't any need for a six foot two 220 pound astronaut when you could send up a 5 foot 950 astronaut it was in better shape and uh more fuel efficient and uh b that i wouldn't say survive very well in a any kind of military hierarchy that required a kind of blind acknowledgement to uh superiors so that was the end of that i then went into uh started aiming towards journalism from there where did that uh where was that seed planted of sort of uh call it insatiable skepticism and a refusal to kind of bend to authority now you're asking me to uh psychoanalyze myself um on one level i once had a uh editor at discover magazine who asked me sarcastically or facetiously whether my brother was as quote well-adjusted as i was and my response was i didn't have to grow up in his shadow you know it's interesting i have a one my youngest son now is 12 years old and he's a basketball obsessed and he plays with the local aau basketball team and you notice that i noticed that the best players are the ones who have older brothers who play they're the scrappiest or the toughest they refuse to give up a rebound and i think because they've been playing with their older brothers their whole life they um i mean the ones that that can compete quit and go into another sport and the ones that can become sort of refuse to give in and so on some level that probably started my skepticism but then when i was you know so i go to journalism school i get i want to be an investigative journalist i had read all the president's men by woodward and bernstein i was fascinated by it the only job i could get out of journalism school was uh i had two semi-offers one was at the dallas morning news and in 1979 i wasn't willing to move to dallas and uh the other was at cnn in atlanta where they didn't allow cigarette smoking in the newsroom when i was a smoker so i stayed in new york and took a job with discover magazine and three or four years in i did maybe two or three years and i did a piece reported an article on the shroud of turin do you remember that of course i don't remember the piece actually but i know what the shroud is so at the time researchers from los alamos were taking this high-tech imaging equipment to turin to study the shroud and they had concluded so this is uh supposedly a the burial shroud of christ that it appeared in uh if i'm remembering this from 40 years ago it appeared in in the the historical record right around the 11th or 12th century right when there's a big market in sort of fake religious uh artifacts so there's a strong prior belief that this is a fake religious artifact but the los alamos researchers take their high-tech imaging equipment to turin and they say and they get permission from the church to do it and they say that they can't uh they can't understand how this was made even though it's also been carbon dated to the 11th and 12th century and i remember a sunday evening i was living in my um studio apartment in new york i was reading their reports that they had published and i forget what it was it struck me as profoundly unsupported by the data but i actually called the researcher in los alamos at home to say how could you possibly interpret this from what you did and it was just the sort of step one in realizing and maybe because i had gone to harvard and i'd gone to stanford and i knew a lot of people who went into science personally there's nothing fundamentally different about somebody who goes into science and somebody who goes into journalism other than we have sort of different mechanisms of wanting to understand what truth is so and then when i would i did my first book what was his response i don't remember i don't remember but if he he certainly didn't wasn't able to satisfactorily defend the interpretation it was also an interesting conclusion about the intra observation about negative results which comes up all the time when somebody gets a negative result when they're unable to determine how the shroud was created does that mean that the shroud was created by supernatural means that are beyond the ability of the equipment to detect or does it mean that the equipment that they used are simply inadequate for doing the job and in effect you know almost 40 years later we're having the same debate online this week about you know the cause of obesity are you doing the right experiments have you refuted the hypothesis or are the experiments flawed and that's that's always a fundamental issue in science let me ask you a question sort of tangential um did you did you know the harm of cigarette smoking when you were a smoker well it's a good question my mother died of lung cancer and she was a smoker but that was about 10 years after i started uh you know it's interesting so i started smoking in 1978 when i went out to stanford for graduate school and i was depressed and uh the sunshine in palo alto wasn't helping you you missed those dark boss winters you know i it's interest i mean it's getting deeply into my uh psychopathology here but um yeah i have uh i've suffered mild depressions my whole life as you know and that's been a uh so when i went out to you you go from uh you know harvard where i'm you know i'm uh i play football i'm well liked and i've you know built a sort of four-year career at the school you think of yourself in a particular way and then you go someplace completely new where nobody knows you and uh i didn't handle that well so um i started smoking to i don't know maybe despite the kids who seemed so happy and complacent in the stanford sunshine when i was definitely not happy and complacent and then it took me 20 years to quit um so uh but they you know i don't know if children and we discussed this when we were doing new c i don't know if kids ever think in terms of the things they do being dangerous we both did some very dangerous things when we were younger we were both boxers although i i i this sounds really dumb and i want to actually talk about your boxing history because the article you wrote in playboy is such a great one but um i don't know if i ever told you this story but the entire time i was boxing i never thought it was dangerous i had this true mental block that was i don't get hit so it's i'm it's not dangerous like nothing's happening to me you know i'm i'm evading and i'm hitting and da da da da which of course it was categorically untrue because my style of boxing was actually to get hit tire out opponents and eventually overcome them due to superior conditioning but it never seemed to hurt and it wasn't until i suffered a very very severe concussion when i was 20 in this i still remember it very well i was actually hospitalized for two days had a ct scan had significant bruising had significant cerebral contusions and had a headache that lasted for three months i mean this was a real this was the hardest i've ever had my bell rung and it was only at that point that i thought oh my god you actually get hit in this sport and by that point i'd already decided i didn't want to be a professional boxer that was the irony of it as i was already in college and i was now only boxing as you know something fun to do but it literally took that event for me to go this sport is crazy and from that but you know i always look at it very differently but while i was doing it i only got into it competitively after my best friend got killed boxing so say more about gay yeah well so yeah i mean there's a lot of things so i was a football player in high school in college and when you're football player in high school in college you know back then getting your bell wrong was not you know it just was what it was i mean i clearly had at least one concussion in high school football um my best friend in college who was actually a lot of kids best friends a very charming uh you know wonderful young man of puerto rican descent from new york was an amateur boxer in new york went back to boxing after his football career came to an end due to knee injuries and got our senior year he had his first fight and he got killed in the ring he was knocked out his head hit the mat we were in lowell massachusetts watching the fight at the time and uh you know he never woke up they my memory is of them unplugging him a week later it did not stop me from then moving to new york when school was over actually three years later and when i got to new york starting to box because i was bored um did you think about him when i did it uh yeah sure but i never thought that what happened to him could happen to me until i got knocked out in my in the golden gloves at which point there's this awareness when you get knocked unconscious when you wake up that there you there may have some people never wake up from that that that might have been the moment in which your candle was blown out in effect and there's no re-lighting it um but it's it's you know talking about this is interesting because we you know a lot of what we do in life and talk about when you're talking about prevention of chronic illnesses and prevention of disease and in prevention of you know addiction it's getting young men and and women who don't think and don't process risk the same way we do as we get older i always thought it was fascinating that the older we get in this the the less life we have less to live the more risk adverse we become where you're you know if something bad happens you're actually losing less of your life than you are when you're younger and i'm sure that you know behavioral psychologists like kahneman and ferske could say things or do say things about that tell me about the playboy article that you wrote after that golden gloves tournament i know you still have a at least the the last time i was at your house which maybe eight years ago you actually had a framed photo of you lying prostrate in the ring you know i still do and it's in it's in our coat entryway i often thought of you know putting it up here instead of this picture because i refer to it as my hubris protection um so while i was working at discover magazine and i was boxing um so this was 1983-84 i by the way not too long after duck who kim was killed by ray mancini i mean the early 80s was a very difficult period in boxing there were a number of yeah yeah he was killed while i was boxing and we actually did a story on it that discover about what happens to the brain um i was uh i remember there was a a good friend of mine a new york times reporter now named denise grady was writing that story and while i was you know boxing and getting ready to box in the golden gloves and she would come and then slip like you know articles under my door about uh whatever we were calling um the traumatic event back then um yeah i was just a young man it was i was box i had a friend a good friend who was a norman mallor's nephew and then norman mallor had a group of uh young men not even that young who met at a gym that's no longer there on 14th street in manhattan back when that was a very um questionable part of town and we would go down i think was every saturday morning and we would we would box for a few hours and then we would go out to lunch and uh yeah from that i got the idea why don't i write a box in the golden gloves and write about it so i originally was doing it for sports illustrated but then i realized that i was technically too old to do it that i missed the cutoff by about two or three months and that if i wanted to box i would have to um and let's say revise my birth certificate and so when i realized that i talked to the editors at sports illustrated and i said you folks you do investigative journalism we were in the same building discover in sports illustrated were both owned by time incorporated at the time and uh so i told the editors you do you know uh hard-hitting investigative journalism uh and you know if i want to continue to do this article i'm gonna have to fake my age and i think that's a problem and the editor has said well it is now that you told us um so uh we pulled it from sports illustrated and one of the editors i worked with had a good friend at playboy so i pitched it to playboy and my sister-in-law got angry at me for writing for a magazine that um doesn't portray women in the most ideal light or depending on how you look at it and she had a point but i said some of the best writers in america write for playboy and uh maybe later i'll have the you know the the platform by which i can be too good for this approach anyway we did it i won my first fight against a policeman from staten island who beat the crap out of me in the first round and then i realized that if i punched back um that might help and i knocked him out in the second round and then the second fight was a week later and i got knocked down i think a minute and 37 seconds by the fellow who ended up winning our division who was not particularly good but i had never really had enough time to work on defense you had been boxing for many years competitively i i had been doing this for about four months at any level other than a saturday morning hobby so um but it was a reminder that anytime i think i'm you know we all some of us grow up with this kind of james bond complex you know i think it's fair to say between the watches and the fast cars and the archery and things like that you might have it also that we think we're so cool we can do anything and that was my reminder that i'm certainly not um and that there are things i should stay away from if i want to have a long and healthy life among them being boxing and i haven't gone back and i never went back into the ring after that what's the process like of learning to write i um i was rereading an article uh yesterday that you had had recently written and uh don't don't get too don't get too flattered by this but i forgot how well you write you know one of the one of the things that i think i write reasonably well i've learned to write better over the years and i think a lot of that came from how often i used to write and how often you used to rip what i used to write you know back when we were at nusi i was doing so much of the writing and you were doing so much of the editing and revising of internal stuff that i would write and that process of course i think made me much better and i can now see it when i look at the writing of other people but but you know your writing today i think is is is really excellent at least it's a style that i find really good right you can write about science in a way that's it's very readable um how does one learn that craft when you show up at columbia which ostensibly is the best journalism school in the country i assume you're coming in incredibly raw did you believe you had some talent some hidden talent for for for writing or is that not even a part of what they're selecting at a top journalism school is it more the thought process they're selecting for and the writing is the easy thing to teach on top well i thought i could write because um i used to write letters to friends and girlfriends that i thought were clever and they liked so there was always a sense that somewhere inside me i was a writer when i first started taking writing classes it was actually at night school at harvard after i got out of after i got my master's degree from stanford i went back to boston and i don't even remember what i was doing for a living but over the course of a semester i took two writing courses one taught by a science writer from the boston herald who i later worked with at discover magazine and one taught by a fiction editor from the atlantic named michael curtis who had been a roommate of thomas pinchot and dick farina at cornell in the early 1960s and was a already a famous fiction editor at the atlantic in the very first article i wrote for him could probably remember the subject if i had to but what i do remember is it came back with the words pure isle written in one inch high letters on the front underlined twice and i had a look up pure aisle which meant basically childish and amateurish and thoughtless and over the course of a semester michael curtis started to hammer me into being a functional writer by constant and relentless criticism of what i did and i appreciate it in fact the boston herald science editor was so nice he would read people's work and he believed you should never say anything negative about their work and i gained absolutely nothing from being in his class and i i was a lovely man but i don't think anyone else did either except maybe you know uh unjustified sense of their own talent um curtis hammered into me and then when i got to journalism school it was just about basically teaching you to write in a report and so it's a steady learning process and then as a journalist when i started discover i started as a reporter so time inc back then had reporters who did the information gathering and then we would write files and the files would be given to the writers and the writers were they were true craftsmen and i started off i don't know the first story i remember doing was about some type of uh particle accelerator at michigan state and uh i had the writers there probably you know friends who were writers would read this draft and then hammered you know just relentlessly critique it until i ended up with something that was worth submitting to the editors and then the editors would do the same thing before it would be published and as i became a writer and got older i did that same thing for other reporters who came in under me and there are you know a few very well respected journalists who i think benefited from me being relentlessly critical and then the actual process of writing is just you know i told you this years ago calvin trillin the famous new yorker writer had a phrase he called the first draft the vomit out where you just get everything down on paper and it kind of relieves the pressure of the first draft so you get everything down on paper the computer and then you just keep rewriting it and rewriting it and rewriting it until it reads like something i would have wanted to read if it hadn't been written by me and because i read a lot and i read a lot of you know very talented authors i know what good writing looks like and feels like and then you just continue to revise and edit until it gets there it's who's the best living science writer in your opinion uh best living science writer in my opinion um i don't think i could answer that question there are a lot of people who have a lot of different skills it's like saying who's the best living football player the best my 12 year old is always asking me who i think the five best basketball players you know is is was will chamberlain better than steph curry well they were different right um there are science journalists uh geez there's a young man at the atlantic now whose name i'm uh going to forget henry somebody who writes a thoughtful well-reported article on a different subject every three or four days and i often read his stuff and i think could i have done that when i was his age and you know worked 70 80 hours a week possibly but i don't think so and i don't think i could have done it as well when i was growing up uh the best out there was jim glick who wrote remember chaos and the feynman biography the name of which i forget at the moment um there are a whole series of science journal you know collection of science journalists who came of age in the 1980s when science magazines had first started um there was a magazine called science well science 80 then it was science 81 science 82 there was discover um some of those like uh charles mann and steve hall um chaos tyranny chaos in the blood yeah um just exquisitely beautiful thoughtful writers in fact i can't i charles man i i he's a friend and steve's a friend and i think i call charles goes by cam and i can't read cam's books because they're so painfully the writing is so painfully beautiful that i feel inadequate when i read them it's very difficult um and the same goes for steve i think what they do they do much better than i do but they're now the older you know we're now these senior figures in the field um what is it about their work though what i mean you once told me that great science writing isn't really about the science um what is it about steve for example that that you read and think he's doing that so well just it's a combination of of so reporting uh you know comprehensive rigorous reporting so you know you have the story although you can never really judge if somebody else has a story right unless they're writing about your field um the you know the prose style the you know the ability to tell a story around a complicated subject yeah i was going to say i just read the ghost map by steven levy have you ever read that no it's an extraordinary book i almost you know i hope that's the best book he ever wrote because if he's written better books then i'm in the wrong field and i know many people say that anyway but um the uh you know on one level just the pros so the ability to to to write a sentence and a paragraph that other people want to read but then the story that you tell and the digressions to the story and keeping it always interesting and making it both bigger than it other people might see and yet simultaneously um you know getting the details of the lives and the times and uh you know it's a uh it's an entire i mean i'm sure every genre has its own challenges but science has this challenge that you're inherently writing about a subject that's very you know complex it's hard for even the people who who the scientists themselves to wrap their heads around so i'm still going to have to think about who the best science who i think the best science writer is today if there is one and there's so many out there today the question you always ask is what books out there like the ghost map and again on one level it's about the you know the jon snow and the cholera epidemic in england and whatever 1864 um in london and how jon snow and his compatriots figured out that this was cholera was not bad air but um you know a infectious agent in the water supply but then it's it's about the birth of modern cities about urbanization about the problems of of that cities faced coming together about cities into the future um as and then fundamentally about you know what it did the scientific process the the challenge of an outsider doing science which might be one reason why it resonated so much with me the uh you know it's it you take you start with a small story and you turn it into something you know a large and intricate and meaningful um extraordinary book so at what point during your your time at discover did you become interested with the subject matter that would eventually become your first book well i did a uh i did an article for uh so i i was you know my background was in physics so it was natural for me to write about physics and uh it's a harvard physicist named carlo rubia working at the european center for nuclear research cern in geneva had his research collaboration of 150 people physicists known as ua1 had discovered two fundamental particles that were sort of the two of the three last remaining well two of the four last remaining particles of the standard model of physics so physics you know the the uh electricity and magnetism had been united with the weak force to the electroweak theory and that was a great step forward in the 1960s and 70s and by 1973 that theory had mostly been confirmed and it predicted the existence of two particles at the transmitter particles that carry the electro weak force this was a w and z boson and rubia's group rubia who was this uh very controversial physicist who taught at harvard had convinced the europe to in effect spend the money to build an accelerator that could have the power to detect the wnc particles and when they announced the discovery we did an article on it at discover i forget who i must have written that um but then discover was part of time magazine and time has their man of the year cover right so discover had this concept of the scientist of the year and because of this great discovery and everyone knew that rubia was going to get the nobel prize for it uh discover made rubia the scientist of the year so i get to fly to geneva actually i flew to belgium rented a bmw drove through paris went to geneva um the uh life was time had a very good expense account back then my life has been downhill ever since the uh anyway i spent time with ruby in geneva i interviewed his friends i wrote them up as a profile for the scientists of the year time inc flew him to new york at the explorers club he was given and this was before started or after stockholm this was before stockholm okay um because he he was awarded the nobel prize what and like it's always the fall so it was it the fall of 85 years 85 okay 85. and the the publish they published the the two bosons in like january or february of 83 does that is that right or was it earlier 82 83 or 84. okay must have been yeah 83 or probably 83. okay so yeah that would have been mine okay so anyway the point is uh not only does ruby get this award he gets a nice gold rolex from the explorers club so he's very grateful to gary tabbs for he thinks somehow and i probably was the one who suggested him for scientist of the year so that april which would be april of 84 he comes to washington there's an american institute of physics the the big physics meeting every year is in washington and rubia gives a presentation announcing that he's now on to the next step which is physics beyond the standard model and he shows what they've gotten he shows a few events and we could talk about that and the message is it always has it's the biggest discovery in physics in 40 years and all he has to do is turn on the accelerator which will happen that autumn and gather more data and narrow it down and it's nobel prize number two and so i was at that talk so i came up to him afterwards i said look it's you know this is terrifically exciting and it's rare that anyone predicts a great discovery in advance so can i write a book about this can i maybe i can come to cern live with you guys and document this as it happens and rubia liked me he thought of me as his personal scribe so he said yes and i put together uh well first i put together a proposal for the atlantic that they um rejected because charles mann and uh his co-author at the time bob crease had just put their own proposal in to do a piece on high energy physics so when i was always following behind man increase um if you're going to follow behind two writers or they're two very good writers to lose out to anyway so i pitched it as a as a book deal instead actually i was approached by a publisher who was publishing a book by shelly glashau who's a nobel laureate at harvard who i knew and they had asked shelley who the good science writers were and shelley said you should get taubs he's probably the best so they approached me i had this proposal from the atlantic that they rejected i sent it to the publisher and they said they'd be willing to pay me to do the book so i uh left discover magazine and flew to geneva and got a room at the hostel on the lab and was today we'd say i was embedded with the physicist for the next nine months and ten months nine and thought i was going to write about a great discovery and pretty quickly realize that this was far less compelling the evidence were far less compelling than rubia had claimed in washington and that there was a very good story here and it was probably not the story of a great discovery and that was you know when you asked sort of what informed my approach to science and science journalism that was the learning experience because so there's 150 physicists on the experiment there's numerous technicians there's a group of physicists who well should i let's back up should i describe what they're doing yeah i think it's i think for most people a particle collider is a very complicated process we're talking about subatomic particles i don't think most people can comprehend the scope of what how rich the data are and what you're looking for what type of a needle in how big a haystack yeah so the gist of it is you've got uh well an atom smasher part a collider so you're colliding subatomic particles together at speeds as close as you can get them to the speed of light to create the the faster the particles go the greater the energy and the collisions and then you're looking in the collisions for the signs for particles that might be made that your theory of physics the standard model does not predict so in that sense you're testing the standard model and as the accelerators are able to put more and more energy into these uh collisions you're able to test your predictions of the standard model further and further out then you've got to create a sort of you have to understand the predictions which is part of what we're dealing with here but um when you end up doing in these then and so you've got this huge particle accelerate if i remember correctly it was maybe four miles in circumference it straddles the french swiss border it points on the accelerator where you're colliding the two beams together you build a detector and a detector these things are with the size of a mansion uh three four stories high uh that's where the money that's you know there is expense so the accelerator itself might cost 50 million dollars or 100 million dollars today they cost billions back then it was hundreds of millions and the detector which i always thought of as kind of a camera that's created to photograph to be able to detect the passage or the emittance of all the various particles that you will come out of these collisions so you've got uh photon detectors to detect photons that come out you've got muon detectors to detect muons that come out and so you collide it and of the billions of collisions you're making i don't know every day uh you're looking for one one collision that creates one particle that your standard model doesn't predict and just to put that in context right i mean as you said you could have billions of collisions per day but i think if i recall i mean rubia would say look you might get 20 a year that are relevant and and so you just think about the signal-to-noise ratio there and again i think just for folks to understand you're trying to look at is there you know so so you'd have a prediction of the mass effect of that collision right so you have to have some conservation of mass you have to have some conservation of charge and you're trying to sort of coalesce all of these different things to look for discrepancies that are occurring at almost an infinitesimal fraction of the number of collisions it's very hard to wrap their mind right and they're the so that are predicted to be occurring that's radical they may not even occur at that infinity yeah so you're you're trying your you've your detector your camera the idea is everything uh you've got the particles colliding everything that comes out of that collision you have to detect so because if you miss something it's beginning to sound a lot like calorimetry which is a subject we should get to later if you miss something then that collision is worthless to you and you're likely to be fooled because you're likely to think some particle was created that wasn't created because you you know you do have to have a conservation of energy so if a certain amount of energy goes off in one direction you better get the same amount of energy going off in the other direction and ideally with every particle you detect and you detect the energy and the particles that's part of what the detector does and you recreate this collision you can you know you know that everything's balanced if it's not balanced does that mean that your detector failed or that a particle was created that your detector couldn't see because it's beyond the standard model now now you have to know your detector better than parts per billion issues because you have to know you have to be able to estimate whether or not your detector failed so on some level this idea that science is about signal to noise you have to be able to predict the noise almost perfectly to understand the noise almost perfectly and this is a sort of repeating theme and everything i've written about even if i don't phrase it like that in newsie we used to talk about signal to noise problems all the time if you don't understand your background which in high energy physics is the standard model predictions of what you would expect to see if there's nothing new out there and what you would expect to see from the understood flaws of the equipment so you know as we could tell the story let me that's the issue the problem we're confronting so you've got parts per billion effects that you're looking for or parts per trillion effects and you have to understand your your the flaws in your detector to better than that and so is uh what's his name rumsfeld would have said you got your known unknowns and your unknown unknowns and you're constantly trying to figure out your unknown unknowns and you never fully figure out your unknown unknowns so physicists you know we read about this so there's a talk recently of a new particle possibly being discovered and physicists say well they haven't discovered it yet because it's only a three sigma effect and a three sigma effect is what you know this better than i do a point zero zero zero probably zero zero zero one five or something like that but but our threshold would be would be six sigma to really yeah so yeah so the reason for the six sigma actually five sigma is because you want to make a lot of room for the unknown unknowns you want to say this is how i perceive it so we have some we can calculate that the sigma is a calculation of the the standard deviation likelihood the difference yeah but there's going to be stuff you don't know there's going to be stuff that's going to fool you that you don't know so you want to have an event that's so absolutely fundamentally freaking outside the range of what you think you know that you can confidently assume that what you don't know the unknown unknowns can't explain it either in its new physics before you go further there's one thing i want you to explain to listeners because it's a beautiful part of physics but it doesn't exist in every other field of science which is the relationship between the theoretical and the experimental physicists um it's i think it's worth it pointing out here how that is a collaborative nature in physics yeah physicist divides up into theory and experiment okay it wasn't always quite so clear but even if you think of you know einstein was a theorist eddington who you know did the the seminal test of the theory of relativity was an experimentalist um so as physics evolves you have people who wrestle with the theory and then they have to come up with the theory that makes predictions that can be experimentally tested and then you have experts or experimentalists whose job is to do the experiment and then there's got to be crosstalk between the theorists and the experimentalists because the experimentalists have to know precisely what they're looking for and they need to help the theorists to tell them how this might manifest itself and the experimentalists have to understand their detectors their experiments to this sort of superhuman ability that's one of the the defining characteristics of an experimentalist is the the awareness of a exquisite physicist is the awareness of how their equipment could fool them and so this is how physics has always developed and then you so do you get to the point that like theorists the job is to come up with a good theory and make a prediction and the experimentalists the job is to test that in the fields in biology and medicine you don't have that diversion which i think is a problem and we talked about this through our years you've got the theorists and the experimentalists are merged into one person everyone's a theorist everyone should be capable of doing the experiment and i think they're two entirely different skill sets you know and they both require such a fine level of detail and thinking and rigor that i'm not sure that you know after a certain point let's say from 1900 onward i don't think one person could encompass both aspects of you know they're they're almost different endeavors so to get back to cern because this is where it's relevant when i get to cern i move into the hostel i'm hanging out with the physicists there's a group once rubia started doing you know published the w and z discoveries and everyone knew this was a place to be in physics even before that he collected a group of very ambitious young mostly men physicists from some of the best physics schools in the world who came to work with him to analyze the data so have has ua1 and ua2 collapsed at this point and is it all no there's it's always both okay you always need both detectors because if you see something at once independent replication yeah so if you don't see it in both you got a problem um that's why even now the uh is it the large hadron collider has four i think four or five different detectors um it's not enough to see something in one detector you always need independent replication um and again that's true of every science the i get there so you have these young men who are doing the analysis and they're sort of the they've become they've moved in they've come in late they've become sort of the the you know chosen uh uh cortiers of rubia they they they hang with him they eat with him they they meet with him they tell him what he wants to hear which is what the what's happening with the data and then you've got the the the physicists who actually built the dam detector and the technicians who built the detector and these are you know these i used to think of them as they come from they don't come from harvard and stanford and oxford and cambridge they they work at like the red brick the universities in the midland and the uk and they've they've been there from the beginning they built this mansion sized piece of 30 million dollar equipment with by with their hands there's no mass produced you know they know how it can fool them because they built it so as soon as i get there i've got these young physicists who are new to the experiment who are all excited about this great discovery and i'm also hanging with these you know the old hands who built the equipment by hand and they're basically poo pooing everything and saying this is crazy yeah our detectors we cannot understand the flaws in our detectors well enough to make the kind of claims that rubia has been making and uh so that's a kind of learning experience right are they voicing that to well they're trying to but the problem is you need a group leader who wants who's willing to hear that so once rubia started talking that he had made a discovery you know in washington in 1984 what he wants to hear he's gone out on the limb right i thought he only predicted it i didn't think he actually said it had happened you know you've probably read my book more recently than i have um when you're even if you're claiming that it will happen yeah so this is a you know again if you think of there's this term that the physicists use pathological science which is the science of things that aren't so and my whole career on some level has been you know writing's right or wrong now i think i understand pathological science and have have studied it as much as any any human being alive um one of the defining characteristics of pathological science is people commit themselves publicly to a result based on premature evidence so they don't it's not ironclad they haven't locked it down there's still a chance they could be wrong and they don't understand the likelihood of that chance no one ever does until you get very good at this when you realize that chance is enormous um and so once you go public what you you know science is supposed to be hypothesis and tests right the idea is you're supposed to rigorously test your hypotheses and ideally you're trying to prove that you're wrong you know richard feynman first principle of science uh is that you must not fool yourself and you're the easiest person to fool so you get it evidence that you've discovered something new your assumption should be that you're wrong that somehow your equipment is fooling yourself and now you try and go out to demonstrate that's true and you do everything you can to prove it and if you fail to find out how you're wrong right now you write a paper that says uh evidence for the observation of particle x question mark and you put together a presentation and you go around you start in your department at whatever university you're at and you give the presentation to your colleagues and basically you're asking them to explain to you how you [ __ ] up if you're pardon the language because surely you did and if they can't explain it to you right then you give if you just you march around the country of the world giving the symposium you still haven't published the paper the evidence for the observation of particle x question mark because you're still working under the assumption that you screwed up and you just don't understand either your equipment and as you're traveling around the country people should be saying to you well what about this did you think of this did you know that the you know the muon detectors actually there's a there's a glitch in the detectors that are made in belgium versus the ones made in switzerland and the ones made in belgium are gonna you know spark in the in the you know once every seven and a half months have you checked that and if you checked it great if you didn't you go back to cern or wherever you are and you check it and so you keep giving this lecture finally at the end of i don't know 20 seminars nobody can explain to you how you [ __ ] up now you publish the paper with the question mark and what you're asking them to do is tell you how you screwed off because if you assume that you did and then they tell you you don't resist it but if you claim that you didn't and you published the paper first now what you're doing instead of that exercise of trying to find out how you assuredly screwed up you're trying to collect evidence for how you got the right answer so you go from paying attention to the negative evidence to paying attention to the positive evidence again everyone does this i'm accused of that all the time it's like the study comes out that confirms what i believe i don't question it the same way i will question a study that comes out that appears to challenge it so once rubia had gotten to the point where he was predicting a discovery all he wanted to hear from his physicists was the evidence supporting that that's the first mistake along the way okay so the physicists who wanted to tell them about the problems with the detector and all the ways the detector could fool them and what they weren't thinking about and what they were missing if those people did their job they were sort of seen as downers they're like like you nobody wants to hear from that um so after a while what happens is you get the sort of polarization in the experiment where the the the principal investigator tends to selectively listen to the people who support what he wants to believe and selectively resist subtly resist the people who argue against it and then as the experiment goes on the more the people who tell him what they wants to believe confirm his beliefs then that confirms his belief that he should not listen to the to the critics the skeptics and this happens in all of sciences what you know we've seen it in an extreme way in cove that it goes on in climate change it goes on in nutrition and chronic disease once you decide you know what the truth is you tend to stop listening to the people who disagree with you and then you surround yourself with the people this is also classic group thing theory at what point did rubia realize you were no longer his uh his scribe in residence during this 10-month period probably when he read a draft of the book um you know carla was interesting because um well he had enormous self-confidence so you have to picture he's larger than life he's he's he's italian he's overweight he's got this exuberance he's he's a nobel laureate he's a nobel laureate i went to stockholm with him we went to i you know i was fitted with for my tuxedo with carlo i mean that's how close we were um once i started realizing there were serious issues with this experiment i would challenge him on this so he i didn't hide my skeptics i would say well you're saying this but you know so and so from from edinburgh or or college de france or you know uh uh the university of pisa is telling me this i i wouldn't out them like that but this is what i'm hearing from your experimenters and carla my take was that he was something of a pathological liar so he defined truth as what was convenient for him that he could get people to believe so i would challenge him on an issue and say well you say this but that's not what i'm hearing from your your researchers and he would say yeah well that's a good point then he would take a step back and tell me something else hoping i would believe it and if i challenge that he would acknowledge it and then tell me something else and we just keep going it never got to the point where i felt from him any awareness that what i was going to write was not the story he wanted to tell and i think this is a classic problem with you know people of his sort of quality and and strength of ego which is the uh he couldn't imagine that i could see the universe differently than he did i don't think he could imagine that anyone could really see the universe differently than he did so um when i wrote the book which was called nobel dreams and described what had happened he asked hit an executive committee at the experiment made up of you know a dozen or so physicists from all these collaborating institutions and he asked that he wanted to sue me and he asked them to join in the suit so that um you know would have more power and they refused and what they didn't tell him is that most of them had read my book and critiqued it in draft as a favor to me i didn't say that in the book because that i said that in the book i would have created problems for them professionally and the book was accurate so but he just he didn't see the universe that way did you like the book itself uh the writing makes me cringe i can see the book it could have been you know it came out when i was still 29 years old i guess i was i the story the story in it is interesting but um but i can't read it my prose my 29 year old prose still makes me uh you know cringe so it came out in what year 87 ish 86 86 86 i think no must have been maybe it was february 87 yeah so i would have been not 29 but uh 31 30. so how did you did you go back to discover at that point or did you immediately jump into the investigative work that would ultimately become the book bad science no i went back to discover i was freelancing for discover and actually it's interesting when the book came out as february 1987 i was living in the upper west side of manhattan i my publisher's idea of getting me publicity was to get page six in the new york post which is the gossip column so i heard that page six was covering it and it was i remember it was a dark snowy day in new york and dreary and i went across the street and went down columbus avenue under there's scaffolding and there was a newspaper stand and i bought the new york post and i'm sitting in the headline of page six is egghead squabble over nobel prize and in it this nobel laureate carlo rubio is calling me a 30 year old writer in new york an [ __ ] and i'm thinking that my career and yeah i'm never going to eat lunch in this town again and my career in journalism is over and as i continue to report stories i start talking to researchers about you know my book and rubia and they want to know about rubia and they'll say to me well if you think ruby is bad you should write about so-and-so and it turns out that there are characters like him in every area of science characters who so we could talk about this pathological science people tend to think of fraud right and when you're committing fraud in science you're knowingly trying to fool other people by manipulating the evidence but there are two ways you can manipulate the evidence you could create a signal right or you could do an inadequate job of studying your background remember it's a signal-to-noise problem so you could fudge a signal or create a signal or move a signal or you could ignore the background and if you ignore the background and do a poor job in the background you'll still end up with a big signal-to-noise ratio you haven't technically committed fraud you're not actively trying to fool anyone else you're fooling yourself and that's the kind of science rubia did he was ambitious he was looking for discoveries he didn't want to doing a background analysis is the hard relentless rigorous grunt work of science it's endless and thankless because if you do it right all you do is prove that you were wrong all along um publicizing a signal and getting a nobel prize is the good part right so so how do you reconcile that that dichotomy which is you know this is a guy that's not committing fraud of course but in your words he's he's doing bad science because he's omitting to do the background check but at the same time he is the guy through sheer personality and force of will that discovers these two bosons that up until the discovery of the higgs boson were the the last two pieces of this puzzle so it's it's i mean and i don't think anybody's disputing the work that went into that nobel prize right so it's it's it's a it's a very unnerving it's it's an unnerving uh revelation right it suggests that even at the upper the uppermost echelon of science you can have people that are committing these omissions well and this is so first of all the one of the messages in my book um i didn't go into this in great debt but the papers that won him the nobel prize and again i'm remembering from almost 40 years ago now uh those were the he's probably wrong he he rushed it i think is oh he he rushed yeah yeah because he was competing but the particles had to exist that discovery had already been made the neutral currents in 1973 or 74 i think it was fermilab um so those particles had to exist and they had to exist with the characteristics that he was looking for so when he published you know the discovery based on i think it was seven events that had these characteristics yeah the um no one asked were these really w particles in retrospect uh most who all of them probably were detector flaws that they didn't understand yet that they still had to work out over the next year when they're trying to discover particles beyond the standard model um this was the issue with rubia it was the reason he got the award immediately is there was a political issue behind all this also which is since world war ii the all the major discoveries in physics had been made in the u.s the u.s had spent the big money on particle accelerators so this was cern's opportunity europe's opportunity to achieve relevance again and the award was given almost instantaneously because this discovery made europe basically redistributed the center of gravity of the physics world back to you know if nothing else to center the atlantic um when i when i was reporting the book one of the things i did was travel around the country and actually around europe talking to other physicists about their work their discoveries and about rubia and trying to rationalize what they told me with who he was and who i thought he was you know one of in defense of ruby and none of this gets done without him no i'm going to rephrase that none of it gets done as quickly without him it all gets done better without him there are people who from the experiment who rubia ground up and chewed up and spit out whose career careers basically came to an end because of him and i said this and i remember the introduction of the book i said there were sort of three types of physicists in the world there were those who were at rubia's level and told me he was brilliant there were those who were um you know knew rubia well and said he was a very smart guy but they wouldn't want to work for him and then there were those who worked for him and uh there were points in the course of the experiment i would sit in on um group meetings and watch some young french physicists be reduced to tears by rubia's bullying and bullying can be very beneficial in science because you're really trying to force someone to think critically and you know force any sloppiness out of them but there were times i considered like look just ask ruby to step inside don't write the book punch him out will physicist physics be the better for it um i decided physics might be but i couldn't afford it um so you know that's what you wrestle with as a young writer the reviewers who didn't like my book which included christopher lehmann health at the new york times and uh jeremy bernstein uh who was a new yorker physicists writer writing i i remember correctly for the boston globe they thought i had no right to write the book i wrote to take on a physicist of this level to uh you know the i think was bernstein who said the sort of sociology and character flaws of physicists at this level don't interest him in the least the only thing that's important is this glorious cathedral of knowledge wasn't my interest so when did you happen upon upon fleischmann and pons

[01:05:48] okay this discover uh so i went back to discover as a freelancer i had a terrific contract with discover i loved uh living in paris where i wrote nobel dreams so i moved back to paris writing for discover and um and then timing soul discover science magazines have trouble making money because it turns out the only people who really read them are high school boys or at least back then or high school boys and they don't spend a lot of money so they don't support advertising revenue so timing so discover to a a low budget publisher and i lost my freelancing gig and i had a choice of living in paris and getting by on scrapping for to do freelance articles or moving to the states i had friends in la who were writing screenplays and making enormous sums of money and they said as have been said to screenwriters in the past come to l.a write screenplays get rich do what you want so i moved to los angeles started writing screenplays and in march 1989 cold fusion broke and my publisher called me up and said do you want to write a book about this and i needed to supplement my income i thought i could spend a year doing the book and make enough money to write screenplays for two years after that and then as is my want i got obsessed and ended up spending three years on the book and owed my father forty thousand dollars when i was done i've bonded with many writers over the years young writers about how much money we owed our parents by the time we were done with our first book and uh you know it was another fascinating story i actually read the so-called fusion ii chemist stan pons from the university of utah and his mentor martin fleischman from southampton university in the uk announced that they've basically created nuclear fusion in a test tube march 23 1989 it's the front page of the wall street journal within a day it's front page news all around the country the very first article i read in the los angeles times mentioned there was a competing group at cern excuse me it's cern brigham young university and as soon as i saw that there was a competing group i assumed they were wrong because as you mentioned with ua1 ua2 you have two experiments competing with each other so the motivation is to establish reliable knowledge beyond reasonable doubt right that's what you're trying to do in science but if your motivation is also to beat the other people to the reliable knowledge you're going to allow one motivation to compromise the other and now the beyond reliable doubt part is going to be tossed out in an effort to win and that's that was one of the fundamental problems at cern with the work ua1 was doing ua2 got everything right because once they came in second they were willing to do a good they were perfectly happy to do the good job i think they were doing all along um so yeah they uh on first principles did you just think it was ridiculous based on your knowledge i didn't know enough no i didn't know enough okay to think that i mean um i just smelled like bad songs and it's been a while since i read bad science actually i think that was your first i think i read that actually the first one i went back to read but um did they claim it was net energy positive or did they yeah the idea is you've so how do you make nuclear fields while you you put heavy water in a test tube with a an electrode made of palladium and you plug it into the wall and the deuterium gets sucked into the palladium and the idea somehow it gets compressed so much that it fuses and generates ideally neutrons which are one sign of future gamma rays or some radioactivity which would tell you that there was a nuclear reaction going on um if not at least generating a lot of heat so pons and fleischmann had had an uh an explosion in their laboratory with one of these cold fusion cells it was being run by ponza's sun it might have been their garage i forget the details and when the cell exploded right if you're looking for trying to create nuclear fusion and test tube and your cell explodes um you know eureka but even more important to that it wasn't just that there was a competition with the people of physicists at brigham young you know 30 miles 40 miles down the highway from the university of utah in salt lake city but the physicist at brigham young was had studied something called muon catalyzed fusion which was a type of cold fusion of the sort and had been shown pons and fleischmann's proposal and had started working on this after reading pons and fleischmann's proposal so pons and fleischmann thought their discovery was being stolen from them by a physicist who should know enough to know whether it's right or not and as i discussed this at the very end of my research when i spent about eight hours with the then president of the university of utah a very thoughtful wonderful man named chase peterson and he was explaining to me you know we were talking about their thought process and going public was something that became this huge fiasco he said you know yeah you know somebody's nothing makes your girlfriend look more attractive than your best friend trying to steal her from you and so once they decided that these people at brigham young were trying to steal it from them they decided it must be right they had to throw a press release they threw a press release and this and this enormous phenomenon kicks in where everyone in the world tries to replicate it because it seems it holds the promise of infinite free energy it's the wealth of opec and anyone can study it it costs like three thousand dollars worth of materials to put together a cold fusion cell so you have basically created a bad science generator so when did you when did it become abundantly clear to you what was going on how long into your investigation well and this is a very different kind of story right because this is immediately front page news so when i jump into it there are meetings there are conferences or other people discussing this i you know i probably flew out to utah within you know a week of having that conversation with my editor and utah is of course surrounded by you know journalists who want to know if infinite free energy has been created um funny coincidence says the wall street journal ran on the front page the author was a a a science writer for the wall street journal named jeremy bishop and he sort of took so i write a book explaining why jeremy bishop was sort of not thinking things through clearly when he put this on the front page i moved back to new york in 1993 or so i move on to a block on the upper west side of manhattan where i'm jerry bishop and i are looking into each other's windows from across the street i mean just the coincidence well anyway um the world was finding out that this was wrong and so i'm following all the attempts to replicate it so the you know in a sense this was how how science is supposed to work right somebody makes a claim of a discovery and they publish the data necessary to replicate that discovery but in independent laboratories and so independent laboratories go out and try to do that and around the world chemists and physicists tried to do that and most people got the right answer which is cold fusion doesn't exist but a half dozen laboratories around the world for reasons that tended to be different in each lab got the wrong answer uh usually and it's we can talk about that i mean there are a lot of interesting reasons why but so the the phenomena keeps going because of the signal being generated from these six labs while again the the all these other labs in the world are working out the background and some of the best scientists in the world are involved with this is a major discovery if it's true so one of the things that attracted was some of the very best physicists and nuclear physicists in the world then i had the n-chemists and i had the opportunity to work closely with these people basically to embed myself with them while they tried to replicate the experiment and did in effect the background analysis that pons and fleischmann and steve jones and brigham young never had the time to do so now you get to find out all the ways your equipment could have fooled you and assuredly did and that's the science working the way it should work and so by june of that year was clear that this was wrong that they had ponds and play the whole thing was wrong and then i continued reporting it for about nine months to tie up all the loose ends to explain some of the other positive results but it was clear to the world by within two to three months that this was just wrong and then it faded from the papers and then obviously you wrote a book about this of course so the book was really less about hey letting everybody know this was wrong because by the time the book came out it was because the book came out in 91 or something like three twenty three ninety three yeah so it was long wait no no no yeah maybe 92. yeah yeah no the purpose of the book was to explain how it became wrong right how did this happen yeah i became obsessed with how this happened that's what fast it's still what fascinates me so um you know when i'm writing about nutrition and chronic disease obesity diabetes the question is how do you come to the conclusions how do people establish conventional wisdom uh dogma the the ruling theory in any science and on what evidence and in this case cold fusion i wrote it as kind of i saw it as a sort of case study in bad science something my fantasy something that every graduate student who goes into science would be required to read so they could see the price all the different ways you're going to fool yourself and um the price of doing so how you're gonna you know of claiming something to be true that then later turns out not to be what were the what are what are the hallmarks of pathological science again there was a great paper written about this um that that wasn't it brought back to light after the cold fusion debacle um irving langmeyer uh nobel laureate chemist gave a talk at ibm and uh you know the suburbs of new york in uh 1957 on pathological he called a pathological science which is a science of things that aren't so and um these are things he said it's not about you know fraud or manipulation of the data it's about the scientists not realizing how easily they can be fooled and there are certain signs and symptoms you know the effects tend to be at the very level of the equipment's ability to detect them um there were four uh criteria that he listed i should remember them but i can't um yeah there was a sensitivity analysis in there as well uh small perturbations um you know they're i don't know we could look it up while we're at maybe um the um but let me give you an example sort of how this plays out so you've got these test tubes right um and this is a common thing um and they're supposedly generating excess heat but the physicists are saying if you've created nuclear fusion you should be generating gamma rays and neutrons those are it should be radioactive so physicists at the georgia tech actually chemist at the georgia tech research institute which is attached to georgia tech university they put together co-fusion cells and they borrow neutron detectors in fact you could think of those geiger counters from the physics department and they've got these cold fusion cells and they plug them in the cells are bubbling away and they hold the detectors over the cold fusion cells and the detectors go off and then they move the detector away and the detector stops rattling and then they bring it back over the cold fusion cell and it starts you know that's the right they're detecting neutrons clearly so they write up a paper they have a press conference and at the press conference one of the local physicists from georgia tech says to them do you realize that these neutron detectors are humidity sensitive now they're chemists they've never worked with neutron detectors before so they you know this at the press conference and they go uh tell us more about that and they say well when you held it over the cell your the cell was bubbling it's human that might have been why it went off right they're doing what scientists are supposed to do ideally before publication so they go back to the lab and now they do what they should have done all along is they do a control right so control is same experiment without the deuterium just do it with water so now you're generating same bubbles yeah now now they hold the detector over the control and it goes off and they hold it over and they realize within a day of their press conference probably 12 hours of their press conference that they've screwed up and the reason they screwed up is because they in effect chose the wrong control they thought the control was just not holding it over the cell but they weren't controlling for the humidity and that gets back to understanding your background what are all the other possible causes of what we're seeing and we have to go through methodically and this is what takes time time time and you need the help of every smart person you know to point out all the different things that you might have thought for that you now have to design an experiment to control for and so everywhere in the country somebody did an experiment and claimed that they had seen signs of cold fusion ultimately you could explain it away as some aspect of the background that they didn't understand and it was always so it was chemists trying to do physics it was physicists trying to do chemistry i feel they weren't intimately and often even you know they if these cells are really creating nuclear fusion they got to be generating more heat than they're taking in from the wall you know they're plugged into the wall um so they have to generate more heat and they you know expenditure has to be greater than intake it's a chico thing here and um the signs of calorimetry is very complicated so there are people out there who spend their whole lives doing nothing but calorimetry they're they were called calorimetrists in the chemical world and they were capable of doing these experiments right when they did the experiments they saw no excess heat when somebody who wasn't a professional calorimetrist did the experiment they inevitably saw a little bit of excess heat often because they didn't realize that there's some feedback from the going down the cord so you're going to get heat coming back into the or energy coming back into the cell from the from the the the you know the power source and if you know if you haven't spent your whole life doing this you don't know the details of the background how long did it take for pons and fleischmann to sort of come to to grips with their errors well i don't think they ever did i mean this is the one of them's not even alive anymore right so he went to his grave believing i think they both might have passed away by now um it's been a long time fleischmann would have been at least 50 in 1989 so um probably older i think they both passed away um you know it's funny i get um there's a section of the twitter sphere that likes to point out that i was asked once at a at a debate in in england whether or not i would ever change my mind about the um energy uselessness of the energy balance equation for obesity and i said no i doubt it and they always so constantly i get these tweets directed at me where where people say look why are you even discussing with talbs he said he would never change his mind anyway and the reason i said that is because you have phenomenal like pons and fleischmann i've witnessed people live through this and what they end up it's virtually it takes a kind of superhuman intellect to be able to say something i've believed beyond reasonable doubt and have staked my reputation on is actually wrong it's always easier for somebody to believe personally that um all the other experiments screwed up people just didn't do the experiment right and i used to joke that even if cold fusion was real someday you know back when i made this joke i was probably thinking around 2021 there will be the stan ponds memorial cold fusion nuclear plant you know on the coast between san diego and la pumping out enough energy from three beakers of heavy water to to power the entire you know southern empire and i'm going to be crawling around the outside of that you know the the perimeter fence with you know a beard and pieces of dunkin donuts and the beard looking for where and a tattered copy of bad science looking for where the damn thing is plugged in because i know it's a con right i am never going to be able to change my mind and accept but then on the other hand my argument to the cold fusion people was if you want us to believe it create cold fusion cells make billions of dollars you know the day that my neighbor buys a cold fusion power car i'm gonna have to start believing it or i'm in trouble until then i think an enormous amount of skepticism if not closing my mind is perhaps a correct thing to do well i do want to come back to the point about um your flexibility or lack thereof with respect to current belief systems around nutrition but let's now really pivot from a career that spans you know a decade and a half uh writing about physics uh and other means of science to the the pursuit of uh public health what how did your curiosity get peaked there what what took you into um a new avenue of science okay so the cold fusion book bad science is basically i interviewed around 300 people for this book um horace freeland judson who was one of the great science writers of the late 20th century he wrote the uh oh christ eighth day of creationism what it's called i always get it confused with uh man increases book um a book about the history of uh yeah the eighth day of creation the book about the history of the molecular biology revolution anyway he said i had done more research than for the stupidest scientific subject than any human being alive um i was obsessed with how this had happened how people made the mistakes how the sociology worked and again i became obsessed with pathological science as a concept and when i was done with the book i had a lot of friends in the physics community who really respected and appreciated what i did and some of my friends in the physics community were involved in this debate about whether or not electromagnetic fields from can from power lines can cause cancer and that involved so on one level physics because you're the what we know about physics is they can cause cancer because their wavelengths are too big to interact with something as small as cells um and on the other side you have epidemiology you have the science of you know uh disease how diseases spread and and researchers saying we can measure the field strength around power lines and and somehow make an association between that the levels of cancer in people living near the power lines and so my physicist friends were horrified at the level of science they were seeing and when my book came out they said well look if you're interested in bad science maybe you should look at this stuff in public health because it's terrible and so the very first article i did i did an article for the atlantic on the powerline cancer connection and um it was dependent on this field of epidemiology which i had never paid any attention to never had any reason to but i had spent the previous six seven years learning about how hard science is to get right and being uh schooled and tutored and you know lectured into believing that you have to be extraordinarily rigorous and methodical and relentless or you'll get the wrong answer and here was a field where basically people just said we're going to look at this we're going to look at that we're going to get an association we're going to assume it's causal they consider doing the kind of rigorous testing of hypotheses to be a luxury that they couldn't afford so i wrote the atlantic piece and then i wrote a piece on epidemiology for the journal science that was infamous i was used to be that if you wanted to publish critics of the field first you published alvin feinstein who was at yale and then it was feinstein and talbs and now it's ion 80s and feinstein and tabs have kind of been you know dwarfed by by john ionide's contribution and feinstein was a controversial character so anyway that was it it was sort of here's the field of science by the way which we'll be linking to in the show notes um epic pieces yeah so feinstein's piece was um i mean you've got a field of science where there's you can't do the experiments so that's that's the first problem that's a problem with every field where there's an act of controversy if you can do the experiments easily like cold fusion i think i've discovered infinite free energy well tell me how you did it let me see if i can do the same thing and if i can't we gotta talk and if he can't and she can't and and they can't then you're you probably screwed up dude um if you can't do the experiment then depending how interesting it is you then develop a field of science around basically a hypothesis and often people assume that hypoth as more and more people see the same phenomena but without using the rigorous experimental techniques of an experimental science they start to believe that this hypothesis is true and you again what i describe with rubia with this sort of group thing phenomenon where you collect the people who see the signal and you ignore the people who work on the background in epidemiology there was never any significant work on the background so you could think of epidemiology where you you have a cohort of people say the nurses health study the most famous in the us you know 110 000 nurses and you give them questionnaires food frequency questionnaires and you ask them what they're eating and they tell you what they're eating and then you follow them and you see who gets sick and who doesn't and then you look at what the people who get sick tended to be eating versus what the people who didn't get sick tend to be eating and you have an association between diet and disease and there's no causal information in that association but now you hypothesize that the association's causing what the whatever they're eating or not eating causes disease or you know keeps these people prevent and there's no way to rigorously test it but let's let's let's stop for a second gary and explain to people why the intuitive is not so because i i i think it's worth spending a second on the fact that and you've probably heard me on this rant before but you know the all of this stuff that we talk about in terms of the rigor of scientific thinking it's a relatively recent phenomenon it's less than 400 years old all of the things you're describing are less than 400 years old which means from an evolutionary perspective they're non-existent it's not wired into our dna and you know i just might add that everything i'm describing is in so francis bacon 401 years ago publishes nova morgan which is sort of the beginning text in the scientific method and um and everything's in there i had to go back around 2001 2002 i read bacon because i was thinking maybe i'm just crazy and that's where i'm starting i'm basically starting at bacon which is why i'm saying call it 400 i didn't realize it was i thought bacon was six i thought he was a little later in the 17th century but okay directionally for so so directionally 400 years ago but if you think back to 4 000 years ago 40 000 years ago right if you think back into the roots of our genes the ability to pattern recognize and make an inference that by definition is presumed to be causal from an association must have been a vital trait for our success right you know i saw larry doing x larry has you know more mating opportunities than me doing x must be the reason that larry has more mating opportunities than me yeah you know but the interesting thing is that's true so you make the association and then you test it right i'm gonna do x and see if i get more mating you know and evolution is going to test it right because if you know john now does x and it ends up getting him killed but we didn't codify it i think that's the difference we didn't live long enough to see the result because the arc of the information coming back is too long so um you're right evolution did follow the experiment but the at the individual level we never got to learn from it so so so come along 401 years ago and of course many steps along the way with the introduction of true randomization statistics which became an important tool etc you have this concept that is very foreign to people and while anybody can say very glibly well correlation doesn't equal causation i think anybody has has heard that and understands what it means i don't think it's entirely clear to people why control and randomization matter and how ubiquitous bias is right so so why is it that people living next to telephone poles who have a higher likelihood of getting cancer are not getting it because of the telephone poles or the power lines rather the this this question you're asking like okay so we see more cancers close to the power lines than we see far away um can we explain that as something other than the power lines cause cancer and so what else could explain this that's the issue and now you've opened up a door where we have an infinite number of possibilities that's why right now the the probability that your hypothesis correct has gone down enormously as soon as you accept the like the the reality that there are an infinite number of other possibilities that you have to roll out some are very likely you prefer to you used to refer to you know their first order factors in second order and as you go down they become less and less likely um and this when we talked about the physicists needing a five sigma effect that's because they're going to say well we can rule out all the major factors and we want to leave a lot of room for the for the fourth fifth sixth order variables because those aren't gonna you know we can't get to everything so maybe people live closer to power lines are poorer than people who live farther away from power lines they might be a slightly lower socioeconomic status okay nobody wants to live next to power lines they're unsightly they make noises so if you can afford not to you don't so maybe what you think is being caused by the cancer is actually a result of socioeconomic status i think a lot of the what the epidemiologists published are false positives that could be explained by socioeconomic status now the epidemiologist will tell you that they correct for that don't they look at the household income if they look at the household incomes there are major studies the nurses health study the most famous study in america never looked at household incomes so when people accuse them in 1987 on their first major observation was the idea that hormone replacement therapy might prevent heart disease significant prevention of heart disease other epidemiologists said well well this is another long story let's get into this let's get back to cancer and then we can get into that kind of problem um the point is many people don't so uh let's say who did you measure you know you you had to get the health records of people right so to know how much cancers they had so how'd you get their health records well we called the people up and we talked to them and asked them you know if they wanted to be involved in the study and can we get their health records well the people we called we got to consider we're calling them during the day so maybe the people answered the phone are the people who aren't working right so maybe there's a socio economic style maybe there's a bias there because the more affluent people the people actually have jobs are not home to answer the phone during the day right maybe so there's a whole world of things like that or maybe the people more likely to participate in the study are the ones that have worse outcomes worth reporting more they want to participate in the study because god knows you know little jimmy had a brain cancer and they never understood why and now you're giving them a reason so they want to be a part of this study and so this is you know this is the process that rubia didn't like to do of doing the background analysis it's very hard to do because you have to each one of these factors is a hypothesis in and of itself so you have to be able to test the hypothesis maybe the biases in the phone sampling process cause what we see how do we test that you know if you can't do an experiment it's very hard to test and then there's this factor we didn't finish we were talking about nobel dreams my first book so rubia and company are spending this the fall and the winter of 1985-86 trying to understand their background they understand more and more of their background they finally come to the revelation that they're probably not seeing anything and other people are doing the same thing also and there's a meeting in the iosta valley in northern italy where they're going to discuss all of this and i went to that meeting and in the meeting an elderly italian physicist i forget his first name his last name was altorelli a very cool guy al torelli stands up in the meeting ruby and everybody is there and altorelli begins to explain all the different ways that the equipment could have fooled ruby into thinking every possible other explanation for the event so maybe in this case the muon comes off and it gets lodged in the infinitesimal you know dividing line between the two detectors and you don't see it maybe uh a neutrino comes off on this one and it bounces off the side of the towel detector and you don't see it maybe any and by the time he's done and the chapter in the book was called the altarelli cocktail and you come up with all these different ways one of this one of that one of these are all the unknown unknowns you can now imagine them because every the around the world physicists have spent months trying to and it's clear that if you begin to understand the background and all the unknown unknowns you could explain everything ruby and company has seen it's not a five sigma result it's not even a one sigma result and that's that's where the discovery died was in that meeting in aosta um the same thing happened so then again this is programming my thinking in cold fusion all these different labs that had published positive results i told you what happened at the georgia tech research institute they all had a different explanation it was another version of the altarelli cocktail but the point was whenever they saw something that confirmed their preconceptions they accepted it okay so there's a selection bias in what you pay attention to and you're always going to pay less attention to the things you don't want to see so in epidemiology people might look for one explanation say i believe so socioeconomic status probably explains a good deal of these phenomena and people just don't measure it or they don't measure it right um but even if it can only explain a quarter of the phenomena or a tenth i can guarantee you that there are probably nine other things that could cover the other nine the difference is in epidemiology right you're looking for 95 confidence level you're you're willing to claim a causal effect based on there is no causal information and you're willing to claim a causality based on a two sigma not five not three but a ninety-five percent confidence level when if you actually try to think about it if you said let's treat this like the physicists treat their science we can go through and we can come up with so many possible alternative explanations that there's a very high likelihood that what you see claiming is a discovery is a false positive now in the case of that example what would be the alternative experiment how would we if we're trying to answer the public health question which is it's inevitable that we have power lines we have to make an infrastructure decision which is can they traverse the areas where people live one would argue that the length of time it would take to answer that question which would be to randomize people independent of every variable imaginable assuming you could get people willing to comport to such an experiment for a long enough period of time to see a result i mean you can quickly convince yourself that it's simply impossible to do a true experiment here and yet an answer to that question should be known so what is good enough well and that's that's that's the debate this is what the field of you know chronic disease epidemiology has been going through so infectious disease epidemiology like with covet is a very different issue you can in effect do randomized controlled trials like you do with vaccines here you as you just explained there they're effectively impossible certainly with something like power lines because you're never going to be able to randomize people to live near power lines or away from power lines um there are ways you know i think they're they're just beyond the limit of science so the question is how do you deal with that issue the conventional thinking has been to embrace this idea of prudent avoidance so yeah we do that when we wear masks for covet but prudent avoidance says you create regulations to try and minimize whatever you know fields are being emitted from these power lines so the power lines pay more they're not avoiding uh a potential harm doesn't come without its own harms as we know in the covet debate about what happens with shutdowns so you can say well we can regulate the power lines better but that means the power companies are going to raise their rates and now people are going to have to pay more for power which means their socioeconomic status is going to be lower per dollar earned you know there are positives and negatives and these have become social value judgments more than anything the question is also what's the incumbent on the researchers you know we're both every fan of science tends to be a richard feynman science fan if not a richard feynman as an individual has become apparently far more conflicting um you know finances and i quote this in the beginning of good calories bad calories a fundamental what you need fundamentally in good science is this sort of bending over backwards to be honest about what you know and what you don't know so as soon as you start doing and he says this in his 1974 caltech commencement talk where he talks about the difference between advertising and and and good science good science the it's incumbent upon the investigators to talk about all the limitations in their research and i think in an ideal uh the article you know published journal report the limitations section would be longer than the results section because what we want to know is all the ways they could have fooled themselves realizing that they very likely did um and then to discuss it with complete and utter honesty rigor um you know again i have critics who would say i don't do that i personally i try to do that the best i possibly can because i think that's the sort of uh you know ethical moral obligation of doing science or writing about science is not over exaggerating it if the people if the scientist covering the power line controversy said we think we know this but these are all the things we don't know nobody acts that's the problem so if they're right like we think cigarettes caused lung cancer but we never did a randomized controlled trial now the lung cancer effect is huge that's like a six sigma effect if even if there's no causal information so we could kind of believe that's causal because we can't think of any alternative explanation for why smokers have such a hugely increased risk if you're honest about what you see that's fulfilling the obligation the scientists but now nobody changes their behavior so if you're right that say power lines cause cancer people are going to get cancer because you haven't forcefully enough made your argument and that's the conflict of public health science how do we get people to change their behavior when we really don't know if they should and this is an enormous problem it's the dietary salt dietary fat it's where we're going to be going in the next couple of minutes here so um okay so you've you've struggled through power lines and cancer you've you've come to wrestle with the pitfalls of epidemiology what what brings you into uh into the den of of nutrition um i'm living in l.a venice near the beach i'm doing freelance science journalism and working on screenplays probably still not making any money so my friends were wrong about at least my ability to get rich writing screenplays um i call up my editor at science and i say look i got to pay the rent next month this month i need a story i could turn over quickly do you have anything i could write that'll generate a paycheck and so researchers have just reported they're reporting on the first results on the dash diet this dietary approach is to stop hypertension it's a a sort of low fat lots of fruits and vegetables dietary approach and the papers coming out the new england journal of medicine and they have a preprint they have a pre-release copy it's embargoed and so i should write about this so the way you can you and you've never written about like nutrition and health science never written about nutrition no okay so he's pretty desperate if he's giving you this because this is a little outside of your wheelhouse right no it's one page in the magazine it's not a lot of not a lot going on so the way you do a one-page story right you you call up the principal investigator if it's a the article hasn't been published yet you ask the pi you you interview him you ask api for the names of a couple of other people who know about the research you could comment uh three interviews for one page is doing your job so it takes a morning to do the interviews and afternoon to write the article it's a day and a half i get my rent money what i didn't know about this article is it had been leaked to science okay in advance and it had been leaked with a list of researchers who i could interview um so i i my editor gave this was 1998 or 9 98 probably my editor gives me the list he doesn't tell me it was leaked or if he did i didn't pay attention um so i get the article i call up the principal investigator larry appel at johns hopkins i interview him i ask him for the names of people i could talk to i call up one of the people on the list this is a former president the american heart association at the university of alabama birmingham and this person tells me that they can't talk about the paper or they'll lose their funding and i say it's this we're talking about a diet trial the new england journal of medicine nobody loses their funding for talking about that it's going to be it's not going to come out to after the embargo the woman she refuses to talk to me she won't tell me anything i said look if there's something wrong with this paper let's go off the record not for attribution like woodward and bernstein in the garage with deep throat tell me what's wrong with this paper what the issue is because if you don't tell me i'll never know and i'll report it incorrectly she refuses even to do that so then i get off the phone with her i call up one of the people that larry appellate johns hopkins has given me and he's a a researcher who is starts yelling at me this guy is a the grand old man of the field i don't know this and he starts yelling mary over the phone that there's no controversy over salt and blood pressure and i say i'm not calling about salt and blood pressure professor i'm calling about this diet trial that lowered blood pressure in the new england journal of medicine and he continues to berate me that there's no controversy so i get off the phone with him and i call up my editor at science i said i had an american heart association former president refused to talk to me because she would lose her funding she said if she did and then i had this other guy yelling at me that there's no controversy over salt and blood pressure when i'm not writing about salt and blood pressure there must be a controversy about some blood pressure that i know nothing about so i'm going to write up this article get my paycheck and then if you don't mind i'm going to look into the salt blood bread the assumed salt blood pressure controversy and see what we're missing and i spent the next nine months reporting that i interviewed about 85 people for one magazine article turns out that it is one of the most vitriolic controversies in the history of medicine and even though already by 1998 we'd all been eating low salt diets in america for 15 to 20 years it was clear that the randomized control evidence never really supported the intervention and that it was backed up by a lot of bad epidemiology and research is assuming that associations were causal that weren't and there were even questionable associations to begin with and while i was doing that story this fellow who was yelling at me i like to joke he sounded exactly like walter matthau over the telephone by the way he's still alive he's about 101 years old so while i'm running him down as a scientist that's arguing evidence that maybe he understands nutrition and diet far better than i do anyway while i was interviewing him this walter matthau character it was clearly the you know i had spent 10 years of my life studying bad science was clear this guy was one of the worst scientists i'd ever interviewed in my life in the bottom five at least and i thought i had interviewed the worst and he took credit not just for getting americans to eat less salt but eat less fat as well for the low-fat diet we had all been on since 1984. so at one point i called up my editor and i said look you know if this guy was involved in this controversy the fat controversy in any way fat story there's got to be a story there you know the message from nobel dreams and bad science was that bad scientists never get the right answer you know it's just it's too hard to get the right answer for you to go in being sloppy and slip shot and lazy and ambitious and get it right nature isn't that kind so i said you know when i'm done writing about salt i'm going to write about fat i have no idea what the story is i've been eating i've been living in l.a you know eating my egg whites and you know probably a 15 fat diet dean ornish would have been proud of me but if the dogma was based in any substantive way on this fellows work there's a story there and i spent a year writing that piece i interviewed 145 researchers and administrators for one magazine article and um you know the big fat lie let's see no this was uh the soft science of dietary fat so this was the salt story was called the political science of salt political in parentheses and the fat story was called the soft science of dietary fat soft in parentheses they both won national association of science writers science and society awards what made you decide to go even further and and write what would become uh perhaps the biggest and most controversial piece you wrote at least in the newspaper um i believe it was for the the times magazine wasn't it yeah new york times magazine um i wanted to write a book when i was done with the two science articles on whatever was happening in medical science that could lead to these kinds of mistakes remember my obsession is pathological science the nutrition aspect of it is just an interesting vehicle through which to explore it i realized that if i did a book then i would go broke i was married i had responsibilities um i remember i had come out forty thousand dollars in debt just doing the cold fusion book it was clear i didn't work fast and i didn't want to work fast and that i would not be able to get in advance large enough to cover the time it would take to do the book so i was living in new york i was having lunch once a month with an editor from the new york times magazine because among other things we shared an affinity for the same local french cafe in the village and we would talk about story ideas and we decided it might be a good idea to see about to ask the question what caused the obesity epidemic and i said to this guy when i was reporting the dietary fat story for science i had had met up with a administrator from the nih who said you know it's interesting when we told people to go on low-fat diets in 1984 we assume we really didn't have the evidence to support the heart disease connection and the message of my story is they never got that evidence but we thought if nothing else we'd be telling people to avoid the densest calories in the diet so if they avoided fat they'd lose weight and that would take care of the if you you know obesity and and overweight of the greatest risk factors for heart disease and he said lo and behold now we have an obesity epidemic and apparently people stopped eating fat and eating more carbohydrates and that got them fatter so i always had this two hypotheses for what caused the obesity epidemic which you can see in the data begins somewhere between 1978-1991 and it coincides with two fundamental changes in the american diet one was a low-fat the embracing of the idea that a low-fat diet is a heart-healthy diet so carbohydrates in general go from being considered inherently fattening which is sort of the conventional wisdom until the 1960s and then they get transformed into heart-healthy diet foods and you may be too young to remember this but we all stopped eating butter and started having pasta and bagels every day and lo and behold everybody starts getting fatter the other thing is high fructose corn syrup came in um 1977 78 high fructose corn syrup 55 comes in which can replace sugar in coca-cola and pepsi and by 1984 it saturates the beverage industry and this coincides with the beginning of the epidemic and people like michael pollan had suggested that high fructose corn syrup was the cause of the epidemic so we decided i would write an article about what might have caused the obesity epidemic it was new enough then that people cared and this would be an important story and in the course of writing that article i came upon five studies that had been published that had been finished but not yet published that all been discussed in conferences so i could discuss them in the article which had compared the atkins diet which is a low carbohydrate high fat eat as much as you want diet to the kind of low fat calorie restricted diet the american heart association was pushing and then all five trials the atkins diet not only did people lose more weight but their heart disease risk factors improved so remember i'm coming at this kind of from my program to think from a scientific perspective i won't say that i'm coming from it to it as a scientist because i know people don't like to hear that from a journalist um they're too fundamental they're two hypotheses out there one is that people get fat because they eat too much and the other is that people get heart disease because they eat high fat foods and now you run a diet trial where you compare a high fat eat as much as you want diet to a low fat calorie restricted diet and your two hypotheses would predict that the high fat diet the atkins diet those patients would get fatter because they could eat as much as they want and clearly they got fat to begin with because they eat too much and that they would have worse heart disease risk factors and in both cases a hypothesis failed to pan out so from a scientific perspective the first five clinical trials on low carb high fat diets actually it was the second through six there was one earlier one that saw the same thing that no one discussed all refuted two of the fundamental hypotheses of modern nutrition science how did you find these i mean i know one of them one of these in there is the minnesota heart study which wasn't published until 1989 right yeah no this is these are the clinical trials so this is eric westman's first trial at duke there was a group at the va hospital in pennsylvania that was doing a trial there was along some researchers why weren't they published uh they just hadn't been published yet they had been finished and the research were talking about then once i did my article it made it both more important for them to get published and simultaneously harder for them to get published because nobody wanted to hear they wanted to see what these people really had but not actually have to publish what these people really had but over the next two or three years they all came out in the journals um how did you sort of come to grips with this this is now challenging your own beliefs uh presumably you had believed that this low-fat diet was healthier had you ever struggled with your weight yeah well remember i was a college football player so in college i tried to be as heavy as humanly possible and eating constantly i don't know if you did this in college but and we would go out at 11 o'clock at night to uh elsie's or the diner across the street from the dorm and eat a thousand calories or 1500 calories worth of the biggest sandwiches they had and then go home and go to bed i mean that's what you you know anyway i could get up to 240. my boxing weight was 212 and uh once i turned 30 and simultaneously had moved to california i just started drifting upward while i was reporting the science article i was simultaneously doing a piece for discover magazine on the mathematics of the stock market and so i was up at mit interviewing a economist who ran the laboratory for financial engineering up there about his research you know trying to establish whether people like warren buffett are brilliant or just lucky which is an interesting question because you're looking for the signal of talent over the signal of luck over the background of luck and you don't of course fully understand your background so we got to talk about good science and bad science i told him about the dietary fat article i was writing and he said well if you're doing a story on fat you've got to try atkins um he said his collaborator warden's father lost 200 pounds on atkins and this fellow in mit is a asian american and he said he gave up basically gave up white rice and lost 40 pounds so i went back to l.a where i was living at that point i was unmarried i my parents had passed away i had no children if i killed myself on atkins the only one who might care were my cats and so i did advocate as an experiment and lost 25 pounds in six weeks and then like everyone else i sort of drifted off the diet by the time i started this new york times magazine piece but um if you go back to read the new york times magazine article there's a line in it that says you know overweight of course is caused by taking in more calories and you expand which today i think is a meaningless statement and both wrong and meaningless um the uh there were a lot of ways i had already because of my research on the dietary fat story i could already accept the idea that these diets would not raise the risk of heart disease it was clear to me the dietary fat story was uncompelling at best and there was no compelling evidence to to avoid saturated fats um the question about the fundamental cause of obesity and how best to regulate weight was something i didn't really understand when i did that article but that article will be you know exceedingly controversial article on the front page of the new york times magazine will indeed get you a large book advance if the subject's one of you know uh natural interests to readers it did get me a large book advance people like to say that that's the only reason i came to the controversial conclusions i did because it would sell more books what they don't realize is that a large advance in new york was enough to live for four years and the book took me five years um the uh anyways that was it that that's when i started the research for good calories bad calories and got obsessed with that story and how did your thinking of the nuance around this topic evolved during the writing of good calories bad guys which i think came out in 07 right right i mean it's still evolving that's what's so bizarre about this is i still wake up at three in the morning thinking why didn't i say that 13 years ago um because so there's these two issues right which i i i mean i don't think we'll have time to go into both of them uh the one being the saturated fat uh issue which is that dietary saturated fat uh drives atherosclerosis and the other being the cause of obesity uh being calorie imbalance and you kind of go after both of these in parallel but they're really different one they're not they're not they're not mutually exclusive right well they're but they're related they're very related yes they're very and that's the issue so the diet if uh you know the dietary heart story was we get heart disease because of the dietary fat saturated fat content of the diet elevating ldl cholesterol and here a guy like atkins comes along and says well look don't eat carbohydrates so if you want to minimize your risk of heart disease by the dietary fat store you avoid fats saturated fats you replace them with carbohydrates back then now they say monounsaturated or unsaturated fats and you're now eating a carbohydrate-rich diet and in theory you're going to minimize your risk of heart disease the flip side was that carbohydrates are fattening that's the simplest way to describe what's now called the carbohydrate insulin model to those of us who gain weight easily it's the carbohydrates that do it and we can't eat carbs but if you don't eat carbs what are you going to replace those with and your choices are protein and fat and protein usually comes with fat attached and real foods and so you're going to increase your fat consumption one way or the other and now you're eating a diet then theory is supposed to kill you and that was the one of the many arguments against atkins was it's going to trigger heart disease and you're going to drop dead when i first tried it as an experiment i was kept waiting to drop that and i'm still waiting i mean i still have a piece of bacon and or a piece of you know pat of butter and i wait for my heart to blow up um so one of the issues i had to deal with in the book is is a diet how did we come to believe that dietary fats the problem so the first third of the book is the evolution of the it's the soft science of dietary fat at book length that how did we how did this theory evolve what was the real data what were the problems with the data you know um why is it likely wrong and then the second part of the book is as doing the research i realized that there had always been a competing hypothesis which is that the chronic diseases that associate with modern diets and lifestyles are driven by the carbohydrate content of the diet so this started as a british hypothesis british nutritionists and then it should have embraced in the 1960s the research by people like jerry reeve and others on insulin resistance and all of that targeted the quality and the type of carbohydrates we're eating the glycemic index and the fructose content and i didn't know anything about that when i started this research but by the time and so the first third of good calories bad calories is the deconstruction of the fat hypothesis the second third is the replacement with a carbohydrate-centric hypothesis and then the third third of the second half of the book actually is this question of obesity because it's clear that whatever causes obesity is so closely associated heart disease and diabetes type 2 diabetes that whatever makes us fat also causes these chronic diseases that associate with us and the question is what makes us fat and now i doing the research i also came upon a whole other stream of research that had kind of been ignored uh first by pre-world war ii european researchers saying obesity is not an energy balance problem it's not caused by people eating too much it's a hormonal regulatory disorder and then post world war ii by people studying primarily the science of hunger saying in effect hunger is caused by fuel availability in the periphery so if you have enough if your liver thinks there's enough fuel available then you're not going to be hungry and when your liver starts thinking fuel is being crimped then it'll release inhibitions on food-seeking behavior and that work done by people in this field of physiological psychology all implicated that insulin as the hormone determining fuel availability the primary hormone and then there was also and this i think is what gets me most um beginning around 1930 the until 1930 virtually no one studied fat tissue it wasn't it was a there were in all these sort of burgeoning fields of physiology and endocrinology nobody really cared the assumption was it was inert it was for padding and cushioning and if you starve people somehow the fat tissue would shrink um then you get this revolution beginning and they had no way to study fat tissue or fat accumulation then beginning in 1933 with this work of this german immigrant schonheimer at working at columbia you start having people studying fat tissue there they become aware that mobilization deposition goes into fat goes on constantly like even when you're in between meals are starving your body is still depositing calories as fat and mobilizing calories as fat and through the 1940s and 50s they begin to work out the details as more and more tools become available to study this problem and by the mid 1960s you have very well established science of what we could call intermediary metabolism which is what the researchers what your body does with the foods the proteins fats and carbohydrates after you eat them and then what your body continues to do to make fuel available as necessary to your body and all of this is left out of the science of obesity as soon as the obesity researchers start saying we've demonstrated that obesity is caused by energy balance imbalance the in political way of saying that is people eat too much that's a fact of life we can see it in our animal models because when we create an obese animal model it tends to be what they call hyperphagic which is very hungry so we have an association between hunger and obesity and we assume causality and um they never actually they just kind of ignore the entire science of fat metabolism and even to this day when i try to make that point it's excruciatingly hard to nobody wants to hear it nobody wants to deal with it it's and you know if i had to prove it to an editor i could i ideally i would have the fact checker fly out to my office at oakland and say let's go through these textbooks from 1965 onward and i'll show you the complete and utter absence of any discussion of the science of fat metabolism fat storage from the obesity discussion and from the 1960s onward the obesity researchers are dominating well obesity research in the 1960s is dominated by psychiatrists and psychologists trying to get fat people to eat less people like mickey stunkert who was a wonderful man but his expertise was psychology and this idea that obesity is a hormonal dysregulation of fat storage fatty acid oxidation and storage a fuel partitioning disorder gets left out of the field who do you most credit for the that that changing that that that new course in the 1930s thereabouts i mean where where did this where did this idea that um the idea that we now take for granted that that um that is the dominant point of view with respect to uh obesity being caused by caloric imbalance rather than being the result um of caloric uh or rather resulting from um what what sowed the seeds and and frankly what what what were the what were the um cause there has to be luck sometimes right like sometimes there's a dominant personality wins out or something like that so well this is the issue one of the um yeah i mentioned i'm working on a book on diabetes now and it very much delves into the history of the field and how much you know i can imagine six maybe seven people reading it once it's published um you think of a field like diabetes where elliot jocelyn opens the first diabetes clinic in the u.s dedicated diabetes clinic in the u.s around 1900 and by 1916 he's seen a thousand patients which is about 950 more diabetic patients than any other doctor in america so he writes the first textbook in 1916 and he does another edition in 1917 and 1923 and 28 and 33 and we're now on i think edition 14 of jocelyn's diabetes mellitus jocelyn's became the determinant of truth the arbitrator of truth in the diabetes world one researcher one physician he's a wonderful physician not a great scientist because of his position in the field this doesn't happen in other i don't know if it happened it didn't happen in physics because there are too many bright people arguing about the data and not enough people outside care but in medicine you get fields in which single individuals like the the the that was the famous breast cancer surgeon from hopkins uh yeah and it's just it's maybe you a kind of unique phenomena in science in obesity research so there was no such thing as obesity research pre-1930 if when you read the literature and you go back and look at the literature there's half a dozen physicians around the world who are writing articles about obesity and often with some statement of causality and there's kind of two competing hypotheses one is fat people just eat too much and you know that's true because you have an association between gluttony and obesity right they watched shakespeare we know falstaff was obese he had this zest for living he ate people out of house and home so therefore you assume causality from an association that's classic pathological science and the other is that people who suffer from obesity have some kind of hormonal disregard some kind of dysregulation where they're going to get fat regardless of how much they eat okay so 1930 lewis newberg comes along he's a physician at the university of michigan he does what he considers the first experimental test of the hormonal regulatory disorder hypothesis so you get fat no matter how much you eat or how little um he runs a test on six or seven people he discusses it at a medical meeting in boston so this guy is now we'll call him the uh if not the newton of the field the eddington of modern you know this is the guy's name that everyone if obesity research was a functioning science every obesity researcher would be insulted if they you thought they didn't know who lewis newberg was he publishes a series of papers in 1930 based on 3031 based on the one experiment with like seven patients where he basically uh starves lean people and patients with obesity and says they lose weight at roughly the same rate when starved therefore the obese people kind of not making this up got fat because aid too much um that this he saw this as uh refuting the conventional that this hormonal regulatory hypothesis nobody's ever done an experiment in obesity before so newberg's papers begin to be taken as gospel and even though there are european researchers particularly julius bauer who's one of the pioneers of the science of endocrinology at the university of vienna and austria which the germans and austrians at this period of time are the sort of apex of the the height of medical science he's writing that this is naive and can't possibly be right based on a series of you know what i think are very logical and undeniable observations even back in 1920 as soon as newberg publishes his article uh bauer co-authors an article the first thing he ever writes in english explaining why newberg's argument is inane this idea that people get fat as they take in more calories and they expand 1938 the first animal model of obesity is um pioneered at the laboratory of a fellow named ransom the leading neuroanatomist of the era and by his graduate student albert hetherington and they take what's called a stereotactic instrument where you could use it to direct the needle into the brain of an animal and it's been used on dogs hetherington pioneers so he could use it on rats and he can reproducibly create obesity if they lesion the ventrimedial hypothalamus of the wrath hetherington has a he's a post-doc there's a fellow postdoc at the lab named john broback who 1939 gets a job to go back to yale to go to gets accepted at yale for medical school he's got his doctorate he goes back to new haven he needs to get a job to help finance medical school he gets a job in a laboratory and he realizes there's a stereotaxic instrument and he can do the same experiments that hetherington did and brobeck starts doing the dmh lesion experiments at yale and broback comes creates what he believes he discovers what he calls um hyperphagic obesity so you lesion the vmh of the rat the rat gets obese and it gets crazy hungry and so you now have the association that the rats got so hungry that even as you're um taking the anesthesia off them they're basically trying to eat as they're coming out of anesthesia it's like they're gay the way i interviewed recently a researcher who did these experiments in the 70s he compared it to gasping for breath so like if you were drowning and you suddenly come up above the water and you're going the animals are eating like that and it's a fascinating observation because you can explain it pretty easily and in fact if you don't allow the anesthesia to wear off if you allow the animal to eat while it's still under the influence of the anesthesia it might choke to death and they often did so the researchers had to learn to give the animal a couple hours despite its evidence starvation um brobeck has read newberg okay so brobeck interprets this these experiments as um i created hyperphagia extreme hunger in the animals that's the discovery and the animal got obese the fact that the animal got obese because it was hyperphagic is just boring animals get fat because they eat too much i know that because that's what newberg says um back in chicago at ransom's lab what's positive because that's a very important point right i think this gets to something you've already talked about twice but i want to make sure the reader doesn't miss the subtlety of this or the listener rather the observation is undeniable if you lesion the part of the brain in question the animal eats in an uncontrolled manner however if your incoming hypothesis is that overeating leads to obesity you will interpret it as lesioning that part of the brain leads to overeating if your hypothesis is that fat accumulation dysregulated fat accumulation leads to obesity you would interpret that finding as lesioning that part of the brain leads to dysregulated fat accumulation which then causes overeating and that's a that's a very subtle difference and i try to be fair to the people of the era to see how easy it could be to make that mistake right well and now let's put it in the context of remember the cold fusion what's your control yeah so if your hypothesis is that eating too much causes obesity okay in these animals when they're lesion the proper control is control for the eating too much so what i was going to say back in chicago hetherington and ransom had animals that got obese independent of the hyperphagia so some of their animals got fat anyway actually some of brobeck's animals also got fat despite not eating any more than lean animals did he ever pair feed his animals with with non-lesioned um brobeck did he did an experiment where he pair fed them with i forget yeah non-lesioned animals and if i remember correctly it was a dozen animals nine of them manifested uh did not get that much fat did not get fatter but three of them did despite being pair fed so brobeck because he had a pre-existing hypothesis assumed that there must have been something wrong with these three animals or he did the lesion incorrectly or maybe they were eating at different times so he left them out of the analysis he mentions it in their paper but they're the counter argument they're the evidence for this counter hypothesis which something about the lesion dysregulates fat accumulation but then why did what do you think explains the other nine oh christ um you can imagine that if you disregulate the fat so let's say we take a animal that normally would grow naturally and we create a dysregulation in their fat tissue such that it's going to store excess fat it might not be able to do that if you restrict its calories it's that simple so that's the idea that you know we both know we all know from personal experience we can lose weight by starving ourselves so we can somehow starve our our our predisposition to get fatter by restricting the foods the amount of food we eat but the question is you know what we want to know is the animals that the the the counter argument to the hyperphagia causes obesity evidence is obesity being caused in the absence of hyperphagia okay so what ransom and uh heatherington argued is heathering branson was a leading neuroanatomist of the day he had just come from studying diabetes insipidus and in diabetes insipidus you can also cause it by lesioning a different part of the hypothalamus you have animals that are what see extremely thirsty i forget the technical term of the hyper i i don't recall actually i'm blanking out but anyway endless thursdays they pee a lot yeah so like any die they have endless thirst and they're peeing constantly so the conventional thinking might be the reason they're so peeing so much is because they're so thirsty right yeah and the counter hypothesis is that the thirst is a response there the the lesion causes them to pee constantly they're losing body water that makes them thirsty so which by the way is what that that's become unequivocally the case we now know that diabetes insipidus is the result of the loss of the hormone called uh antidiuretic hormone or ddavp and so the response to replenishing the water that they're losing because they can't concentrate urine exactly so branson thinks well if they're losing if you're losing water and drinking in response maybe in these cases the animal is losing calories energy into its fat tissue and they're eating in response a hyperphagia is a response to the loss of energy and some of his animals the one that got obese are also um uh sedentary so he said maybe the sedentary the ones that got obese without hyperphasia was sedentary he said maybe the reason they're sedentary is because again the losing calories into the fat tissue the fat tissue has been is creating a sort of vacuum and the animal is responding either by eating more or exercising less so changes in energy balance are a response to the fat tissue being driven to accumulate calories or fat calories um they published this paper three months later this 1942 ransom has a heart attack and dies he was eating too much fat clearly hetherington is postdoc is the middle world war ii joins the air force and leaves the research behind and the only voice left in the field is john broback and so broback dismisses their hypothesis not really even understanding it it's clear from the literature he still thinks they're trying to blame obesity on sedentary behavior because he's trapped in this energy balance thinking he doesn't realize that they're trying to blame both the sedentary behavior and the hypophasia on the drive to accumulate fat which is the fundamental different paradigm so brobeck continues to write about hyperphasia causing obesity by the 1950s between brobeck's work and newberg's work the conventional wisdom is all fat people get fat because they eat too much and there are textbooks that have a statement to that effect in virtually those identical words by the 1960s obesity as i said as being the leading figures in the field are psychologists and psychiatrists who are trying to explain why fat people eat too much and how to stop them from eating too much no one's and there's a whole world of physiologists and biochemists studying fat metabolism learning about all the ways it's regulated learning how its deposition and mobilization of fat go on independent of the nutritional state of the organism that's a direct quote from one of the seminal papers and that what you should be studying is not how much people eat and exercise but why they accumulate so much fat what's the best explanation for why a lesion to the vmh which is a very central very very specific narrow part of the brain why would that have such a broad peripheral consequence of fat hoarding within all of the adipose tissue throughout the body what is the mechanistic or best mechanistic explanation for that in that in that model well in my model is first thing that have first observable effect from the bmh lesion is hyperinsulinemia so you lesion the brain and the animal hyper secretes insulin in response to even thinking about food now if you think about it an animal that's hyper secreting insulin isn't going to be able to so the insulin is signaling its fat tissue to take up fat and to store it for food it's in store it for fuel it's inhibiting the process of lipolysis it's also inhibiting the oxidation of fatty acids and muscle tissue through the malonyl-coa pathway so think about what happens now to these rats or people with tumors you have the surgery you hyper secrete insulin you wake up from the surgery without carbohydrate supplies and unable to oxidize dietary fat so that would explain the hunger it's as though you've created a starvation state in the animal instantaneously you know normally it's going to take a while for the animal to get to the point where it has to start cannibalizing its own muscle for fuel but if you're starving it but now you've done it instantaneously with the lesion and that would explain the gasping for food that these animals manifest and the hyperphagia what's the relative increase in insulin that those animals experienced you know i don't have those numbers that's a i don't tend not to look at those kinds of well let me put it this way if i look at them i forget them um but that would but that's that's that's an important thing right i mean if that's the mechanism through which the if that's the conduit through which a central lesion has such a broad peripheral implication i i would expect uh an enormous increase in insulin to produce that a level that wouldn't be otherwise physiologically described i guess i'm struggling with well also if you think about it um until 1960 they had no way to measure insulin in the bloodstream although but we could do it today is what i'm saying yeah i i yeah i just don't know the number i mean it was clearly enormous and it was observed so when and post 1960 you get yellow and burson's radio you know assay so now you could actually measure insulin levels in the in you know from from blood samples um accurately and with sensitivity and pretty quickly afterwards that's when they realized that the bmh lesion animals were hyperinsulinemic the leptin's an interesting i was about to say how did the ob ob mice also give us a clue into what into both ways to interpret the same observation okay so the uh uh yeah so the oboe mouse is a mouse that's discovered at the jackson laboratories in maine and it is a uh has a uh it's a mutant that manifests uh obesity uh dramatic obesity and uh there turns out there's two different depending on what strain you breed these animals into the dbdb mouse is diabetic obese and diabetic the obob mouse is just obese the work is done at the jackson laboratory what's interesting is the assumption is always right that these animals get fat that they're missing some kind of satiety hormone the theories to the 1950s based on newberg's work and this idea that obese people get fat not because they partition fuel preferentially into fat tissue but because they take in more energy than they expend the dominant the only hypotheses of obesity in the 1950s there's a lipostat hypothesis from a guy named kennedy and a glucose stat hypothesis from sean my ear there's a kind of thermostat hypothesis with body heat they're all hypotheses trying to explain eating too much in the animal and none of these pan out none of these not only are they not pan out you've got these animals that get obese if you think they're caused by eating too much again what's the correct control just pair feed the animal don't let the animal eat more than lean animal so this experiment is done numerous times with leptin the obob mice if you take a lean animal measure how much it's eating give half of that to the ob mouse so you're literally semi-starving it it's anyway yeah and the fellow who did one of the fellows who published these results are douglas coleman but anyone who's ever done this experience coleman uh jeff friedman uh gets credit for doing the work that identified leptin as the hormone that's missing in the obob animal or dysfunctional and he did it based on coleman's parabiosis experiments at jackson lab with the obiobian dbdb animals so jeff friedman comes along he's a young ambitious researcher he wants to look for the obesity hormone the satiety hormone that's missing in the ob mice he comes with this assumption that what's missing is a signal from the fat tissue to the brain telling the brain not to eat too much when he discovers leptin he interprets that signal as being the satiety hormone it's been identified as society hormone ever since when people write books with titles like the hungry brain they're assuming that the absence of leptin makes a brain hungry the person gets hungry eats too much and that's why they get fat and yet you always have this observation in the field that the animal gets fat even when it's a half star basically the obob db animals completely confirm the hormonal regulatory disorder fuel partitioning disorder the point is i'm doing this book on diabetes now i was i was curious what is it about the dbdb animal why would a the absence of a leptin receptor as opposed to the absence of this selected signal cause diabetes and i never really thought about it um and so you look into the literature we actually asked rudy libel and rudy said well it's just it's a background dependent it's the same basically it depends what background you breed the animal onto and uh you know on a particular breed you get this diabetic animal then i went back and i found where douglas coleman discussed it and so the issue is both animals are obese both animals are hyperinsulinemic from weaning onward okay so in the dbdb animals the background strain can't sustain the hyperinsulinemia so its pancreas fails and you manifest frank diabetes the ob strain can continue to keep pumping out the necessary insulin but now you've got leptin basically triggering hyperinsulinemia and it's always been known these animals are hyperinsulinemic and now you're back to the hypothesis that insulin you know the bower ransom hypothesis i didn't say by the way that when ransom and heatherington interpreted the data the way they did they cited julius bauer so brobeck cites newberg he's got a preconceived opinion and ransom had his own preconceived opinion based on the diabetes insipidus work and julius bauer's paper supported that but we and then we grew up with one hypothesis which is the brobeck eating too much hypothesis and it influenced how the leptin work was interpreted it's influenced virtually every experiment afterwards and then some body like me comes along and says well wait a minute all this evidence supports the alternative hypothesis and you have not been considering that for 60 70 years how can you even trust anything you've done when you weren't aware that there was a competing hypothesis it's an awkward place to be in now your work has brought a lot of attention to this alternative hypothesis over the past decade and there have been a number of people who have tried to test it how would you reconcile the findings that have have not demonstrated um what one would be what what would be predicted by the carbohydrate insulin model well and this then gets into the kind of questions we talked about earlier about judging the value of the experiments how rigorously they're done and uh the biases and preconceptions of the researchers so and again i've been having these arguments on twitter this week and i have to stay the hell off twitter um a waste of time you know and you know this we funded these people at nusi we funded two groups of researchers one who was inherently basically had a hypothesis uh that dietary fat and fat balance was a driver of obesity and we on one that had a carbohydrate insulin model like we did and the researchers who believe the conventional wisdom uh interpreted their results uh as supporting the conventional wisdom and refuting the carbohydrate insulin model and the researchers who supported believe the carbohydrate linson model interpreted their results as supporting that model so let's pause there for a second because i simply don't see how this field can make any progress and i'm trying to understand how this field can make progress in a way that physics does when as you point out everybody in this field is biased everybody has a point of view and everyone seems to do experiments that simply confirm their point of view um it strikes me as a very difficult and and here's there's one other thing that makes this more difficult which is the inherent messiness of biology right and it's messy for several reasons right it's messy because it's as complicated as physics is i think biology is more complicated we don't have a standard model of biology the way we have a standard model of physics so there are more unknown unknowns in biology and then secondly the experiments are far more difficult to control i think there's more noise in the biologic experiments and then you couple that with everything we just said i just don't understand what a path forward looks like towards a reconciliation well yeah i don't know if reconciliation is the word you're looking for you want to know which hypothesis is right and we're now in effect re-competition i mean a scientific record discussions yeah yeah uh we're recapitulating the discussions we had whatever eight ten years ago now when lucy was starting um the first thing you have to do so i was thinking about this because you know one of my favorite stories is back around 2009 after good calories bad calories came out i was invited to lecture at the pennington biomedical research center which is the largest obesity research center in the country uh academic and i gave my uh this lecture why we get fat uh adiposity 101 and i suggested that the energy balance hypothesis thinking was i like to say not even wrong stealing from wolfgang pauley and then why all the reasons why it should be replaced with this hormonal regulatory disorder focusing on insulin and after my talk one of the faculty raised his hand very politely a gentleman who was probably then as old as i am now maybe 65 and he said excuse me mr tabbs would it be correct to assume that you think we are all idiots because the argument i was making is that they embraced the wrong paradigm and it was a tough question because partially the ants i want to say well that's one way to look at it um i can't say that so what i said to them is i think the problem here is that when you entered the field there was a paradigm a way of thinking about obesity that seemed to so intuitively obvious this idea that it's an energy balance disorder that you never questioned it and certainly your you know your mentors didn't question and so you were assumed this had been well tested and well proven and you know uh unambiguous and that it deserved to be dogma and it hadn't been and it didn't and that's been a problem ever since um now we come along 50 years later 40 years later and we have to get people to a huge proportion of the community to entertain the possibility that their fundamental belief system is wrong so this isn't the subtle shift in thinking this is you're operating under the wrong paradigm you think the earth is flat and it's round or you think the earth rotates the sun rotates around the earth but it's the other way around um 99.9999 thrown as many nines you want percent of the time people say that they're quacks so why are you not uh that's a good question i often argue this with my old friend our old colleague mark friedman and mark says well we're not because we're right and i say well every quack thinks they're right mark that's not evidence that we're not quacks that's the same tautology that you argue against uh yeah well the other argument is an even better one i'm not a doctor so technically i can't be a quack the best i could uh hope for his whack job um i would offer a more compelling reason if you're if you turn out to not be a quack which is the application of the current model is failing um that's probably the most compelling reason to continue to question it i would say right so in other words if we if we believed that the earth was the center of the universe and every time we tried to launch a rocket into space it blew up because we failed to understand gravity and orbits i would hope we would then say god what if the earth is actually moving even though it doesn't feel like it and that's it that's it that's that's where all these discussions start it's where we you know the new see things start look failure to prevent obesity failure to treat obesity the obesity and diabetes epidemics are out of control let us question these fundamental hypotheses how do we test them you know i'm thinking at the moment having done that and moved to the next stage where we now have competing researchers arguing you know one says i'm right the other says i'm right i side with the one who thinks like i do um how do we get people to care how do we move this it's so this issue how do you get to move it outside the diet issue as we discussed over the years there's a lot of uh you know the conventional wisdom comes with a lot of explanations for why people don't lose weight on various dietary interventions and some of those are are true you know people don't comply with interventions they like dude nobody sticks with the diet so maybe everybody's different and so maybe we have to invest huge sums into individual what's buzzword now for individualized nutritional therapy precision nutrition um yeah that's that's the way the nih is going so the idea is well these people arguing it's carbohydrates yeah we don't believe that so we're not going to spend any money researching that we use there are people believing it's fat and there are people who think it's meat um in an ideal world and we discussed this for eight years right the federal government would say we covet is going to pass and obesity and diabetes are going to go back to being the long pole as using nasa terminology there they were costing a billion dollars a year in direct medical costs we have to understand how we failed because we have to stop blaming it on industry and blaming it on the individuals and so let us put together teams of researchers red teams blue teams multiple callers and hash this out and trying to figure out how we failed to control these epidemics and until we do that we're not going to reject any reasonable hypothesis but how would you even populate said teams i mean to your point there really aren't that many people that would still stand by this idea that you propose uh yeah no it's uh i mean if we're gonna get practical here peter um we're not going to make any progress whatsoever uh the uh yeah i you know in my my dreams it's like it's like a uh populating a jury in a trial you pick people unbiased scientists who are good at what they do have demonstrated that they're good at what they do you can't pick obesity researchers because they have biases you certainly can't pick nutritionists because they have biases and they [Music] i question whether any of them are ever taught to think critically enough about scientific reas progress um and you know they treat it like we did i mean think about the kind of effort that went into covet the amount of money that was spent on research to prevent you know this disease from killing what one tenth of the number of people who die from a chronic diseases related to obesity and diabetes every year i mean i'm not i'm glad they did it but you make that kind of effort you can solve this problem step one is saying look we failed the conventional wisdom fails it's clear it fails because we have obesity and diabetes epidemics that haven't been stemmed in any way we have to question our assumptions let's go back and look at we did if the you know who who actually does that job there's a lot of very intelligent critical thinkers out there the question is how do you get them to care now some of them would argue that hey we know the answer and the the palatability of food the availability of food the affordability of food are driving this equation and the convenience of modern life is making inactivity even a greater and greater issue and and so you might argue well look we haven't put all the steps in place to address those issues this answer is going to be one through policy we have to make foods that don't taste as good that aren't you know what i mean like we you know like i'll give you a funny story like my son came home the other day and he said mommy um one of the kids at school today had something for school and i really want it too and she was like okay what is it he's like i don't know it came in a blue bag and it was a triangle and of course it was cool ranch doritos so what does jill go and do she goes and buys cool ranch doritos for reese for lunch for a little snack and you know he's got a this is not a kid who who is a kid who really likes to eat good food and and so every day he gets a little ziploc with like five cool ranch doritos the problem is i can't eat just five cool ranch doritos so the other day i'm inhaling half a bag of cool ranch doritos and all i'm thinking is this is almost as impressive as the apollo 11 program like from an engineering perspective like the way they made this thing the crunch the taste the lingering flavor it's unbelievable like there's no denying how good this stuff is so why did i just sit there and eat a whole bag of that thing you know that's a very good question okay but here's the counter argument i gave a talk a couple months ago in tahoe and it was just as the ability to give talks in person was winding down and the fellow invited me to give the talk is from texas afterwards sent me a gift box of uh wagyu stakes from a butcher in new york and these are the wagyus that cost it's about 170 a pound okay and um like one of them was called wagyu sashimi and the other way and they they it's just it's it's you just looking at it you know it's by weight as much fat as protein and by calories and farm you know it's going to be 80 fat and i actually made one of these for lunch and i looked up how to do it so you get the skillet and you use the fat on the edge to grease the skillet and hot and then it's a minute on each side and it was eight ounces and i couldn't finish it it was so filling my son harry said hey he got a taste he said this is this is beef butter dad um i still finished it okay so it was delicious however even if i could afford it i still have some in the freezer i didn't it wasn't like a dorito issue so yeah it's not quite as accessible but the question would then be is it did i get fatter did i somehow dysregulate my fat tissue by eating that the way you might be doing eating the dorito and then you know we can go back and forth did you uh why is the is it dorito is it the palability that drives your particular hyperphagia or is it the peripheral response to the macronutrient composition that then drives your hyperphagia when it comes to doritos i mean i just think if you look at the response time it has to be more central than peripheral right i mean it's barely exiting my esophagus while i'm in it yeah yeah but but still the response is going to be a response to an expected peripheral change so you know your body is evolution and almost homeostasis are very good at what they do they know what's about to happen so they're going to prepare your body for that to happen um but then we go back to and we've had you know think about your experience when you were 205 pounds and swimming working out three hours a day and eating as healthy as any human being could eat and the question is again why then and what's changed between then and now and that wasn't a dorito-induced effect so are there other you know this idea that some people are just going to get fats are pre-programmed that the quote is from uh george bernard shaw play i forget which one at the moment where the one of the leads says you know some of them is just we're just going to get fat no matter how much we eat so if that's the case what's what triggers that the doritos i would say trigger it whereas the wagyu which is far more calories does not um how do we get people to care how do you get people whether right or wrong there's a lot of people clearly the conventional wisdom is what you just argued we know what causes it it's too much food available it's very easy to blame industry you know michael moss has done written two terrific books that get a lot of publicity because he's blaming industry he's not blaming the scientists he's not blaming the administrators of the government he's blaming the industry nobody has to you know it's very easy when i was blaming the industry people love what i do as soon as i shift to blaming the scientific community for doing unacceptable science then i have trouble fighting you know with getting the message heard um i don't know i don't know what the answer is you know it's something i think about every day and when people are programmed to assume you're wrong how do you get them to accept the possibility that you're not and that somebody has to study this um and i don't know what the answer is i do know it's the challenge i you know said this before during the new sea years it's like you decide you're going to tilt it windmills for life you've got to get used to the fact that the windmills are gonna kick in the ass when you ride by i don't know i think people do care gary i i mean i guess it depends how you define care right people certainly care about obesity i i guess are you really asking the question not how do we get people to care about how do we get people to question i'm asking yeah how do we and by people i mean uh people in a position of authority okay so who are in have the ability to put the necessary funds and effort towards addressing this question i think one of the problems is that the way we fund research in this country for instance is a kind of you know you get together uh study groups of uh mostly like-minded individuals and they give out small these are all the issues we discussed at nusi um they give out small r01 grants of 500 000 a year for five years to do um you know uh what uh kuhn would have called normal science so we have our conventional wisdom our dominant paradigm we're just going to continue to fund whatever research people happen to do to you know create bricks to fit in that paradigm we don't there is no method by which paradigms are questioned and research programs can shift there's an assumption that it could happen naturally that science is self-correcting but it's the the way we fund research in this country doesn't actually allow that to happen uh if there's money to be made then capitalism will kick in and people will take advantage of the opportunities that other people might be missing and that's why you have operations like virta health which is doing very well uh you know advocating uh you know using nutritional ketosis to treat type 2 diabetes and you have other people who have started operations you know like diet doctor to but um there is no mechanism so when i say people i mean like how do i get francis collins to care and the journalist in living in oakland talking on a podcast you know it's just it's so many levels from uh influence and even if you did get him to care could you get the nih to do anything about it to say hey this is uh we're having this conversation the day after there was an article in science by two researchers who we know very well arguing that this carbohydrate insulin mod of obesity is just wrong failed it was interesting we tested it it failed that's what we were talking about when we discussed why not how do i reconcile my beliefs with that um my response was you know okay you leave out this people who tested it that supported the model you're looking at only a small proportion of the evidence here but even if you're right we have a problem you've avoided the elephant in the living room which are the obesity and diabetes epidemics what do we do about it so so that the paper that came out yesterday uh by by john smiekman and kevin hall is is you know relatively short paper but an interesting you know summation of of what would be viewed as a possible refutation of this carbohydrate insulin model i i think of it less as a public health paper i don't see them trying to address obesity and i don't see them offering or proposing to offer a solution to obesity but i think they're really trying to understand a mechanistic thing and i don't know john but i do know kevin and um my view of kevin is this a guy who came in as an outsider so he has at least the benefit of not having some of the the limitations that that others might have who have come up through the field without kind of the historical context and while um maybe kevin doesn't have that historical context just as as as no one would at least he came in i think as a physicist kind of looking at this from from first principles uh which which you could argue could be an advantage to him right yeah and then in fact if you'll recall that's how i was introduced to kevin by mitch lazar at penn because he thought we saw the problem in similar ways which we did back then um and then i introduced him to you because you know he's a smart uh young researcher with yeah without biases at the time um through the course of our interaction with the energy balance consortium i think we you know uh our belief system uh it gets complicated the uh if you recall his uh initial claim to uh fame as a research what got him his position nih as i understand it is the the model that he has of uh metabolism and how that influences body weight the one point i had asked him to you know he had suggested we could use his model to test my beliefs and his model rejected them and i argued well you've rejected them because you're working in an area that your model has no data so why don't we do the experiment to generate that data and before nuci hired him i was arguing to kevin that he could do this experiment with an n of one or two at nih with the metabolic chamber um anyway so that's uh you know as soon as they started interpreting their experiment remember the idea of one of the fundamental uh problems with pathological science is you you sort of establish what you believe based on premature data so you know rather than entertaining multiple hypotheses as possible explaining what you see you kind of collapse down onto one and then you go public with that prematurely and now you're trying to support that hypothesis rather than test that hypothesis so once kevin started to interpret the evidence from the energy balance consortium as supportive of for as a refutation of the carbohydrate insulin model i think it's basically and supportive of his his computer model i think it basically began to create his bias and lock it in then the more conflict he and i had you know which he witnessed the more that uh locked in his bias as it might have locked in mine the other possibility is that he's just right and i'm wrong which you know if we could do more experiments we might find out one of the critiques of that paper was on different types of methodologies that are used to measure energy expenditure which is a very important thing to study and understand when trying to test these hypotheses um you've already alluded to one method which is indirect calorimetry where people sit inside of a medical grade you know sealed hermetically sealed chamber that can at very minute levels measure inhaled carbon dioxide and calculate the consumption of oxygen and the ratio of those things allows us to calculate very precisely the amount of energy consumed an alternative method to doing that is something called doubly labeled water where a person drinks water that has two different types one is heavily labeled oxygen the other deuterium and by collecting urine over a period of days following that ingestion you can also estimate energy expenditure but do so in a free living environment at the outset you alluded to two experiments that were done in parallel the experiment that was done by the group that had the hypothesis that energy balance determines obesity used the more precise of these the calorimetry the group that was that studied this who had the preconceived idea that the carbohydrate insulin model was correct did a longer outpatient study and used this other method one of the critiques of the paper is that the indirect the the method of doubly labeled water is not valid in people who are carbohydrate restricted and that explains the difference in these findings because otherwise they're very difficult to reconcile right right and well and this is the um you know even the first paper the kevin hall's energy balance paper remember they saw signal so they're measuring energy two different ways and this is the way i think of sign maybe you know i think of science differently than kevin does um you measure energy by the chamber indirect calorimetry and by dlw energy expansion remember the reason we're measuring energy expenditure is because the researchers didn't believe in the course of four weeks you could see an effect on fat mass so measuring fat mass directly by dexa wasn't a possibility and i'm still curious because there was also evidence remember back then uh dex is going to be confounded by water loss and so can you ever use dexa reliably for the kind of measurements that are made over say two weeks when you're transitioning somebody from a low fat to a very low carbohydrate diet i don't think so i don't think so either and yet that's been done in the last two papers out of nih so anyway the point is you've got two main ways to measure energy they give you two different results one result is more consistent with the energy balance prediction the other result is on inconsistent with the energy balance and consistent with the carbohydrate insulin model one way to interpret this data is to say we measured energy expenditure two different ways we got two different results are therefore our results were not very robust we tend to trust the chamber but if the chamber were right we would have expected to see the same thing with the dlw and we didn't unless the dlw is wrong and the chamber is the gold standard right which is a possibility but the the first thinking is we get divergent results here we have other issues with the experiment right we non-randomized so let's design a different experiment you know gary it's clear that the the that that there's probably still enough smoke to question whether there's some fire with respect to these unanswered questions do you think this is an answerable question and well i hope so so that's the first thing clearly i keep doing what i'm doing because i'm hoping i can motivate people to think more deeply about this and to [Music] resolve this issue i don't think progress will ever be made meaningful progress will be made on obesity without understanding the fundamental cause and without you know uh elucidating how treatments are working although i have to say these these glp-1 agonists are fascinating as um so there's a public health problem there's a scientific issue um things have changed so in the 20 years that we've done this uh when i started this conventional wisdom was that high low carb high fat diets like you know atkins what we called keto in pre-2010 or so uh that these diets were deadly that they would cause heart disease and uh that they would ultimately make you fatter and uh today for instance the american diabetes association recommends these diets for type 2 diabetes which means one-tenth of the public and you know the public they're everywhere they're viral the world is saturated with books on keto and even this article in science we've been discussing acknowledge that they can be beneficial for weight control and nobody's talking anymore about them causing heart disease in fact they're probably the most studied diet in history and if you go to clinicaltrials.gov you'll find over 200 trials in the works looking at ketogenic diets for everything from uh you know cancer alzheimer's yeah but far beyond that traumatic brain injury i mean you've interviewed a lot of these people so in one sense we've made an enormous amount of progress in liberating the intervention that comes out of this way of thinking such that it can now be used for people and anyone who wants you know who struggles with the weight or blood sugar control can now know that they can try these diets and they're it's not hard to find a physician to help them guide them through it and from the personal perspective we know that they won't kill you which is what we assumed going in 20 years ago and so it would be nice if the research community understood obesity the way i think they should so it's a way of saying it would be nice if i was right about all this but even if i'm dead wrong the ability to use this dietary intervention to improve your health has now become widespread mostly accepted and clearly there are you know teams of researchers all over the world who find the clinical uh efficacy of these diets fascinating so the world is changing it might not be changing as quickly as i would like and it may not change as much as i would like but like i said even the science article the other day there are statements in there that would have been considered completely unacceptable 20 years ago including the acceptance that insulin plays a major role in fat accumulation and so obesity it's just not the role they were arguing it's just not the role that i think it is and david ludwig thinks it is well gary we've been going at this for a while um i think this was uh this was kind of a tour de force of of of science and a history of science in many ways uh um i'm sure folks found your journey interesting especially given that many people will know you from your more recent work and i think many people will not know you from from the foundation of work that that led to your curiosity here i've always found that to be the most interesting part of your personal story by the way is the way that you stumbled into health sciences almost accidentally i've always found it interesting and obviously i think a lot of good has come of it so gary thanks so much for making the time uh especially in
