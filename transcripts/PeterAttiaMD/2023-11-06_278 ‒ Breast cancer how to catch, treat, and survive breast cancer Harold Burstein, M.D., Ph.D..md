[00:00:00] uh breast cancer is now the most common diagnosis of cancer aside from non-melanoma skin cancer it's the most common cancer diagnosis in the world and for almost all countries on Earth I'm sorry I I I didn't know that Hal you're saying it's more common than lung cancer more commonly diagnosed in lung cancer because the outcomes are better there's still more fatalities from lung cancer but um it's the most common diagnosis of cancer in women on almost every country on Earth uh there are still some places in subsaharan Africa where either cervical or other gynecologic tumors outpace uh breast cancer um but almost everywhere else it's the number one cause diagnosis of cancer in women and in total it's the largest cancer diagnosis hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:00:52] AA hey how thank you so much for joining uh joining me today uh this is a topic I've been really wanting to do a dive on for for quite some time um we've we've done a deep dive on prostate cancer a couple of times and so we're I think we're long overdue to talk about uh the second leading cause of cancer death for women which is of course breast cancer um but maybe just briefly give give listeners a little bit of a sense of your of your background the post you sit in and uh and um the work you do well first uh thanks for being here I want to learn how to live longer so I'm

[00:01:28] I'm hoping that we'll have a two-way conver ation here um and um uh it's great to be able to speak with you and and your audience um I'm a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a medical oncologist here at Dana Farber Cancer Institute where I specialize in breast cancer um I trained in um medical school as an mdphd student and I got a

[00:01:50] PhD in Immunology uh following that I was a house officer studying internal medicine at Mass General and came over to Dana Farber to do medical oncology where I've been uh for the rest of my career and um in my day-to-day work I see a lot of patients who run a very active and busy Clinic here at Dana

[00:02:07] Farber uh I'm involved in a lot of teaching at the medical school and for our fellows and uh I do a lot of both clinical research and clinical education including guidelines work with ASCO the nccn the St gallon Pathways and other uh International and National groups interested in Breast Cancer Care great well let's um let's just give people a little bit of a sense of the the magnitude of of breast cancer um what is a woman's lifetime incidence of breast cancer so the famous statistic is that uh American women have about a 1 in8 lifetime risk or 12% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and what what fraction of those cases will be fatal the good news is that only a small fraction of those will be fatal um the fatality or the mortality associated with breast cancer depends on the stage at which it is caught and it also depends on the subtype of breast cancer because we have different treatment programs for each of the different treatment uh for each of the different subtypes of breast cancer so if you look very broadly across the board um there are roughly 275,000 cases of breast cancer in the

[00:03:18] United States every year and there are roughly 38,000 deaths so if you assume a steady state we are curing 80 to 85% of women with breast cancer uh but roughly 15 to 18% um are still at Jeopardy for recurrence and death from the disease I'd like to start kind of at the beginning with a little bit of the anatomy uh you know I think one of the challenges of course of diagnosing breast cancer is that you don't get to look directly at the place where the tumor arises the way you do for example with colon cancer or skin cancer or cervical cancer for that matter so I think it it it probably behooves us to to spend some time explaining everything from the embryology to the uh prepubescent

[00:04:05] Anatomy to the maturation process of the breast and then perhaps even what happens uh during menopause so so so how would you describe the changes the development and changes of a breast during a woman's life and uh with with a special with a specific nod to how this will factor into helping us understand the pathology of breast cancer development during some of those stages well uh the breast uh is a gland um it is fundamentally a sweat gland if you look at the you know pure embryology of it and it is the defining feature of what it is to be a mammal and as you alluded to the breast goes through uh different stages of maturation and development in the life of a woman and um it begins as um sort of a quiescent area of tissue and then during puberty uh because of the hormonal changes uh develops um in enement and maturation of the glands such that they become able to eventually secrete milk if the if the woman becomes pregnant um and the breast is largely composed of two types of of tissue the majority of the volume is actually just fat and non-specific stromal elements and the thing that determines the size of the breast in a woman is just really how much non- glandular tissue there is um all women more or less have the same amount of glandular tissue in the breast the milk generating component of the breast if you will and those uh ducts radiate from the various breast tissues into the nipple uh which has multiple orifices and the god-given purpose here of course is to to nurse the child um and um breast cancers largely arise from the ductal or the glandular tissue and in this respect breast cancer shares its

[00:05:56] Origins with almost all common cancers prostate at cancer colon cancer lung cancer where it is the glandular part of the organ from which arises the maligant cell um one of the interesting things about um breast cancer and um normal breast development is that there has been over the past decades a rise in the incidence of breast cancer the rate of breast cancer and one of the likely contributors relates to both the early uh puberty that we are now seeing in women um girls are starting to menstruate at a far younger age um in the 2020s than they were a hundred years ago or certainly 150 years ago owing probably to better nutrition uh and better General Health and that u means that the breast development and the exposure of the breast to estrogens starts earlier and women are also menstrating for longer again largely owing to uh Better Health um and women are having at the population level in the developed countries at least fewer children and they tend to nurse those children for a shorter duration of time again this rarely describes an individual patient but at the population level the rates of breast cancer are highest in the most developed societies and many people think it relates to these issues of childhood nutrition uh pubescent uh nutrition number of pregnancies uh duration of Nursing and that accounts for a lot of the difference in the incidence rates that we see between say the United States and and other parts of the world um interestingly as people um shift societies CU they move or as other societies become more developed their rates of breast cancer tend to go up to mirror those of of the US or Western

[00:07:42] European populations yeah I I remember one of the discussions we had in sort of first year medical school you know this is coming up on 30 years ago um was the the study of Japanese women who moved to the United States and within uh a generation went from very very low rates of breast cancer to assuming the same rate the same high rate of breast cancer as American women now of course I think at least for me the takeaway of that was you know we could never know what the causitive driver was given that there were so many things that are happening um but clearly there's an environmental component to this right whether it's some combination of food exercise hormones um stress levels pollution I mean you you you I don't know what the answer would be of course but you you you would have a very long list of things that could change that could amount for such a dramatic shift as opposed to saying for example there's genetic differences that are accounting for this um and we're we're obviously going to talk at length about the genetic drivers of this but uh but that wouldn't explain the one generation shift of course well that's right and you know back to the 19th century one of the first cancer epidemiological findings was that nuns who never became pregnant were at greater risk for develop Ving breast cancer and along with the discovery of um uh scrotal cancers in chimney sweeps it was one of the first real steps forward in the epidemiology of cancer biology to help people begin to get a sense of of what was causing cancer and so I think you make a good point that the uh environment by by which I don't specifically mean like the atmosphere or the pollutants or all those kinds of things but the the environment in which a person grows up is is going to have an impact on their breast cancer risk now the dilemma here here is that for any given individual we almost never have a good sense of what their intrinsic risk of breast cancer is aside from and I'm sure we'll get to this the family history and genetic cancers um and why they get breast cancer now and why they got it in one breast and not the other breast and all those things remain very mysterious and um for someone who takes care of breast cancer patients it's a source of real frustration there are some tumors where we really think we understand why they're a great risk you know the smoking and lung cancer story or other things people sort of say well you know I I at least you can imagine how this arose whereas breast cancer is often a disease of very healthy women uh women who have gone to Great Lengths to care for themselves and despite that they are encountering uh breast cancer diagnosis which is is often frustrating do you recall I I wasn't actually aware of the epidemiologic studies in the uh early parts of the um uh 20th century that that identified nuns as higher risk

[00:10:30] I I'm very familiar with the work on scrotal cancer and chimney sweeps the hazard ratios there were alarmingly high I mean they were you know Hazard ratios of four and five six I mean these were there was it was very easy to make the causal link do you know how high the hazard ratios were for nuns versus non- nuns to be honest I'm not sure they even articulated as um Hazard ratios back in the day and just to be clear for your audience I wasn't there when these studies were being done um but um you know it was seen that you know these nuns were were at a greater risk of developing breast cancer and then this again we're talking about a time that predates radiology and so um you know one of the reasons you could do epidemiology on scrotal tumors or breast tumors is because you could see the cancer and in fact breast cancer was known to the

[00:11:16] Ancients uh it is described in uh Hippocratic type writings and um uh other sort of uh documents from Antiquity and it was the one cancer that would commonly be visually seen people undoubtedly had other kinds of cancers in the era but in a time before you had Imaging um there were rather few that you would actually visually encounter so uh breast cancer is a very ancient disease in that respect and it was one of these things that people appreciated that uh for whatever reason nuns were uh at greater risk and so nowadays we would say it's because of um the fact that they uh were not pregnant and we're not nursing and all those kinds of things which clearly change uh the risk the the interaction between pregnancy and breast cancer risk is both very interesting and complicated so multiple pregnancies lower the risk of breast cancer one pregnancy transiently increases the risk and then it comes down as time goes by and no pregnancies are associated with a slightly higher risk of developing uh breast cancer um and that's not related to the uh invitro fertilization or other hormonal supplements they've looked at that with a lot of rigor in the particularly the Scandinavian databases where they have outstanding Public

[00:12:28] Health registries of all the patients in the Scandinavian countries and it's so infertility for instance is a slight risk for breast cancer but um the treatments for infertility per se are not um now the other thing and I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves but the other thing to say is when we talk about increased risk there's a huge difference between a population increased risk and the risk for a given patient so at the outset we said one in eight lifetime risk in the United States that's 12 133% a woman who has um early onset of menarchy menstration or hormone replacement therapy such that they have longer estrogen exposure or shorter period of nursing or shorter uh fewer pregnancies they might have a 25 or 30% greater risk of breast cancer but that only moves the needle from around 12% to around 15% so you know the risk at the population level is Big the risk for an individual is still pretty small for these kinds of factors and do we have a sense of the difference between things that drive the increase in Risk versus things that drive an increase in mortality so for example in prostate cancer uh it's generally well understood that the prevalence of prostate cancer approximates the decade of life of the male so a guy in his 50 you know basically half of men in their 50s have some prostate cancer you know glein 3 plus three this is not a prostate cancer you would take out but on autopsy you would find it um and this goes on right by the time a guy is in his 70s you might expect that 70 there's a 70% chance he has prostate cancer and of course the challenge then of the urologist is understanding which man is going to die from versus with prostate cancer a moment ago you gave the example of hormone replacement therapy and of course that's a topic we've covered in such alarming detail here that it needs no further rehashing but the the punchline is while the Women's Health

[00:14:22] Initiative demonstrated that women taking conjugated equin estrogen plus MPA had a 25% increase in the risk of breast cancer um it did it never translated to an increase in mortality um and similarly the women who took conjugated equin estrogen alone saw 24% decrease in uh in breast cancer so um my point there being um do we have a sense of which risk factors are driving mortality versus just incidents no and yes uh so they again population level the uh this gets us into the subsets of the different cancers that we speak about so there are really three major flavors of breast cancer there is estrogen receptor positive so-called her2 or hr2 negative breast cancers and those are the most prevalent kinds of breast cancer um they account for 70 to 75% if not more of all breast cancers they are the tumors most likely to be found on screening mamography as opposed to presenting with a lump in the breast they tend to have ounce f size for size the most favorable prognosis in most but not all instances and um they peak in incidents at around age 65 in the United States so that is the sort of Public Health face of a lot of breast cancer but there are other types of breast cancer as well presumably which have some different epidemiologic risk factors and those include what's called triple negative breast cancer which is lacking estrogen receptor progesterone receptor and her two hence triple negative um those tumors have an earlier onset uh are more common in younger women uh are more common to the population level in

[00:16:08] African-American women are less likely to be the kind detected on a screening mamogram as opposed to a clinical finding and um are a riskier flavor of breast cancer and similarly herto positive breast cancers which were um tumors that have an amplification of the herun New enco Gen and account for about 10 to 15% % of all breast cancers those tumors were classically described in younger women and uh again there's the the epidemiology of herto positive breast cancer as opposed to ER positive breast cancer is not really well described so in general older women are more likely to have better prognosis breast cancer a diagnosis because of the subset that arises in them and younger women uh tend to have more aggressive flavors of breast cancer again in in

[00:16:55] Broad Strokes um Hal I want to go over that again because I think that's just a fantastic overview of basically the three subtypes I also want to point out that you did not talk about uh progesterone receptor except in the negative when you talked about the triple negative case let's go back case one is I'm assuming it's ER positive PR agnostic her two new her two negative correct that's correct though the vast vast majority of those tumors also

[00:17:19] Express progesterone receptor got it um you made the case again these are the ones that are showing up more likely on mamography they're also showing up in older women median age I think said about 65 reasonably across the whole age Spectrum but the peak is 65 and um that's correct yep obviously we're going to dive into the therapeutic options prognosis exam Etc you then talked about triple negative though you didn't give a uh the distribution or a number on that

[00:17:45] I'm just doing the math in my head that seems to be about 10 to 15% of the population correct yep okay so 10 to 15% are triple negative again that's ER negative PR negative her two new negative these skew younger these skew more they skew younger they again you can see them anywhere uh I see 80-year-olds who have triple negative breast cancer but um they tend to skew younger um there is an interesting relationship between race and triple negative breast cancer and there's been a lot of really excellent studies to suggest that there may be some um real uh uh demographic genetic differences that predispose we tend to see triple negative breast cancers also in brca1 mutation carrier so there's a clear link between specific specific genetic syndromes and um brca um such as brca and triple negative disease um but they also tend to be more virulent so they're more likely to present as a lump in the breast or a physical exam finding as opposed to readily being identified on a screening mamogram you mentioned a higher prevalence in African-American where do Asian women fit into this did they skew to any more any any more than others they they don't have any enrichment in general over the normal distribution or not the normal the last one you talked about was all the her two new positives which includes your triple positives and frankly agnostic of erpr but her two new positive correct and that's collectively about 15% of all breast cancer split half and half between those that are ER positive her two positive and E are negative and her two positive so again that includes all of your triple positives um and and is the distinction there a biologic One Hal or are you making that distinction more because of herceptin I guess I should just clarify for The Listener because that because there's a targeted therapy for the herun new receptor positive cancer yeah so you you you're exactly right so trusum Abra herceptin is the target of therapy and that has been sort of the Revolutionary treatment in the uh management of her two positive tumors um so there is a both a biological difference there is a specific region of the chromosome 17 that's Amplified giving overexpression of the heru new enogen that's presumably a driver for a fraction of these breast cancers um but it's also important because it allows us to bring a specific targeted therapy to play let's talk a little bit about what happens to a breast during or or postmenopause I mean obviously we we understand some things that are happening during menopause right so estrogen progesterone levels are falling dramatically presumably there are anatomical changes occurring in the breast as the breast no longer needs to maintain the infrastructure for lactation um anything worth talking about there specifically as it pertains to increasing risk only uh indirectly um so estrogenization of the breast does account for breast density which is something that is often seen on a mamogram and there is a relationship between more breast density and a slightly greater risk of developing breast cancer presumably that relates somehow to the woman's lifetime exposure to estrogen and so postmenopausal women who have more dense breast tissue on mamogram are at slightly greater risk of developing breast cancer and it's not simply that the density makes it harder to see the breast cancer um so um there's a sorry sorry just just to interject how to make sure I understand is estrogen controlling ductal density or is it it's more about the the soft tissue component of the breast the the ductal issues the actual fatty tissue yeah I mean the ductal there in a premenopausal woman obviously with the monthly cyclical variation the breast will have changes in both the ductal tissue and the other tissues and I want to be clear if anybody listening to this is an embryologist or a breast surgeon they're rolling their eyes here because I'm not going to get all the details correct but in Broad terms um there is monthly change in the breast architecture and tissue but for postmenopausal women on the screening mamogram that density reflects um the fibros the fibrous tissue the fatty tissue in the breast not specifically the glandular tissue okay and then just kind of bringing it back to a point full circle you mentioned at the outset that regardless of the size of a woman's breast so if you compare a woman with an A cup to a dcup the glandular tissue is still relatively consistent I actually took that to mean the risk of breast cancer by breast size was also relatively similar given that they're dealing with the same amount of glandular tissue is that a is that an incorrect assumption no that's a correct assumption um there is uh you know breast size at the extremes tends to correlate with um obesity there is a really there's a a weak but detectable link between obesity and breast cancer risk so perhaps a slight slight increase risk in in but that's confounded to your point but um you know we don't fundamentally think that um breast size affects risk okay but density per se does and not just from a detection standpoint density is a marker that is associated with a slightly increased risk again but all of these you know again we're talking about moving to a one in or six lifetime risk so it's it's the kind of thing that from the public health point of view is very important for any given woman rarely is a huge driver and I I just point that out to draw a distinction between a genetic syndrome or specific behaviors like smoking that we know are clearly a dominant risk factor for many different kinds of tumors and and and things like that let's talk a little bit about some of those other modifiable risk factors then so we we we know that I guess the who would say that the top two environmental uh triggers for cancer are in order smoking and obesity um now I've always thought that obesity is just a proxy for insulin resistance and that it's really the hyperinsulinemia the excess growth factors and the inflammation that track with obesity rather than the adiposity per se that is driving that risk um how much do those two factors smoking and call it obesity and right up to type two diabetes how much are those moving the needle at the individual level for risk so smoking really is not a major risk factor for breast cancer okay um and um it's because of in in my shorthand you know it's simply a matter of you know the smoke affects the aerodigestive tract and some of the internal organs like the kidneys that end up filtering out some of the carcinogens and stuff but it's really not part of the the breast story if you will um obesity as we mentioned is a relatively weak risk factor um relative to many others and certainly not one that has allowed us to say for instance stratify patients for high-risk screening versus not or offer reassurance to a woman that she is not um uh at Jeopardy for breast cancer because of uh lean body mass or or things like that got it okay so let's let's talk a little bit about um the types of lumps that can show up in a breast and let's let's start at the benign end of the spectrum so um how often will a woman either doing a correct self-exam and by the way i' I'm so far from this myself in my current uh practice that I don't know if it's still in Vogue or not in Vogue to teach women how to do a self- exam of the breast but maybe you could clarify that for me but if a woman is doing a self- exam of the breast uh and then if she's also getting an exam from say someone like yourself who knows what they're doing um what's the probability that a woman in in her lifetime is going to feel a lump and then what fraction of those lumps turn out to be benign well um most women have uh variations in the texture of the breast and so almost all women have uh breast tissue or other things that one can feel and they can appreciate that vary and in younger women these may change with the monthly cycle and and postmenopausal women they may represent you know just residual breast tissue if you lose weight you might feel some of that um architectural tissue more readily than other times and so there's a lot of um normal um lumpiness if you will to the breast and in our um uh advice to patients I think it's worth that they have an awareness of their body and a general sense of what feels sort of like normal to them and what feels different from normal to them um it's been pretty hard to show that a regular monthly breast self- exam or um a u a rigid approach to self- palpation um adds that much um there have been some studies that in China where they literally had tens of thousands of patients who were taught how to do a breast exam versus not it it really didn't change the mortality from breast cancer but what does change the mortality is a real awareness of the body and of the breast and our message to women is if you feel something different suspicious concerning seek evaluation because nowadays we can usually get people Imaging studies whether it's mamography or ultrasound combined with an exam by a breast surgeon or a breast expert and usually um uh do a quick evaluation that most of the time you know reassures the patient that this is a benign finding in the breast itself some patients may need further evaluation either with follow-up

[00:27:25] Imaging or even with some kind of a needle biopsy um but the majority of these findings are not going to be breast cancer again having said that the most important thing is if a patient does appreciate a change in the breast or a lump in the breast certainly if a physician or uh other clinician provider feels something suspicious it is very important to get appropriate Imaging and if necessary a tissue biopsy to um uh to make sure we understand exactly what's going on now if a woman ends up having a l and the lump is suspicious enough that it requires you know more than just reassurance that it's nothing uh the next step is going to be what so so so if a woman has a mammogram that shows a lump that is suspicious with or without calcification uh what what is the what is the algorithm for evaluating that lump and when does it go down the path of more imaging versus a needle biopsy uh versus an excisional biopsy yeah so um again the the key takeaway is if people feel a lump they should seek medical evaluation yeah um for patients who have findings either on physical exam or on Imaging um the

[00:28:39] Imaging team the quality of radiology uh has become uh really terrific at most places around the country and they can often look at findings and say yeah you know this looks like a benign um change or yeah this same thing was seen a year ago and 5 years ago when the patient had a mamogram and it hasn't evolved in any way so reassuring or they can say h um

[00:29:02] I'd like to get more imaging so sometimes patients are referred for additional ultrasound or MRI imaging to be sure and sometimes it's necessary to get a tissue biopsy to really understand what exactly is going on and nowadays that usually begins with an image-guided uh needle biopsy or core needle biopsy where um using an ultrasound or other

[00:29:25] Imaging device um the radio ology team knows exactly sort of where to pinpoint the lesion within the breast they use a very um fine gauge needle um to extract a tissue biopsy that's around the width of a pencil lead uh and um with that they can look under the microscope and usually make a clean diagnosis about what's going on within the breast itself so do you have a sense of the number of if we go to the point where we're actually getting a biopsy what fraction of those turn out to be a benign lesion such as a fibro quoma that's a great question and I don't have an immediate answer I I will follow up with you uh and try and get you the answer but I would guess that the majority of these do um and um for um uh for most women it it turns out to be very reassuring that either it is a benign lesion like a fibro adoma or a pre or even a pre precancerous change in the breast that might warrant additional followup or surveillance uh but is not truly breast cancer got it which would be the analog of finding a pop in the colon which gets removed which puts you on alert for more screening but of course is not cancer itself that's correct and in fact um we may uh get to the point of talking about ductal carcinoma in citu or dcis which um is a precancerous lesion where the cells are beginning to accumulate within the duct but have not penetrated into the rest of the breast tissue and the analogy I give to patients all the time is this is like a colon poop it's a growth it is a precancerous growth we treat it so that it doesn't blossom into a full-blown cancer but in and of itself it is not a cancer lesion well that's a that's a great pivot to that because I I do want to talk about dcis and lcis so um maybe first explain it going back to the anatomy the difference between ducts and lobules and then how does that factor into duct carcinoma andu versus lobular carcinoma andu yeah so the um the ductal tissue of the breast um includes um sort of a a highway if you will where the milk would sort of come out of the breast and then at the end of it a parking lot if you will where the sort of the lobule of the the terminal lobule where the gland terminates and the milk would be generated if you will and again my breast cancer surgeon friends are rolling their eyes but that gives you a flavor of what we're talking about we and we'll we'll include in the show notes a great figure of this because this is this is one of those things where yeah figures figures are tend to be easier to follow I think sometimes than the words here but um the the relationship between lobular carcinoma uh or lob carcinom and citu and ductal carcinoma or ductal carcinom and citu really don't exactly correlate to the architecture of the the normal gland itself it's really how the cells look sort of under the microscope if you will and um you can see um changes in these cells that are staged along the way towards cancer so one of the things that is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer is if there are prior changes in the breast that suggest abnormal amounts of proliferation or atypical appearing cells which are sort of the pre precancerous stages so often times a woman might have a a biopsy that shows

[00:32:57] What's called called atypical hyperplasia there are too many cells present that's the hyperplasia and those cells don't look exactly normal they they the nucleus begins to look a little more aggressive and things and if you're familiar with talking about glein scores you know the the glein score is beginning to drift up there and ADH atypical ductal hyperplasia or alh atypical lobular hyperplasia are lesions that put a woman at slightly greater risk for developing breast cancer in the decades to follow the numeric risk is still pretty small probably only about um uh a half to 1% per year risk of developing breast cancer and followup but it's one of those precursor lesions that begins to flag a patient as being at greater risk for developing breast cancer and then the next step along the way would be incit carcinoma uh so the these are cells that have taken one more step towards looking like cancer and if you were to look under the microscope you know the cell itself looks like it's almost a cancer cell but it is respecting some of the normal membranes of the breast gland it's not penetrating into the breast tissue it hasn't gone through whatever the final steps of full-blown carcinogenesis are such that that cell can now persist Thrive outside of that gland and and begin to develop its own blood supply or even metastasize somewhere else in the body which is how we think of of breast cancer so um you will encounter those lesions along the way many women have been diagnosed with these precursor lesions particularly um alh ADH um they can show up as architectural changes in a mammogram they can show up as calcifications in a mamogram it's rare to find that you actually feel these things though sometimes it's an incidental finding if you're evaluating a lump in the breast um and those are things that warrant you know regular surveillance and in some instances we can actually now use anti-estrogen medicines like tamoxifen to help slow the development of any malignance in a patient with those problems do we have a sense of how often those things exist um for example um we we know from autopsy studies as I said the prevalence of low-grade prostate cancer that is not causing any other issue do we have similar autopsy studies in women where we're looking at women who have died from some other cause and examining breast tissue and looking for the prevalence of all of these Associated changes up and dcis and lcis yeah that's a really interesting question and I don't have a good answer for you it's certainly a common enough problem um that it wouldn't surprise me if someone's done a study of this and reported on it uh the distinction I would draw is you know those classic autopsy studies of of men uh I believe they were from automobile accidents back when I used to read these papers um uh finding that they had prostate cancer we're still talking about something a little different in in the breast so these are precancerous changes they're not uncommon um many of them will never move further um and that's different from breast cancer where the tumor can be indolent it can grow slowly but we're not so sanguin that these are tumors that would sort of never require treatment or never be a clinical problem for a patient does every breast cancer start as a uh ductal C caroma or lobular carcinoma inside you many do particularly hormone receptor positive breast cancers uh triple negative breast cancers which probably have something of a different cell of origin within the duct Channel a little less of the glandular component and a little more of the sort of architectural stromal element uh of the gland um you will often encounter triple negative tumors that do not have dcis um associated with it but probably the vast majority of hormone receptor ER positive breast cancers you know emerge from these multi-stage um evolution of these pre-cancerous lesions so is the majority of dcis then captured through screening mamography and or other forms of screening in higher risk women where you're using more than mamography such as ultrasound or MRI that's right so um you know again 70 years ago um dcis would present as a lump in the breast uh because the cells would just kind of keep accumulating within the duct or page disease of the breast where the cells would literally creep out of the nipple and sort of form a what looked like a crust on the surface of the nipple or the breast um which was again the the sort of the growth of these precancerous cells um but in modern practice those still exist but they're really rare um the vast majority of the time dcis is identified following a mamogram because of calcifications or other subtle changes that appear on the mamogram so how is dcis stay is there there there isn't there actually an invasive dcis which would be kind of the the the closest thing to an actual cancer am I making that up or misremembering that well dcis by definition lacks an invasive component so dcis is stage zero breast cancer or as I like your nomenclature earlier I call it a colon poop of breast cancer it really is a a benign growth um that we want to treat so that it does not become uh an invasive cancer the the difference between the colon po up if people can sort of picture the little mushroom growing sort of in the Lumen of the colon and the dcis is that the dcis cells are not sort of as uh mushroom forming if you will and they can creep and crawl through the ductal space um so you can end up with a more diffuse distribution of the dcis Cs in the breast than you might encounter from an isolated colon pop so once dcis is identified and assuming it's done through a core biopsy what are the next steps yeah so um so this is actually a really interesting area of research so I'm going to start by just saying what we typically do for most cases and then we can talk about some of the areas of controversy so for most women who have dcis diagnosed on a core biopsy because there were calcifications or other changes in the breast the first step is to do an excisional biopsy a surgical biopsy where the area of tissue is surgically removed and we do that for uh two reasons one is we want to remove the affected ption of the breast to remove the area of the breast that has dcis and secondly because there is some upstaging that happens so about 15 to 20% of the time when a woman has the surgical uh excision of an area of dcis there will actually be a small component of invasive breast cancer adjacent to that space or nearby that's removed as well which upstages the diagnosis from stage zero or dcis to um an early stage breast cancer and it's important to know that and to to remove that affected portion of the breast so that's almost always the first step in treatment what happens next depends on quick interjection Hal in that case there do you also do a sentinel node biopsy if you discover that and we'll I know we'll come back to that and talk about it in detail but I just want to ask the question before I forget yeah so it's a great question so the sensal node biopsy we do routinely in invasive breast cancer because we want to find out if the cancer is spread to the axillary the arm pit lymph nodes um and we can uh by we here I mean again my surgeon friends who are still rolling their eyes as we're talking uh here um but um they can inject a radioactive tracer and blue dye into the breast tumor they track that into the armpit it allows them to identify the so-called

[00:40:44] Sentinel lymph node or lymph nodes which are hot from the radioactivity and blue from the contrast eye and you can find out by removing a couple of those nodes whether the cancer has spread to the armpit which is is really important staging information and that's going to be done that's going to be done in that in those in those 15 to 20% of women who are getting upstaged you're going to get a wet readed in the operating room you you know you might but usually not so usually if um if if you're just having that lumpectomy where the portion of the breast is being removed and it's not known to have invasive cancer ahead of time um if there is a finding of invasive cancer then the patient would need to go back for a a second operation to do the sensal lymph nose so the exception to this is sometimes there's a lot of DCI in the breast or for whatever reason U the patient has chosen to have a mastectomy for dcis so this is necessitated sometimes by the extent of the affected area relative to the size of the breast some women will have diffus changes in the breast that require a mastectomy others might have a personal preference for it and if the whole breast is being removed for dcis then they will also do sentin a lymph node mapping of the lymph nodes in the armpit because once you remove the breast you can't go back post Hawk and do the Sentinal node mapping if there is an occult area of cancer found within that area of dcis and I'm guessing though after they've had the excisional biopsy of the dcis you get the pathology back a week later and it says you know in fact there is some invasive component here do you you still have a compromised Sentinel node biopsy at that time I assume because you've actually taken the tumor out right for for reasons I mean you know the presumably The Sentinel node is doing its thing and it's still very feasible to do sentinel node mapping um after a an initial lumpectomy but you don't have a tumor to inject into well they know where the tumor bed was you don't have to inject the tumor itself um you're tracking the lymphatic channels of that portion of the breast so you can use area um all right so the other 80 to 85% of women will emerge from surgery they'll be told good news there was no invasive cancer there uh so this was neither diffuse dcis nor invasive cancer um what is the standard of here today for dcis so following dcis removal assuming the breast if if you've had a mastectomy usually that's all you need and there is no further treatment for dcis um for women who have had a lumpectomy um then there are a couple of options that they can think about one is to um do radiation therapy so one of the interesting things about dcis as we noted earlier is the cells tend to creep along the ductal channels and these all sort of arborize out um throughout the breast space and the cells can kind of sneak around in there so radiation therapy has been shown in many many studies to lower the risk of in breast recurrence including both more dcis and including the development of invasive breast cancer so for younger um healthy women 65 70 and younger who have dcis it's pretty standard to give a course of radiation therapy to the breast to lower the risk of recurrence of dcis within the breast itself um and then there's another option of adding an anti-estrogen therapy so medicines like tamoxifen or aromatase Inhibitors both of which work by depriving the tumor area of estrogen um uh can also lower the risk of in breast recurrence of dcis or lower the risk of developing invasive cancer after dcis the um downside to those treatments is usually recommend many years of therapy they have a lot of side effects that um uh are manageable for most women but when you're talking about a dcis leion which isn't a full-blown cancer um a lot of women wouldn't be sufficiently interested in the couple of percentage points reduction and the risk of recurrence or more dcis for having to take a medicine for for many many years that has side effects related to its anti-estrogen effects so typical would be lumpectomy strong consideration of radiation therapy and then above and beyond that discussing whether or not to offer anti-estrogen treatments and most women do very very well when when you get the pathology back you're also getting the receptor status back on the dcis they will test it for estrogen receptor and as with invasive cancer the vast majority of dcis lesions are estrogen receptor positive because it's the precursor lesion for most breast cancers and is is there's no herto new uh status on a dcis or there is there it can be tested but we don't usually do so because clinically it's not actionable we would don't offer we give correct I got it that's right so let's talk about risk reduction so um if you took all women who had dcis who underwent a lumpectomy um and were found to only have dcis had no invasive cancer and you did nothing yeah how many of those women will go on to get invasive breast cancer so um uh with breast cancer so the thing you want to know is what does the dcis look like under the microscope because one of the really important prognostic markers for both dcis and for invasive breast cancer is what we call grade so higher grade or grade three dcis lesions often associated with what's called necrosis which just means the cells are kind of dying in the um ductal space because they're sort of outstripping the oxygen supply there's no blood vessels that feed dcis um those lesions have a slightly greater risk of in breast recurrence than would lower grade typically more estrogen receptor positive um less Chino necrosis type lesions and so the span ranges from you know 5 to 10% at the low risk end to 20 25% at the higher risk end without you know further treatment um with treatment with radiation therapy um you bring way down the risk of recurrence of dcis or of new breast cancer for both those kinds of lesions um such that it's into the usually into the low single digits nowadays does that reduce mortality also or just recur no so the interesting thing about dcis is it's never treating dcis has actually never been shown to affect mortality because you're so far ahead of the diagnosis uh that um there probably isn't a survival benefit and this is what's led to some really interesting trials looking at if we can do less for dcis so uh Shelley

[00:47:23] Wong who's a very distinguished breast surgeon down at Duke has really been a force in the development of these trials where they are doing more or less what you proposed which is what if you just took it out and followed it uh and see what happens and in in some um instances they're even they're not even doing that excisional biopsy they're doing a core biopsy and saying oh it's just dcis we're just going to follow you so that's interesting though because then they're willing to miss the 10 to 15% of women that have invasive cancer correct and so one of the things that's an ongoing study in the uh NCI Le Cooperative groups and one of the things be really interesting is to see is that that really adequate the other thing that comes into play here is one's perception of risk because um for some women having a 10 to 15% risk over the next decade of having a recurrence or a breast cancer in the breast is a very low risk 85 90% chance they would be fine they're not eager to have more surgery or to have radiation therapy and so they're comfortable with that other women will look at the same number and say gosh I don't really want to deal with this if you're telling me that 3 to four weeks of radiation can lower my risk down to 1 to 2% chance of having a problem I'm willing to sign up and and do the radiation treatment so these become very uh nuanced discussions that have to reflect both the magnitude of the risk as we've been discussing the possible benefit in and the patient preferences become real important here how well are radiation oncologists able to Shield the heart for example do you do you find women making a different decision if this is left side versus right side dcis um or is the amount of radiation that's delivered in this for for dcis so low compared to say invasive breast cancer that it's a non-issue so the radiation treatments are fundamentally the same for invasive cancer and for dcis in fact one of the things that's been persistently um uh a confounding part of the discussion about dcis is the treatments for dcis look almost identical to the treatments for invasive breast cancer so if it's a lumpectomy it's the same kind of surgery you're looking for negative margins you're talking about radiation therapy afterwards it's all very similar to if you were being treated for an early stage invasive breast cancer um so the issue of left and right what you're alluding to is the historic experience which is that radiation therapy to left-sided breast cancers in the past important point was associated with a greater risk of coronary artery disease and that is because in the early days of breast radiation they would um radiate the breast sort of straight on if you will as though an arrow was like someone was standing in front of you shooting an arrow right at your heart and that's where the beam of radiation was going nowadays and for the past 18 to 20 years or more actually 30 years almost now we don't do that and by we I mean my radiation oncology friends and colleagues what they do is called tangential field radiation for most things where they very carefully map out the anatomy of the chest and the breast and they use the radiation coming in from the sides in what if you were drawing a circle sort of tangent lines to the circle to irradiate the breast tissue while sparing the underlying chest wall lung and particularly heart so while any patient who gets breast radiation will be counseled as part of the um um a decision-making process that there is a risk of accelerated coronary disease in modern contemporary practice that risk is incredibly low and not just do they set up the fields differently but now there are a lot of other tricks including specific blocks that radiation doctors can use and what's called a breath holding technique where they synchronize the radiation treatment to holding the breath so if you exhale the chest collapses down and the breast I'm sorry excuse me the the well the heart moves closer to the breast if you will if you take a big breath in the chest expands the heart falls back and you have more space between the breast and the and the heart and so they nowadays synchronize the radiation beam which is a zap that moves at the speed of light to your uh breath hold so they say take a big breath in and and so the risk to the heart is extraordinarily low what about other risks uh just briefly in terms of skin damage or other other risks of sickness or any any persistent damage from radiation under the current uh way it's done it depends a little bit on how much radiation is done and where they have to go so if you have a breast cancer particularly large breast cancer with extensive Regional lymph nodes then that's where you start talking about doing more extensive radiation to the chest wall the regional lymph nodes sometimes even the internal mamory nodes and there while they can still spare the vast majority of the heart um it becomes a little trickier to fully avoid the heart there is a risk of so-called pentis uh inflammation of the lung from some of the radiation scatter there is a risk of secondary skin cancers which you can rarely see after the radiation and there's a lot of shortterm side effects getting the radiation treatment is like having a a bad sunburn or as we say in Boston a wicked bad sunburn on the breast tissue itself where the breast gets red sore swollen it accumulates during the course of the radiation just as a sunburn accumulates during your day at the beach and um and that can be very physically uncomfortable over time uh that uh resolves the skin heals uh the tissue sort of Fades from a lobster red to a a pink and then to a tan color and eventually back to normal skin tone what percentage again of dcis are estrogen receptor positive something like 80 plus percent the vast majority got it so then to the next question which is what is the natural history of dcis er positive dcis with and without uh estrogen blockade in terms of recurrence yeah so estrogen blockade helps lower the risk um further beyond what radiation does one of the cleanest studies we have of this is a study called nsabp B24 which is an old study and in that study um uh it built on a previous study called B17 so in B17 they randomized patients to surgery alone for dcis lumpectomy alone versus lumpectomy plus radiation and in that study at 10 years about 25 or 30% of the women who had surgery alone had had a recurrence or second cancer or you know D of dcis or invasive cancer in the breast radiation cut that in half to about 12 to 15% and then in the follow study B24 they did okay lumpectomy plus radiation with or without tamoxifen and again it lowered the risk further by about half again the Dilemma there is that that study is old enough uh that we've gotten much more sophisticated in terms of the

[00:54:13] Imaging we offer to the breast looking at the margins very carefully making sure there's no extraneous calcifications so most people think that the Baseline risk after surgery alone nowhere approximates that 25 to 30% kind of number anymore it's much lower for most patients who have mammographically detected um uh dcis and so the the rules apply so it drops it by half drops it by half but the absolute benefit is a lot smaller because the Baseline risk is no longer way up here it's kind of down here and so for that reason the marginal benefits of the anti-estrogen approaches are something on the order of you know 3 to 5 perc in terms of preventing uh a recurrence and some of that benefit actually relates to the prevention of a second problem in the opposite breast because the drug therapy obviously affects both breasts uh and so you can help prevent a new cancer in the opposite breast which adds a percentage point or two of the benefit so it's a relatively small gain to be using anti-estrogens after dcis some patients it clearly makes sense because of the extent or other features of the tumor some will pursue it because they like the idea of the secondary benefit in the opposite breast many women um will pass on the anti-estrogen ther thies even as they receive other treatments for dcis one of the again uh academic questions is can you use the anti-estrogens instead of the radiation and that's part of uh other studies that are going on where women might get surgery for the dcis then be put on anti-estrogens without the radiation and we're going to see in the modern era if that's an acceptably um beneficial approach that's interesting though I I I you know as I think I think a lot about hormone replacement therapy and and what um tamoxifen does to women especially premenopausal I'm amazed that that's the more interesting academic question when the radiation as you point out is getting safer and safer and more and more efficacious it seems to me that the real jugular question is how long can we justify giving uh tamoxifen to women with dcis given the really devastating consequences uh if you think about it's it's basically putting women into menopause at a young age depriving them of estrogen we think about the long-term consequences on their bones the vasomotor symptoms the sexual side effects um yeah your your calculations are sort of the same as where I'm coming out when I do the math on the uh the nsabp uh 24 study which is we're talking about a 3 to 5% reduction of recurrence over a decade with no change in mortality it's um I'm it's interesting to hear that the majority of women do not elect for that that that that that actually if I'm hearing you correctly it sounds like the majority of women say

[00:56:59] I'll take my lumpectomy I'll do a little bit of radiation but I'm not going to take tamoxifen for 5 years well it's part of a comprehensive discussion but I think you've done the analysis the way many women would and say you know that I'm not sure that really adds up for me and one of the other things that's in addition to the safer uh features of the radiation therapy we're now offering shorter durations of radiation treatment historically the standard was 25 uh fractions we're now down to 16 fractions for most women and in Europe and increasingly in the US there's interest in looking at yet shorter courses of radiation down to about five days of treatment so at some point that becomes a very compelling option I think and um uh for many women that would be uh great news now how when I was in medical school and maybe a little bit beyond the traditional thinking so I know this is can't be right anymore but was that with lcis which was much less frequent than dcis it was more of a systemic concern and that your risk of contralateral breast cancer was sufficiently high that my gosh were they at one point recommending bilateral mastectomies for lcis am I making that up I I don't think you making it up but that's not an approach we would endorse today so lcis is probably best thought of as a field risk marker it's one of those things that you might have talked about in other contexts uh like um luopa in the throat which increases the risk of developing um head neck cancers or um other field defects clearly the um the diagnosis is saying this patient is a greater risk for developing cancer and historically the teaching was that actually the risk was the same in each breast with very large studies there's probably a slightly greater risk in the affected breast itself there's probably something specific and a little bit clonal going on there but it can increase the risk of a second breast cancer as well so what we usually offer patients like that is in fact very close monitoring and um many of those women will consider uh anti-estrogen therapy to lower their risk of developing uh breast cancer however lcis is not a lesion that is readily thought of as one you treat with surgery alone or surgery plus radiation so that's an area where lcis sort of management diverges from dcis management and for all radiographically suspicious lesions that go down this pathway what's the distribution of lcis versus dcis how much less is the lcis uh I would say it's about 20% of the diagnoses compared to dcis but I'm ballparking yeah yeah so but roughly four to one would be D versus and um any differences there demographically uh are we seeing more lcis uh in older women younger women uh different changes in estrogen receptor status anything like that no lcis is uh almost universally a hormone receptor positive estrogen receptor positive uh lesion um there's a rare entity called pleomorphic lcis which is a pathologic diagnosis that's a more virulent flavor of of um perhaps lcis and certainly of lobular breast cancer pleomorphic globular breast cancer but otherwise it's the same kinds of demographic trends that we've been alluding to when a woman has lcis um what do we know the natural history of that as a progression to invasive cancer and how it differs from in other words is there I I realize that it's more of a global marker of risk within the breast as opposed to a local marker but is it also a higher risk that breast cancer will occur yeah so um lcis along with those things we alluded to earlier like atypical ductal hyperplasia atypical lobal hyperplasia sort of a prean a pre precancerous lesion and it does increase the risk of eventually developing breast cancer we have some very good data from again from the nsbp um and just by way of disclosure I I work with the nsabp as a chair of one of their data safety and monitoring boards so I know their data ply well I don't uh don't have any other um commercial conflicts of interest but

[01:01:20] I do work with the NSA so they did a study called the P1 study which was a prevention study the goal of this study which was published over 20 years ago was to see if Tom oopen could lower the risk of breast cancer diagnosis in women who were at intermediate to moderate risk of developing breast cancer and so um in that trial they included a lot of women who had um lobular carcinoma in saitu and those women were at greater risk of developing breast cancer so that risk just to be quantitative so I'm looking this up as I speak to you was um there was a rate of 13 per per th000 women 13 per thousand women uh per year and tomox havean cut that in half down to about five or six per thousand women per year so you know it makes a few percentage points difference as a preventative agent again the key Point here is the absolute risk for developing breast cancer in any given span of time is still pretty low following a diagnosis of lcis but those patients do warrant monitoring obviously mamography uh and um they should consider or they can consider anti-estrogens to help lower that risk of developing breast s just to make sure I understand that that study so this study took women who were at high risk who had been diagnosed or had not yet been diagnosed with not yet diagnosed with breast cancer so they had a higher RIS risk was family history yeah they had higher risk because of family history or because of atypical hyperplasia or other there was a whole algorithm that went into the risk assessment um so wom higher risk these women took tamoxifen for how long five years versus a placebo and it reduced by less than 1% in absolute risk the occurrence of breast cancer it reduced the so the overall diagnosis of breast cancer in that study um uh was um about 4% um through five years of followup and

[01:03:19] T oxan cut that in half by about to about 2% so you know the drug quote Works unquote um and so for women who are at higher risk or who are very motivated tomox and subsequently other anti-estrogens have been shown to lower that risk of diagnosis but for most ordinary risk women um that risk is sufficiently low that the relative reduction only amounts to a percentage point or two and so it it's um it's not an an approach that has been enthusiastically embraced by most general population and did that reduction in Risk translate to a survival benefit or just an incidence it did not for a couple reasons one is obviously the risk is really low second um we have good treatments for those women who do develop breast cancer and third if you're using Tom oxin as a preventative arguably you're preventing the most treatable types of breast cancer from arising so you're pulling out the better actors if you will and what's left are tumors that remain somewhat resistant to the anti-estrogens and therefore more worrisome yeah boy that's a

[01:04:26] I might not have a dog in this fight because I'm not a woman but boy the thought that 98 out of a 100 women are unnecessarily exposed to tamoxifen for 5 years to save two cases of breast cancer that doesn't translate into any survival benefit my goodness I uh well and I think that you know you this is why it's been uh you know one of the frustrations for people who are really interested in cancer prevention has been that you know for most people in any given span of time the risk of developing a cancer is pretty low and so even in that study which sought to uh enrich for a group of women who are slightly greater than average risk of breast cancer the absolute benefit turns out to be modest and it's been it's been um a drug that only the most motivated patients would be uh inclined to pursue yeah God I think it really places the onus of this uh of of really you know capturing a great consent with the

[01:05:23] The Physician right I I worry that some of those women might not know what they're signing up for when they do it right I I I know a number of women who have taken tamoxifen for dcis you know wives of friends for example and a year in they're sort of calling me saying what the hell is going on like I can't believe is this really necessary and then I kind of walk them through the math and I say look I think you ought to talk to your oncologist because you know no doctor can predict how badly you will have side effects some women probably take tamoxifen and it goes off without a hitch right but but I think it's worth revisiting that discussion with your physician and saying look I'm one year into a 5-year course I'm premenopausal and this drug has ruined my life um I don't think any doctor would advise that woman to keep taking the drug right well um so you make a couple of really great points here the first is it is a nuanced conversation and um you know we're living at a time when it's often hard for clinicians to find that time to have these kinds of very detailed conversations with patients and so it's really important that they talk to people who will invest the time to to speak about that secondly um there will be patients for whom taking this medicine is really important and they feel very reassured by it and for many it will be a different decision and third is I don't want us to demonize the anti-estrogen medicines too much they clearly have side effects and I'm I'm sure we'll get to a discussion of those but in terms of global health toox and other anti-estrogens have cured more W more people of cancer than anything else we do in oncology so aside from surgery itself uh so these are really important medicines um from the global battle against uh breast cancer and um uh while there are legion side effects and we spend a lot of time in clinic addressing those and talking about them and alerting patients to them and managing them these remain really important medicines for invasive breast cancer uh for for pre-invasive cancers uh like dcis and for prean erous lesions um it's been uh a more a more complicated area to discuss because the benefits look pretty small to most people anything else you want to say about by the way dcis or LCS before we start to talk about invasive breast cancer um you know I think that what the the the shared element here is mamography and we're going to get to invasive breast cancer momentarily but the reason we make diagnosis of dcis and lcis is often because of mamography so one of the critiques of mamography which

[01:07:58] I I um I think is important to acknowledge is that you know when you have a national screening mamography program you're going to see an upsurge in the cases of dcis and lcis and this has led some to question whether we are overdiagnosing cancer on mamography it's it's it's part and parcel of the same thing for the cancers where we have successful screening programs one way they work is because they allow you to diagnose pre cancerous conditions so fundamentally that's what a papsmear does right so a papsmear is looking for obviously cervical cancer but it's also looking for the precancerous changes that you can identify on the papsmear a colonoscopy is a very effective screening tool for colon cancer because it allows you to both treat the lesion the pop which is the precancerous one and identify those who are at risk for more of them so they get more frequent screening so it is uh you do diagnoses of skin lesions in dermatologist office and some of them will be benign and others will be skin cancers but you're going to have an uptick in these precancerous findings as well so that is the nature of a successful screening program you are finding pre-cancerous lesions the debate as it relates to breast cancer is how much treatment should we offer in these precancerous instances but that's why there's more dcis and lcis and it is a natural consequence of a successful screening tool for the tumor um before we leave that let's let's add in uh a word on ultrasound and MRI so again bringing it back back to our um prostate analogy right the Workhorse of prostate cancer screening is the PSA so not an Apples to

[01:09:38] Apples comparison because it's not an imaging test but by itself you know really lacks the specificity to be a high yield tool and so in in many cases actually as you probably know the PSA is being abandoned which is unfortunate because it can be used provided you look at the density and the velocity uh of the PSA but instead of course higher risk patients are being evaluated and being more quickly sent for uh MRI and it's a multiparametric MRI um so we can explain what that means but I assume it's a very similar phase of MRI that's being done in breast cancer where it's looking at a highquality image T1 and T2 weighted image along with uh diffusion weighted Imaging uh and the use of contrast as well in the case of prostate this is scored with a RADS score that ranges from 1 to five and that's where the Radiology can sort of assign a probability of of of Suspicion so um Can can you talk a little bit about how ultrasound and MRI work for breast cancer and how they sharpen the resolution um in in this sort of diagnostic stage well so there's uh the diagnostic stage and then there but before that there's the screening the screening sorry I meant the screening stage so the screening stage the the screening tool that's most important is um the mammogram and and that is supplemented by sort of an awareness of

[01:11:00] One's Own body interestingly we may get to this later on when we talk about global impact of of breast health interventions but just teaching women to find a lump and go see a doctor has in many developing countries actually lowered the fatality rate of breast cancer because it allows early detection so there is awareness of the body matters when we're talking about screen mamography what um uh they're looking for are architectural changes uh regularities calcifications that might um uh uh be a sign of an invasive cancer and that's the the gold standard for most folks um sometimes the mam the mamogram is not a perfect tool any woman who's had a mammogram will tell you what an imperfect tool it is it's hard to exactly position the breast correctly it depends a lot on both the radi radiology technician to do a good image the mamography radiologist to interpret it correctly uh a correct comparison back and forth from the old older images to the newer ones and sometimes the breast itself can be difficult to view because of breast density or other features in the breast and that's where other

[01:12:03] Imaging can be helpful so occasionally people may need an ultrasound to support a mamogram finding it's not a reflex per se and it's not universally recommended in fact um Studies have not really shown that ultrasonography dramatically lowers the risk of of uh dramatically improves the the outcomes if you are found to have breast cancer but in some women who have denser breast tissue or other suspicious findings it's a pretty routine thing MRI is a very sensitive tool for finding abnormalities in the breast it does not replace the need for a mamogram but for women who are at very high risk of getting breast cancer classically these are women who have strong family histories or who have a known hereditary predisposition like a braa one or two mutation MRI is very important for early detection of um cancers uh and is routine for those women but but not for the general population and does the um mamogram have a similar sort of radiographic scoring uh where you have a RADS score of 1 two 3 four five correct so these are definitions put forward by the academic Radiology community and they're widely used in in clinical practice um they call it a birad score and they range from zero which is there's nothing of concern to five which is oh my gosh that looks like a cancer uh and in between is a gradation and there are very wellone standards of what those gradations mean and um you know the breast imaging has become very sophisticated and at large centers you know they focus a lot on the quality of the Imaging and the review and all of them are required to maintain their data and they know like if you had a birads three how many of them eventually became a breast cancer within a couple of years versus not and they accepted standards for what all this should mean it's sort of like the aviation industry um you know they've gotten really good at quality control and safety measures and um um you know it's it's really a very refined and sophisticated field of clinical care you know given how much MRI has changed prostate cancer diagnoses and I keep drawing this analogy but I think they're very similar you know those data exist for example where if you know the

[01:14:17] PSA and you know the PSA density and you know the uh pyd's score you have a complete distribution of whether or not there's no cancer present Ain 3+ 3 which you'll watch and wait Ain 3 plus4 which needs to come out or a 4 plus4 which should have come out you know last year um you know that a priority before you biopsy does that level of resolution exist with the combination of birads and any other factor that you can put in for example the mammographic Insight or other parameters of family history the short answer is no so um you know the guiding force of breast cancer management is really what the tissue biopsy defines and um the finding on the mammogram screening the Imaging itself um doesn't tell you as much as you would like to know uh there are a few sort of overarching pearls you can say you know slowly evolving lesions tend to be hormone receptor positive and those tend to have a better prognosis things that pop up quickly uh tend to be more virulent or proliferative lesions which have a less good prognosis but um those are not you know standard markers of risk that you would use to judge what therapy a patient needed all right so let's now talk about what fraction of women that show up with something suspicious either they present with something suspicious or they're undergoing screening and on mamography

[01:15:51] Andor follow-up Imaging there's something suspicious enough to warrant that needle biopsy what fraction of those needle biopsies turn out to be invasive cancer on contact well it depends a lot on what the abnormality is so in other words if you have a birads um four lesion you know the radiation excuse me the

[01:16:13] Radiology team is signaling that's a very suspicious that should have a high chance of being dcis or invasive breast cancer by Reds three it's probably I think I forget the exact number but I want to say like a less than 5% chance that that's a malignant lesion okay so you know there's that gradation uh within there um and you know different groups have then different thresholds internally and uh about what gets biopsied um having said that I think the message to share with with patients or or people in the general audience would be that a lot of the time even if there's a so-called call back for uh a mamogram finding and the mammogram team wants to do additional Imaging or um there even a recommendation for a biopsy a lot of the time these will still be for precancerous or even benign lesions and it doesn't automatically mean that um the patient has breast cancer when you quoted obviously the numbers at the beginning of the episode about the number of cases of breast cancer in the

[01:17:10] US per year I don't recall the number was it about 250,000 it's about 200 I said 275 I think but it's about 250 to 300,000 that's just invasive obviously that doesn't include any of those dcis lcis cases correct correct there's you know ballpark another 50 to 60,000 cases of dcis uh walk us through the diagnostic and staging procedure for a woman who on that core biopsy comes back a couple of weeks later pathologist says I'm sorry the the news is is bad we have invasive cancer so first of all what news is coming back with that in addition to the obvious which is what I just said coupled with receptor status what other information is coming back with respect to grade or other cellular machinery and then walk us through the completion of staging yeah so the core biopsy is very helpful for both defining what the diagnosis is is it precancerous is it dcis is it invasive breast cancer um and then um they would also comment on the grade so the grade is judged as grade one grade two or grade three grade three the cells are kind of growing wildly and sort of all over the place grade one um the cells tend to still form structures that are recognizable as glandular structures and the analogy here would be to a glein score it's not quite a one toone analogy but you know the higher the number the more sort of abnormal the cells are um and they would also do biomarker testing for those three markers we alluded to at the beginning estrogen receptor progesterone receptor and her 2 or hr2 is there anything else that they look at there or is it just those they don't look at there are a lot of things they can look at um so they also sometimes comment on the proliferation rate by using a test called the ki67 um which is a proliferation measure they can also comment on whether or not tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or tills are present uh that is a prognostic marker in triple negative breast cancers in particular um they can comment presumably a a favorable in triple negative that's right um they will comment if they can see any on whether or not um lymphovascular invasion is present sometimes they can see the cancer cell sort of burrowing into a blood vessel or a lymphatic Channel and that is a a marker of somewhat greater risk of the breast cancer um so those are things you can all see on the core biopsy and then those same tests are typically redone especially if you're at a different institution they're redone at the time of the definitive surgery and the definitive surgery here is always going to be a modified radical mastectomy or is there any situation where the lump is small enough that you will just do a lump ectomy with Sentinel nose oh very much uh the good news here is that uh for women who have early detection of breast cancer the majority are going to be candidates for so-called breast conserving surgery also know as a lumpectomy so in that instance only the affected portion of the breast is removed the rest of the volume of the breast is left intact um so the next definitive surgery for most women would be a lumpectomy where the affected portion of the breast is surgically removed and at the same time the surgeon would typically do a sentinal lymph node biopsy so they would look into the armpit uh remove a couple of lymph nodes 1 2 3 and see if there's cancer in those lymph nodes um and then you'll have the full stage information now for some women there is still discussion about a mastectomy um that may be because of um family history or genetics it might be because of personal preference it might be because of the size of the tumor relative to the size of the breast is such that a lumpectomy isn't adequate for achieving a cosmetic result that people would think is is acceptable um or it may be that there's sort of diffuse changes throughout the breast that require it um uh so it it it's very individualized at that point but for with early detection uh most women are going to be candidates for um a lumpectomy and um maybe walk through the tnm staging just so people get a sense of um you know what are the three big things that are driving prognosis because now we're going to put people into four stages 1 two 3 four with some

[01:21:22] A's and B's thrown in there right so as with all cancer staging stage four is metastatic or cancer that is spread beyond the tissue of origin so in breast cancer that means there's a breast cancer but it is spread to the Bone the lung the liver those kinds of organs um uh metastatic disease um stage one the other end of the spectrum is a tumor that is 2 cm or smaller so that's um about the size of a nickel uh or smaller uh and the lymph nodes are negative stage two includes slightly bigger tumors bigger than 2 cenm Andor involvement of some of the axillary the armpit lymph nodes stage three is a progressively larger cancer um and uh similarly affecting more lymph nodes lymph node involvement is the biggest single prognostic marker for early stage breast cancer by which we mean not involving some other organ elsewhere in the body and there's sort of a relatively uh sharp cut between sort of node negative tumors and node positive cancers but it's all of it's really a spectrum so breast cancer is really interesting if you have big enough study you know a 1 cimer cancer is less risky than a 1 and a half centimeter Which is less risky than a 2 centimeter Which is less risky than a 2 and a half cimeter and so forth there's another axis that goes by nodal status node negative is less risky than 1 2 3 4 it's all very linear and then finally there's a third dimensional access about the biology of the tumor where um triple negative cancers again ounce for ounce size for size will have a more aggressive Natural

[01:23:01] History her two positive tumors historically were also a very aggressive tumor now we have some of our most successful outcomes with treatment of her two positive cancers within this large group of er positive her2 negative cancers the risk uh depends on some of these biomarkers like grade so low grade intermediate grade higher grade um how robust the expression of the estrogen receptor is and nowadays we also use so-called genomic tests like the unyp DX recurrence score to understand for that large group of cancers how risky they are and whether they warrant chemotherapy so um I tend to describe it as with many others as sort of a three-dimensional axis of the tumor size the nodal status and then these biological features as well all of which are likely to affect risk of recurrence and just to be clear for The Listener

[01:23:50] Hal um it's important that they understand that all of that is in the m zero case non metastatic case so so all bets are off when we when we have metastatic disease the prognosis is awful um but for no uh the the prognosis is different but it's not awful there are women who are living a long time nowadays with metastatic disease and um we even occasionally think we might cure some people with metastatic disease uh though that's not usually the goal going into it it's only in the fullness of time but um the the key difference what fraction of women today would live small percentage and largely in this group of herto positive breast cancers where we think we have very effective therapies these days but the the big difference is is the tumor still confined to the breast and the lymph nodes so that with a combination of surgery and radiation therapy to the chest and then uh drug therapy to prevent recurrence either in the chest or anywhere else in the body we can cure the cancer or at least aim to achieve a cure for the cancer as opposed to that stage four distinction where it has spread to other important organs where usually we don't actually speak of curing the cancer we speak of managing it treating it keeping it at

[01:25:03] Bay for a long time and there will be women who will live for years and years and years with Advanced or metastatic breast cancer but that's that's where that that's the separation between functionally stage what what is the median survival today for stage four breast cancer it's about five years and it depends again on the subtype of the breast cancer triple negative breast cancer it's more modest her two positive breast cancers actually it's it's moving further and further out beyond that can you tell me again the distinction between the stage two in the stage three um the the is it more separated by the number of lymph nodes or the size of the primary it's both so um if you have a large tumor bigger than 5 cenm that becomes a so-called T3 cancer um and if you have T3 cancer with any degree of nodal involvement that becomes a stage three breast cancer um if you have four or more positive nodes regardless of the um extent of uh the size of the tumor that's stage three if you have involvement of the supera clavicular nodes that's stage three um and so you got to sort of get the grid out and look up all the criteria y got it um can you give me uh uh full survival so not 5ye not median but 10year like actual cure rate for stage one two and three um well if you look at the American

[01:26:25] Cancer Society statistics um you know we're doing uh uh they they update them every year and I don't I can look up the numbers and give the fingertips but in ballpark terms stage one isolated to the breast um 10year cancer-free survival nowadays often on the order of 90% or more uh stage two more like um and I'm ballparking here uh but 75 to 80% stage three um more like you know 65 to 75% and again it depends a lot on not just the stage but on the biology of the tumor and the kinds of treatments that people get now the grade the one 123 grade on pathology that doesn't factor into any of the staging is it more of a subtle issue that comes in when you are thinking about different chemo regimens um I'm not trying to mince words there is a staging criteria that factors in things like grade um and that can be used in in some of the uh more upto-date

[01:27:24] American Joint Commission on cancer staging criteria they do look at some of the things like grade usually though um uh it's less uh discussed because it mostly relates to the outcomes in ER positive breast cancer so triple negative breast cancers are almost always grade three most herto positive breast cancers are grade two or three uh and they all get treated with you know the trastuzamab drug and it's really in that gradation of the the vast majority of cancers the are positive ones where lowgrade clearly does a lot better than um higher grade Cancers and and needs different treatment approaches I guess before we go on to treatment I I guess there's uh I've had many disagreements with people over the years when it comes to uh arguments around aggressive screening um to me one of the most compelling Arguments for aggressive screening of breast cancer let's just limit it to breast cancer really is explained by what you just said coupled with another observation right which is so if if you catch a breast cancer that is 2 cm or smaller without lymph node involvement the chances that you will be cured which we use as 10-year remission uh is 90 to 95% and um without exception the larger the tumor is at presentation and the greater the lymph node involvement the lower your survival and of course if it spreads beyond the breast let's not mince words there is no long-term survival now we also know that when we give women chemotherapy in the adant setting I'll let you explain what that is in a moment and we give virtually the identical chemotherapy for women in the metastatic setting the survival difference is found it's a huge difference suggesting that tumor burden must matter um all of this is a long-winded way of saying the better we were able to identify breast cancer early on seems to me a our best bet at curing cancers which acknowledges you will catch more cancers in other words you will increase the the size of the pool of women who have cancers there will be lead time body all of those things will be true but ultimately it seems to me mathematically by definition you are also going to cure more women of cancer because you will shift the risk pool towards stage one tumors do you do you agree with that I do and I think most people who take care of breast cancer patients would very much agree with that as you may know there is still debate as to how valuable screening could be um it's a complicated subject in the sense that most of the studies that were done showing screening was valuable were concluded by the late 1980s they showed that screening did contribute to improvements in mortality um since then the therapy for breast cancer has gotten a lot better which arguably Cuts both ways on the one hand it means that it minimizes some of the benefits of early detection because you're not just cutting it out uh and you are able to treat um metastatic or systemic disease which is ultimately the life-threatening part of breast cancer and prevent recurrence which on some level diminishes the value of early detection on the other hand early detection is clearly still associated with better long-term prognosis the drugs are more effective or you can use the same drugs or fewer drugs uh when the tumor is smaller to get as uh uh better results so I think um all of us who are in the cancer Community feel strongly that mamography is a a very important tool and um not to take us away from from thinking about how we treat in in the United States but as you may know uh breast cancer is now the most common diagnosis of cancer aside from non-melanoma skin cancer it's the most common cancer diagnosis in the world and for almost all countries on

[01:31:37] Earth I'm sorry I I I didn't know that how you're saying it's more common than lung cancer more commonly diagnosed lung cancer because the outcomes are better there's still more fatalities from lung cancer but um it's the most common diagnosis of cancer in women almost every country on Earth uh there are still some places in subsaharan Africa where either cervical or other gynecologic tumors outpace uh breast cancer um but almost everywhere else it's the number one cause diagnosis of cancer in women and in total it's the largest cancer diagnosis so the the the point of this story is to say that from a global Health point of view um it's becoming a huge issue for countries that historically we've not thought of cancer as a Big Driver of mortality in and this relates to the um the welfare advances in many countries around the world as they've been becoming more affluent better nourished uh and becoming more

[01:32:34] Western in that sense that they now have cancer problems that are um looking more and more like the kinds of cancer issues that we see in the United States and Western Europe and other developed countries so the the importance of mamography globally is growing not shrinking and one of the challenges is there are simply insufficient medical Manpower woman power to adopt widespread screening programs in many parts of the world right now and there's been a lot of really cool artificial intelligence research to suggest that you can look at breast Imaging perhaps even in the future without a radiologist to begin to identify women who warrant either more um uh detailed evaluation or um uh other um uh diagnostic workup but this is going to be a huge problem in the coming decades as breast cancer uh spreads if you will uh to really become a global disease so let's talk a little bit about the the treatment how so for the the and we'll go back and do it through the the lens of the staging so a woman comes out of the definitive procedure which again is going to be a lumpectomy with a sentinel node biopsy The Sentinel node is negative they will not undergo a formal lymph node dissection she'll be told she had stage one breast cancer um is she receiving effectively the same treatment as the dcis woman where she's going to get radiation for local control and then depending on the receptor status she'll either get tamoxifen if it's ER positive her septin if it's hert new positive is that or is there any treatment beyond that yeah so um so the first thing to say is that's a very common problem and um in uh the United States the the most common presentation of breast cancer is of a stage one breast cancer found on a mamogram which has a very good prognosis after surgery but almost all patients will be candidates for some type of what we call Aden therapy so aduen therapy are treatments that are designed to help

[01:34:34] PR prevent a recurrence after surgery it's not unique to breast cancer we use Aden therapy in colon cancer and in some sarcomas and in certain prostate cancers and in other kinds of uh cancers as well and sometimes patients ask well why do I need extra therapy after all the surgeon got rid of the tumor it's a good question when you think about it and the answer is that we worry about the possibility of microscopic disease that might be somewhere either in the breast or chest area or might have snuck away somewhere else in the body itself and so we use additional therapies to mop up those microscopic bits of cancer so one of those is the radiation therapy we've talked about that the majority of women who are 70 and younger and who are vigorous and healthy uh who have uh early stage breast cancer are going to be advised to get radiation therapy U many women in their 7 and even older will have to think about radiation treatment depends on the type of cancer they have their overall health status and fundamentally uh you know as a ballpark term you might say whether they have a 10-year life expectancy or not such that radiation is likely to be of some value to them in preventing recurrence over the next decade and also the vast majority of patients are going to be candidates for some form of drug therapy and in terms of what has really change the mortality from breast cancer it's two fundamental things uh beyond the surgery itself which would be uh which is obviously the sinqua known um one of them is early detection through mamography and that's reduced the risk of breast cancer over the past 30 40 years by about half mortality from breast cancer and the other is effective systemic therapy and that has given us the other half of improvements in mortality that were seen in the United

[01:36:13] States over the past you know 30 years and so for cancers of almost any size that are estrogen receptor positive we think about anti-estrogen medicines like tamoxifen or aroma inhibitors for tumors that are as small as a half a centimeter or more in size we think about drugs like trastuzamab that Target her2 and similarly for very small triple negative breast cancers we often think about chemotherapy and then there's a discussion most women with her two positive cancers also get chemotherapy with that trastuzamab and then as the tumor gets bigger and riskier we amp up with more anti- heru drugs um and more chemotherapy if the tumor um is estrogen or are positive we go through a process where we decide whether or not the patient needs chemotherapy and that usually involves um an oncotype DX recurrent score or similar genomic test done on the tumor itself where they look at the patterns of gene expression in the tumor and those Studies have shown us that the majority of women who have lowrisk scores on this genomic test and there's several commercially available there's one called the recurrent score from exact Sciences there's one called the mam print sass from agenda and their others those have been shown to be very powerful at figuring out who does and more importantly who does not need chemotherapy so there's been a huge shift in how we use chemotherapy in ER positive breast cancers over the past 25 years from the time in 1999 when the NCI said every woman who had a 1 cimeter cancer needed chemotherapy to a Time nowadays when we frequently can avoid chemotherapy for most ER positive breast cancers certainly those that are noed negative and many of the ones that are noed positive as well because we understand that based on this genomic test the chemotherapy is just not going to help them do better in the long run so Circle back surgery is the sinqua known following the surgery we use radiation therapy to sterilize the breast and chest area and then the majority of women will need to think about some kind of drug treatment which could be chemotherapy anti-estrogen therapy targeted drugs sometimes immunotherapy to help prevent a recurrence anywhere else in the body um

[01:38:27] Hal just spend a moment there explaining to people the distinction between chemotherapy and some of these other therapies because I think a lot of people sort of hear any systemic therapy is quote unquote chemotherapy but you've you've made a great point to distinguish between the anti-estrogen therapy and tamoxifen an asrol things like that uh herceptin which is a targeted therapy uh versus quote unquote chemotherapy so what what are the things that you put in that bucket how are you defining that and and specifically what are some of the therapies and what are their side effects yeah so um we've talked about the several different kinds of breast cancer and um nowadays we have a different treatment Paradigm really when it comes to the drug therapy for each of these different types of tumors so for

[01:39:09] ER positive triple uh ER positive her2 negative breast cancer is the most common kind the most important drug therapy relate to anti-estrogen medicines so there are two basic flavors in the early stage one is called tamoxifen the other is called an aromatase inhibitor these are each pills they work by different mechanisms tamoxifen sort of blocks estrogen's ability to reach the estrogen receptor in the cancer cell the aromatase

[01:39:36] Inhibitors um only work in postmenopausal women uh and they block the production of estrogen by nonovarian tissue so a postmenopausal woman still makes a little bit of estrogen in tissues like the liver the adrenal gland the fat normal body stores of fat and the aromat imers block that production of estrogen so the consequence is estrogen deprivation which again sort of starves on the vine these cancer cells that we think depend on estrogen for their growth and development um so that's a very important medicine and again globally hugely important has saved more lives than bone marrow transplant or glec or immunotherapy or whatever you know of the sexy new approaches in cancer but the the statistics are all in favor of these these hormone manipulations as being globally of of huge importance now in addition to that we also have a whole um closet full of different types of drugs that we use so some of them are traditional chemotherapy drugs and patients May sort of have a a cultural sense of what these drugs are they tend to be rather nasty uh IV medicines uh they make you sick to your stomach they can make your hair fall out they lower your blood counts they make you tired uh on the one hand our supportive care and oncology has gotten vastly better in recent decades so we have very powerful antinausea medicines we have medicines to Goose the white blood cells to come back faster so you're not at risk for infections we have cold caps these days that allow women to often not experience hair loss during chemotherapy um so on the one hand the um the supportive care has really transformed our ability to give chemotherapy drugs drugs such as docar rubison or what's also known as adriamycin the Red Devil uh taxine type drugs called ply taxol or taxol alkal drugs like cyclop fosmid or carboplatin very widely use chemotherapy drugs and maybe just for folks to understand how these things all have something in common which is they're basically anti-proliferative drugs as you said they're old school dirty drugs these have drugs that have been around for many many decades and they target dividing cells and that's why these side effects exist hair falls out because hair is dividing you get sor in your mouth because the cells the the epithelial cells in your mouth are dividing and so they're very non-specific um but you know on balance they are sort of going after cancer cells in the sense that cancer cells are going to be dividing more frequently than non-cancer cells that's exactly right and so they're they're rather blunt instruments but sometimes it's really helpful to have a wrecking ball if you will um so that's where things stood you know for a long time but in the past again two decades we've really transformed how we think about this because of some newer drugs that have come along so in the different subtypes we have different approaches triple negative breast cancer had historically been one of the most difficult to treat uh types of breast cancer where we didn't really have a targeted therapy and so we used a lot of chemotherapy and there were dozens of Trials optimizing chemotherapy and triple negative disease but the biggest new thing has been immunotherapy and I'm I'm sure in other cancer podcasts you've talked about the so-called checkpoint Inhibitors drug like pmab and others that have proven very active in a lot of different tumor types in breast cancer the data are most compelling for these drugs in triple negative breast cancers where we um have shown that they can uh reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and interestingly we usually use them before the surgery we can come back to talking about that in what we call a Neo adant approach which is the same idea as adant therapy drug therapy to mop up cancer everywhere in the body but actually given before the surgery to shrink the tumor and to um allow the patient to get the effective treatment that goes everywhere in the body for the herto positive the transformative event was the development of trastuzamab or her septin which uh the data came forward in 2005 for early stage breast cancer that adding trastuzamab dramatically improved uh the chances of never hearing from the cancer again and that became totally standard for herto driven uh breast cancers nowadays for higher risk ones we add a second anti-er drug called pusab or petta now interestingly we're still giving chemotherapy with those anti-h heru drugs but uh We've completely flipped the outcomes for heru positive breast cancer where it has gone from one of the most feared types of breast cancer to one of the most successfully treated types of breast cancer and finally with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer there have been two narratives one has been a narrative about using less chemotherapy so the good news is we are able to figure out a lot of women don't actually need chemotherapy for ER positive her2 negative breast cancers there's this genomic test we get to help us decide whether chemotherapy is going to be valuable and with that about 2third of the women who were previously offered chemotherapy can now avoid chemotherapy wow at the same time we're amping up some of the hormonal AIS manipulation so we are using um ovarian suppression uh which means for younger women going into premature menopause to help prevent the cancer from coming back we're using longer durations of anti-estrogens for higher risk tumors and there's a very exciting new class of drugs called cdk46

[01:44:55] Inhibitors which are oral medicines given for a couple of years now they are targeted drugs that again slow down the proliferation of tumors and for very high-risk cancers we're now looking at using them in addition to all the other kinds of medicines that we're talking about so each type of breast cancer has its own Paradigm of treatment and each group is doing incrementally better and better because of those Innovations what are the indications for Neo adant therapy U so so which which tumors on

[01:45:24] Imaging and biopsy are deemed you know cancers that where they're going to get all that systemic therapy before surgery and my recollection is the the pathological response that you see to the neoen therapy is also a great prognostic indicator that's exactly right so for larger tumors um we have been moving more and more towards a paradigm of what we call Neo adant treatment where the usual sequence of diagnosis of cancer surgery chemotherapy if you're going to get it radiation therapy if you're going to get it hormonal therapy out back we're kind of moving it all around and I often describe this as sort of a a a freight train you know it's it's a cassette of treatment and we're just kind of giving the same kind of therapy but we're switching the order and we're switching the order for very specific reasons um one of those reasons is that by giving the drug therapy first we usually can shrink the tumor either in the breast or particularly in the lymph nodes as well and so that means we can offer very good outcomes the same good outcomes but with less surgery so women who might have needed a mastectomy might now be able to have a lumpectomy if the tumor shrinks or women who might have been obliged to undergo a so-called axillary lymph node dissection where all the lymph nodes in the armpit are removed that carries a greater risk of limited restrictive uh limited range of motion in the arm or lymphadema in the arm now might be a candidate for a sentinal node biopsy by shrinking those tumors ahead of time so that's one big advantage of Neo adant therapy it gives the same treatment but it makes the surgeon um able to do a lesser operation so there's less morbidity from the operation and a better cosmetic uh result the second big reason is that we learn while giving this Neo adant treatment how well the tumor responds and if the cancer totally disappears intuitively obvious that's a really favorable prognostic finding and we call that a pathologic complete response it just means the pathologist looks under the microscope at the end of that treatment course at the time of the surgery and says there's no cancer left that's a really good finding and puts the patient into a much lower risk category a much better prognostic group did those patients get adant therapy or is therapy done they they usually get they often get something and we can it depends again on the specific flavor of where you're at but um uh they the prognosis goes way up conversely if there's some residual cancer it's it's a less favorable prognostic finding but in many instances we actually have drugs that we're now using to overcome that residual disease so for instance in herto positive breast cancer we give chemotherapy and trast tmab up front if there's residual disease out back we can use a derivative of trastuzumab called trastuzumab M tanine which which improves the prognosis for those patients who have residual cancer and there are many instances of this throughout the spectrum of breast cancer treatment so we use Neo ement therapy for larger tumors to shrink the tumor in the breast shrink the tumor burden in the lymph nodes and and to individualize or tailor treatment on the backside based on how much response there is let's talk about prostate cancer again is an analogy so again I think here's a great analogy right we know that in the case of prostate cancer testosterone is not causing prostate cancer but it's a growth factor for the cancer so once a man has prostate cancer if he has metastatic disease Androgen therapy is the standard of care removing the

[01:48:48] Androgen um if you have surgical disease you remove the tumor um but men are able to go back on testosterone replacement therapy if they need it provided the PSA stays low so is there an analogy here in breast cancer where obviously if a woman has ER positive breast cancer and it's metastatic well you're going to have you know unfortunately you're going to be dealing with anti-estrogen therapy indefinitely um but if you're talking about a stage one cancer or a stage two cancer or even a stage three where you have a Neo adant treatment you have a pathologic CR as far as you're concerned there's no evidence of disease are those women still uh told to forego estrogen replacement therapy in in postmenopause and if so why the difference from the biology of prostate cancer well it's a it's a great question so as we've said a couple times in the course of the session you know the anti-estrogen medicines which are very common remember 80 plus per of tumors are estrogen receptor positive and nearly all those patients would be advised to have anti-estrogen medications so the side effects all relate to the estrogen deprivation hot flashes night sweats Bone and Joint stiffness and achiness hair thinning not hair loss but thinning finer hair somewhat of a reeding hairline um vaginal dryness and sexual health issues or frequent urinary tract infections related to changes in the epithelial of the genital tract osteoporosis all these things are related to the loss of estrogen now the upside of the treatment is sufficiently important that we encourage patients to strongly consider those treatments nonetheless but managing those side effects is a is a part of the work of what oncology teams do for women who've had complete pathologic response one asks do I really need all the therapy out back and it's a great question at the moment we we don't usually omit the anti-estrogens if the tumors ER positive parenthetically it's rather rare for ER positive tumors to have that complete pathological response because there's sort of an inverse relationship between the effectiveness of hormone treatment and the effectiveness of chemotherapy the um the more hormone sensitive the tumor is the less role there is for chemo and sort of

[01:50:55] Vice Versa in the space of er positive disease for women who have triple negative breast cancers in theory you could say gosh it would be okay to take anti-estrogens but we don't stylistically indorse that too often I think what what we really focus on is what's the the symptom that we're trying to address with the hormone replacement therapy and in those instances we have important conversations with patients so for instance patient has osteoporosis we have very good non hormonal options to treat osteoporosis um patient has hot flashes and night sweats there are non hormonal options to address those in fact the FDA just approved a drug a few months ago uh to try and treat hot flashes um uh uh um genital symptoms uh genital urinary symptoms sexual health issues were actually rather liberal about using genital uh preparations of um estrogen so vaginal estrogen creams and things like that that can alleviate some of the discomfort or other symptomatology without giving significant systemic absorption so we really try for most breast cancer patients we stay away from um oral hormone replacement therapy looking whenever possible to use non hormonal or tapered or tailored hormonal manipulations that don't offer systemic exposure now having said all that everyone who sees a lot of breast cancer patients knows there's a few women who were really just so uncomfortable without the hormones that um they really need that to have a valuable quality of life and then you have a you know a unique conversation with the patient about those issues so let's talk a little bit about the genetics of this so

[01:52:35] I think there can't imagine there's anybody listening to this who hasn't heard of the braa genes um so let's start with those they're clearly not the only genes that are responsible and as we when we talk about cancer of course everybody understands cancer is a genetic disease um but in the sense that there are mutations that are the sinanan of the cancer um most of those mutations are sematic they're mutations that occur during our life but a handful of them are germline and clearly the bracka mutations are the most noteworthy so um what can we say about inherited risk of breast cancer through either single genes or polygenic how much do we know what's the prevalence what else can you tell us about those yeah so family history is obviously a powerful marker for greater risk of breast cancer recurrence and um if you look at large populations roughly 8 to 10% of all breast cancer diagnoses are related to a specific hereditary gene mutation so um brca1 brca2 braco 1 braa 2 account for about half or five of that 10% of all hereditary breast cancer so um these are often are families that have particular histories of ovarian cancer and breast cancer brca1 and brca2 are very high penetrant genes that means there's a pretty high lifetime risk of developing breast cancer or ovarian cancer if you have a brca 1 or brca2 mutation so if the average again we've talked about this number at one and eight instead of one and8 we're talking about you know a one and two or even a two and three chance lifetime of developing breast cancer for women who

[01:54:15] Harbor those gene mutations uh the genetic testing for that now has become very standard and increasingly what we're seeing is that when one member of a family is identified as having a brca1 or brca2 mutation we can help that patient in several ways first they might consider um mastectomy because of the risk of a second breast cancer some women who not been diagnosed with cancer we'll consider prophylactic mastectomy second we think about prophylactic ectomy removing the ovaries once that patient is done with childbearing because we don't really have a good screening tool for ovarian cancer and so once women have finished um having their families they often think about having their ovaries removed to lower their risk of ovarian cancer which also traffics with a brca1 and brca2 mutation and finally for women who choose to retain the brass we offer more intensive screening uh usually it's an annual MRI staggered every 6 months with an annual mamogram so we've learned a lot about those particular mutations we also talk to extended family members because as you know um brca 102 increased the risk of prostate cancer in men uh they also increase the risk of male breast cancer and they also increase the risk of pancreatic cancer though the numerical issues there are all smaller than than the risk of breast or ovarian cancer so these are um a really evolving space in our management of cancers and we have a whole team of genetic counselors and genetic Specialists to both do the genetic testing and then advise patients very carefully on what the particular findings mean for their own care and how they should think about that in their breast cancer or other cancer management can you say a little bit about more about those as far as um you know braa being gain a function loss a function how is it transmitted is it autosomal dominant uh does you know does it matter if a male knows that he has it with respect to his female Offspring Etc yeah so these are as you said autosomal dominant transmitted that is to say a man can transmit it to his um uh

[01:56:13] Offspring just as easily as a woman can um and um uh they are loss of function mutation so the the normal biological role of these proteins that are encoded by the brca1 and2 gene seems to be to help repair the DNA in a cancer cell or excuse me in a normal cell every time a cell divides there's all this um uh fine print editing if you will of the genome and they're constantly replacing base pairs to correct the genome so that it stays uh perfect if you will through the thousands of Divisions that a cell might undergo in the lifespan of a of a person um when you have a deficiency in brca1 or brca2 or other genes in this space that repair mechanism is much less precise and so mutations begin to accumulate and if you have further loss of DNA repair uh that can then predispose to giving rise to Cancers and the ones we've talked about breast ovarian prostate pancreatic are the most common ones that we see with brca 1 and two what makes up the other half you mentioned that the other half has actually become very interesting as well so the other half includes other proteins in the same pathway of the brca 1 and2 so in particular palb2 which uh is a partner of the bracket 2 protein um and about 1% of all breast cancers will have a palb2 mutation um which is a a mutation that also substantially increases the risk of developing lifetime breast cancer but a little bit less than brca 1 or two um about 1 to 2% will be related to a uh a gene called uh Che 2 chek2 which also increases risk of colon cancer and about 1 to 2% will be related to mutations in the Axia Tangi Asia Gene the ATM mutations uh which can give rise to several different kinds of cancers though they're less common U but that's something that we are now encountering because here's the key takeaway for many many women now we are recommending that following a breast cancer diagnosis they do have genetic testing so that we can understand if we need to think about their tumor differently or if we need to think about their surveillance or prevention approaches differently and so we're doing a lot more genetic testing than we used to do and with that we're finding these other mutations now most women still don't have a mutation most women who have first-degree relatives mom or sisters who have can breast cancer don't have a hereditary mutation and the obverse of this is that many women can be reassured that they have not transmitted an undue risk to their offspring uh which is a real concern amongst many patients diagnosed with breast cancer and so a negative genetic test result can also actually be very reassuring for a family even as a positive finding can allow us to act differently in their management so braa 1 and two uh palb 2 cze 2 ATM account for 10% of breast cancer cases these are the these are not these are the exception and not the rule but they are germline mutations they're single gene mutations and they're worth screening for um is there any reason a woman with um a questionable family history I mean one first-degree relative should be checking this or if um you know if a woman has a sufficient enough family tree you know Mom does not have it and you know no no grandparents have it no parents have it is that would that be dispositive to say I don't need genetic testing there's a growing recognition that um different so these different genes have different sort of familial patterns and because many of them are so-called less penetrant the family history I'm sorry yeah I was just about to say because it's sorry to interrupt you but because it's not fully penetrant correct you can be fooled by a relative not having it's not so it's not so full-blown if you will and you know um and so I think that uh one of the things that happens in following a breast cancer diagnosis is a lot of other family members might be tested uh as well and um um you know I think we're getting closer to the time when there will be universal genetic testing following a breast cancer diagnosis and that will have a cascading effect into the families uh of affected individuals and for women who have a strong family history of cancers uh it's certainly very appropriate to meet with genetic counselors talk about the testing options and in many instances pursue that testing both because they want to know if they should be more uh uh aggressive about their screening and surveillance but also looking for the reassurance that that isn't something they have to be unduly concerned about so this is another part of the revolution of our breast cancer treatment which has been very exciting to see mature over the past uh 20 years um are there any sort of commercial tests that you can point people to where they can you know ask their doctor or go directly uh directly you know over the counter and and get a test done that looks specifically for those five genes um there are tests uh there are many commercial assays from many different companies that uh typically look nowadays at larger panels of of genes often up to about a 100 genes on a rather regular basis um these are usually done with a specific purpose of looking for hereditary cancer risk while that the over-the-counter kind of things like the 23 and me things can in theory pick these up we don't usually lean on them as clinically actionable tests and

[02:01:40] I think if there's a real concern about family history probably better to seek out a genetic counselor or um you know a Cancer Center in the community where you can talk more about this and and get um specific tests from different companies yeah that actually leads me to another question which is the importance or lack of importance um of multi-disciplinary care so obviously you're at Dana Farber which is you know probably one of the top three Cancer Centers globally certainly in the United States um which would be the epicenter of multi-disciplinary care um maybe tell folks what multi-disciplinary care means what the benefits are but um you know given that most people are not going to go to Dana Farber or Memorial Sloan ketering for their breast cancer care how how important is it and what should they be looking for in their local hospital when they are diagnosed yeah it's a it's a really great point about helping patients get excellent Breast Cancer Care and it's not of course unique to breast cancer but many many cancers require as you said multidisiplinary care fancy way of saying you're going to need to think about surgery radiation therapy medical oncology olog management with drug therapy you want to have outstanding pathology you want to have genetic counselors you want to have great

[02:02:58] Imaging teams and what cancer centers do is they bring all those people together Under One Roof these days it's sometimes you know with satellites but they all collaborate together and work together and um that is really why care in a major Cancer Center can be so effective because you have a team of people who are working together every day uh to make sure that things get done the right way and you know sometimes I I draw an analogy about you know the airline industry you know what do you as a passenger you want an invisible experience with the airline right but what makes it all work well you got to have a great maintenance team you got to have an air traffic controller that knows what they're doing you got to have pilots who understand how things work you need the food delivery trucks to arrive at the right time at the right moment you need gate agents to keep people moving through the whole thing and um you get that at airports that are good because they all work together constantly and they know exactly what they're doing they communicate with each other regularly that's what makes for a very uneventful flying experience we hope and for Cancer Care you want the same thing and the the way you can always talk figure this out if you're a patient is are the providers talking to each other it doesn't have to you don't have to see them all the same day though of course it's nice if you can do that and we try to do that they don't have to all be under the same roof because again we try and do that but it's not essential what's essential is that they function as a team cuz almost every patient with breast cancer is going to need to think about surgery radiation therapy medical oncology care many will also need to think about plastic or reconstructive surgery many will need to think about quality of the Imaging they get down the road they might need genetic testing you want folks who are working together all the time communicating with each other and handing the Baton back and forth as necessary so one of the conversations we frequently have when we meet a new patient is modality of therapy is going to come first is it going to be surgery and then

[02:04:56] U medical oncology and radiation afterwards or do we actually want to flip the sequence as we talked about in neoag treatment and give medical oncology treatment first that's where you want a group that works together talks uh effectively and regularly so that they're all on the same page and we all say things like okay you're going to have surgery first I'm going to let my surgical team take you through that next lap on this relay race then we're going to have uh theace iation team grab the

[02:05:22] Baton they're going to take you on a lap and then I'm going to pick it up and take you through another lap as we talk about the medical oncology therapy that kind of collaboration and teamwork is really important for women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer how important do you think it is for a woman to undergo her therapy at home versus coming somewhere else so so if if a if a woman listening to this lives in I'm I

[02:05:47] I'm going to offend whoever lives in that City but the implication is not that the Cancer Care in City X so I won't even name a city but they live in City X and they're listening to this podcast and they just got diagnosed with breast cancer and they say well I I want to go to Dana Farber because you know the way that he's describing that sounds like exactly the care I want to be but the reality of it is cityx is a 2-hour flight from Boston and so they they came out and they saw you for a consult are you going to say to them look city X might not have a place as good as

[02:06:18] Harvard but it's pretty darn good and I think think you're better off staying there because you at least can go home every night as opposed to having to stay in hotels and things like that I mean how do you help patients navigate that and what fraction of the patients who come to Dana Farber don't live in Boston well you know we're very fortunate to have a terrific reputation such that we see patients from obviously New England all across the country and and really all across the world who will come to a

[02:06:45] Cancer Center like Dana Farber for exactly that kind of multi-disciplinary care and in the management of metastatic disease they might also come for U clinical trials actually both in the early and in the advanced stage disease where the next uh wave or the future of innovative treatment is going to emerge having said that breast cancer is a very common problem it is the most common cancer diagnosis in the country as we've as was as we've mentioned and you can get great Breast Cancer Care in many many parts of the country there there are very few parts of the United States where people really don't live within reasonable access distance of really good Breast Cancer Care it's a it's a common problem now having said that um you know I think it is important to make sure that you're dealing with people who specialize in Cancer Care uh there's been a big push to professionalize the issues of radiation oncology and surgery to subspecialize those areas just as we subspecialize medical oncology and that you have that team presence and um I think those are things to very much seek out as part of your treatment program and most people again will live within distance of getting a second opinion and um that's always a good idea uh if there's any ambiguity or if you're looking for reassurance because um you know hopefully uh by making the effort once perhaps to go to a place where you can get uh external validation of the plan it it offers a lot of reassurance and comfort where would you say is the greatest variability of care across the medical oncology Surgical Oncology radiation oncology when you compare you know say the Top Flight you know that if you took at the top 20 institutions in the United States and compared them to the median institutions of the country where will you see the most disparity will it be in the the radiation side the uh the surgical side the the the post-operative side like where's where's the greatest variability I I don't think there's one specific area that jumps out I think that where things can get um you know I think the value added of um you know some of the cancer centers that we've been discussing uh really thoughtful review of the pathology and

[02:08:59] Radiology uh these are things that are not often visible to patients um but the experience of the Radiology team working with the surgeons you know are they really satisfied that that little ditel doesn't need to be biopsied um is the pathology First Rate did they really make sure that um the grade was called correctly that the estrogen receptor was studies were correct done those are incredibly important things and um While most places do it very well those are things that can can really alter longer term outcomes another area is um judicious use of treatment so um there are a lot of drugs that we can use in uh early stage breast cancer and dialing in the right amount is a bit of an art form uh again it's a common disease most places do it very well but there are sometimes Nuance questions about is this a case where we want to add more or is this a case where we're comfortable doing a little bit less that's an important part of the discussion other areas that matter a lot uh again um not always so obvious to patients but plastic and reconstructive surgery uh tremendous variation in approaches uh and uh in the teamwork and collaboration between the breast surgeon and the um plastic and reconstructive surgery teams those things can also uh have a big impact on how people look and feel you know years after the breast cancer diagnosis so making sure that um you know you have high quality access to plastic and Recon plastic and reconstructive surgeons if that's part of the uh treatment plan is is really critical so I think that again the good news is that you can get excellent

[02:10:37] Breast Cancer Care at many many places around the country and the the test if you will for most patients is are these folks used to working together are they talking to each other collaborating with one another coming up with a unified plan that Mak sense that's really what you want to see happen yeah and if that's not happening if they don't have a monthly tumor board those would be kind of signs that a meeting where all these people the Pathologists the medical oncologist surgical oncologist radiation oncologists get together if you don't have a tumor board that might be a sign that says hey uh I I'm going to I'm going to travel a little bit further to the next city or see what I can do I also seems to me that one of the most high yield Investments if you're going to seek that second opinion sending a block of pathology slide to the A+ Center um is is really valuable I think that's something that patients don't always know and I hope that people listening we can now make this a really good Public Service Announcement which is make sure when you have your tissue specimen taken that you understand you have a right to request that that tissue a section of that tissue be sent to another pathologist if you're choosing um and that can be as you said I think a very important determinant of outcome that's an easy easy place to make a mistake or Overlook something if a less experienced Center is viewing a tumor that happens to be not a run-of-the-mill tumor it's a great Point Peter and um the quality of pathology is the foundation for all of Cancer Care and um again breast cancer um very common usually begins in the breast it's usually not so mysterious but uh often times a pathology review is vital importance you know are the margins adequate is this you know uh uh dcis or invasive cancer it can sometimes be hard to know um is this um you know a favorable prognosis tumor under the microscope or not and then if you take a bigger step back we occasionally see things that aren't even breast cancer there are other tumors that can be there they can be reclassified and then when you start to imagine other kinds of cancer sarcomas and lymphomas and leukemias where there's a real art to the Pathology um it's that's uh an uh unappreciated vital part of of the

[02:12:56] Cancer Care process that everyone in has access to with um consultations on pathology and and as part of what great Cancer Centers really deliver how just for the sake of completeness although most people probably aren't aware of this you've already alluded to it twice uh men can develop breast cancer as well um can you say a little bit about what the incidence is uh and do we know anything about the risk factors yeah so it's um uh it's a absolute truism that men can get breast cancer fortunately um the incidence is pretty low for every 200 cases of female breast cancer there's one case of male breast cancer and um the risk factors are not particularly well known but they do include um um uh genetic predisposition as part of it uh they concl they include certain hormonal conditions uh that men can rarely get um but what's interesting is is men are often unaware that they can get breast cancer and so it is not uncommon that men's diagnoses are actually at a higher stage than women's because they weren't really paying a lot of attention to the chest or the breast or they noticed some nodularity and didn't really think much of it uh and so if men are found to have on exam uh any changes around the breast tissue uh that should be evaluated as well and um um I've actually had the experience over the years of a a woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer and then her husband like was poking around his chest like wait a second and they you know have husband and wife breast cancer uh and so it happens once in a while it's a small area of overlapping ven diagrams there but um it is something to be aware of and um the treatment principles for male breast cancer are fundamentally the same as for female breast cancer though nearly all breast cancers in men are estrogen receptor positive uh it's very rare to get a triple negative breast cancer in a man and what about uh her two receptor uh uncommon but not unheard of interesting so one in 200 cases so there's not a lot of men in your care but given the size of your practice I'm sure you do see men from time to time we do and um um we actually have a program here for men with breast cancer uh headed by Pablo Leon and several other cancer centers around the country uh also have this um there are issues that arise historically men have been offered mastectomy because the the aesthetic virtues of breast preservation have not been thought to be so important in men that's kind of changing nowadays for for some men um most men will be candidates for anti-estrogen medicine as we um as their tumors or estrogen receptor positive uh the genetic piece is very important so there are clinics that specialize in the care of men with breast cancer as well got it well Hal this has been a really interesting discussion it's uh it's been a whirlwind tour of all things uh breast cancer I want to thank you very much for uh sharing your time I know I know how busy you are so um yeah I want to thank you again and I I I know that we'll we'll link to a lot of the stuff that we've talked about including some of the trials so that people can understand this I hope that people come away from this with a really good sense of how to ask the right questions to be better advocates for themselves as they're going through therapy and of course ultimately if they are diagnosed with breast cancer to understand what the um critical questions are that that should be asked of the team that's going to be you know charged with with their care well it's a treat to be with you and um

[02:16:22] I hope it's been helpful and um I don't want to sound too Rose tinted glasses here but you know the fact is uh women are doing better and better with the following a diagnosis of breast cancer and early detection is really important um multimodality therapy as we've discussed is really important um the drugs are getting better and better for both early and for uh uh Advanced or stage four breast cancer so there's a lot of tremendous optimism uh in the care of breast cancer patients right now uh even as it remains a a Public Health

[02:16:55] Challenge and obviously a personal challenge for hundreds of thousands of women around the country great well thank you very much H thank you [Music]
