Benoît Arsenault is a research scientist focused on understanding how lifestyle and genetic factors contribute to cardiovascular disease risk. In this episode, the discussion casts a spotlight on Lp(a)—the single most important genetically-inherited trait when it comes to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Benoît explains the biology of Lp(a), how it’s inherited, the importance of measuring Lp(a) levels, and the diseases most associated with high Lp(a). He dives into data on the possible treatments for lowering Lp(a) such niacin, statins, and PCSK9 inhibitors, as well as the most exciting new potential therapeutic—antisense oligonucleotides.

We discuss:

0:29:52 - How statins lower LDL-cholesterol and why this doesn't work for an Lp(a)
0:35:20 - The structure of LDL-p and Lp(a) and what makes Lp(a) more atherogenic than an equivalent LDL particle
0:46:00 - The role of Lp(a) in aortic valve disease
0:52:24 - How greater numbers of Lp(a) particles are associated with increased risk of disease
0:56:56 - The genetics and inheritance of Lp(a) and how and when to measure Lp(a) levels
1:07:30 - Niacin and other proposed therapies to lower Lp(a), apoB, and CVD risk
1:22:46 - Why awareness of Lp(a) among physicians remains low despite the importance of managing risk factors for ASCVD
1:28:36 - The variability of disease in patients with high Lp(a)
1:37:45 - Diseases most associated with high Lp(a)
1:48:05 - The biology of PCSK9 protein, familial hypercholesterolemia, and the case for inhibiting PCSK9
2:04:58 - The variability in PCSK9 inhibitors’ ability to lower Lp(a) and why we need more research on individuals with high levels of Lp(a)
2:10:38 - Peter’s approach to managing patients with high Lp(a), and Benoît’s personal approach to managing his risk
2:13:33 - Antisense oligonucleotides—a potential new therapeutic for Lp(a)

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast about Lp(a):

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features a detailed discussion between Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Benoît Arsenault about lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease that affects approximately 20% of the population. The conversation covers the history of Lp(a) research, its biological mechanisms, measurement challenges, and current therapeutic approaches. They discuss how Lp(a) is one of the most common hereditary drivers of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, yet remains underrecognized in clinical practice.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Lp(a) was discovered in 1963 by Kari Berg [00:15:30]
- About 20% of the population has elevated Lp(a) levels [00:10:15]
- Lp(a) levels are determined primarily by genetics and production rate [00:45:20]
- Elevated Lp(a) increases risk for:
  * Aortic valve stenosis
  * Myocardial infarction
  * Peripheral artery disease
  * Ischemic stroke
  * Chronic kidney disease [01:15:30]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Measure Lp(a) at least once in lifetime [00:55:20]
- Aggressive management of other cardiovascular risk factors if Lp(a) is elevated [01:20:15]
- Consider early screening of aortic valve function [01:45:30]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Statins don't effectively lower Lp(a) [00:35:20]
- PCSK9 inhibitors can lower Lp(a) by ~30% [01:25:30]
- Niacin is not recommended for Lp(a) management [01:30:15]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Lp(a) should be measured in nanomoles/liter when possible [00:25:30]
- Alternative measurement in mg/dL is acceptable [00:26:15]
- High Lp(a) typically considered >50 mg/dL or >125 nmol/L [00:28:30]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"Lp(a) is hands down the most common hereditary driver of ASCVD" [01:05:30]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What is the optimal age to begin Lp(a) screening?
- How will antisense oligonucleotides change Lp(a) management?
- What determines the variable expression of Lp(a)-related disease in different individuals?
