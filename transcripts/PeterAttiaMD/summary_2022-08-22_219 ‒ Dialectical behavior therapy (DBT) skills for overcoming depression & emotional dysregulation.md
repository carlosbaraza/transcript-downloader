Shireen Rizvi is a Professor of Clinical Psychology & Psychiatry at Rutgers University, where she is also the Director of the Dialectical Behavior Therapy Clinic. This episode focuses on dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a skills-based technique which was originally developed to treat borderline personality disorder (BPD) & has since been adapted to treat depression & other mental health conditions, as well as to help people who have difficulty with emotional regulation & self-destructive behaviors. Shireen explains the origins of DBT & how its creator, Dr. Marsha Linehan, came to find a need for something beyond cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) when attempting to treat patients with suicidal behavior. From there, Shireen dives into how DBT works to resolve the apparent contradiction between self-acceptance & change to bring about positive changes in emotional regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, mindfulness, distress tolerance, & more. She also provides examples for how one can apply specific skills taught with DBT such as accessing the “wise mind,” applying radical acceptance, using the “DEAR MAN” technique, & utilizing an emotion regulation skill called “opposite action.” Finally, she explains how the tenets of DBT offer benefits to anyone, & she provides insights & resources for people wanting to further explore DBT.
