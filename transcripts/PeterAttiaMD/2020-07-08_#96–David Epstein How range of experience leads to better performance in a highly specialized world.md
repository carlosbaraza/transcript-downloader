## Description

Original release date: 3/9/20

In this episode, David Epstein, best-selling author of Range and The Sports Gene, discusses the evidence around the most effective ways to improve long-term performance and learning in our specialties, our sports, our careers, and our lives. David makes a compelling case that a range of experiences and skills are more likely to lead to expert performance compared to early specialization, and offers an in-depth critique of the much-publicized 10,000-Hour Rule. David also provides insights into our role as parents in the process of encouraging exposure to many things, the concepts of when to push them, when to give them space, and when to allow them to quit. Furthermore, David goes into many other fascinating topics such as the role of talent, genetics, and practice in reaching expert status, what differentiates a kind vs. wicked learning environment, the importance of “informal training”, and many case studies that suggest strategies for short-term success may not be best for long-term development.

We discuss:
-A shared interest in Ayrton Senna, and pondering the value in participating in sports [2:30];
-Examining the 10,000-Hour Rule, and the importance of questioning existing dogma [15:00];
-How the medical profession is affected by bad science, and the importance of understanding individual variation [28:00];
-David’s most surprising findings when writing The Sports Gene [35:45];
-Kind versus wicked learning environments [40:45];
-How and why strategies for short-term success may not be best for long-term development [47:30];
-Contrasting the success stories of Tiger Woods and Roger Federer—which path is more common, and an argument for diversified training and experiences [59:15];
-Is there an age-range or “critical window” during which exposure is necessary to reach a certain level of proficiency or mastery of a skill or knowledge? [1:14:00];
-How diversifying your interests and unraveling your identity from your speciality could lead to more enjoyment and actually improve performance in your speciality [1:22:15];
-The undervalued importance of “informal training” [1:29:15];
-Advice for increasing match quality in your work—where interests and abilities align—to optimize both job performance and fulfillment [1:41:15];
-Would David want his own son to attend college given the current state of higher education? [1:51:15];
-The role of a parent—how to encourage sampling, when to push them, when to allow them to quit, and insights from the childhoods of Tiger Woods and Wolfgang Mozart [1:55:45];
-The need for varied perspectives and the ability to improvise—insights gained from the Space Shuttle Challenger tragedy [2:08:45];
-How a diversified background and identity could be the difference in life or death—the Hotshot firefighters case study [2:22:15];
-David’s takeaways from the inspiring story of Frances Hesselbein [2:29:00]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast featuring David Epstein:

**1. Executive Summary**:
The discussion primarily focused on David Epstein's books "Range" and "The Sports Gene," exploring how generalists often triumph in specialized fields. Key themes included:
- The limitations of the "10,000 hours rule" and deliberate practice
- The importance of sampling various activities before specialization
- How learning environments can be classified as "kind" vs. "wicked"
- The role of match quality in career success and personal fulfillment

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Variance in practice hours required for mastery varies significantly by domain [00:25:30]
- Early specialization can lead to initial career advantages but later plateaus [01:45:06]
- The Heritage Family Study showed 1000% variation in training response among individuals [01:27:11]
- Perceptual motor skills don't necessarily correlate with faster reflexes in elite athletes [00:39:48]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Allow for sampling periods before specialization [01:55:44]
- Maintain broader training experiences for better skill transfer [01:37:40]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Consider match quality when choosing activities/careers [01:45:54]
- Balance specialized training with broader exposure [01:40:30]

**4. Notable Quotes**:
"We learn who we are in practice, not in theory" [01:44:23]

"Breadth of training predicts breadth of transfer" [01:44:58]

**5. Follow-up Questions**:
1. How can we better measure match quality in educational and professional settings?
2. What are the optimal sampling periods for different domains?
3. How can organizations better balance specialized expertise with generalist perspectives?
4. What role does technology play in changing the specialization vs. generalization debate?

The episode provides valuable insights into learning, skill development, and career planning, challenging conventional wisdom about early specialization while acknowledging the importance of both specialized and generalist approaches in different contexts.

[00:00:10] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode I guess this week is David Epstein David is the author of the best-selling book the sports gene and more recently ranged why generalists triumph in a specialized world which ironically makes him a specialist of generalists he was previously a science and investigative reporter at Pro

[00:01:05] Publica and prior to that a senior writer at Sports Illustrated I have followed David's work for some time have enjoyed his articles his books and reached out to him several months ago asking to interview him even though I had already heard him on a couple of other podcasts that frankly I thought did a great job but I just knew there was more I wanted to explore with him so of course if you've heard David another podcast I wouldn't let that discourage you from listening to him here we go into in my opinion sort of a broader deeper discussion that sort of enabled by hour-long format we talked about a lot of things but I think at the root of it it's basically trying to get a better understanding of how we can improve our own performance and perhaps you can see we get into a lot of stuff around kids but you know as parents how do we manage the exposure of our kids to various things I think anyone listening to this who is a parent obviously feels pretty strongly about giving their kids the best chance at finding something they love and doing well at it there are so many things we come and doing this podcast that are just fascinating beyond belief including a really good explanation of why the 10,000 hour rule that most people take for granted is essentially an axiom or Dogma ie that you know 10,000 hours of deliberate practice is what is required for mastery and greatness and I

[00:02:15] David goes into a great explanation of why that's probably completely nonsense which is not to say that deliberate practice is not incredibly important but to break it down to something as simple as ten thousand hours is almost assuredly incorrect so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with

[00:02:30] David Epstein thank you so much for coming it's a pleasure thanks for having me your work has been something I followed for quite a long time now and even before your most recent book came out just on the basis of the book you wrote was it in 2013 that's right yeah just on the basis of that book people had always said you got an interview and I was always like yeah yeah I know I know I know I know and then the new book comes out it's like well now there's no excuse not to so and I guess it's tough for you because you have this new book and everybody was talking about it but I kind of want to talk about the old one too if that's okay whatever you want we can talk about something other than my books if you want we have a lot to talk about actually because I learned a number of things about you in getting ready to sit down today but somehow it escaped me that you were a fan of Ayrton Senna yeah

[00:03:20] I mean first of all one of the all-time great sports documentaries of people have seen Senna but I used to follow racing and just I loved racing in general like if you put two paper boats on a pond you know I was interested basically and then as I learned about him and his start in karting and the different types of racing he did the fact that he was a good gymnast as a young guy that he basically tried to retire from racing at one point you know that he was also very quietly charitable and I think I think kind of a sensitive soul in a lot of ways and obviously a very traumatic story and I think the greatest definite one driver ever and so just a lot of I don't really as much as you so I'm kind of cautious saying anything but yeah I think all those things are really interesting and resonant and so last week I went to the beach and was with my kids and the two older kids were in the water so just me and the toddler who's - who's actually named after

[00:04:10] Sennett his name is IRA thon and then these other two boys came up and started playing and so then I'm sort of overseeing a playgroup basically one of mine and two others and for like 20 minutes this is going on and then the mother of these two other boys comes up and she's thanking me or whatever playing with them and I can sense her

[00:04:29] Brazilian accent I said oh are you Brazilian she says yeah and I said oh great blah blah we get chatting and I can't talk to somebody who's Brazilian for more than five minutes without of course asking them do you remember when Senna died and blah blah and I'm still waiting for the exception to this to happen it's never happened yet where that person doesn't immediately transform into oh my god

[00:04:50] Senna is the greatest manifestation representation of Brazil it was the saddest day of my life when he died and this woman would have been 7 when he died and our nanny also Brazilian same thing was like for when Senna died but it's seared in her mind so I'm talking driver person at rest it doesn't matter any time I meet someone from Brazil we talked about Senna and it is without exception they speak of him with a reverence that I don't think Americans can relate to there is no athlete we talk about there's no politician there's no scientist we can speak about in the way of Brazilian talks about Senna it's amazing so it sounds like but people here certain generation might think of where they were when Kennedy or Martin

[00:05:32] Luther King were assassinated or something like that it's absolutely that way because of course everybody in Brazil was watching f1 so the world stopped every Sunday to watch the race so now you take everybody is there stopping to watch your guy doing this thing and then you see this person die but unlike maybe with say JFK where yes anybody who was old enough at that moment would remember it I don't even think that they can speak about JFK the way with as much love or reverence as they do Senna so it's kind of amazing to me and humbling that's interesting it's obviously we have Ali as the first person would come to mind but in his day a lot of people hated him it's a lot of athletes like him I think they become beloved once they're sort of older and non-threatening feeling and so a lot of people who love them don't actually really know what it was like for them at the time but that's fascinating and I think his reputation I think a lot of the he turned out after Senna died that he had been doing like a lot of charity that people didn't even know about with no no fanfare whatsoever and so I think his legacy was that's amazing that's not very very good that's right very few people no about how much he did for for the people in Brazil and how seriously he took his position of he came from privilege came from a wealthy family achieved this unbelievable success and people loved this humility that he had that because remember it's not like he was the first Brazilian f1 champion in

[00:06:58] Fittipaldi was a two-time champion Nelson Piquet a three-time champion who by the way Senna won his first championship the year after PK won his last so it's like a complete overlap with another but they don't even belong in the same sentence for most Brazilians in fact I asked this question of almost everybody as well which is how does he compare to Pele and they're like oh it was great but no really oh absolutely yeah yeah it's really kind of amazing yeah I guess that's the most telling question you could ask

[00:07:28] Raziel probably yeah I'll be going for my first time actually to Sao Paulo soon to watch an f1 race and to go and I want to be able to visit the memorial where he was buried and go to the foundation and stuff like that how did you get so interested in him I don't do anything in moderation I think is what kind of comes down to and I've always loved and been attracted to people that are incredibly passionate and great at what they do and I do think that his perfectionism well I'll take a step back and say I was probably attracted to things about him that I didn't appreciate the pathology in at the time so I do think that his desire to win probably also killed him and I think that the sharpness of that edge I probably found incredibly appealing in a way that almost maybe speaks to my own demons and I think that's probably true of a lot of people

[00:08:20] I don't think I'm unique in that so I just remember one of the things I remember loving about him during his career was how much he cared about the engine and what was going on with the car and the setup and the time he would spend with the mechanics mean it was always telling to me that the Honda mechanics loved him I mean just loved him you'd have some guys that would show up they would drive and they would leave but not Senna like he could spend the entire night in the garage mation a ting over every minut detail of the car so it's just this sort of incredible degree of perfectionism all so I do think that there was just a certain there were just things that he did that to this day can't be explained

[00:08:59] I think his qualifying session in 1988 at Monaco there is no explanation for what he did that day I'm sure you're familiar with it just for the listener Monaco is a very short circuit so in a short circuit the difference between qualifying times should be tenths of seconds hundredths of seconds his teammate that year meaning someone driving the exact same car which they had the best car in the field was Alain Prost who was himself a three-time world champion at the time unbelievable driver some would argue one of the more underrated drivers ever

[00:09:30] Senna out qualified him by a second and a half a second and a half on Monaco in a quali might as well be a day it's like winning 100 meters in the Olympics by a second and a half that's exactly right it's like even Usain Bolt at his most dominant couldn't win a race by a second even though there's no actual onboard footage of Senna during that quali lap because he was already on pole so I don't think the network's were even paying attention to his very last quali lap which why would he try to go any faster he'd already secured pole but when you watch Senna at Monaco over and over again which is one of the most demanding circuits because of how tight it is I have my kids watch these videos because I'm like I don't think you guys understand you think daddy drives a race car and that's fun because he can go fast but I want you to see what the best in the world is seeing in real time because we can't do this humans can't do what he's doing the other sort of extension to that story that speaks to this sort of love I have is the tormented nature of this which is what most people don't realize is he qualifies first in Monaco or what most people I think have forgotten is he qualifies first from Monaco in 1988 by literally a second and a half as the race is going on and on and on he has built up such a lead he almost has a lap lead over the field with a very short duration to go in the race I don't remember how many laughs I think like maybe six to ten laps to go he could basically stop get out of his car get back in it and still win the race but he's pushing very hard he's pushing so hard that he actually crashed he is disgusted with himself he gets out of the car literally leaves go straight to his home in Monaco doesn't speak with anybody for days and to me this is a guy for whom it's not about winning yeah yeah this actually gets to something you said I could be dead grass tips I'm gonna make a Multi multi jump let's do it something I've been thinking about that I used to think about a lot and then came up recently was at a certain point when I was at Sports Illustrated and I was doing reporting on doping and

[00:11:32] I would get a lot of reader feedback of why are you reporting on this you sort of a killjoy that kind of stuff I took it seriously and started thinking about should I be doing this what's the value that comes out of sport and somehow I landed on this book called the grasshopper by a Canadian philosopher named Bernard suits and it's called the grasshopper because it's sort of a inversion of this Aesop fable where there's a grasshopper who's playing games all summer and while the ant is storing up food in the summer and then come winter the grasshopper doesn't have any food in the end does and the grasshopper goes to hand and ask for some food the ants says no you were playing well you should have been collecting food and so moral is kind of obvious but in suits there had been this philosophical debate that was supposed to be settled by Vidkun Stein about is there any necessary and sufficient core of sports and games and he said no he said nope absolutely there's not and suits in writing this book the grasshopper the grasshopper is a character who's playing these games and his disciples are scum saying you should be storing food you're gonna die and he says no this is who I am I understand what's coming but this is the best thing I can be doing is endeavor for the love of what he was doing and suit says there is a core to all sports and games and it's the voluntary acceptance of unnecessary obstacles which I thought was kind of amazing and he talks about what he calls the looser attitude which is the attitude you adopt when you get involved in these things which i think is kind of a love of difficulty essentially and I think he sort of United something Aristotle had these two he put actions into two categories one was Kinesis which is like build a house you're doing it for the end and the other was in ner gaya which is something like philosophical contemplation you're doing it for the doing not for the end and he said these two things have to be separate and I think what one of the things suits was saying was in ports and games these things are united there is an end that you're going for but the love of difficulty in the middle is what's really important and you're always doing something you're intentionally doing something inefficient right like you could walk a ball and put it into a goal that would be the most efficient way to do it or you could cut across the track and get there faster but you're intentionally engineering an inefficiency in order to facilitate a certain experience I'm sure

[00:13:42] Santa had that level of difficulty and one of the things that's a tied to my own stuff but one of the reasons I think about it is to me I don't know that readers would say this but to me one of the major themes of my new book is that sometimes the things you can do to cause the most rapid apparent short-term progress can undermine long-term development and that actually you don't always want to be as efficient as possible and I think that's very much embodied in this love of difficulty in sports and games where you are intentionally engineering in inefficiency in order to facilitate an experience that you hope as some value and some learning so sorry that was my multi jump no that is so true I think that actually in one sort of story captures the essence of the greatness we see in sports which is as you said it has to have a struggle in it it's not interesting if there's no struggle but it's in service of some destination that can be quite arbitrary by the way I mean racecar driving happens to be one of the less arbitrary ones going fast seems somewhat understandable in an eight mountaineering seems somewhat understandable and innate get to the top but many sports like basketball and football are kind of arbitrary and what we're asking people to do think of baseball it's like bananas if you were just watching it with no sense of the conceptual structure would look ridiculous like why doesn't the guy just stay at home play there that's funny well before we get to your new book because there are so many questions I have on that theme both personally and then with respect to my profession and then even more broadly I do want to go back to the gene because I remember when the book came out I think it came out on the heels of an article you had written in Sports Illustrated correct wow I'm surprised you remember that yeah the sports gene yet yeah it did yeah I want to confess something really quick this nobody really calls me on is I wrote that article in Sports Illustrated it passed fact-checking in Sports

[00:15:28] Illustrated because when the fact checkers call back the scientists they said all this is true this is true but then after a year of before my books the first year I tried just read ten journal articles a day every day for the first year no writing and having done that for the year researching the sports gene I realized that while I had quoted these scientists appropriately some of them had told me things that could not be concluded from their data and so I cited my own article as one that was mistaken but nobody really called me on that but that's I think if you're writing about science something you're writing about is gonna be wrong so you have to kind of be ready for that well it's so funny you bring this up so Bob Kaplan who's my head of research we are in the process now of going through the fact-checking for this book that I've been painfully and slowly working on for more time than

[00:16:10] I care to admit and what we've realized is he can't be the fact checker nor can I because it's not just facts we're checking its interpretation and we are already so biased by our view on this so we actually have another one of our analysts doing the fact-checking but we specifically refer to it as fact + interpretation in fact + interpretation which turns out to be really a long process and a very challenging process because you do I mean I've done this a handful of times where you pull up one of the citation classics in medicine or science that people have referenced so many times it's been triply referenced internally to the point where I don't think the people are referencing it anymore even know what the paper says let alone what it's citing a telephone game of citation it's unbelievable and the few times I've had our team extract from those papers

[00:17:02] I've been mortified at how wrong they are which again they're not necessarily orthogonal II wrong but they've missed so many things like it's like oh well of course this so-and-so does such and such and such and such well let's go back and look wait a minute you realize that was in one really really really bad experiment in mice in which you could never make that inference into another mammal and now yet it's taken as sort of a fact I have to say not that that's good but I have noticed that that sort of thing provides opportunities for people like me where I'll go and read the original research of things that have just been at the core of other best-selling book it's kind of a great if you're willing to do it it's sort of a competitive advantage you know it gives an opportunity not that I want people to be citing things wrongly but

[00:17:45] I think you're totally right I started as a fact checker at Sports Illustrated and that's where you realize how many ways there are to go wrong are you looking for any more work right now no no I was happy to get out of my fact-checking days I'm in my post book never again phase which I was in before but that's where I am right now no but yeah I hired independent fact checkers also and that doesn't mean there aren't things that are wrong or interpretations that are wrong but it certainly certainly cuts it down compared to I think most books probably have no effect checking at all yeah I'm super paranoid about it because I also realized that we can't catch them all that's the difference between a blog post in a book is and I've written more blog post and

[00:18:20] I'll never be able to count and the good news is the week it comes out someone's smarter than you is gonna catch something that you did wrong and you're like oh my god yeah totally right thank you for that boom I can change it I can't do that with a book and that is crippling me yeah I mean you can do small stuff for second printings and things like that but it's not as easy right it doesn't happen right away and if it will especially if it's the interpretation it's one thing if you get a fact wrong when you start to interpret something incorrectly and you come around it's very difficult to unwind that definitely and if you're gonna change yeah as I learned this time the both of my books there are 352 pages I guess if you count the front and back and because they get printed in sets of 16 so everything has to fit to a multiple of 16 including the index and the citations and everything so if you have to change something major like an interpretation where it's not one sentence if you're gonna mess up two-page flow not so dude you're making some unhappy folks you alluded to something there which is the opportunity to go back and look at something that people have sort of taken as dogma and questioning it and in many ways that's a big part of what the gene does and what your current book does I'll share with you sort of my bias coming into this discuss this discussion with us per se but but sort of this theme which is so

[00:19:35] Daniel Coyle wrote a book in 2009 called the talent code and before that there were a number of other books and pieces of literature on that subject matter and I was obsessed with this I was obsessed with this idea of how can one be great obsessed with it even as a child and certainly when I was doing my surgical training I really remember spending lots of time reading literature on technically achieving mastery like what does it mean to be a great musician or a great surgeon or a great athlete things where there's some sort of dexterity and skill required that goes beyond just thinking and cognitive prowess and so I would say I completely bought this idea that deliberate practice is the only thing that matters and I think a lot of people sort of have taken that to be the case what made you question that in the first place or did you not question that and instead stumbled organically into questioning that I did not question it in the first place and I should say

[00:20:33] Dan's a friend and I'm a big fan of his writing also and yeah I did not question it in fact if you saw my book proposal for the sports gene the talen code in the book proposal sometimes you do a section that I don't know if you had to do this or not but other books there looks like yes yes yes I skipped that part for my second proposal but in the first one I had to do it and talent code was one of the ones that I said it was going to be like and obviously I would say for the casual reader it looks like they're actually diametrically opposed in many ways and I don't see them as diametrically opposed but there are certainly some differences and it was probably when I went back and started looking at some of the original literature the 10,000 hours rule was who was I to question that I mean the one good thing is I was doing my past training to be a scientist and I was like living in a tent in the Arctic when

[00:21:18] I decided for sure to become a writer so I knew I should leverage that background of I was in the geological sciences which are pretty methodologically rigorous I would say as the sciences go and so I decided to go look at these original papers if I'm gonna study them and I come across the first this so-called 10,000 hour study that the scientist who wrote it wouldn't call it that but this was with violinist violinist you know 30 violinists famous music academy in Berlin split into three groups the top ten who were deemed to potentially be international soloists practiced in deliberate practice is highly focused error correction focused practice on average 10,000 hours by the age of 20 the first thing I noticed was that there were no measures of variance reported in the study which is not something when I was a grad student that one could have gotten away with reporting no measures of variance so I was explained that some folks might not even know what that means so likely use an example so if you look at a table and it's is this person practiced this many hours this many hours this many hours what was missing in that description first of all no range so several of the books and the paper wrote that there was complete correspondence between the number of hours of practice and what group someone fell into and I said well I can't tell that from this data like maybe someone in the lowest group actually practiced more than someone in the highest group but you haven't included the range of practice hours or the standard deviations of practice hours what is the individual variation anytime you take an average it could be that nobody practice 10,000 hours it could be that somebody practiced a hundred thousand hours and a bunch of people were much less so sort of like what's my average your average and Bill Gates average wealth sure right sometimes averages can be wildly mislead that's right I mean so for example in the chess literature takes 11,000 53 hours on average to reach international master status so 10,000 hours would be low that's one level down from

[00:23:02] Grandmaster but some people have made it in 3000 hours and some people finished a study at 25000 they still hadn't made it so we don't really know where their end point is so you can tell someone well it takes 11,000 53 hours on average to reach international master status but doesn't tell you anything about the breadth of actual skill acquisition so how is that possible by the way I mean I can't imagine looking at a paper that wouldn't at a minimum include a standard deviation for that type of calculation don't know okay so eventually I organized and noticed that the most famous researcher on that paper who I think has done some very interesting work especially in the area of memory some work that I myself have tried to incorporate into things I do so but I noticed that he was in a lot of his work saying there's no such thing as talent and doesn't matter just pick any random thing and you'll be great at it you know a provided you put the word right right exactly that it doesn't matter what you match with and I noticed he was citing a lot of physiology papers that I knew something about like sports physiology papers and not like you said not in the way the interpretation it was kind of like these secondary interpretations telephone games stuff that and so I organized a panel at the American

[00:24:04] College of Sports Medicine invited him because and this was I thought a problem he was citing a lot of their papers his work Andres Erickson was super influential in expertise I think that 10,000 hours papers clearly the most influential paper ever in the development of expertise but they weren't talking to each other so I organized this panel and in that a researcher stood up I'm Tim Lightfoot and asked what's the variance around that 10,000 hours and he said well that doesn't really matter because the people were actually inconsistent on multiple retrospective recalls because what they did is they just asked for retrospective recall and then had the performers keep a diary for a week and then extrapolated it basically which by the way don't even get me started on the the noise that's introduced by both of those decisions right there was just a replication attempt by the way last month it published and it failed but we can talk about that if you want but in that there was actually in the new replication attempt there was someone at 4,000 hours who got to the highest group and someone 11,000 hours who was still in the lowest group but anyway so he asked what's the variance around that 10,000 hours and

[00:25:02] Ericsson says he said first of all there was inconsistent recall and so Tim says yeah a lot of us struggle with imperfect data but we still put measures of variance and so under says well that'll be like more valid when we have video diaries and we can really track it because we're not being that precise anyway and he says again we all struggle with imperfect data but we include measures of variance was it and then he asked so what was it he says I don't know I'd have to go look back and so

[00:25:30] Lightfoot says definitely more than 500 and that's where we leave it and then I think two years ago something a couple years ago Ericsson did publish measures of variance and turns out there was enormous variance not only was their enormous variance in the original paper the papers from 1993 and it was three or four years ago that he finally published the variance made clear that their conclusions were wrong that there was not complete correspondence between the number of practice hours and the group that someone was in well I think that's sort of where I'm going with this question which is you can't even make an observation of statistical significance without variance so I don't really understand what the paper is saying this is the first thing when I was reading it and saying something's not right here and so then I started asking these very basic questions because I'd been Athene

[00:26:13] I'd gone from being like the worst walk-on on my college team to being like a university record holder so I'm like yeah maybe if I had trained even more would have been even better and that probably is true but but I was I was like oh okay so there is no such thing as Talent I was convinced for a while and then when I started seeing this I started asking the very basic questions like okay in my third year of training I could break the Women's World Record so there has to be at least some basic genetic difference because I haven't worked harder and the women who are pros by any stretch of the imagination and so

[00:26:43] I said okay let's start with that basic question on contact sort of some of the I shouldn't call them the 10,000 hours researchers because they kind of disavowed that but the deliberate practice framework and I remember contacting one and saying wouldn't you agree that a man and a woman who practiced the same like the man has advantages which is why we separate sexes and sports and she's sort of hedged and said maybe not if they all trained the same really and so she sent me a paper saying in fact we think this applies to other organisms if you look at this paper about racing dogs you'll see that they practice the best ones in the highest class practice about the equivalent to their lifespan of 10,000 hours and so

[00:27:23] I'm reading this and I start reading all the citations and one of them notes that like half of these dogs have what is otherwise an incredibly rare myostatin mutation let me pause for a moan explain to the listener what myostatin mutations are so if you knock out the myostatin gene you look like a bodybuilder myostatin is a gene that inhibits muscle growth and there are lots of mile statin mutants out there that I'll have hypo functioning myostatin and therefore super muscular yeah and so racing readers had been they didn't know about the gene but they were breeding for fact they were clearly selecting for this trait yeah yeah and what they wanted was a single myostatin if you get two then you have a bully whippet and google that it's pretty cool to see bully what other thing probably can't even move it's so big right so they want the single mutation yeah and so I'm like okay listen these dogs this doesn't even mean anything so I wasn't gonna like use this study or anything but I just started saying these people aren't reading the primary stuff that they're citing or they're not tracking the references back and so I started to have doubts is this a a broader problem with non experimental science I think so because we do the same dumb thing in medicine by the way people sort of think of medicine which we're gonna get to in spades as it's so rigorous and yeah sometimes medicine does get to leverage the scientific method and actually get to do what Francis Bacon talked about but a lot of times you don't I mean when you think of some of the most important public health measures that are out there oftentimes they are based on exactly the type of inference you're being appropriately critical of which is observational have selected range restricted which I can't wait you talk about this so eloquently that I cannot wait to have you go off on your tangent so bucks whatever rant on that problem but these are huge issues yeah yeah I mean that was the other thing I don't know if I should skip to range restriction well let's start with medicine so I wrote this one article when I was at Pro Publica called when evidence says no and doctors say yes and

[00:29:11] I should say I love the medical profession I think it's filled with a variety of people like any profession but a lot of people who really care and got into the profession because they want to do something that is challenging and useful but also there's like a lot of poor science and a lot of things that continue to be done even once evidence shows they don't work anymore what Mike

[00:29:29] Joyner at the Mayo Clinic always calls bio plausible something that clearly makes sense it definitely should work it's just that when somebody does like a randomized controlled trial it doesn't you probably saw the finished study of partial arthroscopic meniscus repair I think there's a lot of Devils in the details that said it was interesting they gave some people sham surgery where they basically made an incision banged around like they perform surgery and sent them a physical therapy and they did as well as the people who are getting the surgery which is mind-boggling because everyone's doing something that seems like it has to work someone's got a knee pain you bring them in you give them imaging they've got a tear fix it how could that not work then

[00:30:04] I guess it turns out that some huge number of people have incidental tear that doesn't have anything to do with the knee pain the meniscal tear is a huge thorn in the side of the orthopedic specialty because frankly I don't know the answer I mean my intuition is that that's a procedure that has probably done far too much but it's also probably a procedure that if you knew how to select the right patients you could probably make a difference but because we don't we end up applying the tool far too broadly and we dilute the outcome

[00:30:31] I'll give you a much more specific example that is so nerdy but there's a drug called ezetimibe or zetia which blocks cholesterol reabsorption so the body makes a ton of cholesterol virtually all the cholesterol in the body is made by the body and it gets recirculated throughout the body well part of this recirculation pathway requires that cholesterol be dumped into along with bile into the gut and then in your gut you can reabsorb it and the body has a way to regulate how much of that's happening but it turns out there's a drug that blocks this thing called the niemann-pick see one like one transporter that drags drawback in now when that drug is given in mono therapy it lowers cholesterol but not that much and it doesn't save lives so it's not a drug that's really in fact it's absolutely therefore not considered a first-line agent and it's never considered a something that should be used in isolation now when you give it with a statin turns out it lowers cholesterol and it reduces events so the things that you care about the actual hard outcomes change and it's not just the statin correct that's right because you can compare it to statin versus statin alone so I have probably kind of a contrarian view on this which is I actually think this drug alone would work if you actually only gave it to people who were hyper absorbers but that's never been done because we can measure how much absorption capacity a person has but that's that kind of advanced measurement you wouldn't normally do that in a clinical setting but if you select for patients who have mega amounts of absorption it's certainly possible that those patients so I don't know the answer to this and only if a trial was done testing that way could you get it but I do think that this problem exists in medicine which is you dilute by taking such a heterogeneous population to test an intervention on and you're therefore not really powered to detect an effect because in your power calculation you're using the entire population as your denominator and really it probably needs to be a subset and so my intuition is that's probably the case with some of these procedures like miniscule repairs which still offers no help to you or I right now if we're having knee pain with an MRI that shows a miniscule tear I actually don't know the answer in that setting that's interesting on so many levels the first is what you're talking about with absorption is this sort of lesson that there's huge individual variation and that stuff staggering variation by the way I measure absorption synthesis in every single patient non-negotiable no questions asked and I am constantly amazed at how much variation exists of it basically three variables are determining this right it's sort of how much do you make how much do you absorb and how much do you clear out a circulation with the LDL receptor and the variation is it's overwhelming and yet it's amazing to me that our profession looks at just one metric which is how much LDL cholesterol is there and it's gonna be the basis for treatment it strikes me as flying without instruments and deciding you only get to look at the horizon that's interesting that gets it two things I've one remember first this idea of the McNamara fell so you've heard of named after the Secretary of

[00:33:28] Defense during Vietnam which is he said are we winning the war are we losing let's use something measurable our bodies versus their bodies and since we're always winning by that metric said okay we're winning obviously ignoring a lot of other important what's the collateral damage and yeah yeah so it's like we often deem things important because they're easily measuring them because they're important but that individual variation gets to another thing that got me interested that sort of caused the sports gene to be very different from my proposal which was underlying the 10,000 hours were which is actually called the deliberate practice framework C and Ericsson would not call the 10,000 hours rule there is something called the monotonic benefits assumption and essentially if you have two people have never done something for every equal unit of practice they should progress exactly the same amount so it's everyone's practice response is the same is one of the assumptions underlying it and I start how can that be it's not to say it's not would be an interesting conclusion rather but how could that even be the null hypothesis it seems so counterintuitive I don't know does it it might be if people started from zero I'm not sure what I would think if they would progress exactly the same or not but then people have done those studies you know meaning if we took a hundred people who have never spoken Spanish and we gave them Spanish lessons give me the evidence that if that were the case wouldn't we see much more homogeneity in schools I would think I mean Ericsson would make the argument that well some of those kids are engaged in some of them aren't or maybe some of them had more practice before so I think to really evaluate this you have to get some skill that nobody else has tried before that these people haven't done at all because who knows what they bring to school all sorts of other stuff but there are studies like that where people who are sedentary do the exact same exercise one of the famous ones called the Heritage family study where every member of two generations of 98 families it's totally sedentary put on six months of identical cycling training and the range of variation was like a thousand percent doing identical training identical training and you can see things like the military does this in people learning sort of perceptual motor skills for air traffic controller simulations and at very simple simulations actually it's kind of like that like they converge if very simple you just have to see that one planes coming move one off the runway and then it becomes about like how fast can you basically just move the mouse when you're doing a simulation but as it gets more complex people start diverging with more practice and so that monotonic benefits assumption I could find no evidence of it it's like never shown up in a study of anything unless it's an extremely simple task that everyone master is very very quickly and so again I was sort of saying that average is just obscuring individual variation so I keep preventing you from talking about this because I can't stop asking those other questions but when you look at the title to sports gene the assumption would be oh this is a book that explores the notion that a great athlete is genetically gifted Michael

[00:36:09] Jordan is Michael Jordan because he clearly has a set of genes that separate him from the rest of us and that's probably a bad example because it's so extreme but talk to me about some of the things that you found in that book that surprised you and there were certain elements at that book that didn't get that much attention by the way that I in retrospect thought I'm surprised more people didn't fixate on that thing like

[00:36:28] I don't know did it surprise you what people drew out of that book is the most important insights yeah yeah I didn't think the thing that people were gonna find the most controversial was the 10,000 hour rule to be quite honest I didn't I guess I didn't realize how I wouldn't grain that is in our psyche yeah and that people were actually planning certain training plans soccer teams to ten thousand hours on the dot and the thing that was the most important to me I tried to write a book about one of my closest friends and former training partner dropped dead at the end of a mile race he was like one of the top-ranked guys in his age group in the country young Jamaican guy who's gonna be the first in his family to go to college all these things and that kind of threw me for a loop and anyway I got his family to sign a waiver allowing me to gather up his medical records and turn out he had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy so a textbook case misdiagnosed cuz not easy to diagnose if he'd had a good family history turned out he probably clearly had a relative who it's like I went started going to meetings for families that think they have HCM in their family and they'd say well we're not really sure but cousin

[00:37:24] Jimmy died in the pool he was a varsity swimmer and like Uncle Fred was in a one-car accident like all right these might be cardiac arrest and I wanted to write a book when the main reasons I got off the science Trek so I wanted to write about sudden cardiac death and athletes and that's what I tried to pitch a first book on but I I didn't have the professional capital at the time and couldn't sell it but there's a sec of that that I smuggled into one of the chapters in the sports gene which is the most personally important thing to me that I don't think I got asked about one time ever so I don't know if that's surprising or not it just is the most surprising findings of the book to me where things like I still don't know how to summarize the blog but that things that I assumed were genetic like the reflexes it takes 200 mile-per-hour fastball turn out not to be the fact that Major League Baseball players don't have faster reflexes that was a surprise to me I assume they did the same is true by the way for Formula One drivers is it yeah so it turns out oh that makes sense perceptual motor skill right they're probably using cues like the changing size of something in there well one of my favorite exercises that you can see when you compare so if you put a novice next to Lewis Hamilton in a simulator even adjusting for the speed at which things are moving you won't be blown away at where Lewis's eyes are at every moment that he is driving how far ahead he is able to see what's happening so a few weeks ago I was on the track and in an effort to really force this type of learning we have one camera that is actually looking directly at me one camera that is looking directly at the road and capturing all of the telemetry and then I sit with my coach and we review these two side-by-side because what I'm working very hard to overcome is the desire to narrow my field to where I'm driving and when you're going fast that's innate you don't want to be looking somewhere way down the road you're worried about falling off the road right now but you can't do that so that's the thing that they've been able to train to do it's not that they're going faster sorry that's what they have faster reflexes which I can remember when I first was shown these data I was like looking at setup you think he has the fastest reflexes on the planet right right once you start reading about perceptual motor skills it makes perfect sense because any activity that's happening too fast I mean the things they have to do are too fast for any human reven if they did have were the top 0.01% of human reflexes it wouldn't be fast enough so in boxing there was this study I came across doing the sports gene where these someone I don't even know if they were doctors or scientist did some tests of

[00:39:48] Muhammad Ali I think that what they were trying to show is that even this brilliant black man has slower than nor processing speed in his brain or something and so they reported his they would have him like throwing a punch and response to a light or something like that and they were saying like look it's lower than average and then then someone said that they were testing it wrong if you subtract the delay for whatever cue they were giving he actually from first perceptible motion to full extension it was like 150 milliseconds which is extremely fast but that means when he's throwing a punch also I think other people throw punches that fast I don't think was I can a lone outlier for that it's faster than the minimum human reaction time which is a fifth of a second just to see that something's in front of you and for that message to get your muscles not to dodge and so you literally have to be saying things before they happen or else you get hit by every punch of course his genius at disguising what he was doing it was an attempt to confound people's ability to see the future and so anything I think that's happening at that speed those aren't skills that anyone comes with there might be things that facilitate you downloading that software but it doesn't doesn't come with the machine you talked about kind versus

[00:40:55] Wieck and I'm jumping between these books I think we're just gonna end up doing that by the way I really want to talk about the gene but now I can't stop but help moving so maybe use that example in boxing as an example is boxing a kind sport or is it a wicked sport and explain what those two distinctions mean yeah kind and wicked are so those are terms coined by the psychologist Robin Hogarth in a kind learning environment he was trying to reconcile this issue in psychology in the study of expertise about why some people who studied experts saw them get better and better and better with very narrow experience and some people saw them not get better sometimes get worse or get more confident and not get better like what was the difference and it turns out that the difference often has a lot to do with one the way they're training but also the environment that they are training in and a kind learning environment is one where all your information is clear the next steps and goals are totally clear work tomorrow will look like work yesterday patterns recur and whenever you do something you get feedback that is immediate and fully accurate on the other end of the spectrum so golf golf is a really kind learning environment yeah because the ball is never actually moving towards you you're always starting with a static ball and there are almost a finite number of things that you can see in that position and there's no rush and you get automatic and real pleasure your feedback every time something happens so

[00:42:14] I think some of the people who study golf characterize it is like almost industrial tasks in the sense that part of what you're doing is trying to do a similar things over and over with as little deviation as possible archery which is my obsession a very kind learning environment absolutelly kind yeah absolutely and a wicked learning environment on the other hand is you might not know exactly what you're supposed to do next you might not even know the goal human behavior might be involved there baby time pressure and work next year might not look like work last year and importantly you don't always get automatic feedback and sometimes when you get feedback it's delayed and sometimes it's inaccurate I wasn't the there's actually a medical example that another story you're gonna tell yeah which is this doctor at this

[00:42:54] New York doctor who got wealthy and famous because he could miraculously by palpating patients tongues are feeling around their tongue with his hands before they showed any symptoms he could predict they would get typhoid and he was right over and over and over again and one of his colleagues later observed using only his hands he was a more productive carrier of typhoid than even typhoid mary so he was giving people typhoid by touching their tongues and getting the feedback that he was an amazing predictor and so I would do it over so so he was the feedback was reinforcing the wrong lesson so I wouldn't say most of us are in that wicked of a situation either but what Hogarth was doing was setting up this spectrum of of learning what do you think is a bigger wickedness within the wicked environment because there are really at least two variables that I think make that type of learning environment challenging the first is the number of scenarios you can face and the unpredictability of them so in archery the goal of archery actually is to make every single shot identical non-negotiable so everything from the way you stand to the way your shoulder sits to the way the release sits we pay tremendous attention to the feeling of the string on the nose and the feeling of the string and the corner of the mouth I mean it's you're trying to reproduce the same thing ever in everyone so part of it is well in tennis for example there are an infinite number of ways that you could be standing and your opponent could be standing and the ball could be coming with this spin versus that's been or maybe not infinite but there's so many more variables the second piece is this delay between feedback and rial which anybody who's ever tried to talk when they can't hear themselves or when there's a delay realizes how much feedback matters which of those two do you think is more important in creating that environment I think delayed feedback is usually a killer I think that the changing scenarios is easier to accommodate with broader training in some ways so this is classic psychology finding that can be summarized as breadth of training predicts breadth of transfer transfer is and by the way I'd say tennis is definitely more on the wicked end than golf but I would still not yeah still girths than most of us in the knowledge economy are playing

[00:44:58] Martian tennis you see some people playing nobody's told you the rules you have to deduce them and by the way they can change without notice and so breadth of training predicts breadth of transfer transfers the term psychologists use to mean your ability to take skills and knowledge and apply them to a situation you haven't quite seen before it might be similar but something's a little different and what predicts your ability to do that is how broad your training was if your trainings broad it forces you instead of expecting the same thing over and over to build these sort of flexible conceptual frameworks that you can bend when you see a new problem instead of just doing the same thing over and over so I think you can mitigate that with the right kind of training the delayed feedback that really screws people up in studies where people have to sort of drive remote-controlled things if they build in a delay between what they do in the movement it'll completely screws them up all the way to there's some interesting studies of software project managers there's this famous essay I had to cut like 20 or 30,000 words from the book this was something I had in there called the mythical man-month and it's an essay by this guy fred brooks who was like head of research at microsoft and he went on to found the computer science department the university of north carolina and what he meant by the mythical man-month was he had noticed that when project managers when their projects got behind in software if they were complicated they would start adding more person power adding more man or woman power to the team and that would cause the project to become more late and so Brooks's law is if you add people to an already late software project it will become more late in proportion to like how many people you add and that's because there was a delay between those people adding to the team they needed to be assimilated and managers never learned that lesson because of the delay and so they keep doing the same thing over and over and over and a couple of researchers sort of followed up on them more recently and call this the experience trap where these project managers they come up with simpler projects where adding people does help it get done faster because they can right away figure out what to do and then they get promoted and promoted and end up with more complicated projects and in those cases they do the same thing and bring people on and they never learn about the assimilation delay that it takes so these researchers were saying we need to start telling them this is the time between you bringing someone on and them making a positive impact but they never learn that lesson because of the feedback delay so I think that's from the motor skills up to these much more sort of management kind of softer skills that the feedback delay is really difficult that concept ever since I read about it and you're writing I sort of look at the world a bit differently now

[00:47:23] I actually think of that question specifically I'm like how kind is this how wicked is this right that's what happened when I was reading this I was like oh this is gonna be the frame that I'm gonna think through I bet for everything in this book well I think about it a lot with kids you have a kid right you've got one one seven months yeah so I mean think about the learning that's taking place I think about the neuroplasticity of a seven-month-old and for example it's why we're going back to the example before if a child is deaf it's gonna delay speaking not because they can't speak but because they can't get that real-time assimilation and feedback and watching it almost makes you think about how much do you want to intervene when they're doing something wrong - I don't know if you've found that but it's like okay as long as they can't really hurt themselves I should probably let them do that thing that is gonna hurt but hopefully not irreversibly hurt yeah yeah I mean that's a huge question again like I said what I think of as this would make a terrible subtitle so it's not the subtitle of my book ranges the things that you can do that seem the best in the moment maybe are not the best for long-term development and I think that applies to like parenting maybe we should talk about that College Admission scandal or something the snowplow parent isn't the new but clearly that's not the best for long-term development in many cases there's a story you write about I think it's at the Air Force Academy yeah that illustrates that point yeah explain that inside this was one of my favorite studies in range partly because the experimental set up is cool you could only do this at the US it's a true experiment it's print it has randomization its prospective and there's blinding check all the boxes yeah yeah so the US Air Force Academy about a thousand students come in every year and they have to take a sequence of three math courses calculus one two and third course and they are randomized to professors in year one we randomized in year two and re randomized in year three and the characteristics they come in with are spread evenly across classes and so pair of scientists wanted to see okay this is a great experimental setup for looking at what is the impact of different math teachers so he filed about a hundred professors and ten thousand students over a decade and one of their main findings was that the better a professor was oh and everyone takes the same test in every class also and it's created by committee so there's no no one can make their own students do better well they found was the better a professor was at getting their students to over perform in calculus one the more those students then underperformed in the next two follow-on courses so as an inverse relationship between how well students with a certain professor did in the first course and how well they did in a second and third so for example and how they rated their teachers I think the professor who was rated the sixth best by his students in calculus one and his students got the seventh best scores overall I think out of a hundred professors his students in the seventh best was dead last and how his students then did in the next two courses and essentially it turned it just to be clear with a dead last or were they dead last in improvement so there was a value added score which said here are the characteristics these kids come in with and here's how we would expect them to do are they over underperforming yeah so it's not that they were the worst in calc 2 it's that they underperformed relative to where they came in that's right so they grew the least maybe as the right way to think of this that's right yeah absolutely compared to other people who came other students who came in with the exact same characteristics they did worse than them in the following courses and what these scientists found was that the way to get students to do the best in calculus one was to teach a very narrow curriculum that was tailored to the test where they learn a lot of what's called using procedures knowledge where they just learn how to execute algorithms and things like that over and over whereas the professor who got rated worse by their students and their students did worse on the calculus one test they learned more called making connections knowledge where you have to draw together concepts essentially and you're facing different types of problems instead of repeating the same type over and over which is another thing we should talk about after this but but then when they go to the next courses they have this more conceptual flexible knowledge they're learning how to match a strategy to a type of problem instead of just how to execute procedures so they do better later on and so there's this real conflict between how they feel they're doing early and how they rate their professors and how they're really being set up for later success which is kind of wild and that spoke to me on many levels but one of which being is I loved mathematics and I think we spoke before and maybe will tell the story get into that get into the issue later about I've always wondered about the transition I made when I decided to take school seriously but that teacher who I think sort of turned my life around would go on to teach me calculus as well and he had a very unique style of teaching which was you approach every problem through the lens of understanding what is being asked physically and seeing if in the end the question says okay Johnny throws a ball at this speed in this angle where does it land that might be the question I mean that's a very simple calculus question but that's an example but as the problems get more and more challenging he would still really insist that you try to understand graphically using sort of functional calculus like graphically what is happening algebraically what is happening in numerically what is happening and how can you converge the numerical solution with the algebraic solution with the graphical solution he said in calculus you should almost always be able to come up with an estimate of where the answer is based on graphing the functions and looking at how they behave at heart I mean a lot of kids didn't do very well in calculus and yet those lessons took me all the way through honors math and engineering and another sort of example on that path that really spoke to me was in my freshman year of calculus I met this guy studying in the stacks his name was JP and he became a legend to me because he had simultaneously he couldn't decide if he wanted to be a mechanical engineer or an electrical engineer so he did both and he literally got both degrees in four years it's not impossible to get both of those degrees in five or six years but to do both in four years is crazy and he said the only way he was able to do it was he never wanted to memorize how a type of problem was solved he wanted to derive everything from first principles at the time I think we were learning about Coriolis acceleration which is basically the acceleration of a body and rotation where the radius is changing so named after a guy who failed to figure this out when miners in a shaft were moving down so now you actually had a shrinking radius relative to the center of the earth and that changes the forces on the elevator shaft and he said you realize you could derive that all from Newton's first law and I was like I never thought of it that way and he goes yeah let's go through it and it's about a one-page derivation but you can do it and that lesson stuck with me for the remainder of my life which was oh my god if you just think of it in these broader initially more painful ways it yields huge dividends this kids had so many things I'm not sure where to start and range but first thing popped my head was I just saw somebody tweeting a research on Twitter today about how active learning students actually learn more but they rate themselves as having learned less and they also rate their teachers worse so it turns out we're early on we're not actually that good evaluators of how we're doing because the feeling of fluency and learning makes us think we're doing well but but we're actually not this is what I wrote about called desirable difficulties but what you were talking about I mean that's serious making connections knowledge in Japan they actually have a term called bansho that means the type of writing on the blackboard that tracks all these different approaches to the same problem sort of what it sounds like your teacher was doing but I wanted to the derivation point because there was some research I wrote only a little bit about and range but that I read a lot more about that was about what college students understand about math essentially and there were some really startling examples where one of the problems was like I can't matter what the exact numbers or but let's say it was 500 plus 200 equals 700 and the students were asked how can you check if this was right and so he'd say okay 700 minus 200 equals 500 that's right what's another way you can check if it's right they wouldn't come up with 700 - 500 equals 200 because they were taught to subtract the number on the right of the addition sign and when their professors were shown this sort of stuff so this is wicked feedback so you get the feedback that the student understands because they know one way to do it but they actually don't understand at all and the professors would say oh my gosh and the students would in interviews they'd say like math is a system of rules and then executed procedures professors would say like I went into math because I didn't have to memorize stuff because you could derive it and it makes sense is just concepts and so they were just in a totally different place than the students were and it sounds like you had some opportunity to avoid that but I think that's the norm of how math teaching works yeah and it's hard because my daughter who's in sixth grade

[00:56:06] I'm doing this thing and it's really hard I mean I've can't imagine I'm the only parent that struggles with this but I want her to love math I don't want her to view it as a subject I want her to view it as math is more fun than playing video games math is the most beautiful thing in the world I want her to look out the window and see math and see that math is a beautiful tool that we have to explain the world around us through this thing and yet every time as a parent I try to ask her a question to ask her to think a certain way I end up sort of putting her on the spot and so I'm struggling with this thing of one is it just that I'm a bad parent and I don't know how to do this correctly the way you're bad I didn't want to say anything or is it that a child needs a certain base of facts like they have to know a handful of things and be confident with the language like the times tables and all these other things before you can even get them to start thinking beyond the problem like I think a lot about this actually because I feel like I'm underperforming on this actually it's a good point on I should say so again in research theatre called using procedures knowledge which is kind of the knowing stuff and making connections knowledge which is derivation understanding concepts and they're both important it's just that like in some of these famous studies in the United States almost a hundred percent and sometimes literally a hundred percent in classrooms would be the using procedures knowledge and not the making connections but I think that is a tricky thing there's a study that came out after arranged I'd so I couldn't include it but was on the topic of desirable difficulties and it was about interleaving which is well explained the study seventh-grade math classrooms were randomly assigned to different types of math teaching some of them got what's called blocked practice where you get problem type a a a b b b b b and so on and the students get better really quickly and they rate their teachers well they rate their own learning well other classrooms got interleaved practice where it's like as if you threw all the problem types in a hat and you pick out randomly and in that condition the students are frustrated at first they rate their own learning low they rate their teachers poorly but again they're learning how to match a strategy to a type of problem instead of just do the same thing over and over and come test time they all took the same test the interleaving students who had interleaved practice blew the block practice students away it was I think like the largest effect size I've ever seen an education study there was randomized 0.8 three standard deviations it was like taking a kid in the 50th percentile moving him the 80th percentile but they didn't like it early on they don't feel like they're learning and so I'm not sure what the balance is as a parent where you know some of this desirable difficulty is in the long term desirable but you also don't want to turn someone off from the subject so what's that delicate balance I think that's sort of kind of the art of coaching and everything we do whether that's someone in sport trying to develop someone for the long term or a parent is like how do you balance maintaining enthusiasm with optimal development and helping someone have that vision of their future self like your professor did for you without having them be burned out I don't know I really think that's why there's what like great coaches kind of do is they figure out how to balance these things when to make things difficult and when to allow things to be easy and sort of more easily inspirational but I think that's an art as well as a science so what was sort of the take away of the idea that and I don't like using the extreme examples because they're more to silly and that's the problem with them but if you look at a high school track team okay and you look at you pick a big division one school and you look at their sprinters are they genetically predisposed to be sprinters but without a certain degree of training could never appreciate it or could a certain amount of train overcome a lack of genetic predisposition I mean how do you feel about that today versus when you wrote the book versus when you wrote the article because again you're getting smarter as we go yeah when I wrote the article I was more convinced than I had been before the article that genes were unimportant completely unimportant and by the time I wrote the book I came to feel that there was sort of two extreme camps one that felt genes have no influence on performance and another that I'd say the other extreme wasn't that practice has no influence as uncontroversial so I think one extreme was only practice matters and the other extreme was practice and genes matter I think that is not as extreme saying they both matter which and my bias is the latter my bias is just that

[01:00:40] I mean that's what the evidence shows yeah and it's like people don't randomly pick to train for marathons 100 meters if they're trying to get to the top level because there's some zero-sum physiology going on there and so I think to be a sprinter you're not turning a cart horse into a racehorse as the saying goes like you have to have some predisposition to be fast and being explosive and there's a reason why those people are particularly bad Usain Bolt would be a worse marathon runner than a random person picked off the street because it's different physiology but but I also think it's important to note that at the beginning of the season and six months later someone like him are very different in how fast they are even over the course of one season they change out fast they are so I think the practice is is incredibly important but you also need talent now which is maybe a reasonable segue into a story that I know you just get asked about all the time so but I also feel like for the sake of the listener if they haven't heard you on another podcast it's worth them hearing you explain the difference between Roger Federer and Tiger Woods but of course I once you're done with this I want to kind of go down more extreme examples and stuff so is it safe to say that the contrast between Tiger and Roger are elite examples of opposing views yeah yeah definitely and it's sort of interesting because well I'll give the quick versions of the story first before I criticize myself the Tiger

[01:01:56] Woods story I think even if you don't know the details they probably don't absorb the gist seven months old father gave him a putter not trying to turn him into a golfer by the way oh this reminds we should talk about how the tiger mozart's stories I think are told wrong after this so I'm just putting that on our course board here ten months he starts imitating his father's swing two years old you can go on YouTube and see him on national television demonstrating his swing on the Mike Douglas show it at three or four he starts saying I wanna be the next Jack Nicklaus fast forward age 21 is greatest golfer in the world and that's sort of the quintessential I think that story has seeped into culture so much that people who don't even follow golf ever kind of know it Federer on the other hand every bit as famous as an adult but obscure every bit is dominant I mean it's just more so our over a longer time for sure and when he was a kid he played some basketball badminton tennis his mother was a tennis coach refused to coach him because he wouldn't return balls normally he continued on to skateboarding swimming wrestling soccer when his coaches want to move him up a level he declined because he's want to talk about pro wrestling with his friends after practice he went on to play handball maybe I said volleyball already I'm not sure some rugby do we know how good he was at these other sports by the way he was good at soccer for sure most the other sports I'm not really sure but he kept playing badminton basketball soccer longer than some of the others and then soccer was the one that he finally decided he had to he had to choose between soccer and tennis and what age is that when he's having to make that decision I think he was starting to think about that as he was like entering his teens basically and he wasn't focused Tiger saying I'm me Jack Nicklaus when I'm four Roger was actually when he first got good enough to get interviewed by a local paper the reporter asked him if he ever became a pro why would he buy with his first hypothetical paycheck and he says

[01:03:36] Mercedes his mother doesn't want in putting all his eggs in this basket is like appalled and asked the reporter if she can hear the interview recording and the reporter obliged as it turns out Roger said Mayor CDs and Swiss Germany just wanted more CDs not a Mercedes and so his mom's like alright fine but it's just very different in every way from the tiger story and the way I sort of used these as a device to start range first to set up just a concept going forward if the book proposal was titled

[01:04:00] Roger versus tiger and I was gonna be like when did you be a Roger and when should you be a tiger but they felt everyone would think it was a biography of those two guys my publisher and I thought it was telling that we only know only hear one of those stories and my question was which of these is the norm obviously they both worked for these individuals and I think there's many paths so that as there are people but what was the norm and it turns out that the norm when scientists track athletes on route to becoming elite is that early on they tend to have what they call a sampling period where they try a wide variety of activities that often cludes things like martial arts and dance and doesn't just have to be other sports gymnastics and they learn these broad general these physical skills and they learn about their interests and their abilities importantly and delay specializing until later than peers who plateau at lower level and that turns out to be the norm and so I sort of felt we should let people know what the norm is instead of always focusing on these very few exceptions that happen to be in like the most kind learning environment sports and that aren't that good to extrapolate to everything else now how much of that do you think is the psychology of it and the neuromuscular physiology of it so looking at Roger for example who I know very little about Roger Federer that's not the obvious stuff that most people who are not I'm not a tennis fan or anything like that but part of his longevity is it possible to be explained by the fact that he never burnt out versus sort of slowly acquired a love for this thing versus had it shoved down his throat I'm sure like there's lots of stories of trying to create these tennis prodigies where it probably backfires because by the time the kid is 16 they're great but they've lost the desire so it's more of a above the neck phenomenon than a below the like environment how much of it do you think is that versus in playing all those other sports Roger actually developed synaptic connections that served him better in tennis he basically created a bigger foundation across his neuromuscular system that that ultimately came to serve him when he specialized and so there a couple points this will be a sort of a longer point for us cuz you bring up a couple good things initially I thought that most of the effect was going to be accounted for by the fact that if you allow people to delay selection it's more likely you get them in the sport that they're the best at whereas we know the earlier you forced selection the more like you put the wrong person in the wrong sport and when selection occurs really early you end up seeing this huge relative age effect where coaches just pick four kids who are born early in the selection year because they're seven or eight or nine or ten months older than their cohort and so they're young ages that's a huge difference and so coaches mistake biological maturation for talent so I thought most of it was just gonna be the fact that if you delay selection more you'll get the right people in the right sport more but then I started coming across these studies of German national soccer players or people in the national development pipeline where they were matched for ability at a certain age tracked for several years and I see who improves more and at certain ages you have to focus eventually but at certain ages like in the early and mid teen years it was those who did a wider variety of activities and so then I started to think maybe there really is something to the skill benefit which didn't surprise me intuitively but I didn't to see it empirically was interesting and then I spent some time with I should say why by the way my colleague John Wertheim asked Roger

[01:07:16] Federer about this one of the questions you asked on the tennis channel recently and Roger Federer said it contributed to his not burning out you know you never know how much to trust someone's own story but it's worth noting that that's what he said though spent some time with this physiologist for Cirque du Soleil and he noted that they started implementing this program where some of the performers are former Olympians and things like that to where they would have performers learn the basics of three other performers disciplines now cuz they were ever gonna perform them but let's see if it would vary up what they were doing maybe reduce stress related to injuries and stuff like that and they track their injuries next to

[01:07:51] Canadian gymnastics I guess it's a Canadian company and he said it reduced their injuries by like a third so they implemented it they must feel really strongly about it if they're taking away from practice time for those performers their main discipline there seems to be something they showed up at another longitudinal study of young athletes where the best predictor of suffering what they called an adult style overuse injury was how specialized the athlete was and it wasn't necessarily their total time spent in physical activity it was if it was just the same thing over and over so there was like some protective effect from diversifying we can guess at what that is I'm sure your guesses would be better than mine but ultimately my feeling is the Roger pattern is more prevalent one because you have that breadth of training that predicts breadth of transfer you're exposed to much more neuromuscular stuff much more perceptual stuff and when the challenge gets harder as you go up you need to draw in those there's a funny book called extraordinary tennis for the ordinary player I think by this guy Sai

[01:08:47] Remo who's better known as the father of intercontinental ballistic missiles but also wrote some books about tennis and a couple other things and in it one of the interesting things in it was that he shows he does some like serious analysis of gameplay at different levels and shows that even for good amateur players something like 80 or 90% of the points are scored by just keeping the ball and playing someone making an error and then when you get to the elite level it's totally exactly the opposite it's like 80 to 90 percent of points have to be earned and that completely changes the kind of game that you're seeing is I think the challenge that a lot of these athletes are facing really changes a lot as they go up in levels and so they really want to have that kind of breadth of training in this experience responding to different types you think this overlaps with the Air Force Academy example we're having the harder more orthogonal education in calculus prepares you for more real-world problem-solving which is what's happening as you go from calc 1 to 2 to 3 I think so I think so and I mean again that's why I think the theme of the book is the things that'll cause you to be the best today might not be the best for 5 or 10 years from now or the best way to develop a 10 year old might not be the best way to develop a 20 year old or certainly isn't and it's also I think the specialization model may well there's a surprising dearth of research in golf for how popular sport it is but

[01:10:05] I think in the specialization model may well work for golf because you're not facing some of that same stuff it is a very kind learning environment and I mean I guess the best guy in the world right now Brooks kept I didn't come until later and it's unclear if he even likes golf but I could see it makes sense to me that the specialization model would work or at least not be deleterious in golf whereas any other sport some what about the sportswear physiology is undeniably huge so the big three being swimming cycling and running cycling is hard to talk about because people tend to conflate the use of drugs with somehow discounting the remarkable physiology of these guys but if you take a Chris

[01:10:42] Froome for example four-time Tour de France champion grows up in Kenya we can speak to what the importance of early exposure to hypoxia could have been what is our belief about the training effect and the duration of the training effect Ceri to produce world-class athletes at that level because to me that's as foreign like if you said to me Peter I'm gonna put you in a time capsule you're gonna be 16 you're 14 years old again knowing everything you know today if you have to become a professional athlete which sport would it be in the answer is none I positively know there's nothing I could ever be good enough in and that includes if I was willing to do everything that was necessary to become the best cyclist runner or swimmer just couldn't do it you'd have to do what some countries host the Olympics what they focus on is just recruiting more people in the much less competitive sports if there's a basket weaving I have a friend who joked about this because my interests are so diverse he goes Peter do you realize that if someone comes up with an Olympic sport that requires solving a differential equation driving a car fast shooting a bow and arrow and doing a deadlift you could be one of the best that's basically modern pentathlon you're pretty much there it's like you've listed off ten other really stupid esoteric things I do and I'm like yep that's great that's my claim to fame modern pentathlon is like fencing horse riding swimming running it's like we should have that so I think I think there was a time when chess and fiction writing were in the Olympics so there's hope for you I suck at both of those like the Brits I think in the winter sports when skeleton got introduced which is where you sleep whole areas and there's a great innovation story about that if you want to get to that but one of the guys I talked to in their program said we got this down like 80% to a science we make like an open call for women we like do some measurements we know what size they need to be we know what kind of explosion they need to have we pick the gold medallist and they've done that so that stuff's kind of amazing but do you think that for these super physiologic things where presumably mitochondrial density mitochondrial efficiency fiber distribution matter the most is that more of a golf is that more Tiger is that more Roger not withstanding the psychological component which is obviously enormous so I think in sports in general more people a hundred years ago you could have come to the Olympics and been the only person into anything about training or the only person was really talented and win now I think in every sport many more people are ruled out by either their nature or their nurture no matter the sport is but I think in those meaning they're not willing to train hard enough no matter how much their ability so that rules lore they don't have the opportunities I mean a huge portion of people in the world don't have an opportunity to be exposed most sports so they don't have the opportunity I mean no one think one thing the impact of title 9 in the US is showing and how dominant we are in some women's sports where I think I just saw staffing we Ross Tucker he's at science of sport non prominent sport scientist he tweeted that the United States has something like 40% of all the women's registered soccer players in the world so like course were awesome because we're giving more opportunities so I think a lot of people either they're not willing to train they don't have access to training one of those or they don't have the nature for it and the more competitive the sport is the more important that is right because obviously if we had everyone do identical training only genes would separate them and if we had everyone be identical twins only training would separate them but I think people are more quickly filtered out by their nature and some things like sprinting and so how old are you I'm 38 38 so I'm 10 years older than you but directionally like we're both clearly past our prime right in the sense of like sports - sports wise yeah I think

[01:14:12] I'm past my prime and everything but clearly athletically is there a reason that I let's assume I'm a decent athlete which I'm actually not but let's assume I was could I if I decided tomorrow like I want to play tennis I don't think anybody would ever assume I could become a good tennis player but is it because the deliberate practice argument would be there aren't enough hours left for you to devote to this another argument would be no you missed a critical window just as we say by the way this might be totally BS I'd like to hear your view on it this view that we learn language is best at a certain window and once that window closes its sort of like a growth plate closing over a bone it becomes really hard to learn languages thereafter is there something about this critical window of exposure I guess is really the thing I'm trying to get at with this question when it comes to physical talent that's a tough question and there's this book by a neurologist called why Michael couldn't hit and it's about I loved this book was one of my favorite books so the he was saying

[01:15:08] Michael Jordan kind of missed the critical window for developing the perceptual anticipation skill that you need to see things that are coming because your reflexes are too slow right why the greatest athlete we'd ever seen of a generation was a 188 hitter in triple-a ball yeah I'm a bit of a gadfly about that though because I think I was a great book I loved a book

[01:15:27] I loved the Wayne Gretzky story by the way but we'll come back great yeah and one season I think Michael hit like 220 or something like that the minors which I think if we went down and picked a random person off the street they would hit zero in double-a these are people who are stars of college and high school teams or foreign teams so did he do well or poorly I don't know if he had hit ten you know I wouldn't have been surprised because he hadn't been playing a long time so I'm kind of impressed with what he did but I also think there's something too I mean I think the point though was the expectation it's not that hitting 288 or whatever in triple-a ball is horrible no it's just why isn't the guy that seemingly has the best hand-eye coordination in the world immediately able to absorb right and in that sense I do think there was probably something to the critical period and there are always people there are always exceptions to everything one of the most dynamic players in baseball now is Lorenzo Cain and he did not play a game of baseball until age 16 that surprises me he did not know how to play I think most people would need to have some exposure not necessary specialized but have some exposure at that age so there's always exceptions but I do think you want some of that early exposure partly just because you run out of time because you want your perceptual expertise to coincide with your physical yeah right so you're just under a serious time limit and in relating that the language I actually do think and you know there was a guy who tried dropped everything when you read about the 10,000 hour rule and decided to try to become a pro golfer by doing 10,000 hours exactly no and he got Ericsson to consult with him and everything - named

[01:16:49] Dan mcLaughlin far there we go he got to something like 7,000 hours or something like that and then he he stopped he was having injuries and what happened was I think he didn't make it and he didn't nearly make it but he got really good so he got better than like 90% of amateurs or something but wasn't nearly gonna get into q-school qualifying for a professional tour and so what I think and I didn't know if he was gonna make it or not cuz my point has been like you were saying oh you were right he didn't make it I wrote a little bit about him I'm like that's not what I said I said there's huge individual variation if he's gonna make it it's not gonna be exactly 10,000 hours and so he didn't make it by the way do you think there's enough variation that it almost is uncoupled like what would be your 90 percent confidence interval on that or does it even mean I think there has to be a 90% confidence interval right everything about you a thousand to 40,000 if you had to say 90% of people that become that achieve mastery do so in a certain amount of deliberate practice I think it really depends on the sport I listed in the sports scene I listed some hours and varied a lot by sport and so I think it sort of depends what it is most of them were in sports were lower than 10,000 hours significantly four to six thousand hours kinds of things and again these are averages in chess it was higher than that so I think it depends I think it's sport dependent and getting something like skeleton there's a great paper called ice novice two Winter

[01:18:07] Olympian in 14 months whereas basically just pick somebody and then they're they can go to the Olympics so I think it a lot depends on what you're doing and also when I said in a Harvard Business School class for some reporting I was doing for range you just reminded me of something where the professor asks the students yes among all these things like how many Subway sandwich shops do you think there are in America give your 90% confidence interval and basically we can't do it because if you're asked that question if you're asked 20 of those questions you should be able to get 18 correctly in a reference range I've played this game myself and with people I've never seen anybody come close to it people don't go big enough give you a 90% confidence interval and you'd be better off going like well I know there's 10 you know - like a million and instead they go much narrower and they end up missing almost all of them so I wouldn't tiny percent confidence interval B and it's sort of it depends what counts - because there's some accounts of athletes who have done a bunch of different sports and so there are studies that show that invasion sports are the ones that require anticipatory that people can't see me doing air quotes I guess we're on a podcast but that's the term that they use in the invasion sports where you have to anticipate things that are happening faster than you can react to boxing soccer whatever baseball things are flying trying to get past you there's some studies that show that people who have done a variety of invasion sports will then pick up any subsequent invasion sport more rapidly and so I think there was a case of one woman who had played a variety of sports and then it only took her like 500 hours to become one of the best basketball players in the world but she'd played netball and she played a whole bunch of other sports volleyball and all this stuff so it sort of depends what do you count as delivered like Erickson wouldn't count that as deliver practice because it's not the same sport but clearly it is like lowering the throw well and that's really the Federer point isn't it hits that all those other sports he's doing soccer badminton etc I mean they're still training in a more diffuse way a set of skills that obviously have gone on to serve him greatly in tennis yeah and I think this relates to language on a Segway to language a little bit which is I wanted to write about language in the book as I was going through all the research I found so much of it contradictory and confusing that I decided to kind of stay away from it largely because I just couldn't figure out I was hoping there'd be in my repose I wrote about this I'd seen this really cool study I had video for it where infants who were being raised by lingual they were given like this lucite box sort of thing and plexiglass or whatever it was and there was some object and they had to find the opening in this clear box and get an object out of it and then put some other object in it and the ones who were bilingual would try more different strategies and the researchers were saying well they think differently in the eye for executive function and I thought that was tantalizing and I loved the video but I just the research was all over and my conclusion was kind of there's a lot of tantalizing stuff but nobody's quite sure really for a lot of it but one that I did think was pretty strong was the idea that people who grew up bilingual had an advantage for then learning a third language without being taught it formally so there were studies where they'll be given like a fake made-up language and fake grammar and just have to learn it by immersion and they seemed to do that better and I think that's sort of akin to what what do we see in sports and with regard to the sensitive period I do think there is a real sensitive period in language where I think about after like age 12 you're not gonna make something your native language anymore and I think there are cases where kids feral children cases these rare cases where a kid like grows up in the woods or isolated from people and if they haven't learned some well if haven't exposure to language by age 12 they never learn it basically and that also happens to be about the age you have to start if you don't start studying chess patterns by age 12 your chances of reaching international master status drop international master status again one down from Grandmaster they drop from like one in four to one in 55 so I think there are some critical periods but I don't think for most things maybe for these feral children but for most things

[01:22:04] I don't think it's nearly expiration date that people think it is I think most people can get better at most things than they think they can and they can get better most things than they think they can at older ages than they think they can - yeah it's funny you said it that's kind of where I wanted to pivot for a second which was all of this discussion is interesting through the lens of being the absolute best tennis player or the absolute best golfer on the planet but isn't that really besides the point for most of us because if there's seven billion of us on this planet six point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine billion of us are never going to be good enough at anything to make a living at it outside of our day jobs anyway I was asked on a podcast recently why I love archery and driving a racecar so much and part of it is there is still every six months I'm still able to look back and appreciate the progress I've made in other words

[01:22:58] I'm coming from a place of being so not expert at these things that the joy is actually in the monotonic increase in skill that is actually the joy to me it's the I don't want to say mastery because that implies you are mastering it but it's the path towards mastery that is more joyous and I don't know it's almost like on some levels it must may be it's not that much fun to be the best in the world at something because by definition you only have one way to go at some point and that's probably a lot less enjoyable than working your way up the curve and I guess generalists have the ability to I don't know this gets more into the psychology again but you have to tether your identity to just this one thing I always feel bad actually for athletes who it's a brutal brutal way to make a living in the sense that you have a far narrower window in which you can be the best at something versus like say any sort of normal career yeah and if you interact with a lot of athletes here a lot of them say now it's just a job and is something that they loved at a certain point I think we were talking about Ayrton Senna earlier I seem to recall him saying something like the times of sport that he loved the most were not when he was necessarily on the top of the world it was earlier it was actually during his last two seasons in karting it was racing this British guy named Fullerton anything he did that karting was his favorite time absolutely it was pure bliss no politics as he said just pure racing I just actually interviewed a friend of mine the other day at this podcast it'll come out at some point in relation to this when I'm not sure when but but same question I asked her she oh she's an Olympian and it was like okay you were the second best in the world on this day you got a silver medal when was the sport the most fun and it's like oh yeah two years before I went to my first

[01:24:46] Olympics was winning was its most fun yeah yeah it's amazing I mean this makes me think of so many things one I think people that are performers need other stuff to do there was a study I mentioned range where Nobel laureates are 22 times more likely than a typical scientist have like a serious aesthetic hobby even though they're certainly not as good at it as they are at their day job for me I noticed while I was writing this book somewhere along the line I sort of started to forget what I loved about writing I think and I keep this thing I called my little book of small experiments where at least every other month I think of some skill I'd like to learn a little bit about or some interest I'd like to explore a little bit and I put a hypothesis of well what could I try to almost like my grad student and I think notebook what could I try to get some insight into this and I forces me to try something new every other month it doesn't have to be a big deal maybe it's some job that I don't know about I just have to find somebody to talk to about it but when I was sort of losing my enthusiasm for the kind of writing I was doing and starting to feel more pressure because my first book was a surprise success and then all of a sudden get a lot more pressure after that I took an online beginner's fiction writing course

[01:25:51] I've been reading this book about the Zen concept of beginner's mind well you just always keep your mindset as a beginner and never as I've arrived and in this class it's like nobody cares who you are nobody cares what you've done you get back in that feeling of being uncomfortable and I loved it I mean it reminded me what I loved about doing this it made me totally uncomfortable because it's still writing but it's very very different I think it had these huge benefits like one of the exercises was you had to write a story using no dialogue whatsoever and after I did that I went back to my book manuscript that I had and was like I'm leaning on quotes in a lazy way when I don't understand stuff I don't understand it the readers not gonna understand it so I need to learn it better and clarify with narrative writing instead of people's voices and so in every way a refreshed me and so now it's like something I really I really want to do and one of the can share this what a con another story here but does one of the greatest things I've ever seen in sports live has to do a little bit with this having something else going on your identity which was at the Vancouver

[01:26:47] Winter Olympics in 2010 yeah 2010 I was up at the women's 1.6 K cross-country sprint they say sprint but you go like way up a big hill and come back down and and there's like four rounds they're all in a day from the prelims to the medal round and this woman named Petra my touch Celine Ian's gear had been one of the top-ranked people in the world for years and never meddled at World Championships or

[01:27:11] Olympics totally Snakepit and something would always go wrong they didn't bring the right ski so the technician didn't have the right wax our ski breaks like just freak stuff and here she's favored to get silver I think in Vancouver and in the warm-up right before the first round she slides off a curve falls into a frozen creek bed and ruses up all of her side and they take her do quick examination because she has to go to the first round and say okay nothing's broken it's just pain like if you're okay you can go and she goes through the first round qualifies on time when she's she was the favorite in that round barely makes it through second round similar thing the examiner it's just pain you know if you can do it you can go third round she falls down after the finish line screaming they have to carry her away and examine her again and say if anything was really wrong we tell you couldn't go but if you can go you can final round here screaming every time she's like pulling the ground gets the bronze medal just nips in there then they have time to examine her and find she broke a whole bunch of ribs on her side one of them broke off and punctured her lung and so she came to the medal ceremony with a tube sticking out of her chest in a wheelchair and I remember she was I talked to her sports psychologist in there saying if we had known that she had broken all these ribs or had a freakin pneumothorax yeah they weren't gonna let her go to the Maelstrom and she was like I will die in the middle simply got going you know and so they brought wheeled her and they all said well first of all is it kind of a testament to the mentality that if if they told her it was an injury she wouldn't have done it right but it's just pain and I was talking her sports psychologists about what got her here like what's the journey been like especially after she's always having this stuff going wrong this must have been like Oh again and he said one of the most important things was like diversifying identity she was getting so fixated on and so much pressure he's like you need to do something else so he forced her to start building a house basically and that became like a task for her to do and a whole new thing a new skill and he felt like I thought maybe he's gonna talk about some new type of cross-training he's like no to building the house took the pressure off it gave her some other part of her identity so it wasn't just as the person who's like always having something go wrong and I just thought that was so interesting that his what he felt was his main contribution was giving her a hobby essentially and that he thought that really allowed her not to feel like the pressure that would break her in some way you sort of alluded to it earlier would they started the Nobel laureates as well I can't remember it was I think it was Francis Crick who said this I could be wrong that and it might've been

[01:29:28] Watson I think was Crick who said the key to doing great science is always being a little bit unemployed and I'm also probably paraphrasing that in bastardizing it it must have been said much more eloquently but you get the point the gist of it is great insight in science comes from having time to wander in your mind you said something a while ago about yeah which made me very jealous by the way and kind of pissed me off you would read ten papers a day in the exploration phase of writing and it's like I'd give anything to read ten papers a day today instead I even feel fortunate at least to have a team that can read ten papers a day for me I remember that bliss of you just get to read the paper all day every day highlight it take notes called the author go to journal Club like blue like that was unbelievable and we don't mean it's very difficult to be a scientist today because nobody's paying you to be just thinking nobody's really rewarding you nobody is promoting you based on that so we've created this very perverse set of incentives and in some ways honestly I consider it a miracle that there are still really good science being done most science being done by the way it just sucks I mean if we're gonna be brutally honest if you pull up

[01:30:45] PubMed and you look at every one of those hundred thousand papers every month it makes the rayon the PubMed I think 90 to 95 percent of them absolutely useless serve absolutely no purpose to our civilization do not advance natural knowledge do nothing beneficial for us they increase the publication count of the person doing them which is why they're doing that's right it's an economic tool of the journals and it's a promotional tool so you don't have any absolutely nefarious actors in the situation you just have a system with such perverse incentives that nothing some of the predatory journals but though they're yeah yeah yeah yeah and I think a lot of the science is bad I confess in range that I think my own master's thesis was not good science and wouldn't replicate but

[01:31:29] I didn't know like I was rushed into studying the specifics of Arctic plant physiology really quickly without learning what was actually happening when I hit the button on the statistics program and how science has to be set up to make conclusions and I think that's kind of the norm for a lot of scientists ani I think this 2005 paper by John ayan itis that was titled why most published research is false that people kind of wrote off and how it looks like he's a genius right oh no I hope I'm not saying something John wouldn't want me to repeat but I think John's been pretty vocal about this probably like seven or eight years ago I was having dinner with

[01:31:59] John and I said John I want to know answer on this what percentage of people who do science for a living so they apply for grants they get the money they do the thing what percentage of those people shouldn't be doing that which doesn't mean they can't work in a lab but they can't be principal investigators I mean he said something to the tune of 95 he's like 19 out of 20 people who basically for a living are in the business of generating hypotheses testing them experimentally and evaluating the results of those experiments that's the scientific method 19 out of 20 people who do that can't do it and probably should not be doing it that's scary but also I would guess that we don't want to try to narrow it down to just the people that should be doing it because you'd have this purifying form of selection where you have to like allow some failure so this is kind of where I want to go with this thinking right so why are we going down this tangent so you've obviously written a lot about the importance of even generalist within science and you've given a couple of examples which we should go into about the hard problem that gets solved by somebody whose native scientific tongue is not the one that is being addressed so I want to talk about that but I want to contrast it with this other thing which is I have this thesis that I harp on all the time which is mostly my way of communicating with myself to not get so upset at the lack of scientific insight in the world and the idea is genetics and evolution have never prepared us for science so the scientific method is less than 400 years old even the earliest signs of formal logic as a construct to describe the way we think represents less than 0.1% of our genetic existence so attea why would you ever get upset at somebody who can't think logically why would you ever get upset when you pull up a story on goop that is written like the most insulting thing you've ever seen in your life with respect to science why would you let that upset you Peter it's like you're expecting something that is simply too much and you might be assuming that the people writing for goop are trying to get things right so that might be as part of that I would love to hear you all forth about goop to be honest so I contrast this with there has to be some degree of rigidity and formality in the training I like to think of myself as a pretty good critic of science I have the ability to read papers and immediately most of the time figure out why these are total crap and what all the biases are and all these other things but to take any credit for that would be ridiculous I can't take any credit for that that's simply because I was mentored by people and I went through a formal type of training or informal type of training really wasn't formal and codified but it was informal it's it's going to Journal Club it's doing the experiments yourself putting something together thinking you're slick and having people tell you hey no I'm not stid you realize how many ways you screwed this up and how you've drawn the wrong conclusion so how do you balance that you have to go through that type of training with but sometimes you have to be an outsider yeah and by the way what you mentioned in formal training I think we underestimate the importance of informal training and you have to kind of set up cultures for it and things like that so I have a master's degree in geological sciences and I got a much better education in genetics writing a book than I did in a grad program I wouldn't know how to run like the equipment in the lab but I basically kept like a statistician on retainer and just to talk to me about paper anytime and that's an amazing way to learn you're not just being talked at you have a specific question of why is this wrong he's like no you can't use this this is and so is amazing way to have like informal learning and you're right I think the way to balance that I think it's difficult because you're right you do need some formal training in it like in other words the takeaway from your book is not that the person who's going to crack the code on pancreatic cancer is currently working at an investment bank as a finance analyst who's never taken a science course that's not going to happen not even close and I don't think you're trying to suggest that but I've heard people try to take your work and paraphrase it as well all these scientists working on cancer you screw it man they're not gonna figure anything out we need to we need to go get the history majors to solve the cancer problem and I'm like not a freakin chance without some modicum of scientific training yeah and I mean I think a scientific community I would say the tech community in particular would do well to interact with historians I think there are a lot of things they could learn sometimes I feel like the

[01:36:30] Silicon Valley set maybe doesn't respect history quite enough or it'd be useful for them but that's a side point my guess is that when people are saying that that just like go kick some person at random to do science maybe they're taking that from the chapter where I wrote partly about InnoCentive which was the VP of research and development at

[01:36:49] Eli Lilly in the past guy named Alf Bingham who's that he's a I remember I first talked to me said look I'm no Ganic chemist doesn't have a carbon in it I'm not even supposed to play with it okay I'm specialized mmm-hmm and I guess he realized at a certain point that chemists at Lilly were getting so specialized that there were certain things they were great at but it also narrowed their view so he talked a lot about this terminology and some of the business literature exploration versus exploitation exploration meeting essentially going and looking for new ideas and solutions exploitation once you find them how do you make the most out of them both of those incredibly important and he said basically the exploration phase is increasingly found outside because people are so specialized they're just not covering as much ground and so he had this idea to just post online some of Lilly's problems in drug development and at first everyone was like no way proprietary information he said pick stuff well nobody will know what we're doing and they said wheels gonna be able to solve this so he posts him online and like a third of them gets out

[01:37:40] I remember one of his favorite memories was a an attorney who solved some important chemical synthesis project because he had worked on some tear gas copyright case or something and it reminded him of that and so a third of those problems get solved which is amazing yeah that story amazed me actually and in those problems it does tend to be because they've selected for problems that have stumped the specialist rights and does tend to be the more likely the problem is to get solved the diversity and I think my question and that to really double-click on it is did the generalist actually solve the problem or did the generalist just come up with a clue that completely changed how the specialist went about approaching it like in the case of that example the attorney doesn't actually know how to completely synthesize the molecule what they're basically saying is you guys are looking at it this way stop rotate 90 degrees over there and turn around and I think the answer is over here to which case either a new set of specialists could do it is it sort of a bit of that hybrid yeah and actually in a sign of evolve to where they give different now they help other operations post their questions in a way that'll attract what they call solvers and there are different monetary rewards depending on what kind of contribution it is the person makes and sometimes he did get people sent in powders and stuff they synthesized stuff on their own other times it was much more like you're taking the wrong approach and here's another thing to think that they were still chemists that had to do this right not all of them not all of them but there was a lot of that sometimes they'd be chemists from some other area but sometimes it was totally random people but again you're farming it out to the whole world people have not the whole world I mean I'm not most people don't know about incentive but a huge number of people and I think he was surprised sometimes things would come from people who worked with machinery but weren't really formally trained in it but had a lot of experience and so I think sometimes there were true Outsiders but most of the problems don't get to the

[01:39:30] InnoCentive stage anyway they're being handled by the specialists and I wouldn't extrapolate InnoCentive to mean that specialists aren't incredibly important I mean my broad view of this is the same as physicist Freeman Dyson we gave this great speech we said we need birds and frogs the frogs are down in the mud looking at the granular details the birds are up above they don't see the detail but they're integrating the knowledge of the frogs and he said the world is wide and deep it'd be stupid to say one is better than the other you need both for a healthy ecosystem his concern was were telling everybody to be frogs and so we're not having birds and that's kind of how I conceive of it and

[01:40:01] I think the biggest impact would come from what Arturo Casas Duvall who's is kind of one of the prime characters of the last chapter is trying to do we're adding range to people who are within science already like these people are being formally trained he's just backing up the formal training instead of jumping right into kind of the reductionist studying the body as a machine sort of thing it's like the initial classes in the program he's pioneering and he's like one of the and his H index which is a measure of his productivity as of researchers surpassed

[01:40:30] Einsteins recently which isn't fair because people publish a lot more now as you alluded to for their careers but it still puts them in very rare company and so he's starting people with how do we know what is true and the anatomy of scientific errors and also how errors have sometimes led to breakthroughs and so he's just like backing up the training into these broader concepts and saying you can learn the more specific didactic stuff later but if you don't learn the broader conceptual stuff you never get it because you're only going to get more and more and more specialized from here so I think one way we can approach this is just by backing up the training basically because I don't think we have to worry about people will learn the specialized stuff in their field just by doing it and being there but the other stuff but that's what we kind of teach them and start them with but the other stuff like scientific thinking how does it work what constitutes evidence they'll never get that stuff if they don't get it early in training yeah I sort of cite the examples you've given when I get asked a question a lot which is someone going to college who wants to go to medical school saying what is the best thing to study in college to which I don't know the answer but my advice is anything but pre-med so you couldn't really do anything work and I'm sorry because I know there's somebody listening to this I'm sure who's doing pre-med who's gonna go into Medical

[01:41:38] School and my only take for you is okay I'm sorry that you're in pre-med right now but make sure you spend a lot of time doing non pre-med stuff in college you still have the bandwidth to take other classes you should be doing so liberally but you are better off being a history major who goes to medical school than a biochem major who goes to medical school in my opinion I could be wrong but having seen enough people go through it you're gonna learn as much by chemistry's you're gonna need to learn when you get there both interpersonally and frankly in the breath of thinking you'll be better off if you studied something else I mean a lot of Arturo's argument too is I saw him make this argument talking about he went from

[01:42:12] Einstein to Johns Hopkins School of Public Health because they're allowing him to start this new grad program and I saw him on a panel about the replication crisis in science this problem with a lot of work basically not being true and the head editor of the New England Journal of Medicine said you can't do that training is already too long and

[01:42:30] Arturo said it's clearly not working he said I'm saying drop the didactic self because it's not been working I think he actually pointed out that the New England Journal Medicine had the highest retraction rate in some study also but so I thought that was interesting where he said a lot of that stuff is in one ear and out the other anyway if it's really didactic people don't even know if they're gonna need it or when they're gonna need it and so I thought that was an interesting take but he said you can just a drop some of that other stuff but to your point about telling people not to do premed when I was at Sports Illustrated not so much anymore but when I was there

[01:42:58] I would get asked by young aspiring journalists what should I do if I want to work as a sports writer which I major in English or journalism and my first instinct was to say journalism if you know what you want to do get a head start second instinct English and then I if I thought about I'd be like well I majored in geology and astronomy so I have no idea to tell you but stats course biology course never heard anyone you should do one of those cuz you'll learn the job by doing the job and that's the only way you learn the job that is the challenge of giving advice isn't it because I don't feel this way at all anymore I'm totally comfortable with my nonlinear path to doing what I do but I spent a great deal of time frustrated that I couldn't figure out sooner in life what I wanted to be when I grew up and I thought of all the time squandered but again that was through the paradigm of you only had one two to ten thousand our windows you didn't take them you spent them doing something you will never do again I had my 10,000 hours shot and I put it in the wrong thing and now I never do it again in it but I think that speaks to probably the insights of your book which is you're discounting a bunch of things you learned in doing that and also sorry I didn't mean RP where you go no no and also I think your insight into yourself your skills and interest in the world are constrained by your roster of previous experiences as Herminia Barra who studies how people find what's called match quality the degree of fit between their interest abilities in the work that they do which turns out to be really important for how likely they are to burn out for their performance for all these sorts of things and we really underestimate it she studies basically how people seek this out and transition careers and she said we learned who we are in practice not in theory which means there's this kind of cultural idea and lots of career gurus and personality quizzes they kind of seek to convince you that you can just introspect and know what you should do putting in that time but in fact the way we learn about what we want to do is we have to do stuff to act and then think you have to do stuff and then reflect on it and that's the only way you figure it out and match quality seems to be so important that's spending some time and that experimentation is worth it so one of the that I think is sort of representative of that this economist who found a natural experiment in the higher ed systems of England and

[01:45:06] Scotland where in the period he studied students in England had to pick a specialty in their mid teen years to apply for a certain program in college the Scottish students could keep sampling throughout university and he said who wins the trade-off otherwise the systems were very similar who wins the early or late specialized errs and what he found was the early specialized errs do in fact jump out to an income lead because they have more domain-specific skills but the late specialized errs sample more things and when they do pick they have better match quality and so they have higher growth rates so by year six out they fly by the early specialized errs meanwhile the early specialize that's based on the economics yeah what about when you look at things that probably matter even more such as happiness and satisfaction he was only looking at finance and career switching so because he was looking at huge numbers of people but we can talk about fulfillment insects so the early specialises then started leaving their career tracks and much higher numbers even though they have much more distant

[01:45:54] Center from doing so they're made to pick so early that they more often make a wrong choice so the return to match quality was higher than the return to getting a head start in domain-specific skills the Dark Horse project which I wanted to get around to anyway has to do with fulfillment because I think you should tell more of your story because sounded really interesting I want to hear more of it but that project the dependent variable was fulfillment it was about how people go on yeah well before we started the podcast I said there's this thing I've always tried to explain when I've told my story to high school kids or something like that it doesn't really make sense which is growing up all of my energy went into boxing and martial arts and I didn't do anything in school I was super mediocre and then I had this awesome teacher who when I was in grade 12 in Canada you said grade 12 not 12th grade it sounds stupid so weird

[01:46:44] I can't believe we can even it's hard to them we can even have a discussion and he called me in one morning and he said hey I heard you're not applying to University and stuff and I said that's right and he certainly didn't bust my chops he in fact I wrote about him after he died and how amazing it was that he just knew what to say he knew the right thing to say at the right time which was hey I totally get it when I was your age all I wanted to do was play in the NHL and it was only thing that mattered to me and you really ought to don't let anybody tell you that your dream of being middleweight champ in the world is a dumb idea it's not but he said but it was almost like a Steve Jobs moment like one more thing I think you have a gift for mathematics and you should at least entertain the idea that maybe that's your calling is more in terms of math than it is in fighting and I remember that day as clear is mean that that's so long ago it's more than half my life ago was that moment but it did change the course of my life completely and then I did come back to high school to finish and did better than anybody expected I could ever do and I've always assumed the reason I was able to do that is I simply took the work ethic of exercising 6 hours a day which was sort of what I did in high school I was I would run 5 to 13 miles every morning 400 push-ups before bed every night and everything in between was training around that and I just applied that to calculus algebra physics geometry etc so that sort of gets into the Duckworth grit stuff the question I guess I have in that is had I taken the grit of age 13 to 18 and basically with no other cognitive capacity turned it into then doing well in school I definitely wouldn't say no other cognitive capacity because well I think those things take a different certain cognitive capacity that kind of discipline but clearly the teacher recognized something in you that you did not recognize in yourself didn't just pick you out randomly and I assumed well especially because I wasn't even the top student in mathematics at the time I wasn't even near the top so yeah so obviously saw something that you didn't yourself see and so it seems to me like you had this training whether that was something that as part of who you are naturally or something that motivated you that you could take that and transfer that to then something that had better match quality for you and so as a combination of you using certain skills and approaches that you would learn and somebody helping you find better match quality basically I think that's like a explosive combination in a good way but it is interesting I wonder what he saw because he was right but did you have any inkling that that was the case at the time was that total news to you that he thought you know in fact I found math incredibly frustrating because it wasn't something you could be us your way through at least in English class I remember this well because I'm actually still very close to my English teacher from high school I always managed to find a way to weasel through by writing every essay I wrote was on Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson or Marvin Hagler or Jimi

[01:49:25] Hendrix I basically screwed my way through English by always figuring out a way to read a book that I was interested in and figuring out a way to write but you couldn't do that in math you sort of had to do so when I remember is that math frustrated me more than anything but I wish woody was still alive for many reasons but one of them being I wish I could ask him why he said that yeah no it's cure I mean and I think a lot of people find math more frustrating

[01:49:49] English class it's like English class and more subjective and you can kind of get through you know a lot of people even if you don't know what you're doing but that is that is interesting I wonder what he saw and I think that's the reason I said I think it resonates with the darkhorse project which was this project by these two Harvard researchers to sort of figure out how people who find fulfillment in their work go about it in a wide range of careers essentially there was a huge variety but most of the people did not stick on their first sort of dream basically there were some but it was a small minority most of them had this they actually called it the Dark Horse project because people would come in and say well don't tell anybody to do what I did because I started this other thing and then I something else came up or something random happened or I realized there wasn't what I want to do so I had to start my own thing so they also felt sort of sheepish about their non linear path yeah I get there and they saw themselves as having gotten lucky and come out of nowhere what you have to get like luck is important but they all saw themselves as having come out of nowhere which is why they called it the Dark

[01:50:44] Horse project what they kind of had in common was this they would sort of respond instead of sticking to like an ironclad long term plan they would respond to their lived experience by zigging and zagging finding what they were good at whether that was someone helping them figure that out which i think is often the case for a younger person or them being older and maturing and sort of realizing that and it sounds like that kind of happened you in some way you yourself is coming out of nowhere because you had a talent and also some transferable skills it could come together in a way that you hadn't conceived before and it worked really well so I think you'd be kind of the type for the Dark Horse project I mean to take something you said a moment ago and couple it to this so let's say we fast forward whatever 18 years and your son says dad I don't want to go to college I'm gonna learn a bunch of stuff that a I don't need to learn cuz I could teach it on my own I'm gonna get a degree in something that doesn't necessarily imply what I'm going to do with myself thereafter the letters don't really matter after my name and by the way notwithstanding the fact that maybe by the time our kids are going to college the debt that they did incur to do so is itself more debilitating than anything else so can you make a case that one does not need formal education at that level to go for me notwithstanding the fact that sometimes you need it from a professional standpoint like you can't become a lawyer without going to school I don't see that changing and things like that at least in California you just have to pass the bar that actually is a great point you can't become a doctor I guess without going to school and so does this change the way you think about higher education yeah and cash I don't even know where to start with this question

[01:52:18] I hope the college looks different 18 years from now than it does now because if we keep ramping up people's debt then we will make sure that they fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy where the more you invest in something one of my favorite writers Maria konnikova wrote a book about Kahneman and one of their strategies is they start with asking for small things oh I thought you meant

[01:52:36] Kahneman no no con men playing confidence games it was called the confidence game and she's a she's a psychology PhD and a great writer and she notes that they'll start with these small lots of small asks because the more you invest the more likely you are to fall prey to the Sun cost fallacy of then saying like well I've already put some ins I should keep going even when to an outsider it's like clear that's a disaster and I think the more debt we saddle people with like that study we're just talking about the higher ed systems in England Scotland the English students who specialized earlier have more disincentive from quitting even though they should when they do quit their growth rates are then higher because they're quitting in response to information about themselves that they've learned and I think the more the more time and debt we saddle people with the more we make sure they will not respond to match quality information and instead will say yeah you blunt their receptivity to the signal that's right and I think we want to Steve Levitt the freakanomics economist did his interesting study we had people flip a coin to determine major life decisions and the most commonly asked question was should I quit my job when he found was the people who flipped I think of his heads and changed their job we're better off when he checked in with him later and so I think you want like as little friction as possible to people job changing in fact when I was watching one of the Democratic primary debates recently and people were talking about universal health care I would think one of the advantages might be that it would lower friction to job changing because you're not was worried about so that maybe people can shuffle around more and have better match quality so I think something has to be done about the dead situation I think there's plenty of evidence that for a lot of students so the Economist Bryan Caplan wrote a book called the case against education I certainly don't agree with an entire education specifically I certainly don't agree with everything in the book but I think it's provocative and a rigorous take and his argument so we know that some part of college education is signaling to the job world that is not about anything that you've learned is just about I am smart enough and I'm serious enough and you know it's like the minor leagues for the job world so we're doing them a favor because they don't have to be good Scouts and basically what he was saying is nobody says that either signaling or learning is all of the effect of college but his argument was that he thinks signaling is like 80 percent of it whereas other people would say oh maybe it's twenty percent so he thinks most of it is just you need this credential to signal's of the work world that I'm okay and I don't know if he's right about how much it is but I think it's probably more than people into it because research seems to suggest that it doesn't change people as much as we might think in some ways what

[01:55:00] I do think is important about it though is that it does give that kind of sampling ability like I didn't know about so the Scottish students in that study also much more often delayed specialized errs end up studying something that wasn't offered in their high school because they didn't know about it I didn't know about the stuff I studied until I got to college and so without it I would want to be some other mechanism for sampling but I think that kind of communication technology that we have now and the Internet may if we use it smartly it can expose you to a lot more stuff and I think there's huge potential of online courses I love some of these online courses so I do think while I would want him to be able to have a sampling period my kid I think I don't know that the same kind of college model that we have now will be the answer and

[01:55:44] I think there are other things that could expose him to more are there things and but if society forces the signaling to continue then what can you do then it's just like you have to pay your dues because you have to pay your dues the way I see my role as a parent we mentioned Angela Duckworth by the way

[01:55:57] I should mention the week that my book came out I've subscribed her newsletter her newsletter was titled summaries for sampling and she said kids shouldn't be too gritty until they figure out what to be gritty in and she says it took me a decade of trying stuff to figure out so it really speaks to a broader point here which is a lot of these insights that we sort of latch on to are slightly out of context yeah definitely definitely and I mean so now if her point is you should be greeting when you should be gritty

[01:56:24] I'm totally on board with that I view my roles I write a little bit in that section about grit about something I should have done more about about the way the army adjusted when they realized in an industrial economy and they had this strict upper out structure it was great because you did want to be specialized because work next year did look like work last year and there were huge barriers to lateral mobility but knowledge economy comes along and now there's tons of lateral mobility for people who can engage in knowledge creation and creative problem-solving so their highest potential officers started quitting if they didn't have any agency over their career matching and so first they tried to throw money at people to retain them and they people were going to stay took it people gonna leave left anyway half a billion dollars of taxpayer money down the drain then they started programs like when they call talent based branching where instead of saying here's your career track go up or out they say we're gonna pair you with a coach and try this one career track and reflect on how it fits you and then try these other two and these other two and we'll triangulate a better fit for you and that improved retention more than throwing money at people they've basically built in a match quality sampling system and so maybe we could do stuff that's how frankly I view right now my parenting role as being the coach in the math talent based branching system for my kid facilitate help him know that a lot of things are available and get the maximum amount of signal about himself from each one and I think there are ways that that can be done possibly more effectively and a lot more cheaply than the formal education structure how do you know how long to push so give you two examples with my daughter and I feel so bad sometimes telling these stories about her cuz one day she'll listen to this and should be like dad I can't believe you embarrass me but when she was five she said I want to play the drums and we've had lots of parents who have interacted with us who said are you crazy how did you listen to her but we were like we just did so we got her like a set of cheapo little toy drums just to see what she actually do anything and she did she wouldn't stop wailing on them and though she was four when she said that then when she was five she said no I really want to keep playing so I'm fine so we got a drum teacher got her a real set of drums and away she went and here she is now she's 11 she still drums she loves it she's I mean she's really good I think I can say that without too much bias just objectively based on what her teacher tells me which is like she drums better than most anyone and she's only 11 and we never pushed her right so it was just she just wanted to do this there was one time when she kind of wanted to quit when she was about seven and we talked to her teacher and said hey let's spend way more time just letting her play

[01:58:49] Taylor Swift songs than doing scales for a while and see what happens and then it was great like it all came back into the mix year ago she starts taking tennis lessons I think her tennis teacher is the most awesome guy he's like this young Russian kid he's so fun he's so smart I've haven't watched them I mean he's just has a beautiful way of explaining things to her she never feels bad like he never hammers her but he's strict she's screwing around he tells her she's like

[01:59:18] I don't play tennis anymore and I'm like Olivia are you freakin crazy do you know what I'd give to have played tennis when I was a kid and I don't get into the sob story of like we didn't have the opportunity for private tennis lessons or whatever but it's more the tennis is such a beautiful sport you will be able to play this forever how can you not want this and I'm really torn do I push her too continue taking lessons and I'm not saying like you have to go and even compete it's just sit here and play tennis for two hours a week you and Mom play it's fun why wouldn't you want to do this or do I just say well she only wants to play basketball which is the only sport she wants to play right now should I just I don't know if this is a great example but I think you get the point right yeah it's like there's a part of me that thinks it's really good for her to keep playing tennis yeah yeah and she's crazy to stop obviously you're saying she'll regret it it sounds like it that's my potentially stupid fear which is you're gonna be fifty one day and you're not gonna be playing basketball coz nobody's playing no fifty year old woman is running around playing pick-up basketball but you will still play tennis so why wouldn't you continue to learn this now well you have this critical window in which you could get good at this sport yeah and she could play tennis at start up at 50 she just wouldn't be as good at it exactly yeah and you're oriented toward achievement so she might be a great drummer in a crap tennis player she starts at 50 she might still like tennis though yes and

[02:00:36] I'm trying to balance the yes I think that's the part of it I can't let go with this idea that I'm not great at anything it would be really cool if my kids had the potential to be great at something world-class like wouldn't it be cool if she could be a world-class drummer one day I have no delusion she won't because the interest or even the talent to be a world-class tennis player but I still think I wouldn't you you have this wind I think I'm still stuck to this idea that there's a window in which you can assimilate skill viet language music sports that to go a little further if she said I don't know anyway that's sort of and when she's younger also you have more time to put into it and you're a lot less concerned about making mistakes so you'll throw yourself in and practice in a way that you probably won't when you're older and most things I mean that's a great question it sounds like in drums you found a way to sort of when she was saying I don't really want to do it anymore to keep her foot in by sort of changing what she was doing right and it was just this one little audible called on the line of scrimmage everything was fine but also it would have never even occurred to me to put a kid in drums like this was 100% her insisting on it and there was no resistance from us I was like great but if she'd said piano violin fill-in-the-blank we would have been equally interested in letting her pursue that so maybe it just comes back to this broader issue of is there an age at which parents should force some of the sampling is there an and wish parents say enough is enough you've sampled enough if you don't want to play tennis anymore don't play tennis

[02:02:00] I should make clear I don't want a prescribed diversification any more than I want to prescribe specialization right and this gets to something I mentioned before which is I think we tell the tiger and the Mozart stories a little wrong yeah let's do that story okay so Tiger said in 2000 his father never asked him to play golf so his father did put a putter in his hand when he was seven months old but he wasn't attempting to make him a golfer he's just giving it to him as a toy and he responded so he said in 2000 my father never once asked me to play golf it was always me asking him it's the child's desire to play not the parents desire to have the child play the matters that resonates with the work of this woman

[02:02:34] Ellen winner who's maybe the world's authority on and prodigies of that nature that they're usually driving their parents crazy not the reverse and that there's not really yeah I mean Wayne Gretzky is a great example of that do you listen to these interviews with his parents like they couldn't get this kid to come in for dinner and what Ellen winter I think she leads to some research and I think this research was exactly hers but it's really a problem when someone's parents if they're low socioeconomic status and they have a prodigy and the person has this incredible Drive a master whatever it is they're doing and the parent can't accommodate that because it really is hard for the parents obviously tiger's father responded his very unusual display of interest in prowess Mozart probably the second most famous example tell people just what the what's the mythology around Mozart did oh that his father basically was like

[02:03:21] Tiger Woods father except for music that he started very shove the violin into the crib and yeah exactly and so I was going through these letters and one that I remember really well about Mozart's early life was a musician would come over to play with Mozart's father who was a musician and he recalls young

[02:03:39] Mozart coming in with the group of adults and saying I want to play the second violin part and Mozart's father says go away you have many lessons you obviously can't play violin and then the letter writer his name was ondrea's something like a member the last name says little Wolfgang started crying and so I said okay I'll go play with him in the other room and his father says but play quietly don't disturb us next thing you know they hear the second violin part coming from the other room and so they walk in and look and young Wolfgang Mozart playing the second violin part with made-up fingering because nobody's taught him the fingering and in the letter this part I remember verbatim he says young Wolfgang was emboldened by our applause to insist that he could also play the first violin part and so then he goes and does that and that's when his father says holy crap yeah and responds to it so neither of those cases where they like manufactured the way we tell that story so I don't think we should be scared about missing a tiger or Mozart because the best way to find one of those people is probably still to expose them to a bunch of things and see if something lights their fire that way I mean I think of Mozart it's a great point that's a great point yeah I think those

[02:04:41] I'm sure there's a lot of those people who never got exposed to the thing that would have ignited what Helen winter calls that rage to master and most people you're not gonna have a lot of tigers and Mozart's no matter what now obviously those are exceptions but I think that's important to keep in mind to go back to when do you allow your kid to quit this is something I've seen

[02:04:57] Angela Duckworth has tried to respond to a number of times it's very difficult she'll say things like don't quit on a bad day which i think is sensible but also should you quit on a good day it's kind of hard to know what is the calculus for when you should quit like if you're having tons of bad days maybe you should quit on a bad day and Levitt and Dubner have written about this right

[02:05:16] I think it's in one other maybe their third book well Levitt is always saying my best thing as I know when to quit like everything it like fields of study projects whatever yeah by the way is a funny aside you know Steve has tried very hard to get me to take up golf no really yeah so he's a very good golfer I don't know why people don't know how good a golfer Steve is incredible and he's convinced that taking sort of a freakonomics approach to golf you could take a novice and make them really good in a short period of time we've had very serious discussions about if I would give him one year he could turn me into a really good golfer as someone who's never even touched a golf club I don't know if that's true I'm curious enough that I'd love to try it if I had the time because when he's explained to me the logic behind it like how many steps you can shortcut if you're purely optimizing around this thing and how he's figured out a bunch of these hacks

[02:06:07] I'm like it's kind of fun it's not gonna happen with me I don't think but yeah I don't have time to do that but if you did take him up on that like that guy we talked about earlier Dan McLaughlin who dropped his job to try to become a pro right who got 7,000 hours into it I think he got better so he was getting way better at first like anything the learning curve is but

[02:06:25] I think how quickly he got better and he had never golf before ever was surprising to most people how quickly he got better early on and so I think doing that plus I mean he was practicing that was like his full-time job for the time but if you did that for a year plus whatever hacks he's talking about I bet you'd past most of the amateur golfers out there because most of them are just going like swatting and it's like stress relief they're not even really trying to get better a lot of times but I bet you'd surprise yourself with how good you get but I'm not a huge golf fans

[02:06:53] I'm putting all of that energy into the things that I'm currently doing but but this idea of quitting it is really an underappreciated thing isn't it because sometimes it's the it's time it really comes down to time and exposure and that's the most valuable resource we have so but the when to do it is still the million dollar question totally I mean I think that's why this I like this model of talent based branching at the army used so much because they pair someone with a coach to help them make that decision and it's still not a science and I also like they call talent based branching because basically it's coached quitting but they use a different term so it doesn't sound bad but I don't know what's perfect I mean I think someone a mother asked me recently he said her son is a really good at violin and now he just wants to quit and

[02:07:34] I think like just wants play tennis and she was saying but he's so good and I know he'll love it when he's older and the best thing I could think of was try to help him keep a foot in whether that's playing Taylor Swift songs or whatever maybe he just needs to back off and try something else for a while can you keep a foot in that pool so they doesn't totally detach from it you know he feels regenerated or whatever can go back to it if you know that progress comes from alternating stress and rest and things like that so maybe they just need a break or maybe they need to try some other type of training I think that's undervalued if someone wants to quit and say oh either you have to stick with it or quit but the approach you took was let's try varying what you're doing I think that's incredibly undervalued we act as if it's a binary choice instead of why don't we see what else this area has to offer maybe you just need to get on a different track and again I think that's the brilliance of good coaches is they help personalize that environment so the person continues to be interested continues to progress and so so the first thing I would try is varying up what they're actually doing and if they really want to quit it's a maybe keep a foot in if you can for a little while but then ultimately if they really want to quit and it defeats the purpose if some aspiration of life is to find happiness then yeah yeah and make it and if they want to come back maybe they just needed a break keep it available if possible but if they quit and they don't regret it then what are you gonna do the proofs in the pudding there are a couple other stories in range that I wanted to ask you about one of them is the story about the space shuttle Challenger I'll let you tell the story and then I'll bring my question to it guess I don't even know how to tell this story quickly I'll set the stage everybody knows what happened let's assume everybody knows the following

[02:09:07] January 1986 space shuttle Challenger is scheduled to launch happens to be the first time there's a civilian on board it also happens to be the first time it's ever launched on a day that's that cold and everybody knows what happened which is whatever 73 seconds after liftoff the o-ring failed to contain one of the liquid fuels like a member it was liquid oxygen but basically there was a spark an explosion and the rest is history you write about one the decision to launch that day to the challenges of figuring out what was the cause of that talk about both of those especially the former actually and then I'll tell you where I'm curious what I focused on was this emergency conference call the night before the launch when the weather report came in that it was going to be an unusually cold day in Florida and so engineers at Morton Thiokol which was the rocket booster contractor and NASA they get on this big conference call in three different locations a group of engineers and they say what should we do is this a problem should we worry about it the shuttle was supposed to be cleared for cool temperatures but nobody really knew because they had never launched below 53 degrees and they were concerned as an aside by the way that oring was from the Apollo program that's a great example of engineering sort of shortcut which is they never actually redesigned the o-rings for the shuttle they literally just took the o-rings from the

[02:10:34] Apollo project which had a different spec and brought them over maybe I should describe what Oh rings are a little bit it's like it's a strip of rubber that runs all if you can picture the rocket booster you know it looks like a missile attached to the shuttle and the o-rings it's put together in different four chuckles segments and the o-rings run along the perimeter of the missile like rocket booster and seal the joints between pieces and they have to stay sealed so that they block the rocket fuel coming down the booster from shooting outside essentially and there was concern that the rubber of the o-ring launched there were forces that moved the o-ring to move the metal pieces that were being sealed apart and the o-ring rubber had to expand immediately to maintain contact so that fuel didn't come shooting past and the concern was that the rubber would harden a little when it was cold and so it wouldn't expand quite as quickly and so some rocket fuel would basically shoot through the wall of the booster and that is exactly what happened and the question was that they were trying to answer is should we be worried because twice before they had had cases where they saw soot on the wrong side of the o-ring which meant rocket fuel had gotten past it but it wasn't catastrophic one of those will only launch 253 degrees which was the coolest temperature they'd launch that one was it like 75 degrees which was one of the warmest temperatures they hadn't launched it and so on this day it was like 30-something right it's like thirty-eight or something like that they were looking at it that it was gonna be like 40 but it ended up being colder than they expected even and I think in retrospect some of the temperatures of actual components were even colder there was like ice on the so it ended up being colder than anybody expected anyway but their question was in these temperatures will the o-ring work or not basically and the fact was that they didn't really there are only two cases of this so-called blow-by when the rocket fuel goes past again one at the coolest temperature one at one of the warmest temperatures and the whole shuttle was thought by the project manager to be cleared for lower temperatures anyway and so all of a sudden they're having this last-minute meeting where they're saying like how do or eans work and when do they work and the only real they didn't have enough data to answer the question and one of the engineers was saying we shouldn't do this because I inspected the joints and in the 53 degree day there was lots of blacks behind the o-ring so that means a lot of gas cap by and we're lucky it came back and the 75 degree day something else wants to happen because only a little bit got past I don't know what happened but only a little got past and so we go colder so he said they asked him to quantify this so what's the relationship between temperature and gas blow by and he said I don't know I can't quantify it all I know is colder is away from goodness that's how he put it and they kept saying quantified quantified quantified I can't I've got photographs that's it and I think they're telling a story and the fact that he couldn't quantify it meant that essentially it was deemed inadmissible evidence basically because they couldn't quantify what the problem was and so he made the decision to launch the rest is history so the story is tragic on so many levels because it would almost be easier to accept a disaster like that if nobody had seen what could have been done that's what makes it so painful but on a second reading what makes it even more painful is the way the questions are being asked which is were they asking for him to assign a probability like I don't even understand what the question was quantify it what does that mean yeah I mean I think they want him to say at what temperature would it fail because the well it clearly had already failed so really this is a probabilistic question exactly yes but again that's not a linear question yeah right that's an asymmetry question that's the question of so-and-so has an actuarial risk of having a heart attack of 5.4% in the next decade should you take preventative measures I don't know I mean depends on your view of the world what's the upside what's the downside what's the risk of doing something about it versus the risk of not doing something about it those are very asymmetric risks yeah and I mean actually if you read the Rogers

[02:14:27] Commission which investigated the Challenger disaster Richard Fineman my middle son is named after him by the way okay so senna senna and Fineman are two heroes of mine and your daughter named after actually she's named after her grandmother okay who was also I'm sure an exceptional person there was a point where Fineman was asking this questions like this like what were you trying to get him to say they say well he couldn't quantify his KCM data and Fineman says when you don't have data you have to use reason and he was giving you reasons and there is a point at which they're trying to say well at this temperature based on this data the chances of failure should have been like one in a I don't know a fulfill iam some enormous number and findings like that's nonsense you had two cases that had like a small failure here and you're telling me it's basically impossible on a small finite number of launches yeah yeah and so obviously there was a lot of cover your ass stuff going and they even knew that at the time so there was this unusual on that conference call once

[02:15:21] Morton Thiokol said well our engineers saying don't launch we're gonna support that and then there was all this discussion and they went for an offline caucus where they said where they kept being asked for data quantify your case quantify your case quantified occasion they said we can't okay I guess we agree to launch and then they were required to do a sign-off that they didn't have to do in the past so obviously people were sort of in cya mode at some level or they felt protected by the process but yeah I don't think they weren't the best questions that they were asking I mean I think they wanted to know at what again what temperature we suffer catastrophic failure and the answer was that they didn't know but that things didn't look good and there was reason to be worried think about that question even through the lens of the financial crisis at what loan-to-value ratio at do you see a default or if you go through all the metrics it's like it's a probability distribution the only way you can really answer these questions is you can't answer them this way but the only way you can even get estimates of that is to run simulations across distributions assuming you even know how to predict the probability of failure which in that case I would argue they didn't even have that and spatial most complicated machine ever made maybe not as complicated as the credit system but I was complicated machine ever made not what ever 24 launches they all come back safely and you're right they didn't know and in fact when Morton Thiokol gave its first recommendation their initial recommendation was don't launch below 53 degrees because NASA wanted a temperature and I think the project manager thought that the whole shuttle was cleared from 33 to 99 so they were putting definite boundaries on it so they said don't go below 53 and they said well what's your reasoning for that they said well we've done 53 before and it came back and that actually totally backfired so basically they set the lower bound of what they'd already done and said don't go below it and so it backfired in the sense that they nasa had this very strong engineering culture of course it did it worked great up till then and so he said that's not science that's tradition that's not an answer you've departed from engineering give us an engineering story I don't say just do what we've done before and I get that like as Mary Shafer a NASA engineer later said perfect safety is for people who don't have the balls to live in the real world so you can it is a probability distribution you can't have perfect safety but I think their attempt to be prudent backfired because it was viewed as an emotional rather than a scientific case essentially but as Fineman said the data wasn't there so you have to start thinking about reason and that doesn't mean maybe they would have gone with the same solution but they had to start thinking about this problem in a different way than they were used to because usually they did have the data they needed to make a decision and in this case they didn't the other challenge of these case studies because it's easy to just stop there but we also don't realize in the 24 launches prior and the God knows how many launches that followed it including one more disaster by the way on reentry what's the denominator how many times did somebody first of all how many disasters weren't barely avoided maybe and at least another one on in the day there was 53 and could you ever have had a full consensus on any given day this is a great case study because it has so much the richness of the data that follow are there but we don't know if every time one of these things goes up there was also somebody in the room that said and by the way with perfectly good reason no way no way no way and here's the reason and if that's so is this the price we have to pay to live in an uncertain world or in retrospect was Fineman right and this one should have been averted using reasonable engineering insight yeah I think I think and it's so easy to say in retrospect of course these people are under incredible pressure they've had all successes in the past the astronauts know they're taking risks everyone knows they're taking risks but I do think there's a case to be made that this one should have been averted like voices were being raised and in fact I think one of the reforms that came you mentioned narrowly averting crisis before this the 53 degree launch I think one of the I spent a lot of time talking to the head of the rocket booster program I was reporting the book and I think was saying one of the changes that occurred was sharing information like that with the astronauts themselves because the feeling was had they known what happened with that o-ring then they would have said no no no no we're not ready to go you guys need to figure this out and so I don't know whether that whatever wouldn't do that's an interesting idea but I think maybe I think it's worth getting a different view when you're assessing that risk was it Atlantis that which was the one that burned upon re-entry Colombia Colombia so totally different issue had to do with adulterer that's I was gonna ask you was there a cultural similarity in the screw up totally or was it a different totally different type of miss cultural carbon copy in fact the investigation commissioned for the Columbia accident wrote in their conclusions this is so similar to the Challenger disaster culturally that we deemed NASA not a learning organization because they didn't learn from that experience and when I write about is they had this incredibly strong process culture essentially that was his sign like on the mission when one of the rooms had said in God We Trust all others bring data which is great like they were super rigorous but when they would get into these situations where you didn't have the data you wanted then continuing to sort of ask for it and follow these very strict procedures men they really kind of constrained their thinking like with

[02:20:34] Columbia there were engineers who said we'd like photographs of a part of the shuttle we think is damaged and so they went and asked a Department of Defense for those photos and their superiors not only blocked them but apologized to the Department of Defense for going outside of the normal process for trying to acquire things like that and so in both cases they kept sticking to this very rigid process we need an engineer case we need a quantitative case or these concerns like they're not being quantified and you're not going through the proper channels and so it doesn't count evidence and hunches kept being deemed inadmissible because they weren't part of the normal formal process and it happened an exact same way both times people suspected what was going to happen but because their concerns didn't fit into the normal procedural boxes they were discounted no we don't know the denominator we don't know how many times people had concerns that were completely unwarranted and would have thwarted so therein lies the challenge that's what Alan McDonald who was the head of the rocket booster program told me he's like look if we called off that launch for challenger people would be called as he said chicken littles because you have to be willing to take risk in the space program and you don't really get credit for not launching as I was going about to say let's assume they had not launched that day and they'd waited until the next day and it was warmer and they launched we wouldn't be having this discussion about it you're never a hero in that situation that's right and I think there's one sort of thing that I didn't try but that I think has been attributed a little wrongly where some people have said there was pressure on Morton

[02:21:59] Thiokol for sure more pressure because there was a civilian and this was more high-profile or what was the no for thiokol there was more pressure because nasod said they were gonna like open up the rocket booster contract got it but so people have said oh that pressure maybe that pressure was a problem but I call gave the initial recommendation not to launch so that they were okay not to launch and then they were pressed for the quantitative case so I don't think that pressure was definitive because they initially came with the recommendation of not to launch so speaking of stories in the book this is different but it's equally perplexing to me which is the firefighters and these guys who are doing these crazy jump rescue things it's not that I don't believe the stories I do but I I can't

[02:22:37] I'm trying to be empathetic to that situation and say where am i making a similar mistake in my life so spend a moment in explaining what that is yeah this comes from the work of a psychologist named Karl Weick who writes a lot about what he calls sense making like how do people collectively make sense of a dynamic situation and one of the things he noticed when he was studying wilderness firefighting teams hotshot firefighters who hike in how to dig trenches around wilderness fires or smoke jumpers who parachute into them is that they do a great job they're very reliable but sometimes something unusual happens like a fire jumps from one slope across a Gulch to another slope and starts chasing them uphill and when when unexpected things happen sometimes they have trouble and sometimes they die and when they die what he noticed was they tend the ones who died tend to die with their tools chainsaws drip torches axes whatever hundreds of pounds of equipment and the ones who survive or much fewer have dropped their equipment and run and in many cases the hotshots where firefighters will refuse orders to drop their tools and so I was going through like reports of some of these tragedies and you'd see victim is one hundred feet from safety still carrying chainsaw and drip torch and backpack and things like that and even accounts of survivors would say they'd be running they'd be looking for a place to put their they couldn't believe they were dropping their equipment because it was so central to their identity as a firefighter Norman MacLean who most famously wrote a river runs through it also wrote a book called the young men and fire and he wrote that being asked to drop your tool is like being asked to forget that you are a firefighter because that's your a whole group identity and all your training is built on never getting rid of your tools but an unfamiliar situation holding on to them kills you and so white used that as kind of an allegory for what he saw and other usually highly reliable organizations like commercial airlines where when things go as expected these very formal strict procedures work incredibly well but sometimes having done them so many times makes the organization rigid such that when things change and when it's obvious to an outsider that they shouldn't drop their tools and run they don't do it because they're so used to doing one thing and so what he was arguing for is how can we make training so that we have those reliable procedures but also so that people know they have to improvise and we can't train them exactly what to do for improvising necessarily although now they do get trained to drop their tools but who knows what the other how many people had to die to figure that out and again the more powerful part of that allegory is the what's my tool right what are the tools that I am lugging around that are probably helping me 99% of the time but 1% of the time not only are they not helping me but they could be catastrophic ly wounding me yeah I mean have you thought about this in your own life oh for sure in fact when I told that and this is not nearly as it sounds like there's so little gravity compared to this but when I was talking before about taking a fiction writing class I was trying to think about the joy of it and think about new structures or new structure for writing but what really came out of it was this thing when it said to me I'm using quotes in a stupid way because I've been writing investigative magazine articles for the last couple of years where you and the lawyers really want other people to explain stuff in their voice if they can but that's not good for this kind of book and I didn't even think about that it was not the right way to go about it until I was like knocked out of it by doing something different again that's not that's not anything on the level of tragedy but some of the other things

[02:25:58] Wieck wrote about working commercial airlines they have these incredible it's incredibly safe it's pretty remarkable actually but when there are problems it was usually the large majority of problems would be caused when a situation would change and the flight crew would do the thing they were used to anyway even though to like an outsider would become obvious that they had to shift what they were doing so I think it's this sometimes paradox of expertise where if you haven't learned to do some improvisation then you kind of get stuck doing similar things over and over you know you get like the typical when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail problem and I think there's plenty of that in medicine you could argue medicine is probably has more of that than anything else given the degree of specialization but also I think the tacit kind of it's the word I'm looking for sort of the air of invincibility not invincibility either is the sort of the I think part of it stems from the privilege of medicine which is like you can sit down with you could meet a person for the very first time in the emergency room and they'll take their clothes off and you're going to examine them and they'll tell you a detail about their life they've never told another human being there's just something about that that says well there's still something about this profession we place so much faith in and then by extension those in the profession start to project that faith on their own decisions so I think that coupled with the stakes coupled with the specialization I think probably creates a fertile environment for exactly that type of thinking now I mean I guess the last point I want to ask about on this particular issue is had those firefighters going back to this particular example been trained as lifelong firefighters versus they had been sampled across a much broader group of people coming in is the point of the story that that if you'd come in to that role having been an accountant working at Subway just pick a totally random distribution of people would it be more intuitive to that group to have dropped their tools that's a suggestion yeah that it would be and in fact what what why can McLean argued is that in the first of the famous disasters called a man Gulch fire a few people survived and the leader of the group he ordered people to drop their tools they refused the orders essentially except for the two that did survive and one of the things they pointed out was that he had a much broader training base he was used to doing lots of other things with tools not only firefighting and so they thought that he was we don't know for sure but the argument that they made was that he had had a much broader experience with tools so he did think of them as like only these things that he used in a certain way for firefighting and so in fact what he did to save himself was so he's ordering these guys at drop his tools most of them aren't he realized he wasn't gonna he was far down the gulch you realize he wasn't gonna be able to run away from the fire so he actually lit a fire in front of himself burned the grass and dove into the ash and the fire burned around him so he improvised and now people are trained for it to do that the idea that you would stop a fire by lighting a fire in the grass in front of yourself and that worked but so they made the argument that he was much better set up to improvise because he was used to improvising with tools David I could continue having this discussion for another couple of hours but I want to be sensitive to your time and so before we wrap is there anything that I feel like we've only scratched the surface frankly of these two books I actually thought we'd get through more but I guess that speaks to how long winded I am when I ask questions no you told me before we started that I could go on and be digressive and I told you that I'm naturally digressing so I took you up on is a perfect perfect it was match quality at its finest anything we didn't talk about in the last few minutes that you you want a chance to sort of discuss someone who became that I don't get asked about much in the book who became sort of a role model for me works not so far from here a woman named Frances

[02:29:48] Hesselbein who took her first real job at the age of 54 and I'll keep her story short here but basically she essentially became she became a CEO of the Girl Scouts and when she had one semester of junior college under her belt in her entire life but now has 23 honorary degrees she likes note and when she actually interviewed for the CEO position the people before her had had incredible leadership credentials captain Dorothy stratten was one she started the women's Coast Guard Reserve and was University Dean another was

[02:30:18] Cecily Kanan Selby a prominent scientist and leader in industry and education Frances Hesselbein one semester junior college leader of one of 355 local councils of Girl Scouts and again first professional job at age 54 and so she says no no I'm not taking that CEO job I'm never moving out of Pennsylvania she grew up in Johnstown and her husband says no I'll Drive in New York you can turn it down in person and so they asked her if you took over Girl Scouts this is late 60s Girl Scouts is in total crisis free-fall of membership and volunteers and what would you do if you took it over and she doesn't want the job she feels fine to say whatever she to speak her mind freely and she says the roll-out are sacrosanct handbook I'd replace it with ones that appeal to girls of different ages and start working on diversity if an indigenous girl near an ice floe in Alaska opens a book I want her to see herself in a girl scouts uniform she just goes through all this I sell some of the underused camp sites even though it'd be painful get rid of some of this home making stuff focus on educate girls about sex and drugs and math and science and all this and she's like well I was fun but I'm never here from then again of course she comes back I mean it's actually the early 70s when she was interviewing but so she gets the CEO job and totally transforms the organization turns the cookie business into like a third of a billion dollar business triples diversity representation adds a hundred and thirty thousand volunteers people she's paying in a sense of mission not in money and basically saves the Girl

[02:31:40] Scouts and she works every week I'm sure she's at her office right now because he works every weekday in Manhattan she's only 103 and a half so she has a lot of I'm sure she has a lot of place to go but I think she meant a lot of things to me one people can make an impact when they're older than they think they can she's now running the Frances Hesselbein

[02:31:57] Leadership Institute and teaching at West Point also she never expected to do any of the things she did every time she got offered an opportunity she'd say like nope I'm not doing it and then they tell her well then this Girl Scout troops gonna have to be folded sorry and she took five I'll do it for a month and would get to try it then be like wait I actually love this and that's everything she did so she's sort of short term planned her way through life and she had two sayings that really stuck with me one was leadership is a matter of how to be not a matter of what to do I think that's the powerful thing to think about so much about leadership is is being a good example not having to know everything sometimes I think we have this George Washington's standing up in the boat crossing the Delaware which I don't think that's an accurate depiction

[02:32:36] I think there's a real painting of him somewhere and obviously he's sitting down in the boat but it's like this idea that they know everything ahead they're clairvoyant it's like no they need to be a good example and part of that is admitting that you don't know stuff and the other was her saying was you have to carry a big basket to bring something home and she told me when she was at one of her first training events some woman complains she wasn't learning anything she Artie knew all this stuff and then this other woman told that saying to Frances and then it sort of became one of her mantras and I love that saying because I realized again it was part of this I don't wanna keep coming back to this online beginners fiction writing class I took but it was it was sort of the emphasis of hearing her say that I said sure I can take a beginners class and I realized there's like no amount of beginners classes I could take that I wouldn't learn something from because if you go in open-minded you'll learn something from it there was one day my my neighborhood

[02:33:25] I live in DC now where I noticed a bunch of increase in the population of wizards in my neighborhood and so I walked over a nearby hotel notice they were having like a Japanese conference formation conference yeah and they had a beginning Japanese comics writing class so I'm like I'll sit in on that probably not gonna write to Japanese comic but its structure and its story and narrative and dialogue and all this stuff you can't not learn from it so I'd it's just just made me realize that if you go into with that mindset you're just constantly learning something and so that's an approach I try to adopt two of those phrases really stuck with me and I am glad you told that story that is a beautiful story and I think it dovetails perfectly into this idea of being a lifelong student which I think well frankly that's sort of one of the things that's fun about a podcast so basically just an excuse to learn a whole bunch of stuff so I figured I mean you don't have to be doing this for any professional reason yeah well David thank you so much I really appreciate thanks for coming up to New
