Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins surgeon and New York Times bestselling author, returns to The Drive to discuss his latest book, Blind Spots: When Medicine Gets It Wrong, and What It Means for Our Health. In this episode, Marty explores how a new generation of doctors is challenging long-held medical practices by asking critical new questions. He discusses the major problems of groupthink and cognitive dissonance in the medical community and delves into several of the "blind spots" raised in the book, including treatments for appendicitis, the peanut allergy epidemic, misunderstandings about HRT and breast cancer, antibiotic use, and the evolution of childbirth. He explains the urgent need for reform in medical education and the major barriers standing in the way of innovative medical research. Throughout the conversation, Marty offers insightful reflections on where medicine has succeeded and where there’s still room to challenge historic practices and embrace new approaches.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Peanut allergy rates increased significantly after the 2000 recommendation for peanut avoidance [00:19:00]
- Ovarian cancer is primarily originating from fallopian tubes, not ovaries [01:13:09]
- Non-operative treatment of appendicitis is effective in 67% of cases [00:07:41]
- C-section rates have increased to around 30% in the US, with some private hospitals reaching 90% [00:58:23]
- Approximately 60% of outpatient antibiotics are unnecessary according to studies [00:38:04]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Question absolute medical recommendations without strong scientific evidence [00:24:18]
- Consider delayed cord clamping during childbirth (45-90 seconds) [02:07:08]

Context-specific Recommendations:
- Consider non-operative treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis [00:07:41]
