This clip is from episode #352 ‒ Female fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility and PCOS, and understanding the IVF process | Paula Amato, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- How IVF Actually Works – The process begins by stimulating the ovaries to produce multiple eggs, which are then retrieved and fertilized in a lab
- Why Egg Quality Matters Most – The success of IVF is heavily dependent on the quality of the eggs, especially as maternal age increases
- The Role of Genetic Testing – Embryos can be screened for chromosomal abnormalities using preimplantation genetic testing, though results aren’t always definitive
- Success Rates Drop with Age – The likelihood of IVF success sharply declines as a woman ages, particularly after 40, making early intervention crucial

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Okay. So, let's just walk through how IVF works and then we'll kind of dive into the ins and outs of of some of the nuances. So, um so a woman comes to you probably she's progressed through some layers of treatment, but you know, you've collectively come to the decision that this is hands down the best opportunity both for success and you know risk. Um so, how how does the treatment go? Yeah. So, typically we do a bunch of screening tests on both partners. That includes some blood tests, a semen analysis, an ultrasound to get some assessment of their egg number, the woman's egg number. And then when the cycle starts, takes about 2 to 3 months to complete a cycle of IVF. And when you say egg number, are you determining that through an AMH or through a physical examination of the ovaries? Both. So we do an ultrasound.

[00:00:47] We can count the number of follicles. How how small are these things? You know, a few millimeters. And you have the resolution to see that on an ultrasound. Yeah. Okay. And that gives you some sense of about how many eggs that particular patient will produce with ovarian stimulation. So anyway, when she's ready to start cycle, everything usually starts with their period. Usually we depending on the age again, but usually the patient starts on a couple weeks of birth control pills.

[00:01:14] What that does is kind of suppresses the ovaries because we want all the eggs to kind of grow at the same rate. Yeah. Stop the pill, then start the gonadotropins, which are the injectable. Yep. And they're injectable. They're just under skin kind of injections. So meaning hCG and FSH. Not a hCG, but primarily FSH with a little bit of LH.

[00:01:35] Okay. Okay. So you're on those for about 8 to 12 days. And then every few days while you're taking those medications, you have to come into the clinic for ultrasound monitoring and estradiol levels, blood levels. and we can monitor how many follicles are growing, how big they are, etc. Usually medications are pretty well tolerated. Um, typical symptoms, most common I would say is bloating as the ovaries get a little more enlarged.

[00:02:03] There's a small risk of something called ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome. When the ovaries get a little bit too stimulated, but that's exceedingly rare. Usually there's signs is happening. We can always back down on the dose. Sometimes patient doesn't make as many eggs as we were hoping. So sometimes we have to increase the dose or change the protocol, but usually we guess pretty right. And then um once the follicles are a certain size, that's how we know the eggs are mature because of course we can't see the eggs on the ultrasound.

[00:02:31] You can only see the follicles that contain the egg, right? So then the patient gets hcg which is another medication which kind of simulates her own LH surge. And the purpose of that medication, it causes the final maturation of the eggs. And if we did not do an egg retrieval, she would release all those eggs. But of course, we time the egg retrieval to happen just before the woman ovulates. So that medication is very timesensitive. And do you harvest the follicles in the fallopian tube or do you go right into the ovaries? In the ovaries. Yeah. Okay.

[00:03:06] So the egg retrieval is happens 2 days after the hCG trigger. Wow. Yeah. Yeah, I would have thought. So it it would have taken 2 days for her to 36 hours specifically. So she usually takes it in the evening and then the retrieval is is the the day after in the morning. Okay. So woman comes into your office a day two days later. Yep. And like walk me through this. So you lay her on a table, you've got an ultrasound on her ovary and you're literally putting a needle in there. Well, first of all, she's asleep. uh fully asleep or just local. Yeah.

[00:03:42] Yeah. So this is done in um surgery center typically or clinic with um anesthesiologist present IV sedation prop. So it's it's like a colonoscopy or dental extraction or something. It's all done vaginally actually using the ultrasound and that day there's a needle that's guided by the ultrasound that goes through the vagina into the ovaries. Yeah. So, you're looking where you're going with the ultrasound and you're using the needle to puncture the ovary, get into the follicles, and the the needle is attached to like a vacuum suction. And so, the fluid and the follicles collect it, goes through the needle into the test tube, and then that test tube is handed off to the embryologist. They look under the microscope and try and isolate the egg.

[00:04:28] Okay. So, how long does that procedure typically take? Half an hour. Okay. and you've got the embryologist next to you and he or she is under the microscope going check check check and he or she is validating that you indeed are getting ripened eggs and they look different presumably right like those are easy to identify under a light microscope basically they tell us they got eggs we don't know if they're mature yet we know nothing about them yet I see but long we get the eggs they go to the lab and then the rest of the process happens there.

[00:05:02] So at the at the retrieval we're just aspirating all the follicles trying to get as many eggs as possible. Uh tell me the time cores now and how you move from retrieval to fertilization. Right. So then the the eggs are sitting in the petri dish in the lab. So the embryologist transfers this to the media. Yep. Okay. Few hours later the eggs are inseminated. So with conventional IVF just put a bunch of sperm in there and let the fertilization happen by itself. With Ixie or intracytoplasmic sperm injection, the embryologist takes a single sperm and injects it into each egg. And the only time again you need to do Ixie is if the sperm is so dysfunctional that it can't even on its own with no barriers make its way to fertilization when placed in direct proximity of an egg. It probably could, but maybe there's too few sperm.

[00:05:54] So anytime there's a male factor, we tend to do Ixie. Any male factor, you go straight to Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And in fact, a lot of times it's done even when there isn't a male factor because fertilization rate is a little bit higher with Ixie compared to IVF. In very few cases, you don't get fertilization. So, you don't want to bind out, oh, by the way, your sperm can't fertilize your egg. That's the whole problem all along because then you got throw away the egg. So for again for a couple listening to us now, this is something they need to be talking about with their fertility doc, which is, hey, do you do Ixie out of the gate no matter what or Yeah, it's a little controversial because it adds cost. How much cost? You know, it's probably another,000 or 2,000 or something. No, probably a thousand. Okay. But so the data to be clear shows that Ixie and IVF have similar success rates for non-male factor. But I'm just telling you that a lot of times we're doing it anyway because we don't want to find out small very small percentage of cases that have zero fertilization. That's like not a good conversation. Catastrophic because you've lost those eggs too. Right.

[00:07:07] Right. Right. So that's part of the reason that we do it. So by the next day, usually we look at the embryos to see or the eggs to see if they're fertilized. Usually about 70% of the eggs fertilized. So let's say we get 10 eggs. You can expect maybe seven of them will be fertilized. And now there's seven embryos. So we discard the unfertilized eggs, continue to culture.

[00:07:31] Okay. So So how many day you go to 14 days of this? No. No. Uh five five days, five to six days. And depending if we're doing a fresh transfer or freezing the embryo. So a fresh transfer wheat. So you'll do both, right? We do both. Yeah. Although these days, most of the time we're freezing because you're doing genetic screening because we're doing genetic testing, right? So let's go through that example then. So we're culturing these embryos in the petri dish for 5 to 6 days. Then we look at them again. The ones that have made it to that stage, which is usually only half of them. So remember, you're seven now, maybe there's three or four. So what explains that? So most likely the ones that didn't make it are the chromosomally abnormal ones. Remember we talked earlier about those ones not making it. Well, they don't. And then how long does it take typically to get the genetic results back? Uh typically within a week or two. Okay. Yeah.

[00:08:23] And what depth of genetic testing is being done here? Are you doing whole genome sequence or are you just looking at a handful of snips that are pre-identified as the ones that matter? Yeah, good question. So, it's evolved over time and I should say it's still very controversial because there's always a risk of harming the embryos.

[00:08:46] You're only looking at a few cells. So, is it really representative of the embryo? I mean we do it a lot and the data definitely shows that if you transfer a normal embryo it has a very high chance of implanting but the issue is recently has been are we discarding embryos that are maybe normal uh because we think they're abnormal based on the genetic testing but the genetic testing is flawed. It's a whole So presumably genetic testing is really easy to identify annuployy.

[00:09:15] That's chromosomeal analysis is trivial. It's geared up to do that. Right. Okay. Right. So most of the time we're using something called next generation sequencing which is you know very high level sequencing but it's not whole genome sequencing. So you're getting targeted. Yeah. and you're looking mostly at chromosomeal abnormalities unless you know that the couple is a carrier for some genetic mutation that you also want to screen for. Yeah. So let's say one of the parents well this would be a bad example but cystic fibrosis like let's say both patients so both of them have are a carrier for CF and so there's a one in4 chance that you're going to get two copies of CF. So then you're looking directly for the CF.

[00:09:59] Exactly. Betathal Exactly. Uh cickle cell, there's a whole bunch of them, right? And part of the screening, we didn't mention it, but most people doing IVF will get carrier screening to see if they're carriers for any genetic mutations. Usually, that's a pretty common scenario where you have two people that are CF carriers, neither of whom have CF. They most of those people would say, "I'm gonna do IVF because I don't want to take the chance that my kid Okay. So, let's just say you're, you know, you harvested 15. Um, you fertilized 10, seven had good morphology. Mhm. Six came back genetically good." Okay. Those would be reasonable numbers. Yeah. The six out of seven is high. Yeah. Okay.

[00:10:40] So, so five came back genetically good, let's say, in a young person. Yeah. So you got onethird onethird of what you harvested you could implant. You're saying each of those is 70 to 75% success rate. And yet you would only implant one at a time. Yeah. Which is interesting because if you implanted two, let's do the math. You're talking about 50% chance. That's right. I was just going to say twins. Yeah. Which is high. Too high. We just can't take that risk. Yeah. I mean, you know, obviously, you know, we believe in patient autonomy. Patient usually gets to make that decision, but but you're going to you're going to make the case for why that's not not a great idea.

[00:11:20] Yeah. You want a healthy baby in the end. You want a healthy mom. Yeah. Okay. So, now let's talk about um now it's time to implant. So, how does that process work? So, that process is u much less complicated but equally important. Um so, usually does it's timed, right? It has to happen at a certain time in the cycle. So we either use the woman's natural cycle to time it and time it at the time that implantation would normally occur which is like the second half of the cycle or we use what we call a controlled or programmed cycle where we basically give the woman the hormones and then again time the transfer to happen at a specific time. Um the actual process kind of like a papsmear. It basically doesn't require any anesthesia or anything. We do do it under ultrasound guidance. So, abdominal ultrasound. We thaw one of the embryos, draw it up in a little catheter with a little syringe on the end, place a speculum in the vagina, and then just pass the catheter through the cervix. And we're looking on the ultrasound for the placement. And where are you implanting it? About one and a half centimeters to 2 centimeters from the top of the uterus. And then are you done or are you still doing ongoing hormone therapy? Um, sometimes we give supplemental progesterone. That's another hormone that helps maintain the pregnancy. And then usually, you know, 12 to 14 days later, the patient has her first pregnancy test. Hopefully, she's pregnant. We usually follow the pregnancy for the first few weeks before and then she transfers to her nonvid.

[00:12:51] Yeah. Wow. Um, it's just kind of amazing that this all works. Yeah. It I've been doing it for 30 plus years and I still find it fascinating. I'm Peter Atia.
