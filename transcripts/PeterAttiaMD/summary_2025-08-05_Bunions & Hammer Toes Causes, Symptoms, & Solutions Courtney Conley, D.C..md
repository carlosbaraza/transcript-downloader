This clip is from episode 296 ‒ Foot health: preventing common injuries, enhancing strength and mobility, & picking footwear

In this clip, they discuss:

- What Is a Bunion, Really? – It’s not just a bump—it's caused by transverse instability, where the bone at the base of the big toe shifts outward
-  Why So Many Have Bunions – A loss of foot control, often at the junction of the midfoot and forefoot, leads to that telltale bony protrusion
- What Are Hammer Toes? – Toes 2–5 start “hammering” the ground due to muscle imbalance between short and long toe extensors and flexors
-  Footwear’s Impact Is Massive – Toe boxes that don’t allow the toes to splay are a major contributor to bunion formation
-  The Real Fix: Strengthening, Not Surgery – Strengthening foot muscles and using the right footwear is more effective than just pinning bones
