## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something

[00:02:13] I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:17] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is Mark SGA mark is considered one of the greatest hockey players of all time he had a career that spanned 25 years in the NHL and he's played the second most games of any player second only to Gordie Howe and there's an interesting story that we'll get to in the podcast about how close he came to that record he's also the second leading all-time scorer of all time or as he likes to put it the first leading all-time scorer amongst mere mortals with Wayne Gretzky being the only one who scored more than he did it would take me too long to kind of go through all of marks professional accolades six times

[00:04:33] Stanley Cup champion the only person to captain two different teams to win a Stanley Cup the Edmonton Oilers and the New York Rangers in addition to all the number of all-star games he's played in and the number of MVPs that he's won etc I wanted to talk with Mark about a number of things today I wanted to talk about his career and this is kind of a boyhood dream of mine to speak with one of my heroes who have had the privilege of getting to know over the past couple of years but also I wanted to just talk about Mark's philosophy in life and leadership and amazing transition he has made and the ease with which it seems he's been able to transition out of the limelight into his family life in his work outside of hockey we touch on many things here but we do sort of go through it chronologically and I think if you're a hockey fan this is a no-brainer for you but I would encourage you even if you're not a hockey fan to listen to this one I think you're gonna get a lot out of it I think I was really on the edge of my seat honestly during so many parts of this and even though a lot of those stories I knew but I don't think I really appreciated growing up watching mark was the subtlety in the maturation process that came along with his leadership and his growth as an individual you know I almost forgot that he he entered the the NHL at the age of 17 or 18 years old which seems almost unimaginable today I'll leave it at that and without further delay please enjoy my conversation with Mark Messier mark thanks so much for coming into the city today good to be here with you how often do you come into New York City these days actually quite often especially with the emerging Kingsbridge project up in the Bronx we'd set up an office down on 21st Street and what's coming in for at least a couple years at least four times a week and then Ranger games and other charitable initiatives and dinners and meetings New York is still friendly

[00:06:26] I'm a regular on the on the subways and trains now yeah I was about to say I mean you know you took the subway in today - most days - someone recognized you on the train every day on the train coming in from Greenwich then on the subways obviously takes a lot of selfies on this but it doesn't get old it's just amazing you know almost twenty years later the passion that's still in the city and the people that were involved with the

[00:06:50] Rangers that year if not actually there during the regular season in the playoffs and of course it Stanley Cup in 1994 so yeah this is 25 years which went t 25 year yeah it is hard to believe actually where we had a reunion last year we couldn't believe it's been actually 25 years yeah we were talking before we started this podcast about even just it seems like you didn't retire 14 years ago or whatever it was 15 years ago like it seems I guess that's what happens when we get older time goes seems to be going by quicker life does not stand still that's for sure especially when you have kids you can see the growth obviously every year and it's fun though every stage of the development of the kids has been amazing being a part of their lives and being retired so I can be home for that has been incredible so yeah I've enjoyed retirement but still when you start actually reminiscing and talking about my career it's hard to believe I've been retired now almost 14 years we'll talk a lot about your career but I mean I think one little factoid that's always worth mentioning is the length of it right it's that I mean you played in the NHL for 25 years correct 25 years in the NHL 26 years as a professional started when

[00:08:03] I was 17 and the that's back when they had to WH a which was a secondary league a lot of the NHL errs Wayne Gretzky Craig Hertzberg they used to called it was it was a big race to sign the underage players back then especially for the Debbie AJ who was competing with the NHL so I was able to play as a 17-year old for two teams and I have the distinction of being the youngest player ever to fold a professional franchise in hockey but since in that or the

[00:08:31] Indianapolis racers I played five games and they folded went home back to Edmonton for a couple weeks and then Cincinnati signed me about two weeks later it's interesting to look back at because that's as you know because we've talked about this before but I mean the others were my team growing up even though I grew up in Toronto I mean one the Leafs were just such a bad team in the 80s that hard to be a Leafs fan but also Edmonton was just the most exciting team in hockey so I remember those early 80s years and those were I think it's unless you're in a real hockey diehard I don't think most people remember what the Oilers were like in the 80s like what it was like to have Gretzky Messi a curry coffee low furor Anderson like that all of those guys were on one team yeah like like free agency wouldn't permit that today right it would be hard to keep the players for as long as we did but just to put it in perspective

[00:09:29] I used to travel a lot in the summertime I had the travel bug and went all over the world and the Oilers literally in Wayne Gretzky and put Edmonton on the map and it wasn't anywhere we didn't travel that someone didn't know where Edmonton was because of the hockey team which was always kind of gave you a sense of pride just because of what we were able to accomplish but also what we were able to do in the in the sporting world that was being recognized with people all over the world that was eye-opening for me coming from Edmonton and traveled a bit with our family but once I started really going abroad and that really hit at home with that we were doing something special and actually we had a really special team with some amazing players that were being recognized around the world so you grew up how close to Edmonton I know you're from Alberta right yeah so

[00:10:16] Edmonton Alberta was grew up great were you in a suburb of Edmonton er eventually but when I first came back my father was playing hockey in Portland Oregon for the Portland buckaroos I think we moved back in 1968 he came back and taught school I think I came back and was going to grade one or two or straight around there and then rate about when I was turning or getting into greater to go to grade four we moved out of Edmonton to st. Albert which was just a small community at the time just north of the city finished my schooling there and played junior hockey till I actually signed as a seventeen year old to go to the WH a so when did you start playing hockey well I think like everybody else

[00:11:00] I started skating fairly early but I think my first organized hockey team was pretty much like everybody like rate at six years actually started in Hemet or in Portland my father started the whole minor hockey league programs in Portland they didn't have kids hockey back then he was responsible for really getting the whole minor hockey league system up and running in Portland Oregon how did it fit into other sports and other activities you were doing was it one of those things where you know everybody talks about Wayne's story where he's two years old he like basically you can't stop him from playing right it's like he won't come in from the rink he's taking shots on his grandmother in the kitchen was it like that for you or was it just another sport that you played in addition to baseball oh I loved it I loved hockey you know back when I played it was it was completely different you know we played hockey in the wintertime we had a hundred and twenty hour program we had two practices two games a week we didn't travel to tournaments everything was rated in Edmonton and when this winter or the spring came we played you know baseball or soccer or so we played multiple sports and if you talked to

[00:12:06] Wayne and you and you listen to what he talks about is is that he was a great athlete and the other way that was played all sports he played baseball he's a great baseball player is a great lacrosse player and he played hockey in the wintertime and that's the way it was now it's kind of been more professionalized at an early age which some good dispute is not the most healthy thing for kids but this the way it is now and yeah what do you think of that I mean my reading of the literature so this is a very academic view of this not as my kids aren't in Southern

[00:12:33] California hockey's not even on their radar even though obviously lots of kids in SoCal do play hockey but it would seem that the approach that you took was a better approach actually which is a broader sampling of sports and developing a broader set of athletic abilities before ultimately sort of narrowing your focus I mean that looks to be the better formula but it's not what's typically happening today is it's not and I think because of it it puts a lot of pressure on on the parents both on a time issue for parents and the pressure puts on the rest of family but also on the financial by having to travel consistently to different places to play tournament hockey and and whatnot but until you get to the age of 14 is really the kind of the age where kids start separating themselves into what they really want to do and they're more focusing on what they want to do but up until then I've always believed that it's great to try a lot of different sports and become a better athlete total a total better athlete in all regards and I think the science would probably prove that and there's all kinds of examples of some hockey players that actually made it to the NHL that didn't really start playing hockey till they were 14 or 15 years old which debunked the myth of that you have to be playing hockey 365 days from the time you're two years old to the time you get drafted it's just not the case you got to be blessed with a god-given talent toward in order to make it and then at the right time you have to hone those skills and you have to have the desire and the passion to put the work in but there's a lot of kids that go through that whole process that never do make it so where is that fine line and that balance that's really healthy for the family structure healthy for the kid and give him the best opportunity to fulfill his own dreams so what's the earliest memory you have of your dad playing because I I gotta believe that that sort of at least planted a seed in your mind or no question I remember I was not wasn't even in school yet and we were living in Portland Oregon and my father would take me with him to his practices sometimes I probably was maybe 4 3 4 years old and then we'd be able to go skate on the ice in Portland before his practice started so you know I have very early memories of him playing I I can honestly say I don't really actually remember him being on the ice in a game vaguely we got some old pictures and some old videos that we watch once in a while but no question him being a hockey player really cemented the passion and it's amazing how much he learned sitting around the kitchen table talking about hockey when you have a parent that was so entrenched in the game itself not only only as a player but as a coach and as a mentor to a lot of young kids after his retirement when did it start to make sense to you that like this thing that you loved doing or one of several sports you liked doing you actually could do this as your job I mean how old were you in that because yeah you know I always played up my brother was four years older than me or three years older yes so when we moved back from Portland to Edmonton Paul was basically a peewee

[00:15:41] I think he was ten years old or somewhere in there I was seven so my dad was coaching and he didn't want to go to two different practice times and took different rank so he just put me on the team and so I was always playing against older kids a joke was I had a career as a peewee I think it played for years as a peewee but I was never really that great growing up might like the game I always watched Hockey Night in Canada did all the things that most kids do when they love a sport I guess you know

[00:16:10] I didn't have very much success as a banham I think one of my Banham years or one of my years we'd won one game the whole time of the whole year so individually I wasn't really kind of standing out maybe because I was playing against older kids but do you remember if you were Hessel having fun oh yeah oh yeah I felt about Oh lovely lovely and oh yeah I loved it loved it oh yeah never question about my dad was really cool about practices and all that he would he always knew if I was just being lazy or if I really just needed not to go because of tired school whatever so there's never any pressure in that regard to go to the rinks but we would besides our practices we would go with our friends and play outside and that's what we would do on the weekends when we weren't playing I mean that's how we spent our time at the outside rinks with their buddies and sipping hot chocolate and playing shinny I had a real passion for the game but I had a passion for all sports I love being outside playing thrown soccer football lacrosse I might ride them all wasn't that great in any of them there but certainly had the passion for hockey and it was probably if looking back and it was my probably my main sport so when you're what 12 13 14 did anything start to change at that point in terms of your not just play I was a slate developer I didn't really start growing at 15 I think I had a look growth spurt I shot up to like 5 9 and 150 pounds I actually made that next fall after turning in 15 in January the next fall I made the junior team which at a 15 was was pretty good by that time

[00:17:42] I was maybe growing a little bit more but I was a late developer physically you know I played four years of junior when I finished jr. a 6-1 couple hundred pounds and that's when I left to go play probe so when I was right around 14 I really started to kind of I used to practice my dad's junior team they're all twenty-two you know you know fifteen to twenty years old when I was younger and trying to do all the drills and catching up but

[00:18:09] I was you know I was working hard but I couldn't really generate any speed and my dad was come on he got a skate skate skate and I was in my own mind I felt that I was skating but all of a sudden I started getting it's growing and getting stronger all of a sudden my stride getting started getting longer started getting more speed and everything just started to fall into place once I turned 15 and and became a junior Augie were you weight training at the time what kind of tough day start weight training till I was 15 you know at that time you know the conventional wisdom he had to wait a certain time to your growth plates and all that I think is still true to today we had an assistant coach my after my first year of junior who befriended one of the world's strongest men on the contest huge guy and he had brought home a program that he did and it was Monday Wednesday Friday three hour sessions and you know we just used to lift hit it's all changed now but back then it was heavy weights and you know we couldn't even lift our arms up to wash our hair after in the shower it was one of those real beefy big weight heavy weight weightlifting programs but it that really really really cemented it for me

[00:19:19] I love the workout I could see the changes happening there so between getting the power on the ice so I could skate faster and handle myself and it really all started to kind of come together for me at that rate around that 15 years old age so you're 17 you're in the WH a which as you pointed out a moment ago I mean the whe absorb was absorbed at least four of the teams I think were absorbed by the NHL when the

[00:19:44] WH a folded but there were a lot of great players in the WH a I mean many stars in the NHL came out of that league what was it like back in the late 70s was the idea that you play in the WH a and then eventually go to the NHL or was it a totally parallel path that you pick one or the other no not really it was just a lot of under ages being signed by did the NHL had a cap on what you could sign at the time no there was no cap nothing like that at the NHL and the NHL wasn't too happy about losing these young great players to the lake Gretzky to the wh a so it was a little bit of tenuous relationship obviously between the two leagues the debicki folded for those teams went I think was when a big Quebec

[00:20:25] Edmonton and Hartford joined the NHL from Solon from a 16 team to a 21 team and I think that City to the team in Kansas if somebody became I can't remember I can't remember now my trajectory was I was gonna go follow my brother's footsteps to a college scholarship to Denver University so I had kind of a verbal commitment from

[00:20:50] Marshall Johnson at the time who was scouting the Western teams and jr. and that felt like a great great idea and so I stayed in in jr. B which gives you the ability to go play college hockey instead of the major junior where you can't it takes your eligibility away so that was what I was planning on doing and all of a sudden the opportunity came to go play in the DHA and I was kind of getting bigger and stronger and obviously looking back I was wasn't never ready to go play pro hockey as a 17 year old but I can also say it was a great experience what did your folks say what did your mom say about that specific think my mom was too happy about it my dad was a little more he kind of realized that I was at the point of it was my fourth year of junior hockey I was kind of playing pretty well at that particular time for that league

[00:21:40] I couldn't go to college yet I had to finish the year and so I was kind of stuck in this kind of place but it was playing gonna take that college eligibility away I'm assuming a year in the whe oh yeah oh yeah I don't wait a girl I know I became assigned a contractor he became a pro without that dad wiped out the college yeah was that a hard decision to make for you personally I would have liked to have gone to college but for me it just seemed to be the right thing for me at the time emotionally and for what I was really trying to accomplish I wanted to be a pro hockey player at that time I'd kind of thrown everything into the ring so you know and someone's going to sign you and give you some money to go play hawky didn't seem like didn't seem like a bad idea kind of amazed how small many of those contracts were at the time I mean Gretzky had I think a huge contract with the Indianapolis racers that ultimately got bought by the Oilers well it wasn't big but but relative to wh a relative to the well don't Bobby Hill sign for a million dollars back in the early 70s which was huge money or anybody back then so they were giving some money out to get try to get some wreck wasn't Gordie Howe in the WH a at this point as well Gordie Howe I played against Gordie Howe into wh a because he was playing for the Whalers at the time he was looking for the way there's yeah and they had a bunch of old Boston

[00:22:51] Bruins Davey ki on Johnny McKenzie I mean I watched these these guys play on Hockey Night in Canada my whole life and Here I am as a 17 year old wh a planning against Gordie Howe and Johnny McKenzie and Dave Keon and all these amazing players that had watched for years in the NHL that had finished their careers and then WH a so it was amazing actually remember the first time you met Gretzky

[00:23:13] I do I always tell the story when I was flying from Edmonton to go play for Indianapolis was shortly after he was got traded with Peter Driscoll and Eddie meal and he was on a plane flying from Indianapolis to Edmonton and so our paths crossed in the air and so I didn't meet Wayne other than playing against him I didn't meet him until training camp when the league's folded I was drafted by Edmonton and then we met at training camp in 1979 and that would be in the NHL now that was in the energy so you guys didn't meet I didn't realize that I thought you guys crossed paths in

[00:23:46] WH a but you actually didn't really meet til you were both now no I was playing in an Indy appleís they folded then I went to Cincinnati to finish the year for 52 games and Wayne was got traded to Edmonton so we played against each other but didn't know each other and how many of the other sort of foundational players of the Oilers came in that merger who else was there was fewer there no fear didn't get drafted till 82 years into our and here run yeah and your hurry came later he came maybe the second after the set the second draft what about low low was the first draft for the oven - no there's yeah Kevin was the first draft ever of the Edmonton

[00:24:23] Oilers back in 1979 80 draft I think curry came the next year grant and Paul Coffey came the second year with curry curry was like a fourth fifth rounder then grant was drafted early in the third year and so we basically that whole team from the draft came together and those so Andy mug was the goalie coming out of WH a Danny mugged no he didn't come till later either he was playing you know it came from Penticton was playing major junior he got there before grant he came the second year when we upset the Montreal Canadiens yes which was 1981 was in 1981 I think our goalie got hurt or Glen Sather put him in on a whim and and they stole the show as a rookie goalie that was back when I mean a lot of people don't remember what the NHL looked like back then but in my recollection I was only eight years old but I was still obsessed won played 16 - played 15 like it was done like a sweet 16 independent of conference wasn't it absolutely 21 team league 16 made the playoffs aid from each conference and you seated yourself depending on your waist during the regular season and so

[00:25:30] Edmonton gets in their 16th the top seat is the Montreal Canadiens the second year first year we played Philadelphia we made the playoffs the first year we had to win nine of the last 10 games of the regular season our first year just to make the playoffs and of course Philadelphia was a team who we played they beat us in I think they beat us three straight back then over the first series yeah the first versus the best-of-five if best-of-five so they beat us pretty handily they had it they had a really good team and then it's that second season which is 81 82 if I'm 80 81 eighty eighty one yeah sorry you guys a Mont Royal Canadian you upset the Canadian we upset the

[00:26:05] Canadians which was one of the most to this day one of my best experiences playing hockey that whole series against Montreal and I can't remember everything that happened but I just remember coming home and people can google it and it's the impossible dream they we were under the in the dressing room obviously waiting to be come out onto the ice and they played a video with the song impossible dream within with all the highlights cuz we won the first two games in Montreal and coming home to close it out to this day it makes it here in the back of my necks to end up of how energized that city was was that the moment you realized that you were gonna win a Stanley Cup whether or not that year but when was the moment when you thought this is a really special group of people well it wasn't quite that soon but I think what we all recognize that Wayne was on a different trajectory than most any other hockey player to ever play the game and the chances of Wayne win a Stanley Cup were gonna be pretty good and if we all played her cards right and we're able to grab an oar and start rowing and fill-a-need on the team our chances increased significantly if we could follow Wayne so and that's true that's the way we felt Wayne was completely different than any hockey player he was chasing records books he wanted to smash every record that it was ever made well 81-82 is sort of a crazy year because those are some of my really first memories of hockey so I grew up in

[00:27:36] Toronto so you guys always were two hours behind us so those we'd to watch an euler game you know it was really a big ask of my mom I mean I thought I do my mom's permission to stay up late because you guys weren't starting your games until 9 p.m. Toronto time no school night that a school night but but

[00:27:54] I would beg and plead and I think my mom just gave up I mean it was just like Oh for heaven's sake it was must watch TV you know I think he won that he tied Marcel Dionne his first year with 165 points and then the second year I think he smashed it with 190 some points and wanted going away and then on to 215 points to 12 and then yes whoo 15 you know scoring 50 goals and 39 games well it's that that that night I remember so do you remember that night in Edmonton against Philadelphia when he's got 45 goals going into the 39th game and at that point everybody knows 50 and 50 is gonna go down but nobody knows it's gonna be five goals in one night everybody's just trying to anticipate where to be and where to get tickets and when it's gonna happen but nobody going to that rink that night thought he was gonna score five goals against the

[00:28:43] Philadelphia Flyers the big bad tough Philadelphia Flyers there were no way they're gonna let that happen and sure enough he did he scored five goals and Pete Peters and what an amazing time to sit there and watch that genius on a day-to-day basis and very how often in anybody's life can they look at one of their own peers a guy that it's your same age and look up to him as a role model but that's what

[00:29:07] Wayne was for us he was so far ahead of us in his own mental preparation and the way he prepared for games and both physically and mentally and his ambition of what he wanted to do in the game of hockey all those things were just so far superior and then to be able to sit there and watch how he practiced in his practice habits and how he prepared for games and and it was just remarkable to have someone like that to learn from I want to understand that a little bit more because I think most people are familiar with you as one of the greatest leaders in hockey I mean you are the only person to captain to Stanley Cup teams you've captain Edmonton to a

[00:29:46] Stanley Cup in the absence of Gretzky and then you captain the Rangers to a Stanley Cup and no one's done that before or since and yet what I'm hearing you say is some of your early sort of lessons in leadership came from watching Gretzky well not only Wayne but a lot of people obviously my father who was a great mentor and role model for not only myself and my brother and my sisters but also a lot of hockey players at a coach he was a great coach a great mentor and then all the people that helped you along the way and then you and you need to turn pro and then you start watching other players and you started watching and listening to coaches and you started filling up your bag with all this experience and so you kind of learned through successes and failures of what actually works for you as a player and as a person so you're kind of collecting all this data you know all the way along

[00:30:36] Wayne just happened to be a teammate that was obvious to everybody that he was gonna be become the best hockey player to ever play the game he proved it as a kid from the time he was four years old to the time he was in junior hockey there's a time he turned pro and here he is you know scoring 200 15 points unheard of numbers in any sport no matter how you compare it to it's worth pausing on that for a moment because I don't think a non hockey fan can put in perspective what Wayne Gretzky did during about a seven-year run from 81 to 88 right what you just described to my knowledge no player has ever scored more than 200 points in a season Gretzky averaged that for seven consecutive seasons yeah I know you're probably true

[00:31:24] I know it that he had you know 215 212 205 202 a few times 190 mean there was years when he was winning the scoring title on assists alone yeah the only guy that I can actually say that was you could even talk about Wayne in the same breath net regard as far as that offensive genius would be Mary Mary Onew yeah Muriel had some injuries early on and so he never had that consistency that Wayne did but he would be the only guy that I could even think about comparing to to have that you know offensive genius a you that exists in a guy that was able to do that it was amazing having that kind of role model there rate for a guy that was my own age that's right because you guys are both born in 16 days old 8 days old

[00:32:08] I remember reading a funny story once and again it can be totally BS because it was just miss blown out of proportion but early in your days and Edmonton you you sort of got in trouble for something I did you fail to show up to a practice or you just did you discipline for something very early in your time in

[00:32:23] Edmonton yeah I was living at home my first year Pro and punctuality at that time in my life was probably wasn't my best asset but this one was actually harm you were super punctual today so yeah whatever lessons learned lessons learned is taken a while but I was living at home and my mom was driving we're leaving on a extended road trip and so I packed my bag and my mom was driving me to the airport and she asked you know cuz at back then there was two airports in Edmonton there was a downtown airport and there was one out in the suburbs the International Airport and I told her that we were coming back into the Municipal Airport for whatever reason we just didn't think about it we drove to the Municipal Airport once so when I got out of the car and she dropped me off this is back in the day with no cell phones or anything I looked around and normally you see the change in trench coats and their bags and everybody huddled together waiting on their tickets and I didn't see any kind of a sign that you'd normally see so my heart started beating a little quicker and sure enough

[00:33:23] I looked at the itinerary and we were leaving to Detroit from Edmonton International so my heart sank I quickly jumped in a actually I went in to end phone on a payphone and phone the the euler office and his secretary said no problem mark there'll be a ticket waiting for you at the counter at the Air Canada counter so when I got to in a taxi and got out to international went up to desk and got my ticket except it wasn't going to Detroit it was going to

[00:33:50] Houston I was being sent down to the home I to the farm team to teach me a lesson so that was a tough moment for me at that time knowing that my Vista flight and was being sent to our farm team I spent two weeks down there played five games and they called me back up thankfully but that was not a fun experience but that must have had that must have left an impression I mean that's a pretty harsh lesson well you think it would have there was a couple other ones along the way that had to cement the lessons but what you realize is that when you're playing on a team and you're in a team format nothing is about you as an individual it's all about what's best for the team and your time is not your own it's a team's time and you have to be respectful of that so there's a lot there was a lot of lessons for me growing up as a young adult in a professional environment that doesn't always happen but when you turn professional 18 years old you grew up quickly in those days I mean even by today's standards I mean Gretzky was tiny how explicit was it that someone on that team or some group of guys on that team needed to make sure that he didn't get hurt well back then that's where the game was played anyways I mean it was a completely different set of rules of what was acceptable behavior and in

[00:35:09] National Hockey League it was tough hockey you know just know long before that there was still bench clearing brawl during the game you know I memmer had in the deadweight a my last year as a 17 year old having three bench clearing brawl in one game and insane and big big tough guys I'm looking up to so yeah I think every team had a lot of muscle on their teams and everybody had to stick up for each other you had to be able to count on your teammates for protection everybody had to be a cohesive unit and and everybody had the answer to bail for the protection of the entirety of the team not to mention something of Wayne's caliber because he was obviously targeted in many different ways and we had to be there to help him get through an 82-game schedule so let's fast forward to your first Stanley Cup final 83 against the Islanders Islanders have won three consecutive Stanley Cups right now Mike Bossy Bryan Trottier Billy

[00:36:08] Smith who I hated if your honors fan you hated Billy Smith right and it's now basically you guys are gonna try to stop their fourth consecutive Stanley Cup how well do you remember that series I remember every series I ever played but that one in particular because how much respect we had for the Islanders and don't forget two years before that we had taken him to six games and we didn't even know we were doing back then and we were just doing it on sheer talent and adrenaline and youthful exuberance and at that point I mean the average age of the Edmonton Oilers is probably 20 to 23 well we had some you veterans that mixed in with some of our young guys so there was a good mix of vets and and some young guys but we didn't have as much talent then as we ended up having the first year we won but we still had a good team and of course any team with wayne on it was x-factor so you make it to the finals and remember what the oddsmakers said going into that finals but I certainly remember as a kid it was like the Oilers are definitely gonna win this boy feel good about it yeah so we had suffered some painful losses on our way to that first down the cup final you know losing to LA being up five nothing in the in the deciding game there was a lot of painful lessons along the way of what it took to win and we were on the trajectory and we were taking those defeats and those failures and really implementing into our game and so by the time we got to the Stanley Cup final we felt pretty good about our game we didn't realize how much of a cohesive unit the Islanders had become by winning three straight Stanley Cups there was a huge disparity about where they were as a team and how they played as a team compared to where we were it was not even in the same league and they pretty much dismantled us even with the great Gretzky they dismantled us in four games and that was a real eye-opener for us that if we're gonna take this to the next level there we have to figure out first of all how to play much better defense of hockey and then be able to recognize what teams are trying to do to us and then be able to counterbalance that very quickly in game and make in-game changes and alterations to the style of play we're playing so it became a real chess game after that for us we realized we were playing checkers and they were playing chess and we had a lot of catching up to do in that regard do you remember leaving the arena on the night of that they won the Cup yeah that's a much often told story I mean you can only imagine nowadays a team winning four straight Stanley Cups and the toll that would take on a team not only as a team but on every individual and we did we walked by their dressing room and expecting a big celebratory champagne fest and 'muslim were just sitting around quietly around their stalls by this time with ice packs on their bodies in that that told us that we weren't paying the price that we needed to in order to win a Stanley Cup so a lot of lot of lessons lot of lessons leaving that rank that night in that playoff series there that we came back to next year and started implementing very early on in training camp you talked about like any professional sport would like to take hockey for example there's 21 teams well 20 of them end the season as losers right I mean there's just you know there's only one team that's gonna win the Stanley Cup so there's 20 teams that either don't make the playoffs get booted out earlier or like the Oilers did in that case get booted out at the very last moment but it would seem to me that losing in the way that you guys did and four straight as you said just getting just getting your asses handed to you makes that a very long summer I'm sure there's a party that just cannot wait to come back we didn't fall didn't see it coming because we had actually taken him to six games two years that's right and so we felt good about the matchups and we felt and we knew what we're getting into we knew the players it wasn't like they surprised us from a player standpoint but what they really surprised this worth for with is how they're able to take our strengths away and expose our weaknesses and pretty much completely take us off our game and a game that we like to play they never allowed us to get into our rhythm and that high paced high temple game that we were so used to and customed to playing and we realized that if we're gonna beat the Islanders there we had to beat him in the streets in the alleys and eventually we're able to do that the next time around but what is it what one say there say after that fourth game do you remember what was said in the locker room when you guys lost at that time not much to said it's a long year everybody's nerves are pretty fragile everybody's emotions are high it's not really the time to start kind of dissecting what had happened I think we all kind of had to live with it ourselves throughout the summer and then come back and start to address it and and that's what we did and to everybody's credit they came back with even more vigor and and determination to get it to the next level and went sure enough we were able to and it's kind of amazing so the next season 83 84 you guys face the Islanders again in the final and now it's there they're going for five consecutive Stanley Cups and it was easy for them they had to win an amazing series that gets Pittsburgh and scored and overcame seven overtime to get there so you can imagine it's it's amazing actually to this day it's incredible that they made it - we won five cups and in seven years but to win five straight is incredible so I think I have a good understanding of what it took on you as a physically as a person but also as a team and sure enough there we were they were again now if I recall you guys won Game one close they won

[00:42:05] Game two not close it was kind of a blowout game - wasn't it - it's pretty good yeah - yeah and then you won the next three and it was I always thought like I just what do you remember about the psychology of those last three games that that was the passing of the baton that was one dynasty to the neck it was to this day was so amazing to see that team hang on to that championship banner and how hard they fought to really initiate you would think at some point you know we could have just willed it away from them that we couldn't they would not relent their grasp on it and it was all we could do in that third game to win that third game once we won that third game I think it kind of was the start of kind of the wear and tear of them starting to kind of show and then our confidence went this way and they were beaten up and tired and then we were able to win the next games not easily but pretty handily but to this day I give those guys so much credit because they would not let go of that that mantle of being soundly kept champions and it was so much pride and hard work had gone into it there and it was just even as no I think they knew in their hearts that their time had come it was just devastating I think they just were so devastated that they finally lost there but it was a great lesson in humility and in sportsmanship and what a real pride a champion has to watch those guys go through that whole fifth year or trying to win a Stanley Cup four five times room now going into Game five when you guys are at home if you win the game you win the Cup which you go on to do was there even a tiny bit of a thought in the back of your mind that not only could you guys win this thing tonight which I guess there was that thought but that you could be the MVP of the playoffs was that even something you never never even thought of that you know every time we allowed ourselves the night before to think about maybe we might win the Stanley Cup it just was overwrought with fear of losing that game and given him a chance to get back in the series yeah we were terrified of the Islanders we knew how good a team they were and even though they were banged up we knew how dangerous they were and we and if you lose Game five you're back to New York to play Game six before you know it Game six and Game seven yeah yeah you could be hosed if you lose that game it was not a good thought going all the way back there for a number of reasons but none more than then we were terrified of getting this close and not finishing off where does that first Stanley Cup first of your six ranked in terms of the emotion you felt when that final buzzer went well I get asked that question often to vote you know what was the best Stanley Cup and I can only say that every Stanley Cup had so many of their own unique story lines because there was always different players and he's obviously the first day on the cup growing up watching it being delivered to a team every year from the time I can remember watching TV to the time that I actually had a chance to do it ourselves was a huge moment both from every individual on the team and then collectively what we had gone through to get there so that was that was incredible but then the next year it was the same kind of feelings again because of how hard we had to work and different set of circumstances different set of motivating factors that led into the team and and then the same thing happen all the rest of them and the next year was Pelle Lindbergh right that was the year you played you faced Pelle

[00:45:37] Lindbergh was in the 84 85 Stanley Cup right it was the 84 it was the 85 Stanley Cup against Philadelphia you go from facing Billy Smith to Pelley Lindbergh I mean I guess that's why he stands for the Stanley Cup I mean these wires had an amazing team when you get to that point I mean that you obviously plan a team deservedly of being there and nothing's gonna be easy and at this particular point we were pretty confident and we knew how to win and we knew what it was gonna take in order to win we just needed to go out and execute and we felt that if we executed our best we were a better team but didn't make it easier so now you've won two Stanley Cups by the 85-86 season Edmonton looks unstoppable the team is now fully connected I mean you basically could have four or five 50 goal scorers on the ice at one time in

[00:46:36] Grant Fuhr you have my personal view the greatest goalie that ever played the game maybe not by the statistics but in turn of like just pure big-game acrobatics it seems like there's no way you guys can't win a third fourth fifth six seven Stanley Cup consecutively and then you come up against your nemesis from the town next door the Calgary Flames and I remain up by this point I'm in seventh grade so now am I by sort of my I'm watching every minute of every game and studying every statistic reading my

[00:47:08] Toronto Star newspaper is just like I'm dissecting every detail of this and I can't believe what's happening but all of a sudden it's Game seven against the Calgary Flames somehow you guys have each won three games going into the final game the Northlands Coliseum and I remember that night having dinner getting ready to watch the game and thinking trying to paint a glass-half-full view which is well do you know maybe maybe maybe Edmonton just needs this was a good little wake-up call and and maybe they're getting a little too complacent going into this game and I've never gone back and watched that game again so like I remembered and I watched it in 1986 I've never seen it since I don't know you ever seen that game since did you really watch it from start to finish No so if my memory serves me correctly it's 2-2 in the third period is that I couldn't even tell you exactly what the scored I know I know it was tied late in the game yeah it's tie its tie think it's tied 1-1 or two two or three three birthing was to two in the third period Steve

[00:48:06] Smith behind the goal has the puck he's going cross ice pass a million times a game pass and it just didn't go in the right place and it hit the back of Grant Fuhr his leg and in the net it goes and you guys are down 3 to 2 with less than a period to go what do you remember about that moment oh I just remember

[00:48:30] Calgary building a team that could compete with this a smite the vision back then was whoever seemed to be able to get out of the smite division had a good chance of witnessed hanley Cup Winnipeg was a great team Calgary was really amassing a great bunch of talent and putting a team together that believed they could beat us and they were tough all year long so we knew once we got into that series with them was going to be a tough series and it didn't surprise us at all that they were playing us every is hard and we're matching us in every bit of the game both physically and from a talent perspective and it got into that series were we knew was gonna be tough to your point where here we are in game 7 and that sport stuff happens you know when you're in the middle of it when something like that happens you got to shrug it off pretty quickly we weren't able to rebound from it and score a tying goal and end up winning the game they beat us in that seventh game but that sports things happen there's someone like that along the way yeah and there's so much about it to me right like remember in 91 when the bills went to their first Super Bowl and at the very end of the game Scott Norwood has to kick this field goal for them to beat the Giants and it misses it goes wide and he's you know on some level this big scapegoat and you sort of imagined well is that how Steve Smith felt but but a really critical analysis of that game again if the Giants versus the bills says it's really not about

[00:49:57] Scott Norwood at all if the Bills had played half as well in that game as they'd been playing all the way to the Superbowl they never would have been in a position where a last-second field goal was necessary and I think that was sort of my feeling of the whole thing with Steve Smith which was sure it would be easy to sit here and beat this guy up not you guys as his teammates I never got the sense you know reading the newspapers that that was happening but that the public could sort of beat this guy up for the own goal as they would call it in soccer but it was like look that was just a symptom of there were seven games in this series right normally good bounces bad bounces over seven game series they all equal out so

[00:50:35] I would never blame anyone incident on winning or losing a seven-game series you know that whole game in the whole way it unfolded with Steve is we could do a whole podcast on the psychology of that alone it was amazing time for all of us to you know just look at ourselves and the vulnerability that we all face in a team game and how much you require everybody to be in the moment and put the work in and trusts and all the things that you talked about in order for a team to win a championship and it could have been any one of us and I think the compassion that everybody felt for Steve even drove our team closer together in some crazy ways again you know another tough lesson along the way but things happen and and that's what we took out of it is you can take nothing for granted in this game as good as we were as much as we expected to win ourselves as much as everybody else expected us to win you can never take it for granted of exactly what's happening here and so we just collected ourselves again and dusted ourselves off and came back the next year and the next even more determined you play the Flyers again if I recall right next year exactly play that with Ron Ron Hextall

[00:51:57] Ron Hextall so we play them the next year and we were able to Wayne was able to accept a Stanley Cup and first guy he hands it to is Steve Smith I mean and that's why Sports is so important in everybody's lies because it transcends sports it goes much deeper than sports especially when you're playing on a team and doing the things that we were doing there it wasn't just about hockey it wasn't just about shooting goals and scoring pucks and all the things you would think about it became much more about life and life lessons in order to sustain that kind of remarkable level of play for the way did you know Gretzky was going to do that it didn't surprise me when he did do it you know Wayne I was always looking out for people around him always had the ability to get outside himself and make sure everybody felt good about being on the team and part of the team and all the things you would expect from a leader so it didn't really shock anybody that he was the first one that he handed the cup to was

[00:53:01] Steve I remember that very clearly and I'm glad you brought it up because I don't I don't think I would have remembered to have brought it up but I don't know it just sort of warms your heart I mean you compare it to the most extreme grotesque example of the opposite which is 1994 the World Cup andreas Escobar scores on his own goal and he ends up getting killed you know I mean he literally is murdered in a parking lot of a are and here's Steve Smith at least a year later gets to hold the Stanley Cup as part of any human development for him as a person and as a player and what it did for him and his own confidence and his own self esteem and his own career I think you know those are the things that define you ultimately and stuff happens everybody but you know he was able to be strong enough to absorb the criticism that came along his way strong enough to come back the next year and go through the process of getting back in that exact same position and then succeeding ultimately all the way through until we were able to win a Stanley Cup I mean that's what defines you not him shooting the puck in her own goal what define him was absorbing that and having the strength to absorb it and the infrastructure around him to help him to absorb it and I think that's what good organizations good teams do they they help people grow not only as athletes and hockey players but as people because you need people and you need good character people in order to win so if you're just talking about developing athletes and hockey players and trying to win a Stanley Cup it's just not gonna happen and do you see examples of that either in hockey today or in other sports then or now where you have all the talent in the world but there's something lacking in the character of all the time all the time you see it all the time when we were kids we saw good teams that had infighting amongst each other in jealousy about who was playing and and it just didn't ever dawn on us to ever think that way let's reflect on that for a second mark because the talent on that team was staggering as we as we've discussed earlier it would be very difficult to imagine in a free agency era like we have today where you could amass that much talent under one jersey we could amass it but then you couldn't you couldn't paint it yeah you couldn't afford even so again maybe there were stories that you're not telling but you don't get the sense that this is a team of prima donnas where everybody's sort of pissed that the other guys getting more airtime and more attention well it helps it helps when you have the the leadership that we had and it helps when you had the character that we had I mean as part of it that Gretzky was so good that everybody was happy to acknowledge that this is our leader and this is the best player on our team and we're watching history right now I mean as you said it was it was part of it but it was also the way he included everybody and his his crazy is in in the stats that he was having he had a way of making Dave semanko feel like he was a most important guy on the team and did list that goes on and I think that in the end is really we always talked about the stage is gonna be big enough first all the stand on there's not one or two of us gonna be standing on the stage when we win

[00:56:11] Stanley Cup the stage is big enough for everybody so let's make everybody feel accountable and let's make everybody feel important and let's hold everybody accountable for the job that they have and let's help them understand that even though on another team they were able to play a different role but on this team this is a role we need you to play and we need you to do the best to your ability and anything less than a hundred percent isn't gonna cut it and together we were able to help convince everybody that that was the path to success and we never felt jealous of Wayne we never felt that he shouldn't be on the ice at the end of the game when he already had four goals and four assists we wanted him on the ice we felt a part of his success we felt that we it enabled him and put him in position to have the success that he did so in a in a crazy way we felt part of the reason why he was able to smash all those records so it was really a team philosophy that we had that we're all in it together and you're right I mean one year and in the all-star game we had eleven players off the edmonton oilers dress in the in the all-star game and you were to think everybody would have been vying for but you know Glen

[00:57:19] Anderson never once would complain about not being on the frit and he was a 50 goal scorer and he couldn't get on the first power play unit never once did he even think it was a problem did you the hall coffee almost score 50 goals 1 yet he scored 48 goals a defenseman Tonsley 100 and some points I mean it was yeah so everybody had a role Kevin Lowe was an offensive defenseman he realized right away we didn't need another Paul coffee so he worked on becoming the league's best offensive defenseman and that was where he got his pride of being able to shut the other team he knew that that was our best chance to win as if he and leaf Oakland could be the go-to guys to shut it down late in the games and so he took the pride to do that and everybody on team did the same thing when you look at the way the NHL is today and again we'll talk about the arc of your career but the league you finished in is very different very different style of play from the Li you started in could a team that played the way Edmonton played in the 80s could that type of a team be successful today in the league oh yeah we you know

[00:58:20] Edmonton was the first I mean Glen Sather took the European flavor that in had infiltrated into Debbie HEA with all the European players and all the Swedish players and Anders Hedberg and off Nielsen and Bobby Hull and all these great European players that came over and then the Russians in 72 and in the flavor that we got from that kind of that infiltrated into the

[00:58:42] DHA and Glen really realized that that was the wave the next wave of the way hockey would be played and so when we came in the league in 1979-80 we were all really good skaters and the Glen allowed us not to play we called it we called tabletop hockey you know those games that you'd play with your hands and the winger would go up and down but that's all he could go that was traditional NHL hockey next thing you know you know the Oilers come in with all the talent and we're all weaving and going all over the ice and creating havoc for most teams so that style of play is basically a refined version of what's happening now so to answer your question are styled with Edmonton would have fit perfectly with the way that game is being played now it's amazing so

[00:59:28] Yves now one it's sort of July of 1988 you've just won your fourth Stanley Cup in five years when do you first hear any sort of inkling or rumor about the trade there was some kind of rumblings towards the end of the season through the playoffs and you know we didn't think much of it you know how could they ever trade Wayne Gretzky and nobody would even think about it so we didn't really pay too much attention to it we got wind of it you know normally with the smoke there's fire as they say there was becoming more talk about it and I was actually in the summertime playing

[01:00:04] Golf and got the word that the trade had happened and I was this is like August early August like somewhere in there who called you I remember being playing golf and stopping at the halfway house and hearing about it on the radio that the trade had gone through nobody could still believe it so until I got actually got the phone call from I think Wayne or somebody that then I realized that it actually had come true yeah what did you think at that moment I mean you're obviously thinking by this point you've had now eight years to hone your own leadership skill I mean just listening to the way you talk about those eight years you can see like I can just hear you describing lesson after lesson after lesson up and down up and down hard you know hard lessons so on the one hand you still have a job to do you became the captain of the Oilers that day right basically de facto even if they didn't put the C on your jersey until a few months later but it's got to be kind of heartbreaking too I mean

[01:01:04] Gretzky was probably your closest friend on that team as well what was devastating for everybody it was certainly devastating for the players we felt that we were only just beginning of what we could accomplish we're all in the prime of our careers that's the part that's so hard to believe is you guys literally were right right now it's real time you were not near the crest yet no we're right there in the sweet spot so for the players is devastating for the fans and the people in Edmonton it was devastating it was just a really tough day for everybody did you talk to Peter

[01:01:36] Pocklington no no I'd never talked to Peter about that there was no need to I mean what was there to say obviously yeah the feelings everybody had were obvious but to your point when all the dust settled and the training camp came around you know what were we gonna do about it you know we realized that we had first responsibilities to each other in the room and we had the responsibility to the team as much as we're disappointed with the decision do something like that and and then we added a responsibility to the fans and to the city and so we just like again collected ourselves again and came the training camp and tried to do the best we could throughout a tough year no in 88-89 I'm blanking who won the Cup that year was that Montreal no Calgary oh that's right that's right that's right Calgary won another one in 80s that's right and of course Montreal would go on to win in 93 after that amazing series with

[01:02:32] LA but then in 90 you guys make it back to the final I think you're playing the Bruins in the finals in 98 Bruins yeah what does it feel like to go back to the Stanley Cup without Gretzky and now you're the captain I mean you've always carried the expectations in many way but now this is the captain didn't change much for me I mean I was already entrenched and most of players than team knew me so I didn't really have to change anything did you create a narrative like I can imagine it could very easily spiral out of control psychologically where you think well if we don't win now it somehow means that all those years we want it was only because of Wayne I mean did you did you did anyone even know how that was it was true it was true one of the reasons why we won't know those capsules because of

[01:03:20] Wayne but it was because of a lot of other guys too well to me that's the point of 1990 right it's that you want to know how great the Oilers were yeah they're the best team that probably ever laced up skates and with Wayne Gretzky if you never interrupted that team they probably would have won nine Stanley but if we didn't look at as validation of how good we were weren't as hockey players because we won in 1990 without

[01:03:43] Wayne never even crossed our minds in fact the opposite in fact in fact we're disappointed Wayne wasn't there to share it with us because of all the great times we had had with him so I don't think anybody on the team was looking for validation that we could or couldn't win without Wayne I just think when that when the training camp came along like every other year you set your sights on winning a Stanley Cup and we go through the whole journey all year long to win a Stanley Cup and you go through the process of winning us down the cup because now there's new players on the team and players that hadn't been before in that culture and so you're trying to establish this culture with new players and you go through the whole process when ultimately we we did win in in 90 I don't think anybody felt like alright I will show everybody that it was it was more that we were proud of the process so we had to go through with younger players and different players with a lot of the players that have been through the grind years prior and we were able to elevate ourselves and everybody else in order to make it happen so there was never any validation from us that were able to do without Wayne it was we were way past that in my opinion as far as our own careers in her own thoughts of where we were and where we stood in the game and and and how we could look to ourselves as winners and all that kind of things it was a great victory don't get me wrong it was an amazing victory to bounce back and win you can't put it ahead of any other other ones but it was it was just as satisfying to win that that one as well when did it start to look like cuz you your contract with Edmonton was through what 92 or later maybe even longer right

[01:05:25] I can't remember sigh member signing a contract at some point I can't remember if I had contract left or I had a couple years left or known it I don't even know I just knew it was over when did you know it was over when did you know you were leaving Edmonton I knew his over the last year I was there which was 91 1990 1991 fight anyone yeah a lot of changes the team would was breaking up a lot of injuries it just felt different whatever reason we ended up losing to

[01:05:56] Minnesota I think he could just tell that his back that shouted ours right what yeah yeah yeah yeah you could just tell that chapter and all our lives was over and it was time to go do something different in a different place different town can you just know we can just feel it you can't explain it never even tried to figure out why or you know why I felt that way it was just so evident to me that it was just time to go where are you keeping this to yourself were you talking about us with your parents other teammates I mean how were you proud I didn't it wasn't really that I was talking about it during the regular season because you're so focused in on trying to win and I had to hurt my leg that year and I missed some time and think I'd missed like six weeks with a knee injury and came back early and my knee was never really that great the rest of the year into the play when it was over at the end of the year and we had finally lost we got to the semi-finals again which was amazing and it was over when the final game ended against Minnesota it was it was like the book could someone just took the two chapters and closed a book and it was over as quickly as that did you know where you'd end up no idea hadn't even had the conversation with the Glen or anybody hadn't even talked about it with anybody but had to have that conversation I don't even know when it was with Glen at some point and and he was great about it what's it like to come to New York well as you as I had mentioned earlier I was into a lot of travel and you know I was 30 years old I was looking for a new challenge both professionally and personally and when you started looking at the choices from where I was in my own self development what an amazing what mattered to you the most in that next chapter because lifestyle opportunity was a sight I have to win another cup or I want to be probably I was I was 30 years old I was still peak in my career I was playing good hockey still ya know the hockey wasn't over but I just wanted to do it in a different venue a different environment something completely different and then you just match it all up and you pin New York's a pressure cooker right I mean it's a this is in a sense that you know the Rangers haven't won a Cup since what 50 19 well I thought I thought I didn't care about that

[01:08:15] Oh 1940 they had one cup since 1940 yeah I did I thought that wasn't in a problem because of the pressure that was in Edmonton because it's such a small community and players can't really go anywhere I mean it's really a small community but I loved it I'm from there we embraced it we didn't hide from it we immerse ourselves and with the people and at restaurants and at bars and at parties and had fundraisers and that charity events and we're we were part of everybody else we were just we've meshed in just like everybody else those years in Edmonton so the pressure was always there with us so when I come into New York I didn't think would be a big problem I quickly underestimated that impact the size and the pressure here in New

[01:08:56] York City but it it didn't bother me I mean it was something that I just really wanted to focus in on you know why do you think cuz there are some people mark that just get crushed in that environment I can only imagine what it would be like to be a professional athlete in New York where you've got the world watching you right and this is a city that can put more pressure on you than maybe even the country could like

[01:09:18] Canada well one lesson I learned very early on was from Wayne when he mentioned something that the everything he has is because of hockey and he never jeopardize his performance with something that had to do with off the ice so everything off the ice took a back seat for Wayne hockey was his primary focus and so when I came to New

[01:09:39] York I realized that I had to take that same philosophy in order to be successful here and because of the distractions that are obviously abundant in his city likeness and so my focus was purely on hockey and everything else that came along with it would take a secondary role if I was able to do it and that sustained me well and don't get me wrong we had as much fun as anybody that's ever played in this city but and for myself personally my main focus was from 7:00 to 10:00 at night playing the game to be in making sure I was that the best my ability to do it and I think that's one of the reasons why I was able to perform here with arguably one of the toughest cities to play in because of the distractions that just made it more fun for me more challenging I know all the things being able to juggle that and that's kind of the juice that I was looking for as a 30 year old coming off five Stanley Cups in seven years and feeling pretty good about my own game and and excited about that live in the city and and try to be a part of a team that conquered at that time a fifty year drought or 51 year drought what was it like when you showed up for training camp in 92 93 wasn't 91 92 I guess your first year I miss training camp because I didn't get signed till after the training camp had finished I actually met the team in

[01:10:58] Montreal when the season was just getting going and how were you received was it just incredible excitement on the part of the players or was there a bit of trepidation I'm probably not the one that asked that but I was excited so I think the players were excited I hope they were I think they were I remember the Rangers hadn't wanted munch or all in a lot of years and we won to end up winning that game and it just seemed to start unfolding and I think that year we won the

[01:11:26] Presidents Trophy we missed the playoffs and next year and when this down a couple of third years so I rolled this huge rollercoaster of emotions through three years and saw the great side of New York all the way down to the depths of missing the playoffs and the coaches getting fired and taken the blame for the whole debacle and then all of a sudden rising up the third year to winning a Stanley Cup it was an amazing roller coaster maybe one of the reasons why I made the experience so much more powerful is that I was able to see both the good and the bad of an athlete in

[01:11:56] New York and it wasn't easy when when we didn't well let's start let's start with the bad so 92 93 you guys don't make the playoffs what what is that like compared to other pain you can experience as an athlete for example the year you guys get swept by the Islanders or the year you guys lose to the flames like how does it compare to say you don't make the playoffs and well a city that year that we won the Presidents Trophy it gave me enough time to realize the importance of the Rangers in this community and the generations of fans that have supported this tranch eyes for so long and so by that by the second year I was fully aware of the impact that the Rangers have in this town in this area and then to go from disappointing playoffs obviously and failing again which always seemed to happen to the Rangers but having a great regular season so that was kind of like a little bit of a trade off to the next year just not having a good year it was what do you think was wrong that year we had injuries there was a lot of things that that happened that didn't allow us to play as well as we should have and but anyways I got to see the other side of the city and the pressures that can go against an athlete's that's expected to bring a championship luckily I guess

[01:13:16] I had enough experience to absorb it and articulated in my own mind and take the responsibility and and then have enough support around me to help get through it and then make the right decisions obviously the next year in order to allow us to get to this down the cub before you get to the Stanley Cup you got to get through your arch-nemesis the

[01:13:36] New Jersey Devils well we beat the Islanders and the Devils that year so it was a good hockey in this area in the metro area there so we've you know we started off with the Islanders then played Washington and obviously the great series against the Devils let's talk about that end of that series so you're down three games to two correct you now have to win the next two games and you make this bold promise right so you sort of follow in the lineage of

[01:14:02] Babe Ruth and Joe Namath yeah wasn't thinking about that long at the time I mean did it occur to you what you were saying and how boldly you were decaying occurred to me what I was saying because I was trying to as a captain you're always monitoring your team's confidence level every day not only during the playoffs but every day you walk into the room your spider senses are up and you're just gauging everybody's emotional state good better and different in that particular time I was just trying to instill a confidence in the players and our routine on that day was to kind of get on a bus and go gather on a bus and go to New Jersey have a pregame skate in the morning have lunched have a dress and then go back to this so I knew everybody would be on the bus reading the morning papers because we had done it all year long so I said well what a great idea to let the guys know that I believe we can win this I wasn't even thinking about that it would be splashed across the papers it was only supposed to be for our 20 guys on the bus it wasn't supposed to be for 12 million New Yorkers and certainly in the

[01:15:07] New Jersey Devils but that particular point it didn't really matter to me I mean we do anything you can to swing the momentum back into your favor and that's what I was trying to do is instill the confidence that which displayed all year is that we could go in there and win Game six we had done it numerous times it wasn't like we couldn't do it we had to figure out a way to play better we had to figure out a way to stop the the devils and that's where the inspiration came from so going into game seven how do you feel well we feel good we feel good about winning game six we feel good about going home for Game seven it's been a friendly place for us all year long we love playing in front of our home fans there's nothing not to like about our position going into Game seven other than the Devils are a great hockey team and could play a spoiler very easily which was terrifying we knew in order to win Game seven we were gonna have to earn it they weren't gonna roll over they felt that they could win the game just as much as we did and ultimately is one of the best series I've probably ever played in was it Game seven that you got the hat-trick Game six was Game six he got the hat trick to win the game to come back what was the score game seven two three two two one one good moto the greater the great Mattila goal on overtime yeah so now you're back in the Stanley

[01:16:28] Cup Finals before we get to that I want to go back to something you said a moment ago cuz it honestly like the way you articulated it I've heard great CEOs say the same thing right which is the job of a great CEO is to monitor the confidence of the team is to boost morale is to provide leadership in a meaningful way not just a sort of hollow way I want to kind of understand how how these things developed in you like when did it become apparent to you that like what you did mattered more than just how you played on the ice what you said mattered how you spoke in the locker room mattered like what was the evolution of that from a 17 year old

[01:17:12] Punk who can't even get to the right airport to the guy who on the eve of Game six is calling a shot heard around the world that guaranteeing victory yeah good question I think it really stems back when I was all the lessons that I had from a father who was a hockey player who was a team player who was a tough defenseman who protected his teammate and knew the value of a team in every sense for protection for success for individual accomplishments he really understood what it meant to be a team player then I'm a stick boy for my brothers junior team when I'm 14 years old actually 12 to 14 and got to see my dad coach and how he treated his players and how he talked to his players and how he motivated the team and how he brought the team together and how he made everybody feel comfortable and accountable and important and valued he just see the power of what a team can do when they are completely synched and linked together without ego and without all the things that can undermine any team in any sport and then get to a professional level as a young guy just trying to get my own footing as a professional but still seeing and understanding all the things that I've learned all along the way and then seeing it play out in different formats and sometimes positively and sometimes very negatively and so you start to realize that Jesus some of the things that you know are actually really good and and smart and healthy and and productive and this thing and the way that this happening is very toxic and detrimental and not good for anybody and so you just start kind of like I said earlier just start building the confidence of of what you're doing not only as an individual but what you're trying to do as a team and and how you're carrying yourself on the team and the decisions that you're making for the team as an individual and and it just starts to come together and then you start to see other players and other great leaders and hear about other great events and and it just starts to accumulate over time until you're finally put in a position to have to pull the lever on some of the things that you've learned at critical times and having the confidence that it's the right thing to do and and I think you know with any great leader will tell you there that they know great leader is is mistake-free every leader makes mistakes but it's the equity that you've built up into the people that you were around that will forgive you for making an on a mistake that just didn't work out well it was a calculated this decision it didn't work out but the players or the people aren't gonna abandon you because of that mistake they trust you it was a bad decision didn't work out but they still trust your vision and and how you can get there and so that's where kind of all evolved into some seminal moments in my own career as a captain in the 1990 Stanley Cup run all the way in through New York until we were able to win the Stanley Cup with a bunch of great character talented kids here in New York City you've obviously talked about the role that your dad had that Wayne had and probably some of the other guys you played with in Edmonton how much of this was modeled for you by people not on your team were you able to look at opposing players and see some of these characteristics that would ultimately come to define your leadership no question both positively and negatively we would watch other teams and good teams be fighting with each other on the bench and yelling each other on the ice as a leader on the opposing team I'm using that as a galvanizing force for our players to say look at these guys they don't even like each other they don't even win I'm using every any tool

[01:21:08] I can to convince our guys that we can win no matter what it is and so if I see a weak link like that that's gonna we're gonna expose that anything because it gets down to such small detail when two teams are so evenly matched the smallest things matter and you're always looking for that little bit of evidence that little bit of self-doubt on the other team or any kind of pressure cracks that are starting to happen and to use that for your own team to expose that there's so many things that go along and so you really start as you get older and you're in a different position of leadership you're looking for to play the game within the game and that's often times weird you know series and in Stanley

[01:21:50] Cups or one and loss if you can win the the war of not only attrition but also the the mental war that goes on against another team of all the players you played against but never with so I know you play it against Gretzky but let's discount Gretzky and curry who you played against eventually but because you played with them but of guys that you only played against who did you respect them first as a player but also as a leader and you can think of those separately if

[01:22:20] I was looking there looking at the other day with my son my younger son about there was a wall somewhere of all the names and I and I looked at at night I was late against every one of these players and go and I went back to some of these guys that were playing in the 60s that were still playing we're still playing at the end of that day and every area clearly yours yeah and then to evolve over four decades so you can imagine amount of players that I played against ten with over over 26 26 years

[01:22:47] Pro you know just off the top of my head I just had so much respect before I was just as a kid with Bobby Orr he was my favorite player I loved the way Bobby played I loved everything about him I loved the way he dressed I love the way he Zaki looked in his equipment so I had a lot of respect for him I had a lot of respect for when did you first meet Bobby Orr by the way not too much later when I was already a pro

[01:23:10] I didn't get a chance to meet Bobby as a young guy at all I got funny story for you so when I was a kid I had a Bobby Orr signed hockey stick on my wall and it was like you know one of my prized possessions I had your autograph I had Gretzky's autograph curry fear like I had half the Oilers posters and stuff autographed and I had this Bobby Orr hockey stick autographed as you know being a good Canadian kid all you're doing is playing ice hockey and street hockey every day and so sure enough I'm out there one day they were playing street hockey after school and I break my stick and I don't have another stick to play and you know what I did it's like the worst thing I've ever done in my life I go into my bedroom I take that

[01:23:53] Bobby Orr stick which is way too big for me I go and get a saw I cut the top of it off which is the part he'd signed and I go back out and I just start playing with it and all I've got left is the signed top end of a Bobby Orr stick and my dad comes home and somehow he had got me this stick you know somehow I mean he wasn't pissed at me but you could just tell he was sort of like I don't think you're supposed to do that son I mean I was like you know I was probably like all for the love of the game 10 years old and I just can't to this day I still think I cannot believe I saw that stick you just said guila Fleur as well now you did play against Kela flirt like a

[01:24:29] Penske LeFleur but I always remember the great series against Boston that rivalry and when there had to go back to Boston and Mike Milbury said he wouldn't get out of there alive and the story goes a gala Fleur was at the Boston Gardens at 2:00 in the afternoon in full equipment smoking cigarettes and went out scored a hat-trick when I heard that story I said

[01:24:55] Wow because I know what it was like going into the Boston Garden so I can really appreciate performing under that kind of pressure back then but love the way he played but there's so many players I played against that were ended up being not only great leaders but great players great people off the ice great in their communities and that's one of the I think the assets of our game is really the people not only as players but what they've been able to do off the ice as well I always felt like Eric Lindros was a player that never fully reached his potential he was just always getting you know something about his style of play that lent itself to just him getting hurt too many times yeah it's health and it's not only injuries but his health in so many different ways and that allow a player to do what you're talking about and have an extended career I think but Eric played 12 years or when he first came in the league look like he could play till he is 100 well do you remember before so the year he was late for the Oshawa

[01:25:54] Generals and he was gonna get drafted and it was really clear Quebec was gonna draft him I mean this was non-negotiable and he kept signaling guys I'm not playing for Quebec so don't bother drafting me trade me trade me trade me but they don't but I think Sports Illustrated came out with an article that said this kid is Lemieux Gretzky and Messier melded into one and I remember thinking guys are you freaking kidding me like how much pressure could you put on a kid like taking the three greatest players in the NHL and telling me that this kid in junior a is gonna be the next him and I grew up in Toronto so a lot of the kids I went to school with actually played with Eric during like the junior junior like mth oh you know triple-a like through probably fourth grade before Eric really started to leapfrog ahead so you knew he was great there was no question but I thought that was like that was a bit much pressure to put on a kid I thought yeah I think so too you know he was her got cut short the fact about the NHL there's a lot of great players there's a lot of great players and to elevate your self to the likes of Lemieux and Gretzky those are pretty lofty standards well in Diaz you said there's a longevity thing I mean I still can't believe you played 25 years like in fact I got to be honest with you

[01:27:09] I never had done the math until I was preparing for us to sit down and talk today like it was really on the last couple of weeks that I did that actual math because I just didn't realize it was that long in fact I forgot that Gretzky had played a full 20 years like that just doesn't make sense in a sport like hockey like that's the exception not the rule you you really and especially the way you played because you played such a physical game I mean what's the worst injury you've sustained that day I was so lucky um I had both knees ligament stretch MCL is probably four times in each knee

[01:27:47] I had arthroscopic surgery on my shoulder towards my little second last year how many concussions that you have hard to count yeah they just don't really keep track of them the same way to keep track multiple concussions but didn't really keep track and back then you made sure you woke your roommate up a couple times if you did get a bump in the head make sure he woke up you know we just didn't know we just didn't have the the knowledge of of what concussions were and the impact that they had so it was completely different back then what was the hardest part about retiring for me I didn't really have a hard time retiring if you can believe it just like

[01:28:29] I'd recognize it was kind of finished in Edmonton I kind of recognized that what was funny I asked my trainer I said okay if I train every day am I gonna be able to at 44 am I gonna be able to compete with the younger guys on that kind of level and he goes no because you're gonna need more work to rest yep your recovery is my recovery is just not there so every time I work out I need three days of rest or whatever it is and so it's diminishing returns over 82-game but you ever think like imagine there's a model I've often thought about this and it's you know you have to change the economics of this sport but it's like you take a guy like you who's now in his early 40s and you say look we're gonna reduce the amount you're getting paid but you're only gonna pay a play every third game you know could a roster support that because in many ways what you're bringing from a leadership and an experience and an intelligence standpoint is not going down it's only going up but you just as you said you don't have the reps in you you can't practice and play with 22 year olds yeah

[01:29:37] I personally probably wouldn't have like that I mean I love playing every day I love being in the pit I love being in the trenches that wouldn't work for me III couldn't have sat on the bench for two out of every three games I just don't think you have the equity with the players I think you you you can do that and be a great resource and you can actually play and it would be for some people but I think to be in a big leadership role I think one of the parts of being a leadership role is being is actually got a hurts everybody example--and and being in those tough skates and being those tough it's not the worst philosophy and so I just knew that if I couldn't do that then what else do I have left to play for I didn't want to play for money I didn't want to play for anything either I didn't care if I was eight games behind Gordie Howe it didn't mean anything - yeah that's that was another stat that I had totally forgotten which was so you retire as the second leading scorer of all time so you know somehow these two little kids that showed up from the whao I was as I retired as a leading scorer of mere mortals that's the way leading scorer he's way so I was retired now I'm I'm third of the mere mortals that played the game but what's amazing is what you just alluded to a second ago you were only what eight games behind

[01:31:07] Gordie Howe for when everybody say play another year plan you only eight games behind Gordie Howe I said I never played the game everybody never played for a record never played first that never played for any kind of goal record any kind of assist record any kind of a game record I never played for any of that wasn't even on my radar when I first came on the league I was just trying to make the NHL I never thought I would even be in a position to hold any record and so I it wasn't even in my DNA as a player to to even consider something like that and all the things that came along were just by coincidence of playing at a certain amount of time but feeling a part of the of the whole journey with the team and so to come back and play in a promotional tour to be Gordie Howe I mean what was that gonna define me with it it didn't mean anything to me that's telling though mark I mean I think there are a lot of players who would have come back for another year or half a year or as you said kind of just a record tour I think a lot of people would and but but I think in some ways I think the fact that you didn't the fact that youth you finish eight games behind one of the most storied records in sports says more than if you had the record maybe you know I guess that's for other people to decide if hurt for me I you know I was so focused in on being a team player and trying to win a Stanley

[01:32:27] Cup every year so that was the only thing that kind of motivated me and finding that whole chemistry within a different team every year and and it all came in different ways and different teams were motivated for different reasons but finding that motivating galvanizing factor every year that we could all rally around was the juice that kept me playing for 25 years if the young player comes up to you today and says I'm starting my career I mean was there a moment when you were just so nervous that you you know going into a game or going into a series or going into a tryout or something and and you actually had to will yourself off the ledge because obviously stress and anxiety and nerves are a very positive thing I mean you can totally harness those things but when they go too far they can be crippling do you recall a time when you actually were on that edge and you had to pull yourself back from the sort of destructive to the constructive utilization of that force that's that's such a great point and the fear factor of failure is always evident you know we were terrified of losing in Edmonton all the time as good as we looked from the outside I can only imagine inside we were terrified not losing and probably more terrified of underachieving which is worse than anything is being an underachiever so how do you get yourself that you're able to be ready enough and relaxed enough to be able to execute in the most important situations and I think it really gets back to what we talked about earlier you know your preparation trusting in the preparation trusting in the evolution of the team over the course of the season and and repetitive scenarios there that you know you can do and you can trust yourself and you got trust in your teammates that they're gonna be in the right position because it's this whole choreographed ballet that's happening on the ice at 40 miles an hour with twenty four switch blades traveling 60 miles an hour and dangerous and but everybody's got to be in the right position at the right time in order to make that cohesive systems work so I've felt it myself but when you do fail there and because you're not always gonna play your best when the chips are on the line you're gonna fail you're already gonna make mistakes you are gonna be the guy that gives a puck away to to lose the game and just being able to be strong enough to have an unwavering self belief and in who you are and what you're trying to achieve and a lot of that comes from the preparation and the commitment that you put into the game so there's been a lot of questionable moments along the 26 years where you doubt yourself and I remember standing on my first time they kept final along the blue line in

[01:35:15] Edmonton and being so amped up that when the anthem finished my whole right side of my eye got blurry and I played about 20 seconds of the first shift and then went off to the dressing room I had to lay on the training room table for five minutes in order - just get vision back whatever happened just way too amped up way too ready to go away too excited and that was a great lesson as well because when I looked over at the Islanders there they were just kind of in a nice groove and a nice relaxed state and so how do you marry that with too much not enough and that perfect sublime state and then of course a lot of philosophy and some other things that I worked on in my career from a self-awareness standpoint and things like that say a bit more about that you live the different life than most people can relate to right I mean most people finish high school get a job or go to college or whatever but you were sort of thrust into a limelight from from very young age you had to make a bunch of mistakes in front of a bunch of people and and before you know it you're you're sort of 44 years old or whatever you were at 43 when you retired

[01:36:28] I want to talk a little bit more about retirement and the next phase of your life but I want to know a little bit about how you like what kind of introspection and self-reflection were you able to do as an athlete or was that mostly something that came after no I think it wasn't a evolution all the way through I became curious wife to start with why Wayne was the best hockey player in the world and so I started watching him I started watching him in practice in this practice habits and what he did in practice to become a better player and how he was able to saucer the puck on his forehand backhand and where he would go in certain situations and all that and then I'd so if you're curious enough there's a lot of answers out there of how to become a better player both physically and emotionally and tactically and all the things that you would because you don't rep here the way you represent yourself you're just an average guy right like you're not a guy that had this god-given gift now of course you obviously have great natural athletic talent but you're this guy who as you tell the story no one could have predicted on your first day in the NHL you are going to be the second leading scorer of all time or the first amongst mortals whereas in the case of Gretzky if someone said that on day one it was believable it was more evidence and that's why it's so amazing that you are patient within there's certain things that you look for in in athletes of any sport not necessarily when they're younger but in how they can change and evolve so there would have been no evidence up until I even turn pro that that would have happened so I think that yes you are given god-given talent it has to be nurtured and and honed and then you have to be willing to absorb a lot of information in order to become a good pro and a good teammate and then you know how do you elevate your own game from a fourth line fighter to a second line left winger to a second line centerman to a first line sentiment through the course of a career right like but yeah so I think curiosity won and I felt that there was a way that I didn't believe in the zone hmm tell me more about that

[01:38:39] I didn't believe in that it was just by chance that a guy would have a good game you would hear these people talking about wow I was really in the zone tonight I don't know why I don't know what happened couldn't feel my legs I could skate all day never got tired the goal look like a soccer net you know didn't feel like anybody else's onlin you know you never once felt that I felt it but I didn't think it was just because it just was it was just a chance you think that something happened along the way in order for that to manifest itself at that particular time so I started asking questions about you know okay well what is that I mean what if there's a there's a bigger so what is something bigger what is your take well

[01:39:22] I think it's a level of concentration that doesn't get discovered you know it's a whole nother that's another whole nother podcast but I just think it's a it's a deep level of concentration that you're not even aware of that's mixed with preparation that's was mixed with belief that's mixed with repetition of the skill all that comes together at a certain time and I think that in - just very quickly I just think that you know in a professional world there's a lot of external things that go on outside the game that can be conflicting and be distracting and take away energies from you not only physically but also emotionally and if you in a perfect world you have everything in your person life in complete order you have one thing to think about on a big game like a game seven or whatever it is so when you guys were like literally these 23 year old kids in this town called Edmonton do you think you were able to take it more seriously as a combination of things one it's not New York City right so you're not or Montreal or Toronto where the pressure is unbelievable was unbelievable in Edmonton too but almost a result of how well you have much potential you guys brought to it and then secondly you have this thing around Gretzky which is you all figure out very quickly you are in the presence of greatness and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity you are a piece of history in many ways do you think that somehow that all galvanized to produce this environment you're describing which is you could focus so much on your unhone in your craft and in at a time when it could have been easy to have put 80% of that effort in but 20% of that could have been put elsewhere

[01:41:15] I think again it doesn't just happen overnight I think this is something that if you're interested in it takes a long time to get there and I think that there are a lot of questions that need to be answered along the way of anyone's career you know why am I here what am I here for you know what are my intentions what is the endgame how am I being perceived by my teammates how was the sporting hockey world perceive me what am i doing off the ice to be a good citizen what am i doing to contribute to the community that doesn't happen when you're 18 years old that doesn't happen when you're 20 years old that happens over a duration of period as you evolve as a person so for me when

[01:41:59] I came to New York I was 30 years old and I had a lot of time for introspection to think about you know what I was needed to do in order to be successful a player and all that maybe if I came here at 22 it wouldn't have been the same result because I wasn't ready for it or mature enough to handle the external things around the city who knows I just look at it it's it's an evolution of anyone's I think that the sport has to mirror the maturity of anyone's and if those two things kind of keep going on a parallel track then you get into players like Tom Brady and players that are redefining their sport and doing things that are considered unattainable whether you're playing into your 40s and still you know you original as quarterback you know I'm just using him as yeah sure but I think if you asked him his own trajectory of when he first came out and I got thrown in well

[01:43:01] I think there's something else about I don't know Tom Brady but I would infer from the outside that there's something about Tom that's very similar to what you said earlier which is I don't get the impression he's playing for another Super Bowl ring of course he wants to win another Super Bowl ring but that's not the reason he's playing I get the sense he's playing because he believes he can continue to perfect his craft and and I I suspect that that's what the greatest thing about winning is the end the net result it's the way you can measure that it's the way you can measure it and of course you know every time you come to training camp you want to win but I don't think you can just say you want to win I think there's certain things especially at his age that he needs to do in order to be put himself in position to be efficient enough at that position in order to take his team to another and so I think that's where that whole thing I'm talking about word or sport and life finally come together at a certain age and they parallel the tracks where you become more evolved as a person which only helps you in your sport because you have under better understanding of who you are as a person and all the things that are it takes to be successful from a physical standpoint and the training and then the evolvement of the knowledge of the game and the experiences have you had so it's it's quite remarkable and it's one of the things that I'm sure he would tell you because I can say for myself is one of the things that keeps you in the game at that later stage of of the year is honing that walking on that razor's edge that very few people have done and to try to do something that has never didn't done before you look like you're still in great shape what do you do today for exercise how do you stay in shape a little bit of everything obviously weightlifting is a important cardio and I can get cardio from many different uses

[01:44:47] I was never a runner but I ran the New York City Marathon back I guess 2011 ten-year anniversary of 9/11 are you deliberate about it or sometimes professional athletes when they're done they're done with structure they've spent their whole lives being very structured in doing this doing this being here at this time being in this training camp being you know eating this way doing this doing that and then when they're done it's like look I'm gonna work out but I don't want to program I just want to do what I feel like doing I mean where are you sort of on that spectrum yeah I'd say that shortly after

[01:45:21] I retired I was doing some other stuff and I I kept waiting for that because I used to give myself three hours to work out when I was training you know it'd take me a minute to get in the gym and it'd take me you know 10 15 minutes to get myself with a deep enough concentration to be able to actually put the work into that I wouldn't I wouldn't need I didn't need three hours to actually physically workout but I to get myself mentally ready to workout and then when I retired I kept waiting for that 3-hour window to come along and everything everyone never came along because of the kids and all that kind of stuff so I'm kind of pretty loose about what I did find though is that I feel better when I workout I physically feel more awake I feel more alive I feel more energized more energy fresher when I guess it's a probably a net result of doing it for so many years that your body just becomes accustomed to it and you feel sharper so you know when I did retire I wouldn't work out all the time and it became apparent to me that I actually feel better when I when I get some kind of work in it doesn't have to be anything like I did when I was in the three hours in the gym and all that but if it's a 20-minute cardio or if it's a anything yoga session or so I'm kind of resigned to the fact that if anybody's doing anything I'll kind of jump in on it and try it and obviously got a little bit of a routine 2 3 4 days a week but try anything do anything and just to kind of keep the body moving how often do you get back on skates playing some charity events every once in a while I'm on the ice quite a bit cuz I coach my son's team so I'm on the ice I use actually friends rink up in wire mill Paul Orlin the great guy he's got a little private rink there so I go there and just do some cardio you'll just get out there and skate I'll just get up there and just do skating exercises because it's just so good for your core and for your and you don't have the impact and you don't have the impact of running and all that and so it's just in the gist of so much development of your core and your legs and all that so keep that strong how fast can you skate relative to your 28 year old self what percent well what you realize is that you have such massive leg power when you're playing and when you stop that atrophies pretty quickly so if I had to say put a percentage on it you know like I'm curious as to how far you would fall in 20 years I would say add 10 percent of what a head weight 10% less no overall you're that far from over you were 20 years ago I would I would say so but my guess is if you can so I'm still in good shape I can still skate but like if you get back on the ice with a bunch of 40 year old dudes I bet you skate circles around them right it depends on what you're skating I mean if I if I took six months and skated and and started to develop some of the muscles that you really need to skate and and for your edging and all that yeah maybe but you know I'm 58 so you know it's just atrophy unless you skate every day those muscles atrophy you know you're growing is in your hip flexors and your quads and ham I mean that whole muscle group of of your legs and so that's just straightaway speed skating around circles what about the ability to change direction is that even more lost is that even though slow loss because you instantly become fatigued because you don't have the muscle power there so it's just it's amazing actually in fact it wasn't but it was about two years after I retired and I put my equipment on to do something and it felt like I didn't have my I felt like I had so here we're in someone else's equipment because my legs were about twice the size and my fit different and all of a sudden my legs are in the pants that I had retired with and it felt like they were just swimming on me just because of the atrophy what do you weigh now weigh about 215 which is not that far from what you play that played ready right there at 215 or so just distributed you think it's just distributed differently yeah you just don't have the muscle mass you lose muscle mass just because of age but you also you'd lose muscle if you're not using it well I mean you can be just amazing how much power it takes to play hockey from a legs standpoint and a cardiovascular standpoint it's incredible and you know when you do it from the time you're a young boy to the time you're 40-something and you retire you don't even think about it because it's all you've get on the ice and not even think about it what is your son think about hockey the one that you coach he's how old well lines 30 older boys 32 and he coaches on he loves hockey it's he's made a career of coaching kids and up in washington d little caps douglas loves hockey he's 16 playing hockey and that's the one you coach yeah yeah does he want to play pro I think he would love to play pro is it hard how do you feel about letting him be his own guy oh I think he needs completely needs to go on that journey of self exploration to see what he can extract from himself does he ask you about it oh we talk often about hockey I think he knows what's required even before whether or not you have the talent it's an interesting journey for him to see where he can take it ultimately that'll be defined by him and not by me it's got to be interesting it's got to be a mixed bag of emotions for you to watch your watch your kids play this game and know that you know I know enough about you to know that all you really care about is you just want your kids to be happy you want your kids to sort of find their own way and you want to stay out of their way enough but also be there enough to answer a question and support them it's just I think it's just harder when your dad is

[01:50:50] Mark Messier to know much balance I mean your dad was such an important part of your development is it sort of like you want to be able to provide exactly what your dad did no more no less is that sort of how you think about question being the son of any professional player and any sport is is going to come with some baggage for the kids whether they feel it as they're expected to be a great player because her dad was and and all the things that go along with it ultimately the reason why sports in my opinion are such a great thing for all kids is that it does take you on that self journey of self-awareness and what you want to do and are you able to do and are you able to put the discipline in and the time in and that's required to be the best you can be it doesn't matter how good everybody else is what do you have and are you willing to extract every ounce of talent and work out of your own body that ultimately no matter how far you take it will serve you well in wherever you land whether it's in a sport or in business or whatever that kind of journey can only be beneficial for for all kids and certainly for my kids as well and I think there's something else about team sports which is all the stuff you've alluded to around this type of leadership and the difference between you know I was loved that movie miracle because I thought it did such a great job of showing how at an individual level that team was not nearly as talented as the Soviets right but on that one moment in that tournament everything that they had done under her

[01:52:21] Brooke sort of came together and they outplayed the best team on you know in the world as a team not as a collection of individuals and so much of what you talk about is really you've repeatedly emphasized this importance of both leadership and team play and the dynamics of the team and again I think you've you've paid a lot of that tribute both to your dad and to Gretzky as being too great role models of that and many more but yeah there's there's a lot of information out there for her any young aspiring sportsman sports woman girl a boy no matter what their dance music acting hockey baseball football whatever it is if you're interested there's a lot to learn if you're interested tell me put the Mark Messier foundation what do you guys do well when I first came to

[01:53:11] New York it was really important for me to entrench myself into the community the first charity I ever got involved it was the Alberta Lung Association when I first became a pro in in Edmonton and Glen Sather our coach there really kind of emphasized that we get out into the community and pick a charity and attach her name to it and help the Alberta Lung

[01:53:31] Association was an incredible learning experience for me because it was all about the babies that were born premature and had unhealthy lungs and whatnot fast forward to coming to New York the inundation of requests to get involved with some kind of charity in the city was overwhelming so I had to figure out a charity and Tim bawled myself with and then help out as much as I could everywhere else and that became the tomorrow's children fund at the

[01:53:59] Hackensack Medical University and years after retirement it became apparent that I could start my own foundation and really kind of focus in on the things that inspired me the most and that was giving back to in providing access and opportunity to kids that didn't have the means to do it like hockey in the city so the Mark Messier Foundation is basically that it's about creating access and opportunity in different areas of kids lives or that they would never have had the opportunity otherwise and for different circumstances whether it was financial or infrastructure not available or scholastics or whatever and so that's what we focused on and it's spun out of the Kingsbridge nationalized project that we're trying to build here in the city that you that would provide a lot more access and opportunity to kids to play hockey in the metropolitan area here with three NHL teams you you would think we could do a better job of creating more access for kids to play a sport that's so much entrenched into this metropolitan area it's hard to imagine you not living here isn't it you have so many tentacles in this in this New York area business-wise philanthropy wise family wise which is again I think it's for me

[01:55:17] I always think of you as being from Edmonton which of course you are from but you've probably lived almost as much of your life here as you have there right yeah well that's close I came here when I was just 30 and I'm 58 now so it's been a you know I remember my press conference saying I hope my second career is this gives my first weren't able to Khoisan twin as many

[01:55:38] Championships here in New York but we were able to win the one but my experience here in New York has been incredible I think the thing that really drew me to come to New York was not only the challenge of breakin the 54 year old drought of the Stanley Cup but also immersing myself into a city of this magnitude and and the culture and all the things that go along with it that was it was very appealing to me and it didn't disappoint me in any way

[01:56:02] I've can't tell you how much I've enjoyed my time as a player and in retirement in this area and the people and the amount of experience that I've had with so many different types of people in the city it's interesting I mean I thing I really want to talk about mark is this idea where there just seemed to be two types of athletes there are those who retire who can never sort of get over the fact that they're not still 28 years old and that their glory is no longer going to be Wed to that and then there were another group of athletes who retire and move on and continue to like live life to the fullest with respect to whatever the next chapters of their lives fit and I you're obviously in the latter category

[01:56:51] I mean you know we could have in a whole other podcast talking about what you're doing in business today and all the things you're doing outside of hockey do you have a sense of why you're able to make that transition and when it was time to say goodbye you said goodbye and you know your identity doesn't have to be wrapped up in that and why others have such a difficult time doing that what do you think defines that diff I think you just nailed it I think to put it very quickly I think the thing is I didn't identify myself only as a hockey player I think that in order and and for me to be able to do that I needed a good family around me and good people around you to remind you that there's a lot more to life than hockey although it's a huge part of my life from the time I was you know very young to the time I turn pro and this is one of the thing that I had to really focus in on when I was 18 because it requires all your attention to perform at your highest level but it wasn't who I was as a person big difference and I think with good people around you to remind you of what's possible outside the game you eventually realize that you do something that you love and it's the most amazing time of your life but it's not gonna define you in the end and I think those two things became very apparent to me you know sometime in the middle of my career where there was just more to this then playing hockey and that's where it became so apparent that you are an important part of any community that you're playing and there's other things that going on and the way you conduct yourself and how you give back and all the things that are so important to a to a professional athlete in order for him to do and I think those are things that really kind of separate you from the player and so when it's time to retire yeah I sure I missed the game I love playing hockey there's nothing better than playing hockey and being a part of a team but I was able to walk away because I had a new family and there was more to do in life in a different way that alleviates that need to go to the rink everyday and have your ego boosted because of your playing on a professional hockey team so I think that kind of really made it easy for me to retire and to kind of go on to the next phase of my life when at 40 some years old now look at if I was 25 years old and forced to retire because of injury or something god it would have been tough to retire I no question no question so I'm only speaking for myself that I was I fulfilled everything yeah you know for you know 26 years Pro 40 for a young family in my own mind was there anything left to prove you know from a hockey standpoint no was there a lot more to prove from a philanthropic standpoint there's a lot more it's amazing marked he still keep in touch with any of the guys from Edmonton I everybody everybody you know we just had another reunion in Edmonton not long ago we had one here in New York and it what's amazing about the city is that everybody seems to come through here at one point during the year so being able to stay connected to a large portion of the guy on a fairly regular basis is is quite easy I would love to be a fly on the wall for one of those reunions literally just sitting up there in a raft or watching like the greatest hockey team that ever laced up reminiscing about gosh what it's been now 30 to 35 years ago the 85 team was voted the top team in the last hundred years and so we had a reunion for that team in Edmonton not long ago and it was remarkable actually to get that team together and see everybody that some of the guys I hadn't seen a lot of guys I had but just to be able to get to your point to get to the room and and everybody sat an exact same seats on the bus on the way to the room it was did you guys get on the ice and skate we never did that would have been if we should have done that actually we should have had some kind of it just some came at game a quick pickup or something like we should have been with both Andy and grant there your two goalies yeah yeah okay heard the whole team was there unbelievable it was amazing actually we should have done that I'll remember that for the next one you know I I got to meet Ronnie lot recently who was one of my favorite football players ever growing up and we were you know after we shooting the breeze for a bit I said you know do you guys ever get together and play a game of pick-up football you and Montana rice and everybody goes yeah yeah we did it actually kind of recently and I said what was it like and he goes it was awful I mean I hurt for like three days after he's like you know Jerry was the only one who was really really in still an amazing shape which of course if you look at Ronnie Lott by the way he looks just like you he is the exact same weight that he played at so it's not like this guy got out of shape but he's like look Jerry was still sort of you know really in shape but but it's the same idea like to get that 49ers team of the 80s together and the Oilers of the 80s I mean I don't know there's something there's something very special about those well this is I think the the connection is so strong because you have such a deep respect for what you did together and the commitment that each individual put forwards towards the common goal I think that's where the gratitude comes in do you think that it's just impossible to ever reproduce that again in the sense that like has money chain that I mean back in the 80s you guys just didn't get paid a fraction of what players get today do you think that has shoulders to when you in order to win you got to get there somehow or another the team has a shorter window to do it to bring it all together but they have to get there on an emotional level in order to win st. Louis did this year that you know you look at them but just before Christmas they weren't even in the playoffs yeah kind of an amazing turnaround amazing Turner but somehow or another they were able to emotionally connect on a much deeper level than they had ever in the past and it's without that so yeah I think the principles of winning are the same you got a much shorter window to do it it comes and goes for some organizations where they don't quite get there but any team that actually wins will tell you there that the team connected in a way that they didn't probably feel possible at some point prior notwithstanding that your kids are still at a point where you don't want to be away from home but fast forward a few years your kids are all in college or doing their own thing would you want a coach in the NHL it's hard to say I obviously feel like I have a lot to offer any organization any team because of my experiences that would lend itself well to any part of the organization coaching is something that

[02:03:33] I enjoy and I don't think there's a big difference philosophy speaking coaching a 16 year old team than coaching an NHL team because you do have to communicate the bench awareness the things that come have to come naturally to some of the coaches and it doesn't come naturally to everybody it just doesn't I recognize that I do have a unique ability to coach and I think I get it from my father and to communicate so it'll be interesting to see if that ever happens one day and the last question sort of out of your purview but will Toronto ever win the

[02:04:09] Stanley I'm asking seriously I do write do we think so you know the toughest part about our game is it is such a tough league but the good news is that you can see a team like st. Louis bring it together in a short period of time I mean they obviously had the pieces they couldn't have one that they didn't have the pieces in order to do it but somehow or another they are able to galvanize which in a way that they hadn't previously and so when you look at the turnarounds of teams that have gone on to to win the Stanley Cup in the last ten years you know you look at LA you know when it's finishing eighth and winning the Stanley Cup the league is structured now that every team has weaknesses there's no perfect team out there right now everyone team has to decide where they're gonna put their strengths and and absorb the weaknesses because of the salary cap area and what it does is it lends itself to a very competitive environment where it's a tough League and but it also gives a lot of teams a lot of hope that it can win and I think it's good for the fans it's good for the league it's good for the players it's good for their organizations it's gonna be hard for someone to dominate perhaps like we did in the 80s or something like that but to answer your question I believe the

[02:05:26] Toronto Maple Leafs are gonna with the nucleus they have there right now they should be able to get it done and it's now probably longer than the Rangers drought because wasn't the Leafs last Cup in 67 67 so what are we working on now yeah so you're that's long that's that's actually that is now longer than the Rangers four years is a long time well a long long long time but I love the Leafs no I guess it's not quite there yet another couple years but I think it's funny grown up in Toronto I never like the leaves because I just think the sort of that Harold Ballard era was so bad and I mean we would go to the gardens but you were going to watch the other teams they were coming I mean every time the Oilers played including exhibition games I was sitting up in those crappy gray seats to watch a game but now I'm always amazed when I'm back in Toronto just what an ordeal it is to get to the Air

[02:06:19] Canada Centre to see a game I mean it's got to be one of the toughest towns to get tickets I just know coming to New York and original six team and a passion behind the generations of fans that were here it didn't take me long to understand the gravity of it and if you and then when I say I love the Leafs I love the least because of that same yeah yeah original six teams are just richness team the history the the the passion the heartbreak the all the things that go into an organization that make it so compelling to go to the game and to cheer the Leafs on if you're a leaf fan and even if you're not a leaf fan you still got a respect where they've been and where they've come from and and the way the organization has moved into the modern era and this juggernaut organization that is just so compelling well if they win this year

[02:07:08] I've done the math now it'll be 53 years if they win this year so they've got one and they've got two years left - where did I say 54 is long a long time but they're working on it so hopefully they can get it done sooner or later it'll be nice to see a Canadian team get in there but oh yeah for sure it's that it won't be I can guarantee it won't be given to him mark has been awesome thank you so much for all these insights you know the first time we met

[02:07:36] I remember you never know when you're a kid you know you meet you meet your boyhood heroes you sort of you just never know like can they live up to the poster on your wall can they live up to that time you got that autograph then you got to stand in front of them for 3.7 seconds while they scribbled something on your hockey stick or whatever it's been a pleasure getting to know you and I think that this podcast I think is just hopefully a great way for folks to get to really understand your style of leadership which is certainly not about boasting but about just sort of a quiet passionate yet highly intuitive and introspective form of leadership that I I don't know I guess

[02:08:14] I'm biased but I don't think we see a lot of that in sports anymore if nothing else I'm highly appreciative of it and I know that others will be also well thank you great being on great talk and hockey as always and we'll be watching those Leafs all right let's go get some dinner you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at
