## Description

Original release date: 6/8/20

In this episode, Eileen White, Chief Scientific Officer at the Rutgers Cancer Institute, describes the fundamental role of autophagy in the maintenance of health and prevention of neurodegeneration, cancer, and other diseases. She also goes into detail about the paradoxical finding that autophagy may benefit an existing cancer cell and help it to survive—a discovery leading to new possibilities in cancer therapy. We also discuss fasting (and molecules that induce autophagy) and the critical need to decode the proper fasting “dose” in order to improve human health.

We discuss:
00:00:00 - Intro
00:03:40 - Eileen’s discovery that a specific oncogene blocks apoptosis 
00:10:00 - Defining apoptosis and its role in cancer prevention  
00:17:20 - How cancer cells use the autophagy pathway to survive 
00:29:15 - Stressors that induce autophagy  
00:32:45 - The importance of autophagy in the brain and liver 
00:40:00 - The mechanisms that can trigger autophagy to support longevity  
00:42:30 - Evidence for cancer treatment by blocking autophagy  
00:46:45 - Types of cancer that are most autophagy-dependent 
00:52:40 - The autophagy paradox  
00:59:15 - Finding a molecular signal for autophagy 
01:13:00 - Current knowledge gaps around fasting as a tool for longevity  
01:22:15 - Rapamycin, metformin, and other molecules that may induce autophagy  
01:32:50 - How to study fasting and exercise as longevity tools  
01:36:45 - The Nobel Prize for autophagic research  
01:38:25 - Eileen’s future areas of research  
01:49:25 - A fasting strategy for Alzheimer’s disease prevention 
01:51:30 - Future study of metabolism and autophagy

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the episode:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Eileen White, discussing autophagy and its role in health, disease prevention, and cancer treatment. The conversation explores the complex relationship between autophagy and cancer, where autophagy appears to both prevent cancer development but also potentially help cancer cells survive once established. They discuss the importance of fasting as a tool to induce autophagy and the critical need to better understand proper "dosing" of fasting protocols.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Autophagy is elevated in cancer cells even in fed states compared to normal cells [24:00]
- Autophagy-deficient mice die within 16 hours of fasting [1:09:18]
- Brain and liver are particularly sensitive to autophagy disruption [1:44:23]
- LC3 protein conversion is a key marker of autophagy activity [1:07:06]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Fasting appears beneficial for health maintenance [1:20:07]
- Exercise potently induces autophagy [31:03]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Cancer patients may need different approaches to fasting depending on treatment stage [58:35]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- Rapamycin [1:30:53]
- Metformin [1:28:38]
- Hydroxychloroquine (as research tool) [1:09:18]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Exercise induces autophagy potently [31:03]
- Exercise damages muscle and autophagy helps mitigate this damage [31:03]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Water-only fasting discussed extensively
- 3-day vs. 7-day fasting protocols compared [1:02:03]
- Metabolic changes during fasting detailed [1:18:54]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- LC3 conversion as autophagy marker [1:07:06]
- Glucose, insulin, uric acid changes during fasting [1:03:00]
- Beta-hydroxybutyrate levels [1:03:00]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Yoshinori Ohsumi's Nobel Prize work mentioned [1:37:26]
- David Sabatini's work referenced [1:34:38]
- George Cahill's 40-day fasting study cited [1:18:54]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"Fasting is probably the most potent tool we have, and yet we don't know how to dose it." [1:21:38]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- How can we develop reliable biomarkers for autophagy in humans?
- What is the optimal fasting protocol for disease prevention?
- How does autophagy specifically affect cardiovascular disease?
