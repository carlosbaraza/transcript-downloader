In this clip, they discuss:

- Strength Training in Menopause – Transition into perimenopause and menopause is a key time to prioritize fitness
- Start Early – Women who enter this stage already fit tend to handle hormone changes much better
- Common Challenges – Sleep issues and tendon stiffness, including frozen shoulder, often emerge
- Role of HRT – Hormone replacement therapy can be helpful for some, alongside training
- Myth of “Bulking Up” – Women rarely gain large muscle mass from training
