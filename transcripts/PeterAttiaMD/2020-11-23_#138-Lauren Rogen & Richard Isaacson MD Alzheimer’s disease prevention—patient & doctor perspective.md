## Description

Peter is joined by writer, director, actress, and founder of HFC, Lauren Miller Rogen, and previous podcast guest and director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian, Dr. Richard Isaacson. In this episode, Lauren tells the heartbreaking story of watching members of her family succumb to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) which motivated her to proactively address her own risk with Richard’s guidance. Richard discusses the various genetic and lifestyle factors that influence the risk of AD and uses Lauren’s unique situation to explain how he diagnoses patients and personalizes care. They go through Lauren’s protocol of preventative measures that have already produced marked results, and end with the uplifting message that one’s genetic predisposition does not seal one's fate.

[00:00:03] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guests this week are lauren miller rogan and richard isaacson lauren is an actress screenwriter director but also a friend and patient she's the co-founder of hilarity for charity or hfc a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to care for the families facing disease of alzheimer's disease educate them about living a healthy brain life and activate the next generation of alzheimer's advocates richard isaacson should be a familiar name for some of you as he was a guest on a previous episode of the drive in late 2018 when we did a deep dive into alzheimer's disease many of you have requested follow-up podcasts on this topic among them this is one richard serves as the director of the alzheimer's prevention clinic at weill cornell new york presbyterian hospital and is a assistant dean at the office of the faculty of wild cornell of medicine i've known lauren for a couple of years we actually met through richard and the three of us been talking about doing this podcast for about a year in fact we were going to do it last fall and then we put it off until the spring and then covid got in the way so this one's been a long time coming my intuition was that being able to talk about alzheimer's disease with richard and lauren simultaneously would be a beautiful way to discuss the human tragedy of the disease and also to talk about the science of prevention and the pathology of the disease and and honestly by the end of this discussion i felt we had really achieved that i think lauren's story is both heartbreaking and uplifting for reasons that will become clear as you listen to this in this episode we talk about her journey with her family history what led her to richard and ultimately what really changed the course of her life with respect to how she treats prevention we talk a lot about what preventative measures look like today and how we look at the evolving body of literature to figure out how to modify risk so if you have even a slight interest in the prevention of alzheimer's disease i think you're going to find this episode both touching and enlightening so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with lauren miller rogan and richard isaacson [Music] lauren and richard what a privilege to be sort of sitting down with you guys right now we have been kicking around the idea of doing this for about a year now kovid kind of got in our way we were going to do this obviously in person last year so while it's long overdue i think this is just such an exciting opportunity both to kind of hear from you lauren and and kind of understand your personal journey um which you've basically taken on as your life's mission and then obviously richard to to to have you back on uh and and kind of i don't know i think bring people up to speed on what's what's happened in the last couple of years so thanks both of you for making time today thank you for having us you know i feel like longtime listener first time guest very excited to be here long time listener as well yeah i hang on every word of of most of the podcasts especially i had to listen to tom dayspring's podcast like 14 times i'm still like need to listen to it on repeat but lauren let's start with you i mean i want people to really get an understanding of of your story so i mean when did you first become aware that there was something going on in your family that was robbing people of this precious thing called their mind unfortunately alzheimer's has been a part of my life as long as i can have my own memory my grandfather my mom's dad had alzheimer's my aunt has told me it seems like he showed symptoms maybe in his late 50s or early 60s but he was in a nursing home i think from the time i was around eight or nine maybe 10 and he passed away when i was 12 but when you're young that age to me his memory issues were almost funny right like he would take his teeth out at the table and i thought that was hysterical and he would you know repeat things and again like when you're little that's funny and i didn't have any concept of the fact that the reason he had to go into a nursing home was because he was wandering and that my grandmother couldn't take care of him and then after he passed away my grandmother started showing signs of dementia and you know she was struggling to take care of herself and was clearly wasn't eating and but you know i was in high school so again i wasn't really that aware of the situation and what was happening but you know i was aware when they brought her from her home in south florida up to where we were in central florida to put her in a facility you know and how she was curled over in the seat sleeping and not aware when i was showing her how i could drive for the first time and how she eventually stopped being able to walk or talk or feed herself and my senior year i would go visit her every friday after school and you know a few other days during the week but you know when she spent the last year of her life curled up in a bed obviously not talking or being able to care for herself in any any way at all it was a lot at 18 and but it was still i was younger and it was my grandmother you know i think when you're young and you envision your grandparents is like well they're grandparents they're you know this happens to them even though you know mike i think my grandmother was 76 maybe so then she passed away and then at my college graduation when i was 22 my mom was 52 she repeated a story a few times and you know my mom who was this incredibly smart vibrant woman who was aggressive about the things she wanted in her life and she didn't take no for an answer type of woman but throughout her life she would always say when i get alzheimer's when i get alzheimer's and i say stop saying that don't say that like and then at my graduation when she repeated the story a few times i thought oh god but i didn't say anything of course and then you know over the next year or two it became clear that this repetition was becoming a part of who she was and she was losing control of you know her ability to teach and to you know do any number of things that someone who is fully functioning in a cognitive way could do eventually we encouraged my dad to take her to a doctor and you know over the course of a year and a half or so we got as you know as much as a diagnosis as one could get at that time you're just out of college and you're being confronted with the idea that your mom is not even in her mid-50s yet and she's already in the early stages of alzheimer's disease something that's already prematurely taken her parents i'm guessing it's now sort of setting in that there's something going on in your family right yeah i mean there was a lot of denial i would say a lot of fear a lot of anger and of course a lot of depression and i think what was really hard about it at the time was my mom wouldn't let us talk about it and you know at this point i can only imagine what her identity felt like as a daughter of alzheimer's herself what was driving her at this point but to me things were really starting to become clear in a really scary way at that point i didn't talk to anyone about it because i didn't i think you know when you talk about something it seems real all of a sudden it's really happening even your father oh god especially not my dad because my dad was the most in denial about any of us you know my dad you know my parents had you know an amazing marriage and they were best friends and partners and he admired my mom for her brain and for how smart she was and how passionate she was about what she did and how hard she worked and so yeah he was the last one i think to come around but eventually a few months after seth and i started dating actually my parents came out to visit this was in 2005 to meet him and came out for my birthday and when i dropped them off at the airport and i came back to seth's apartment it was the first time i said it out loud that i was afraid my mom was developing alzheimer's and it was the first time i cried about it and he was like no no she's fine no it's fine i'm like you don't know her you don't know how the person you met this weekend is different than who she was and you know it was i guess around two years from that point of going to visit and she'd be worse it was clear you know at some point she shouldn't be driving eventually her school decided she shouldn't be in a traditional classroom anymore and took her out of that classroom it was just who she was was fading away and changing right in front of her eyes she couldn't have these long conversations anymore she again would repeat herself she would call with the same thing over and over again and it was devastating i was in a very dark place at the time do you have any sense that she was aware of some of these things for example the idea that she could no longer teach her classes and to have that taken away from her by her peers did that register with her what was happening and why yeah you know i never i didn't have that direct conversation with her about it i'm sure my dad did i think she took that stuff in stride probably to act like a strong independent person for us but when she eventually had to retire i know she wasn't thrilled about it but she was at a point where cognitively she wasn't at full function anymore and so it became a bit easier to change her life in a way where she didn't question it which is you know really sad to think about but i think it was i had one conversation with her early early on it i read in teen magazine if there's ever something difficult you want to talk to your parents about do it in the car because the drive will eventually end and so the awkward conversation will naturally end so i remember one time i was home in florida and i was visiting them it might have been around the time she was forced to retire and we were driving to target and i asked her if she was scared about getting alzheimer's and she told me that she wasn't scared for her she was scared for me and my brother and my dad because i think she got that at some point she may not know what's happening and that the weight would be on us i think she knew that because of what happened with her dad and her mom and i can only imagine how terrifying that was for her but i you know i can't understand where she was at that point cognitively or emotionally even to really know the fear there so you mentioned that this is around the time when i mean it's now hitting you with the full force yeah and i assume it's much less or i mean maybe somewhat but probably less about what the implications are for you and much more about the loss of her yeah which of course you know i was in my early 20s so that was only about me but i was at a point in my life where i was just starting to become friends with her she had getting a little emotional she had come out to visit i moved to la in january of 2004 and she came out to visit in march of 2004 during her spring break and we had such a great time being you know i was 22 but you know a grown-up and we went to dinner just the two of us like as grown-ups and like drank wine and like she wasn't a big drinker she would drink a sea breeze i remember and like it felt like i was reaching that point where she was my friend which i think you know now i have so many girlfriends who their moms are their best friends and i instantly felt like that was being taken away from me and was so angry about it and so jealous of all my friends who were having those relationships with their moms and felt so hopeless you know i would go online and i would just search like cure for alzheimer's treatment for alzheimer's gotta be there i know i can find it like i'm the kind of person who's like if i'm gonna do so i'm gonna do it you know and like no there's something out there i can find something for her and there was nothing like there was nothing and so it was a really scary hard time where i felt like i could do nothing and that this train had left the station for my mom and that was it so i want to give you a chance to just sort of catch your breath a bit and richard i want to sort of ask you a couple of questions right now not necessarily specifically about lauren's mom because i want to come to that in some detail later when you actually when we get to the part of the story where you and lauren meet but i want to just ask you a broader question here which is help a listener understand the context of this type of alzheimer's disease and by this type i mean one that is so clearly familial and also so early in onset how do you think about that as a neurologist what's going through your mind as you think about this type of a case in terms of genetic predisposition let's just let's just start with the genetics of this sure so i first have to start with just i hate this disease i just like hate it i hate hearing stories now you're gonna make me cry lord i'm on a podcast come on i'm on record i can't well no one can see us so it's fine okay good perfect i just hate this disease so much because it's so insidious it's so nasty it's so just it just it robs not just the per i mean it robs the person of who they are but it robs the whole family i mean just like you just said it's like it robbed you of like the good years like the the friendship years and and that's just so i hate this disease alzheimer's disease starts in the brain decades before the first symptom of memory loss begins and i didn't learn that in medical school i hate to say it but most doctors don't know that still you know the new diagnostic criteria have been out now for about a decade but you know when i hear at 52 i say oh my gosh what was hap in their in her 30s what was happening in her 30s like why why is this happening and then i hear the family history and i hear wow her mom and her dad why why is this happening and lauren we have some small world coincidences which we learned about later but like my brother he's a neurologist he's he's older than me he took care of another one of your family members like on another so like why why is this and of course the first thing you think about is genetic and then you think about well is this early onset what is early onset i think most people think about alzheimer's disease an older person's disease greater than 70 72 74 what's what's the average age but there's a small tiny sliver a small small group that i would qualify as having early onset alzheimer's disease due to a genetic reason where the person usually gets alzheimer's in their you know 40s or 50s but you know lauren your family was different and we'll talk about this later but when i hear a family history like this i say well well why do certain people in in one family get it later and the other people in the family get it earlier this is actually earlier on said alzheimer's and i maybe made that up but what is what is it this person should have been affected in the later years and something is fast forwarding something is there's like a one plus one equals three here there's like a mishmash of things that just like the first thing i think about is why is this happening and number one i say okay genetics there's got to be some genetic something and then number two is okay then i think about well could it be lifestyle could it be an exposure to something could it be head trauma could it be uncontrolled diabetes high blood pressure cholesterol these are all things that you know just synergize together to potentially make a late onset alzheimer's case start earlier so so these are the some of the things like you know detective work things that i think about but no it's not typical what genes do you think about richard what are the suite of genes i mean there's the obvious ones apoe4 but there are other genes that could be implicated in early cases can you say a little bit about those sure so there's the typical early onset genes there's really only three uh presynalin one presinalin2 and amyloid precursor protein gene mutation i can count on my two hands how many patients i've seen with that i've seen over 1500 patients easily probably close to 2 000 patients over the last you know 15 plus years literally two hands it's all i got lauren you actually introduced me to one an amazing amazing person great individual and someone that i who she may have that gene but i will not say that she will get alzheimer's so so for the first time in my career i've not only we not only figured out that someone has an early onset gene which means you're going to get alzheimer's but just wait our field is making a lot of progress so you know these three genes are just so rare that's number one most people that have earlier onset alzheimer's have a milieu of things so i would call it polygenic risk so apoe apoe4 the variant apoe4 is the most common genetic risk factor for alzheimer's disease now the difference between apo e4 having one variant or two i'll explain that in a second means if you get the e4 it doesn't mean you're going to get alzheimer's it just increases your risk if you get president one president ii or amyloid precursor protein gene mutation sorry for the long words there if you get those genes you get alzheimer's that's that's what the books say except in that one person that you introduced me to lauren we're gonna we got time she's in her 20s we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna get this up for her and those richard really represent far less than one percent of the total cases are made up of app psen1 psen2 for what it's worth i've never actually seen one i for me those only exist in the literature the interesting aside by the way is there's some people speculate that the index case of alzheimer's disease was actually one of those and some of our understanding of this disease may be incorrect as a result of that but we'll we'll kick that to another discussion so when you meet a person like lauren you're not necessarily thinking one of those three genes you were just thinking some aggressive combination of other things yep and it's um epigenetics would be the word that i think about so the term epigenetics encompasses a person's genetics plus the environmental impact the milieu of what a person does in their lifestyle or behavior or what they were exposed to for example whether it was a virus or if it was a traumatic something or if it was something that triggered the gene to work in one way or another and the term polygenic risk means that there are multiple genes that work together now some genes can increase risk and some people some genes actually decrease risk so the future of alzheimer's disease well i believe the future of alzheimer's disease is based in precision medicine using these types of genetic underpinnings understanding all the individual genes that impact a person's risk figuring out what they are figuring out what their biological function is figuring out why it puts a person down the path towards alzheimer's and then telling that person to do a b c x y and z to get them off the path towards alzheimer's that's the future of alzheimer's and i think in a lot of ways the future is now but apoe is by far the most well understood most well researched every patient that walks through our doors gets an apoe test you know there are commercial like anyone can basically find out what their apoe status is just for the listener out there you get one from mom and one from dad either an apoe2 a three or a four it's called an allele or a variant a lot of people call it a mutation but it's not a mutation so you get a two or three or four from mom or dad and a four increases risk a little bit a three is neutral and a two actually is protective so if someone comes in as an apoe33 that's a pretty you know neutral risk kind of boring no big deal apoe23 okay maybe they have some protection and one for apoe34 for example increases risk a little bit and then two fours apoe4 fours increases risk more so but again genes are not our destiny we can absolutely win the tug of war against our genes and you know four fours i have dozens of patients in my practice that i absolutely think that they are not going to get alzheimer's disease they they're going to be able to do some things to delay it they also have other genes to protect them so without getting too detailed apoe4 is important we personalize care you know if someone has a four we're going to tell them to do certain things someone doesn't have a four we're going to do other things for them because their other things are preferentially effective but this polygenic risk is what i'm thinking so when i hear about lauren's mom like what is it what are you force sure but what else there's got to be something else the devil is in the details there richard i want to go back to lauren to continue the story before i do can you explain for folks that want a bit more of an understanding what is it about having the e4 variant relative to the e3 variant that increases risk so the gene codes for a protein that differs in what way from the what we call the wild type or the e3 variant so i guess how i would answer that is starting by basic what does apoe mean apo is apolipoprotein that means something related to cholesterol i guess people actually who get the gene tested in our practice actually get it through a cardiovascular disease prevention panel peter you and i have used the same labs you may be focused more on cardiovascular disease prevention i focus more on alzheimer's disease risk reduction and prevention but it's really a cardiovascular risk gene just as much as it is in alzheimer's risk gene so the way that i think about apoe4 is it increases vascular risk it increases the likelihood of a bad pathologic protein called amyloid it's a sticky stuff that builds up in the brain of a person with alzheimer's and people with this gene are more likely to have accelerated deposition or accelerated accumulation of this amyloid protein through a what i would call just in a basic sense a a cholesterol-like vascular-like pathway there's a ton more i can talk about it but you know once you've seen one person with alzheimer's you've seen one person with alzheimer's and different people can take different roads to alzheimer's disease and the apoe4 road is actually something i kind of understand i kind of get it i i feel good about it i know that may sound callous or strange but like i know what i'm up against like okay great we can do lifestyle things we can manage cholesterol in a certain way we can do all these different things and i know certain things that work and i know what i'm up against it's the person that actually doesn't have the e4 that i'm like wow they're either spared or they have another gene lurking how do i find it and what the heck do i do about it so e4 doesn't bother me and i i feel relieved sometimes when we find it in a person all right well i think we'll we'll talk a little bit more about this but lauren i want to kind of hear more from your story so as you're now kind of coming to grips with the fact that your mom is slowly slipping away and you're also realizing that unlike oh if my mom has premature heart disease for which there's no shortage of treatments you're realizing actually your ability to access the best in medical care isn't really going to to do much what's the temporal course of her progression so as we get let's say fast forward to when you and seth get married which is you know 10 years ago how is she at that point which is still probably putting her in her late 50s right she just turned 60. so at that point she could still walk she was there were moments where she knew us no she knew us she knew that we were her family and that we were her loved ones but she was you know at that point being fully cared for by my father at that point you know but she could still dress herself and bathe herself and use the restroom but you know planning i would say planning my wedding was was a real emotional turning point for me because it was you know i i always was the kind of you know girl who like envisioned my wedding and it was be this thing and then my mom and i would do it together and that is just not what happened at all to the point where you know i couldn't even have her there when i was getting ready because she would just be wandering and my dad had to take her to a separate hair appointment because it would just would be too disruptive to get everything together to have her there but you know when she walked in i remember that morning off back up a bit to say we had a bit of a weekend our wedding and friday night was a small thing and saturday and saturday night there was a dinner and it was not good you know we had taken my mom from her home which for an alzheimer's patient for anyone with dementia is difficult to take someone out of their space their routine where they know everything and they are familiar with their their world so that of course had put her in a place where i think she was probably feeling very scared because she didn't understand where she was or what was happening and at our rehearsal dinner the night before i remember her telling me she just wanted to go home which was you know really hard to handle but then miraculously the day of like she walked in and she called me the bride and she knew that i was the bride and that i think she knew that i was her daughter but she knew she felt proud she knew she felt love and i have an amazing photo of her like looking at me and holding my hand and it's just she know she knows that you know there's a connection there but it wasn't you know it wasn't the moment that i had certainly dreamed of and i feel like it was my dad and i that walked her down the aisle instead of him and her walking me down the aisle and you know normally in jewish weddings the family stands up next to the bride and groom and we didn't do that we had them sitting next to us because we knew my mom couldn't do that so at that point she was you know she hadn't she wasn't teaching anymore that was a few years earlier that had ended so it was for me it was a really hard thing but luckily she rose to the occasion that day which you know it's interesting throughout this journey with her you know i think people that don't understand the disease trying to find some sort of lightness and hope would always be like but she must have good days sometimes she must remember you sometimes does she does she remember you sometimes and i'd always be like no it's gone like that's gone it's not like sometimes you remember like oh i use my legs for walking like once that's gone that's gone but for whatever reason the day of my actual wedding i will say she was as there as anyone could be in her state and that was an amazing thing but but overall it was it was only a few months after that that we encouraged my parents to move out to los angeles because you know my dad it was clear that it was killing it was going to kill my dad before he killed her the stress of taking care of her he always talks about the plane ride home from our wedding was like the worst five hours of his life because she had had an accident in her seat on the airplane and was acting out and was screaming and they had to get help to get off the plane when they landed back in florida and it was a you know a pretty horrific time i mean these are some of the things that we're going to talk a lot about hilarity for charity and why the focus is on the family which i think is part of why i'm so excited about it and you can ask me a hundred times to do something for it and i'll always say yes so you always apologize but but but i really i'm really so fond of organizations that take that step and appreciate what is being done for the family too often people think the only way to make a differences to fund research and clearly that's important but it's too easy to ignore that while we're waiting for these things to happen people need help in caring for this and i suppose there's no disease where that's more true than than this one absolutely richard can you just spend a minute kind of explaining what it is about the deposition of these plaques the accumulation of the tau why does it lead to this largely predictable set of symptoms that don't just involve almost a folksy funny loss of memory right but also at some of this deeper level of this what i suspect is fear and confusion on on some level right like why would she be upset on the airplane well i'm guessing on some level there's a sense of fear right there's something is wrong why is she not able to control her bowel or bladder like how is this disease wreaking so much havoc on the central nervous system richard yeah so there's um actually a couple who i believe were both pathologists um brock and brock b-r-a-a-k and what they did was they kind of came up with the brock staging of of pathology where the amyloid protein and then the pathology of alzheimer's spreads over different parts of the brain and you know when i was in medical school i was taught that alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disease characterized by changes in short-term memory and then later on that includes changes in some behaviors neuropsychiatric disease changes in sleep and then the person as the pathology spreads they can no longer take care of themselves what we really now understand about alzheimer's is it's a much more heterogeneous disease meaning wherever the pathology goes those are the symptoms that manifest so there are newer forms of alzheimer's and and they're newer because they're now published in the literature but we've seen this for decades there's one newer form that has something called a dis-executive syndrome well what does that mean executive function is higher order processing judgment planning you know you find a wallet on the floor what do you do with it right peter would take the money out put the money in his pocket throw the wallet back on the floor you know you know lauren she's very empathetic and compassionate she'd look at the license you know she'd say oh i'm gonna go find this guy i'm gonna go to the ends of the earth to find this person's wallet so that's executive function maybe it depends depends on this depends on how much is in there exactly that's one form of alzheimer's you know another form of alzheimer's is part p-a-r-t primary age-related taupopathy so we've talked about amyloid but what about tau how's another protein and there's tau and amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles and and then there's glucose hypometabolism meaning the glucose the sugar in the brain it's just not being efficiently able to be used to power the brain cells so depending on where the problem is you have different manifestations cognitive symptoms i guess and part for example is primary age-related tauopathy again one more time it's related to age so it's usually in older people easily 70s more likely 80s and 90s and it's specifically short-term memory and it's specifically because that pathology is localized to the memory centers in the brain uh the hippocampus for example but that person can still have good executive function the frontal lobes the front part of the brain is working so it just depends it depends you know for example there's when the pathology when the bad stuff goes to the back part of the brain that's where the visual fibers are so the eyes are in the front but they have visual projections that go to the back you interpret images well when someone can't interpret images they get confused they they act funny they may be weird they may be you know confused but it's not exactly a memory problem it's a it's a visual perception problem so you know i don't want to be cheeky but like richard no no this is this is very interesting and i've never really thought of it this way but as you probably are aware we don't really think of cancer as one disease anymore right i mean i mean that's it's been a while that nobody's thought of cancer as one disease so breast cancer and colon cancer have very little in common i mean about the only thing they have in common is unregulated cell growth but thereafter they're very different diseases not just in the ability to impact a different organ and it sounds like what you're saying is alzheimer's is not really one disease it's kind of an umbrella term that encompasses many different diseases of the brain that have some common features in the way that cancers all cancers have some common features that you know cells don't respond to normal signaling but th this notion that someone could have a form of alzheimer's that largely spares the frontal cortex and therefore preserves some higher order functioning versus another person that has something that's not i mean listening to the story of lauren's mom just hearing what we've heard so far how would you think about the ideology or the insult well i'll try not to bias my answer because i know a lot about lauren's mom and lauren's whole family but if i just took for face value what lauren said that symptoms began with little repeating of stories and memory glitches around 52 to 54 to where she had to have then a modified work schedule to then six years later she's having trouble caring for herself maybe not recognizing her daughter and then having emotional behavioral psychiatric components i mean that that sounds like alzheimer's disease that sounds like progressive short-term memory loss plus behavior changes plus you know other things so it sounds like she started in the mild cognitive impairment phase with the symptoms so there's three phases of alzheimer's three stages maybe we should take a take a step back for listeners the first stage is actually the pre-clinical phase the pre-symptomatic phase where alzheimer's disease has started in the brain but there are no symptoms yet no clinically apparent symptoms believe it or not there are 46 million americans with alzheimer's disease in their brain right now but no symptoms that's crazy i've never heard that before that number you've noticed that's wow yeah i try to keep that close to my my vest because how do we know that richard that's what the studies say you know i don't know you're the critical appraiser of studies i'll have to send you the study and you can tear it apart peter you're going to bring this one to journal club next month what a great what a great idea i love those journal clubs that sounds like the nerdiest club of all time oh my and we and we've discussed you and we've just no it is nerdy it is pretty freaking nerdy and we record it and then we watch it and we oh my god yeah i was i was captain of my math team at comac high school well there you go never mind it sounds really cool then thank you thank you um also the alma mater of lauren's mom high five go comac um and lauren's uncle and some others anyway so this preclinical pre-symptomatic phase is by far the most important phase i think well maybe to focus on because that would be prevention of alzheimer's you can call it either treating preclinical alzheimer's or secondary prevention of alzheimer's because you're trying to prevent the dementia from happening so stage one is pre-clinical alzheimer's stage two is mild cognitive impairment due to alzheimer's where there are enough memory glitches and other changes to where it's noticeable it's greater than a standard deviation and a half below the norm but the person can still take care of themselves so i think lauren when your mom started having symptoms she was easily in the borderline preclinical to mci stage and then people have you know roughly between a 12 and 16 per year depending on what study you read chance of converting from mci mild cognitive impairment due to alzheimer's to dementia due to alzheimer's and the only difference is they still have the symptoms they're just worse and they can no longer take care of themselves so you know lauren many people would be very pleased and i'm thankful that um if symptoms started at 52 and she was able to attend your um wedding at 60. i mean that's horrible but better than it could have been in the grand scheme she was there you know i have friends who who unfortunately lost were had weddings without parents there so because they had lost them already so yeah absolutely so so these are the stages okay it's a staggering number and whether it's 46 million or 36 million or whatever the number is you know it's not surprising in the sense that if when you look at how many people are pre-diabetic and you think about how that is one of the pathways to alzheimer's disease sort of the energy-dependent pathway it's very plausible especially when you consider the other pathways richard one thing i want to park with you to come back to is some thinking around how many different variants of the disease there are right sort of the lipid variant of the disease the toxin variant the potentially an infectious variant if such if one such exists so maybe we'll i'll let you think about that for a minute so lauren i want to talk about how you made your way to to richard because that's how you and i met you and i met through richard but i want to know how you and richard met sure so okay i'll try to keep this somewhat brief i feel like it might be long this is a hilarious story i'm sorry i remember this like a video in my mind but anyway i don't want interrupt so in 2011 it was the year that i got married it was the year i shot for a good time call and it was the first year that we planned the first hilarity for charity event which was january of 2012. so 2011 was a pivotal year for me up until that point like i said i had been really dark and depressed and i had been trying to work and you know i'm a screenwriter and i was writing but like i just spent a lot of time just being pretty dark and pretty upset and then a friend came to me and was like let's throw an event and raise money for alzheimer's and i was like no but then he wore me down thank god and we did and so in january of 2012 we threw our first variety show to raise money for the alzheimer's association and that was you know an incredible event we raised a few hundred thousand dollars but was the the most incredible part of that was that we were contacted by young people who felt seen for the first time because they were seeing me in my you know late twenties and my husband in his late twenties talk about alzheimer's which you know even for me up until that point every image of alzheimer's i had seen was of someone who was old and gray and not at all related to me in any way that i could understand so we felt like we had an opportunity to continue talking and to continue hopefully gathering people and helping them feel like they too had a place in this disease which is considered a disease for old people and so that's when we kind of decided to form our own little organization which was a fund within the alzheimer's association for many years in 2017 became our own 501c3 but during that time of course we became alzheimer's advocates and i met many smart people and doctors and scientists and and other advocates who were doing all sorts of incredible work we became friendly with maria shriver who of course has always used her platform to raise awareness about alzheimer's and is so so incredible and had really sort of gotten to know the alzheimer's community a bit so then my uncle who is my mom's brother who was five years older than her was starting to show symptoms now my uncle who was an athlete his whole life he was and and his later life started when he was i don't know i guess maybe in his 40s riding a bike and was a obsessive bike rider and he was in great shape and he's a big strong muscular guy and we'll get into some of the other things why alzheimer's happened and my mom earlier than it did with him but he started showing symptoms and i wasn't allowed to talk about that publicly at the time unfortunately he passed away in march this year only a month after my mom and his family my aunt and my cousins have fortunately now given permission to tell his story so it can potentially help so he was starting to show symptoms and they were on the east coast so they came to me and said what do we do how do we what do we do at this point at this point by the way my mom was very advanced at this point they were out here this was i don't know what richard it was 20 14 15 16 even 17. and basically i'd reach out to a doctor that i knew was like you know my uncle's on the the east coast i want to get him into the best of the best who is it and this person recommended richard the best of the best looking i hope the best-looking all-stars doctor there could yes exactly thankfully this is a podcast that's what my uncle was hoping for was the best-looking first doctor the one the one with the best phones i think definitely the best phone well i i mean certainly i've listened to that episode where we talk about where you guys talked about richard's phones oh god he's showing one everyone's missing it there's rhinestones is a horse on the back at the top are those not rhinestones diamonds hello oh diamond excuse me those are diamonds it's the diamond pillow come on anyway so gave me richard's name and i went on his website and i found his email it's direct email because of course i was again i'm not the kind of person who's like i'm going to be polite and keep my mouth shut and follow the rules to get to where i need to go like i'm going to do what i got to do so so i found his like direct email address and was like hi here's who i am this is what i've done my uncle has alzheimer's and needs your help and so he wrote me back right away and then of course then we connected that he was from comac and that my mom and my uncle had gone to the same high school as richard which is you know what a small world he of course got my my uncle in there right away and they went on the journey that they went on so then i was in la and then i once i connected them i came to new york you know a few months later or something and i you know said i'm coming new york i want to come see the clinic come meet you and then of course you know i'm seeing the clinic and talking to him and then i was like i want in i want to be a patient i want to prevent alzheimer's let me in help my brain you literally like i don't know how to do this but like like shot out your arm and said like take my blood now let's do it and like literally you walked into the clinic we like literally stuck a needle you signed a consent form and then like it was the quickest most rapid alzheimer's prevention consult in the history of our program so lucky for me lucky for me what kind of shape was your uncle in at that point in time i actually didn't realize this part of the story that that the initial connection with richard was actually a consultation for your uncle is that presumably because at that point you felt your mom was just advanced enough that it yeah no at that point my mom was she was fully bedridden i'm pretty sure at that point getting everything fed to her fully cared for there was her train had long left the station so your mom at that point would have been in her early 60s i guess and your uncle is a little older did you say yeah so he's five years older than her and he was you know i would say in that that mci in that mild cognitive impairment space right richard or even almost a little before that it was he was a very functional guy i you know with both my mom and my uncle and you know and you guys can speak to this more about other people they could both like rise to the the occasion in a way and so you know i knew that what my aunt was seeing with my uncle was different than what i saw that he could somehow dig deep and put on a show if you will and act like he was still in control but there were little things little hints that that wasn't happening whereas my mom we were far past that point richard let's talk a little bit about now the beginning you go down this path of kind of being a detective so you're never going to get to meet the parents the grandparents in this case but the parents of your first patient but you know enough about their story you're meeting lauren's uncle you know about lauren's mom though you haven't met her how are you now starting to piece together this family first for the standpoint of trying to understand if anything can be done to help lauren's uncle but ultimately to really figure out what to do to help lauren and her brother yeah this is detective work this is a spelunking mission down the deepest darkest cave with no light and um you know instead of a a pickaxe i don't know maybe with a plastic fork and knife let me take a step back lauren before i met your mom i saw a video of your mom which kind of changed things for me this was a video of a movie actually that you can maybe talk about you'd worked on and i had actually watched i don't know if it was a clip online or maybe it was something you sent me and seeing the video of your mom from the i don't know you can tell me eight something years before the present that was so instructive i mean i i don't know how to explain this but like i'm not psychic or anything like that but i trust my gut and when i see people sometimes this is gonna sound weird but i think it's true i i see genes i see i i don't know my gut just feels something and i can i don't know if it's just because i've seen the pattern so many times there's genotype meaning the genes and the phenotype which is the you know the physical real world manifestations of jeans but there was something about your mom her behavior her mannerisms her i don't know her shape of her face i mean i don't want to get too like kooky and weird but like there was something that my gut or my subconscious just saw and your mom was a little confusing to me because i saw something consistent with alzheimer's but there was you know my gut said there's something else this is this is just strange this is not clearly alzheimer's this could be something else and then when i talked to you lauren about and really talked to you know your aunt and your uncle and i learned all the intricate details i just learned that this was this was more complicated than alzheimer's maybe there's alzheimer's on one side but there's alzheimer's plus something else in another and i don't know if i don't know if i've ever told you this story but your uncle brought in his comac high school yearbook i don't know if we ever talked about that yeah and then i don't know and then when i was actually at your place in la you're i think your dad found your mom's coma high school graduation yearbook and this is going to sound even kookier but you can tell in the handwriting your grandparents signed your mom's yearbook and your uncle's yearbook and they were five years apart and i could tell in the handwriting there's like research to support this but you know you could just tell by the the change in the handwriting over the years and just the you know like alzheimer's is a neurological disease there's other neurological conditions like parkinson's disease dementia with lewy bodies and in parkinson's disease when you when you start writing as you write more and more the writing gets smaller and there's like a shaky nature to the writing this is really hard to explain it i don't know something about the handwriting was just different and about the word choice like you know there was a study that looked at nuns and the nuns wrote their autobiographical sketches in like their late teens and then depending on analysis of of their autobiographies that they wrote you could predict which nuns were going to get dementia 60 years later so there's a lot you know i believe alzheimer's is a life course disease yet literally people with the apoe4 variant with one or two copies have smaller brains when they're born so i know we say alzheimer's you know starts 20 to 30 years before in the brain well that may be because of the biomarkers of alzheimer's that we can detect are noticeable then but i believe alzheimer's is a life course disease and sorry for the long story here but i learned a lot about your family from the clues that i got from those videos and the handwriting samples of your grandparents so i guess i would start with that um and then i think i just said earlier but my brother brand completely randomly cared for another one of your family my great uncle your great uncle i mean like just completely strange and bizarre but you know i actually talked to my brother about him and we just start to put the clues together so so first we do the detective work and kind of the investigative part and then we just do a clinical history we ask about all sorts of things from medical history to what other risk factors were apparent we did some genetic testing which was critical so we just try to put together lots of different pieces to the puzzle and do as best as we can with the information we have to personalize or individualize a person's care so richard and lauren i don't know if you and if you don't if you don't have permission to talk about lauren's uncle's case then we don't need to talk about it at all but if we do so i'm curious richard you have this clinical history that is at least for me would be very overwhelming i realized that a lot of people walk into your clinic with stories as tragic and as complicated as this but what are the things you most want to see come back out of that blood work once you have a very detailed clinical history at this point you've probably established that brother and sister are on the same pathway though sister is moving much quicker in lauren's mom versus uncle the apoe genotype comes back what does it show and what does that tell you all i can say is my brain kept asking why why why why why like why did lauren's mom have symptoms at 52 but lauren's uncle five years older started having symptoms in his late 60s or maybe his early 70s why why why why why why was there this 15 something year old what is going on here so the first thing i think about is and this is also because of a genotype phenotype thing i felt or smelled or whatever it was that there was some e4 or something apoe4 something lauren when i saw that video your mom i don't know again this is weird but your mom was e4 i actually thought she was e44 i'll just be frank she was 4-4 yeah i know well i i uh exactly i mean from the video from the video yeah and again this is weird talking about when it's being recorded but like i don't know i've seen a lot of patients so i can just you know i can i don't know something subconscious when your uncle walked in 4-4 but just to be clear richard did you think that lauren's mom was 4-4 because of how early it affected her or because of the fact that she had such a clear history of disease on both sides of the family honestly i guess what i'm saying now is i saw her on video and the phenotype that i saw the the her body makeup her habitus her structure again sounds weird but i i saw 4-4 i felt 4-4 plus of course in my subconscious mind i knew she got it early i knew the parents i knew her parents lauren's grandparents got it later so it just fit and also big big big you heard it here first no this is common knowledge i hope or it should be common knowledge women with the e4 variant much higher risk i mean women with e4 are very different than men with e4 and i think most people just completely are not aware of that and then lauren i forget when this came up but i don't know if i asked you this but i said when did your mom go through menopause and then you told me about the hysterectomy and they took the ovaries out and i said oh my goodness my goodness i said wow e44 even though i don't think we had the genetics at the time or maybe we did plus the you know surgical menopause taking out you know immediate withdrawal of estrogen and taking out the ovaries back then we had no idea relationship to alzheimer's or anything else plus she's a woman and there's a synergistic you know impact on risk so it kind of was the perfect storm but but still a 4-4 plus a woman plus plus a hysterectomy there had to have been something else and then we went on a spelunking mission to find something else lauren how old was your mom when she had a hysterectomy was she in her 40s late 40s i want to say she was 46 maybe 47 but i'm pretty sure it's 46. all right you've alluded to this just in passing a moment ago i want you to expand on it a little bit you basically created a little bit of a contrast between your uncle and your mom in terms of lifestyle your uncle being exercising constantly tell us a little bit about your mom obviously you've spoken about her intellectually and you mentioned she didn't consume much alcohol what other lifestyle factors do you know about her did she sleep well was she under a lot of stress what was her diet like how much did she exercise did she smoke any other things that you you can tell us i mean she never she never smoked she told me once she tried to smoke a cigarette in high school and threw up and never did again so that's why i never smoked a cigarette but um she did not exercise we were a big sugar house who had dessert every night she probably had cookies most nights after dinner she used her brain every single day but was she constantly learning new things a little she taught first grade for 15 years and so you know sure could she have been learning things yes but was she recycling information that she had already learned potentially but i think you know knowing what i know now she got almost no cardio exercise and she ate a lot of sugar and combining those things with you know her family history of course and then of course the hormonal issues that arose from her hysterectomy you know seemed to really put her on the path that she eventually went down do you know if she had any difficulty sleeping prior to the hysterectomy i can only imagine afterwards it was devastating but yeah i mean it's funny she and my uncle and my grandfather were similar sleepers i would say and that they would fall asleep on the couch every night and then wake up super early that's as much information that i got from her but like me of course less as i get older but like i'm the kind of person who loves to sleep and is very happy to sleep whereas like she wasn't a big sleeper she definitely she definitely did herself no favors with her sleep habits especially again knowing what we know now she did not use her sleep to help her brain at all i just want to comment one thing so and i talked to your dad about this at some point your mom was not you know when you saw when you looked at your mom when she was you know in the 80s and 90s your mom was not unhealthy by any means she didn't no no i don't want to paint the picture of her as being this like disgustingly you know unhealthy person who didn't care about herself it wasn't that it just she didn't make the effort that is needed that we know now to you know as richard said to take control of the genes that she had been given in prevention in the prevention space in preventative medicine or preventative health at least the way i think about it is there's normal and then there's optimal you know your mom for the time that was kind of the typical you know what i would call your mom now is you know maybe maybe you know they've heard of the term skinny fat right um skinny on the outside fat on the inside you know and you may i don't know what your mom's waist circumference was in high school versus her waist circumference in her you know 40s and 50s yeah i can guarantee you is larger based on you know my understanding of the pathology of this disease and but back then that wasn't really talked about or thought about you know you know in the 80s it was like you know that was like when 10 000 steps came about you know like who came up with 10 000 well sorry i know who came up with it but i understand that there's some better than nothing and calculating but ten thousand steps is like so antiquated it's like it's like you know literally the eighties compared to now we truly understand physical fitness and how to optimize physical performance your mom was not unlike most middle-aged women at the time you know and the difference between her and my uncle or even you know me and my brother is like my mom was never an athlete like i was a gymnast growing up my brother was a baseball player my uncle ran track and then he got into cycling and was always a physically active person whereas my mom was an intellectually active person she read she you know like i said she was a great student she loved to learn and then to teach but she didn't use her body in a way that perhaps could have at least delayed what you know her genes were leading her toward when someone meets me at a cocktail party or i think you asked me that question peter what are the three things that you tell someone when they yesterday wasn't your podcast that was yeah and i i refused to answer it i was like out walking the dogs the other day and someone someone asked me the same question i'm like well but but the number one thing by far is exercise and physical activity but it's not just like you know going for a walk it's there's physical activity and then there's physical exercise and the difference is key cardiovascular and strength training there's just so many degrees high intensity interval training specifically for this case you know high intensity interval training is probably the only thing that can move the needle in terms of certain aspects of cognitive function and people with the apoe4 variant and like no one knew any of that even a few years ago let alone a decade ago so optimization of physical activity is key and your uncle just so we can paint the picture your uncle was like he was a machine he was a beast yeah he was rip i mean i'm you know he could put pete i don't know him and peter next to each other be close um you know i'm scrawny or whatever compared but he was ripped he just looked great his leg muscles were like oh oh my word my goodness and because of that your metabolism is better all these different things richard was he three four or four four uh he was four four also i see okay so this is very interesting right because until you have that information you could say well maybe the reason everything came to him so much later is he was the 3-4 his sister's the 4-4 and that explains the 15-year gap but to have them both be 4 4 you're basically looking at gender inclusive of the removal of hormones lifestyle factors it's some probably some combination of those things that's explaining it can you explain a little bit the gender issue again most people who follow the research will be very well aware that alzheimer's disease disproportionately affects women the answer that used to be thrown about was well that's because women live longer anybody who understands even first order mathematics will realize that the increase in expected lifespan of women does not fully explain that so there must be something else do you think that it's the loss of hormones that explains the remainder of that gap or do you think it's even something beyond that yeah so i would have answered that question just like you did with the age thing you know even five six seven years ago and then it was one day on some television something where someone kept elbowing me someone named maria our friend maria shriver it's like no no you've got to figure it out go why do women no no no two out of every three brains of of alzheimer's are women's brains and we don't know why isaacson go figure it out and i said yes ma'am i'll go do it i think i understand much better now and in the category of likelihood is during the perimenopause transition there are bioenergetic shifts in the brain that absolutely can predispose a woman to accelerated alzheimer's pathology and we call it the window of opportunity during the perimenopause transition if we can intervene the right way at the right time in the right woman i believe that we can negate a reasonable amount if not much of careful with my words of the negative impact of this precipitous drop of estrogen which i believe is neuroprotective again the right type of estrogen the right whatever the natural estrogen i believe is protective whether we get into hormone replacement that could you know be a different part of the conversation and which types and what this and what that but the bioenergetic shifts during the perimenopause transition you know why do people have perimenopause what are the symptoms that get hot flashes right night sweats you can talk about that oh boy my sweats i don't know what you're talking about no not at all irritability never never so all of these different things it's a brain disease perimenopause is a brain condition it's those are those are manifestations of of the hormone withdrawal in the brain and those are the symptoms that you know brain fog like i used to think i'll just be very frank i was completely dead wrong like women that had perimenopause and they had this brain fog thing uh maybe they're just not sleeping right maybe well no they're not sleeping right and their their sleep is interrupted because of this bioenergetic shift and heck yeah you're going to have brain fog and now we know what it looks like i hate that term brain fog it's so non-specific you know it's problems with processing speed and attention and that's how i think of it but perimenopause is a brain disease so i think that's that's really important and this bioenergetic shift is like it's like if you want to fast forward brain aging like in a woman in it sorry in a susceptible woman because not all women are created equal an e4 for a woman a surgical menopause meaning taking out the ovaries with the with the with the uterus wow that's that could do it now i don't want to say this in all cases it again depends on the individual person but perimenopause transition is a huge unrealized risk factor for progression to dementia in an alzheimer's susceptible woman and just be careful and listen to those words because just because you're going through perimenopause does not mean you're going to get alzheimer's but in susceptible people it is and and i really believe that from a precision medicine perspective we can intervene with specific hormones in specific ways is it a patch is it a gel is it a you know all these different things do you need estrogen what type of estrogen from horses from you know from from natural from what about progesterone when do we add it and these are things that i talk i talk to an ob gyn every other week now i'm a neurologist what the heck so so i could talk about this for a long time but just just know that the the this hormone thing is real that's where you think the bulk of it is then richard is it's less about the age gap or the age advantage like you know the sort of lifespan advantage women have and you think it's the elephant in the room is this enormous hormonal shift i think that's the most under recognized slash largest impact in a lot of women but i have to take a step back and age is the number one risk factor for alzheimer's women plus age so a 65 year old woman with the apoe4 with at least one or two apoe4 variants that's like the perfect storm plus you add in this you know the perimenopause transition but you know there's individual things when it comes to a woman's life so for example there's more widows than widowers and widowhood is a astronomically important risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia also women specifically with abdominal obesity let's talk let's or sorry enlarged waist circumference visceral fat is as the belly size gets larger the memory center of the brain gets smaller and we now know that in women specifically women have a 39 increased risk of dementia when they have you know enlarged waist circumferences over a certain degree and and they're impacted more so than men when i think of a woman and i think of body composition i'm really paying attention to body fat and i'm not just paying attention like weight i don't care about for women i care about what's percent body fat and where is the fat is it visceral or is it otherwise cellulite on the thighs i don't care oh thank god belly fat yeah thank you thank you great you don't have cellulite in your thighs you're on the atiya isaacson program thank goodness this is a podcast you be you beat me in in the spin clay you were you were a haas in there i did that was impressive i was dying so where the fat is is key like in men i really believe and i think evidence is coming around to support this but muscle mass in men is more important as opposed to body fat especially visceral fat and women as a specific individual sex specific risk factor to results so i was going to ask you about that richard do you think that part of the sex difference is that men have more lean mass than women so it's that they have greater capacity for glucose disposal and that that could be an independent predictor beyond the loss of hormones i don't know i think we need to tease this out you know we're honestly doing one of the if not the only one of the very few studies where we're looking at you know pretty comprehensive brain imaging on on women and men between the ages of 40 to 65. um lauren you don't qualify yet because you're still a baby thank you but one day you'll jump in we're going to be able to answer this question i hope in the next five to seven to ten years or sooner but i don't know the answer to that question so lauren you finally decide you also now want to be a part of this prevention program you're watching your uncle hopefully have his disease course slowed you're watching your mom in the final stages of her life what is the hardest thing for you to hear from richard once you get through that initial diagnostic workup and battery of tests what are what are the things you're now starting to confront about yourself what do you learn first of all oh god where do i begin i mean i i learned a lot well i mean first but i learned my apoe status which is that i'm a three-four okay so that means you got a four from mom and obviously a three from dad right and you know i felt okay i didn't throw you know it's funny my my brother had done 23 and me a couple years before before we knew richard before anything and he got it back and it was like you know and this is early on in 23 me so i don't even know if it said apoe4 it said like alzheimer's risk yes and he freaked out but then by a few years later i think it was like you know and it even could have been the information that came with that along with richard which is this is not the genes that he'd been talking about before which are you're going to get alzheimer's this is even a 4-4 this is a 3-4 and there are things that we can do to modify my risk and so i again as i touched on as someone who's like if i'm going to do it i want to do it and dive in on it so i don't get me wrong i wasn't like yes i have a three-fourths let's celebrate but like i felt you know okay i have this information science is telling me there's something i can do why don't i do it but it was easier in the beginning i kind of have i've been a patient of the clinic for you five years five at least four or five years yeah at least you know when i kind of like half started i was like you know a little better at my diet a little less sugar and you know and i were i exercised but not not what i needed to be doing and then certainly then and in the year leading up to when i met you peter was you know i was directing a movie that year and that is certainly not the time where you have all the space in your life to take control of your health so that it certainly i fell off the wagon during like sitting on my ass in an editing room for eight or nine hours a day was i didn't exercise before that you know what i mean it felt like power in a way and it took me a while to figure out how to harness that power and what lifestyle changes i needed to adopt and to change and certainly took both of you at different points in my journey to uh help me and guide me and i'm lucky for that but to me it felt exciting you know people often are like aren't you scared how do why would you want to know blah blah and i'm just like why don't you want to know science gives us tools i don't want to live in the dark and not use the few tools that i've been given at this point that seems way worse to me so i felt very lucky that i was you know getting to access your smart brains and of course other people that i've met and and take some control over my genes it is an interesting point you raise lauren because and i may have even told this story on a podcast before but i remember maybe 2014 or so i had a husband and wife that were both in the practice and simultaneously coming in and did blood tests on both of them and we always do screen for apoe on the way in and each of them came back three four three four they have three children so one i'm explaining to them what the e4 e4 means for them and i'm also saying look you know your kids are young now but at some point it's going to make sense probably in their 20s to do a screen on them because there's a 25 chance that each of them will be a 4-4 a 50 chance that they'll be three four and a twenty five percent chance they'll be three threes and uh i think because their kids were girls i wasn't so worried about head trauma if their kids were boys i probably would have said i would even test sooner to really revis you know if they if if they're thinking about playing football i would probably reconsider that in the case of an e4 richard i'd like to hear your thoughts on that by the way anyway the point of the story is i got a real heated call from their pcp a couple of weeks later saying how dare you test them for this gene i mean what are you trying to do we can't do anything about this so what on earth what good comes of scaring them with the fact that they have an e4 gene and obviously that led to a discussion i actually think that person has since then changed changed their tune a little bit on that front in large part thanks to the work that richard's done but um richard just a quick digression there is there what's the evidence on people with an e4 gene being better off without head trauma not that anybody does well with morehead trauma but are e4 is more susceptible to head trauma well just to take one step back i mean peter you you did the right thing i mean this this is when the conversations need to start i mean for example eating fatty fish people with apoe4s just don't absorb for just as one example i can just soap so many things but eating fatty fish from early in life again i'm not a pediatrician so i'm not recommending little kids and 12 and i don't know i don't even know what or when to start but omega-3 fatty acids and e4 brain should be started as early as possible and at reasonable doses to really protect the brain head trauma is something that's a little confusing my opinion on this has shifted a little bit you know my nephew bobby my sister asked me about this um you know should he be playing football and you know of course i have some adjective in my stomach but you know i uh you know if you have the four genes sure you may be at a higher risk and head trauma may certainly intermingle again epigenetic risk head trauma plus e4 potentially can increase risk these are really difficult conversations to have but knowledge is power lauren you felt empowered you know are patients like okay i'm ready let's do it if i at least i tried you know i mean it's better to try than not when it comes to e4 i don't know when the best age is to learn i guess that's a that's a that's a tricky question but you know the reveal study showed that people that find out their apoe4 status in the initial six months maybe there's a little bit more anxiety initially but but but at the end there's no negative psychiatric psychological outcomes and you know the the studies that we've published you know i wrote our first paper on this in 2011 so like a decade ago and like just the fact that you could use genetics to personalize alzheimer's care that paper fell on its face i don't even think it's been cited like it's one of those papers you know it just kind of sat i mean now we write papers that like specifically the entire paper is about if you're e4 versus not e4 do this versus that and and i don't know one day i hope it's soon we're going to know all these genes and and people when they get their preventative health screenings we're gonna it's not just e4 we're gonna get a whole bunch of genes and primary care doctors i hope one day soon five years ten years who knows are going to basically do these genetic screens on multiple genes and give people targeted personalized plans for disease risk reduction as early as possible so anyway i support you doing e4 i would say though that most doctors are not aware of this so it's not exactly the doctor's fault but understanding genetic type to personalized care is the future of medicine what other genes are there we've talked about obviously the three that are of greatest concern but fortunately the the three that virtually nobody's ever gonna have to hear about her deal with the psen12 and app apoe4 sucks all the air out of the room there are a couple of other genes richard in this space that we're just starting to become aware of can you speak to a couple of those and did any of those figure into the detective work you did in lauren's family i learned a lot about lauren's family and it was in part because my brother was in part because of actually you and your brother lauren and i just met so many different people i mean i really got to know your family tree pretty well between videos and talking and all this sort of thing and your family is one of the first i would say first 12 to 15 families that we ever really you know did some super deep dives on i mean i looked at all sorts of different things um in your family and i guess what i would say is huh do i really want to call out one gene or another or even just generally like even independent of of lauren's family richard when we think about some of these other genes that are now kind of starting to become of interest to us tom 40 tnf what can you say about these and how they impact our understanding of this disease i hesitate to call out any one specific gene because this is a complicated topic but you know there are around 30 or so alzheimer's risk genes that have been found that i think are very important but aside from just those wrist genes and you know you could say clu and piclam or whatever you call it in bin one and you know i could just name a whole bunch and tom40 is really important because not all apoe4s are created equal i believe um this is confusing um and it's even been confusing for me but the tom 40 that's next the e4 is really can influence in my opinion i believe i'm not certain but i believe that the different tom40 chain length or whatever it is one e4 can behave one way and another e4 can have a lower or high or higher risk depending on the gene next to it so there's there's a lot of confusion here with this polygenic risk thing but tom 40 is important but you know when we take a step back and i look at alzheimer's as a medical condition it's a medical condition that causes neurologic manifestations i think alzheimer's is a medical disease i love being a neurologist it's fun the brain is interesting i possibly could have should have been an internal medicine specialist i am really intrigued by all the lower organs as the neurologist would say below the neck no no no disrespect to the lungs in the liver and everything else but no it's a medical condition and whether you're on the lipid path or the inflammation path or the potentially infectious path or the head trauma there's so many different things that can trigger brain related pathology so i'm very interested in the vascular genes vascular like fto and and other cholesterol ldl and pcsk9 related genes like i i'm interested in those things because that that can have an increase in or decrease depending on polygenic risk longevity genes what about like foxo and clotho like there's got to be there's i know that there are genes that kind of protect you against the alzheimer's risk of the other genes so i really look at the metabolism genes i look at the vascular risk genes in lauren specifically lauren was one of the first people that we found another gene that kind of co-interacts with apoe to even be even more interesting because maybe this gene related to tnf tnf-alpha which we can talk about when someone has that tnf alpha gene and also has an apoe4 gene well they're also at higher risk than someone with e4 without the tnf so so again we're trying to put the pieces of the puzzle together of why the heck did your mom get this and we can pin it on exercise and we can pin it on one thing but but it's not just one thing it's not like your mom didn't get alzheimer's because she didn't exercise your mom would have gotten alzheimer's anyway if she would have exercised rigorously which no one knew back then sure would she have delayed it i i firmly believe so but your mom was different than your uncle in other ways too because you know your uncle did not have that tnf-alpha related gene and now because we found this gene i mean this is like imprecise science this is like i would call it better than back of a napkin but not perfect science we're doing things with you lauren now that are trying to get ahead of the curve and trying to make that tnf alpha gene have a less of a negative impact on your trajectory so between peter and i we've really kind of hit you with certain things that can potentially help that so i guess what i would say is polygenic risk is probably the answer and i think there's something else you've said that the other analogy is not all e4s are created equal i don't think that can be overstated enough and the the analogy for in the cardiovascular world is lp little a i've seen so many patients with elevated lp little a's and in some of them it absolutely tears through the family with premature heart disease that you can spot a mile away so just in the same way you look at lauren's family history and a mile away you say it's april e4 you'll look at people having heart attacks in their 40s and dying in their 50s from heart disease and you say that's that's lp little a until proven otherwise and then there's other patients that show up with elevated lp little a very even very elevated lp little a normal apparently normal risk of cardiovascular disease so even though this is technically not the correct term it's almost like there's variable penetration of the gene as well so let's go back to kind of the what can you do lauren so let's go back in time it's now a couple of years ago you finished you're off the uh the the editing floor you're off the cruise ship weren't you living on a cruise ship for a while i mean too long too many days yes it's been about two three years that you really switch this into overdrive yeah i mean you've you've really become the poster child for i'm going to do every single thing in my power every day to reduce the risk of this beast i guess i just get the sense from you like you don't seem to to push back on this like you've i guess it's in part because it's come from within you and not it's not been thrust upon you is that do you think that's the reason that it's been so easy i i want to use the word easy because i don't think it's easy but yeah i think when you see what i have seen over the last 15 years you know why wouldn't i do anything i possibly can to avoid what i saw over the last 15 years i want to do everything i possibly can to not go through that myself to not put that on my husband or my family and i feel like i've been given an opportunity to at least try so why wouldn't i well it is really amazing to watch how seth basically acts the same way right it's sort of like he's sort of in it with you right it's kind of like well okay you're both on the complete risk reduction pathway well i mean only since this pandemic have i really gotten him into exercise in a way and he's still not where i am and of course obviously all of us i'm not you know exercising the way i was before all of this but yeah we eat and we you know we eat every meal together so we eat the same things and he has certainly changed his eating habits which has been wonderful and he supports me and yeah he goes along with it we don't have the same genes but like why wouldn't he also care about his brain he still got one you know as as richard said just because he doesn't have a four doesn't mean he's not at some risk and so i'm very lucky that i have someone who is supporting me most of the time that doesn't mean he's not always like orders too much at dinner or orders extra things and i'm like i have to have a bite of that or you know but exercise is always very supportive of but it also speaks to i think the difference between having a spouse or a family member that can kind of go through the journey with you whether it's cancer alzheimer's disease heart disease whatever it is that a person is really trying to make these lifestyle changes to to work against and and so we've spoken a lot about exercise certainly on other podcasts we've spoken a lot about nutrition how does one improve glycemic control how does one ensure maximum insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal richard can we talk about some of the other tools in the toolkit that we have with with lauren and and frankly a number of the other patients that we take care of that are high risk in some way i mean in our practice richard as you know we define patients as high risk meaning you come into their care basically if their family history is notable they have at least one copy of the four gene or they're over 60. you check one of those boxes richard is a part of your care and then we kind of have a protocol that obviously you're the poster child for lauren what are some of the other things that we're doing on that protocol richard sure so to give you an evidence-based answer let's let's start with that first and then we'll go to a you know a case study of lauren so within the last year we published the results of our of our clinical trial that lauren thank you you're a part of you thank you for participating you forced your arm upon me but we said okay after you consign the consent but and i think you you guys win the prize for the most family members and i think you guys may be tied for the most family members in the study but we have a study that we published in the journal alzheimer's and dementia the journal of the alzheimer's association and peter thank you you a co-author on that study you really fundamentally helped me understand and developed the approach towards maximizing human performance from both not just physical activity but nutrition and just you got me to understand quick shout out for peter i give you all these shout outs lauren because you're the best but peter quick shout out you got me to understand the difference between life span longevity health span which is kind of quality and brain span and uh really that's what that's what we mostly focus on but there's a lot of overlap but what we did is we did a study because we had to prove whether or not this individualization of care could work and in this study we found that on average people got 21 different interventions you know again that's average um lauren how many things do we tell you to do probably around there i've i can count i have i have your list definitely around there i mean i'm on a lot of supplements and then of course there's the the lifestyle stuff the sleep and the food and all the stuff i'm just loading up one of your things from december 2019. so a major important part of this is also regular follow-up so every six months we repeat body composition measures which is we use the term abcs of alzheimer's prevention management so the a is for anthropometrics or body composition body fat muscle mass stuff like that the b is the blood-based biomarkers we look at your cholesterol markers we look at your inflammation your metabolism your nutrition genetics are in there too and then c is cognitive function so we assess and track all of these things and at each every six months depending on what the repeat is depending on what your memory function is and what your cholesterol is and all this we will keep refining or fine-tuning so we can you know this is really an iterative process so basically we we keep tracking and then in your case because of your apoe4 and because of your and i have permission to talk about this i guess okay great because of your apoe4 um we really honed in on exercise and also more high-intensity interval training really really focusing on that in terms of nutrition we and we checked your omega-3 levels in your blood red blood cell dha levels and epa and whatnot we had you eat fish but also omega-3 fatty acids via capsules a very specific type and brand that we often recommend i have nothing to disclose i wish i did i could pay my student loans but nothing to disclose from any supplement or vitamin companies but omega-3 fatty acids are key pretty reasonable dose omega-3s dha and epa um based on studies that thankfully this was proven this past year but we've had you on this for the last several years that people with the 804 gene require higher doses of omega-3s so even eating fish just wasn't enough so we also have you on roughly 2 000 milligrams or so of dha and something or other of epa we also put you on a very purified form of cocoa flavonols that have been studied in multiple randomized trials we gave you a very specific type of curcumin a type of more nanoparticle version again nothing to disclose but that may have anti-tnf alpha effects may help with inflammation so we put you on a reasonable dose of that we put you on specific types of b complex vitamins this was to address your homocysteine homocysteine is an is an amino acid in the blood that is an independent risk factor so if you have high homocysteine you are more likely to have brain shrinkage over time and impaired memory function but only in people with high homocysteine we can give b complex vitamins b12 b6 in tiny amounts and then folic acid if we can control that and the person has sufficient levels of omega-3s then you can slow brain shrinkage brain atrophy and improve memory so we've modified that risk factor homocysteine we optimized your vitamin d i think your vitamin d wasn't i'm terrible but it was you know lower than it could be i think 60 percent of people for example in florida are vitamin d deficient that makes the first time the first time i saw you my vitamin d was not good i can remember that and i'm 19. definitely not good and i remember being like i gotta sit outside more and not wear as much sunscreen because i'm obviously i'm the palest human ever and so i wear a lot of sunscreen but like we've helped that is there a level richard that you try to do do you want to see vitamin d within a certain range yeah great question so in a study in neurology it was little john and and other other studies i can name several cedric ann weiler also has some great great work on this but the best that i can do in across the board and in a general answer is you know 30 is kind of normal but what is optimal i'm thinking closer to 40 to 50 maybe more likely 50. in someone that has two apoe4 variants so an apoe44 based on a study in the european journal of nutrition a couple years back e44 is probably preferentially protected or or or e4s better have good vitamin d levels i'll put it that way at 50 or more maybe it's 50 to 70 i don't think we know the exact answers but a level of 17 to 19 when lauren first came in to see me was was definitely not sufficient aside from taking vitamin d we recommend how to take it it's a fat soluble vitamin so take it with a meal with a little bit of fat in it that's key otherwise it doesn't help with absorption i'm getting some sun from from my perspective you know 10 to 15 minutes between the hours of 11 to 1 when the sun is when the uv or whatever it is is strongest there's lots of devil in the details here but um you know lauren we've been able to completely modify that risk factor so that's that's been pretty good and going back to the epa dha issue do you give whatever amount is needed to reach a certain level in the red blood cell membrane or do you just say look we know that e4s are going to have a harder time assimilating we're just going to give a higher dose again our patients we use this stuff like very liberally i think lauren is on at least 2 grams combined epa dha so did you just leave it at the dose or do you like to rely on the omega quant type assay i don't know that i have the perfect answer for this but i titrate it up based on the person's red blood cell level i try to get an index of at least 12 to 14 and higher is probably better i think orange is like 14 plus which is awesome i also look at the cholesterol so apob um and peter and i i hate disagreeing with peter on anything but i still like ldlp but i know i've been a convert to apob if someone has high apob and ldl cholesterol i really believe that we can even be more liberal and people people need it even more but you know the study by hussein yasin that was just published recently just showed that you really need to get at least to 2 grams of dha alone to even get enough they did a spinal fluid study thankfully these people volunteered to get spinal taps and i mean lauren we're really hitting you with this stuff and i'm really glad because you know the cumulative effect of the apo e plus dha and epa over time there's a cumulative effect and we we really started right with you so we we hedged our bets a little because it was safe and then it was proven you know five years later so that was cool but i don't know that i have a great answer i also look at omega 6 to 3 ratio and i know peter i know you and i are may not look at the same that way i also look at trans fats in in the blood and i know that that's maybe an imperfect assay or science but trans fats are no bueno when it comes to on alzheimer's risk so i don't know i think there's a lot of important aspects to omega-3s and fat assays but i don't know that i know the perfect answer on how to how to do it you spoke briefly about thera cumin we tend to reserve theracumin for those higher risk patients versus curcumin for most people what's our belief for why theracumin there's been some reasonable data suggesting that despite the enormous increase in cost when you switch to theracumin it's worth the cost this is based on an important study from small gary small at ucla and they showed that you know when people randomized to this you know it sounds kitschy but like nanoparticles ooh that sounds cool nanoparticles can get through the blood-brain barrier well that sounds like in some ways marketing but then they did a study and like they had less you know amyloid accumulation so like okay sign me up like it's safe yes it has a cost to it but it's not astronomically expensive you know i don't know what the exact effect is but the effect size was large enough even though it was a small study to you know when we talk about evidence-based and safe i think there's enough evidence it's not perfect but it's safe and it's not super super super costly so and especially with tnf should lauren be on both curcumin longa plus thera like who knows like i have no idea because of the tnf but she's doing so much exercise that maybe we don't need to do it but i'm babbling but basically i don't know the answer uh i just think it's it's a reasonable option even though it's not perfect okay well another supplement that i'm a huge fan of is magnesium l three and eight what are your thoughts on that and and i'll explain to folks what it is l three and eight is a transporter that gets magnesium into the brain much more easily so normally if you take magnesium it's not you know going to get too much in the brain there is actually some interesting clinical data in humans suggesting that magnesium l3 and 8 in patients with mci improve symptoms so again one has to take a leap of faith to say well if you give it to people prior to mci it would even delay progression from phase one to phase two and potentially from phase two to phase three so what are your thoughts on that richard yeah so i actually learned a little bit about this from you i've been a magnesium glycinate kind of guy for a while because just kind of from the headache community as a neurologist it's very well tolerated and and that kind of thing but i think the date on three is compelling i think it may also help with sleep if i'm not mistaken and i've had some success with that and some pretty shall we say stressed out type a people so it's not at the very top of my list but it's somewhere in the middle-ish you know middle to it's not super low but it's it's it's again evidence-based enough and completely safe so when it comes to alzheimer's prevention we don't want to give anything to anyone that has any degree of you know risk because what if they're not going to get alzheimer's anyway then we've done our patients harm and we take the oath do no harm so i'm pro meg three and eight but i don't have as much evidence that's lower on the evidence list how do you think about you've already kind of alluded to this but i want to make sure we round it out around what we would call e4 specific maneuvers right so let's assume you have two theoretical patients in front of you that you believe are both at higher risk than you'd like one of them is an e4 patient another one is not given what we know about e4 how does that change your thinking you've already made several points in reference to this one of them for example is boy there's no ambiguity around the benefits of exercise in e4 people people with e4 tend to require higher doses of epa and dha they tend to benefit disproportionately from vitamin d are there any other things that are unique to patients with e4 yeah so we wrote a paper on this that's open access it's in the journal of prevention of alzheimer's disease um it's called clinical application of apoe and alzheimer's prevention a precision medicine approach kara berkowitz is the first author she's awesome she was a med student at cornell peter we lost her to surgery i don't know what i don't know how that happened you surgeons but she wrote this terrific paper and did several other papers with us too so i mentioned this paper first because this is a complicated topic let's just start by saying physical exercise is i believe likely preferentially effective in people with the e4 variant or more brain imaging studies show that e4 carriers exacerbates the effect of having a sedentary lifestyle in alzheimer's pathology so someone with e4 really really really better exercise and it's like no joke it's got to be really important and and the intensity of the exercise is key tobacco use just worse in e4s like i'm not telling you that non-carrier can smoke but i think it's i think it's worse alcohol use alcohol is really confusing and the data on alcohol kind of darts all over the place but a few drinks a week is kind of where i'm at now you know men and women may be a little bit different this is really confusing but there's probably an e4 impact but what i would say that while light to moderate alcohol consumption i mean more on the light side like four to seven drinks may be beneficial for non-carriers of before decreasing alcohol intake or even abstaining maybe even more so helpful for carriers but this is this is tricky and i don't really know the answer to that cognitive engagement if you don't use it you lose it staying cognitively engaged is like critical there's some difference with e4s and cognitive engagement strategies but i think the jury's out a little bit the dietary stuff is you know just specific dietary types is key omega-3 fatty acids we talked about are probably preferentially effective but you need to be at higher dose you know there's a randomized trial go underway now to try to understand you know the impact of high saturated fats and high glycemic index diet on cognitive function for e4 carriers but that's not published yet i guess i want to be cautious in saying this but i think people with e4s are probably you have to be more cautious and careful in terms of high saturated fat you know mcts i'm i'm pro mcts if they're the right mct's and and this is a topic for another discussion and on pro mcts if it's not specifically more so likely in people without the e4 variant there's more window or more leeway to be able to use them but mct is is a really tricky topic but i personalize mct use based on this but this is a whole thing so i i don't know how much down the rabbit hole to go i have another question about this is one we've all spoken about and yet i'm still very much unclear and i'm curious as to where your thinking is evolving which is thc in any form be it edible be it inhaled i mean what do we know and acknowledging that it's probably complicated right because there are probably benefits that come in terms of stress reduction certainly if if it facilitates sleep but what do we know on that front then are we ever going to get good answers because the epidemiology is obviously heavily negatively biased based on the cohort that's studied this is a hard one i'm not negative on thc specifically i think there's something with the cbd and thc connection i think it depends on the amount of cbd versus thc um you know if i had to choose you know if someone's going to use thc or cbd edible to me makes more sense because of you know less smoking is better but i don't know that's just what i believe but i'm not i don't think that's grounded in perfect science but i guess i would say i don't know i for every one study you read where it helps alzheimer's pathology you can read another study where it you know it causes greater pathology so i'm not anti cbd thc i'm not pro i'm kind of i'm kind of in the middle i think it's an individualized decision and i think if someone's going to use cbd or thc because for example hey when i take it my sleep is better i feel better okay but that's subjective i want to know objectively you know let me see your fitness tracker let me see your ring let me see your whatever you do to track things and these these all these gadgets may or may not work great in different people but i think one has to really the term here would be an n of one study where you make one specific change and then you compare what happens to that person over the three months say or six months of only taking that one thing and does cognitive function improve or does what does sleep metrics improve i think the thc cbd story is a precision medicine answer well speaking of cognitive testing lauren how many times now have you been through the battery of cognitive tests that richard puts people through i don't know was that a cognitive test to see if i even know that number maybe but six seven times i don't know if you know that right off the information in front of you but something like that enough that i'm starting to learn the tests is it intimidating when you sit down and do it because i've had some patients that don't want to do it well okay because i had a bad time i visited richard the day that like father came out which was because of a number of reasons perhaps the most stressful day an emotion one of the most emotional days i'd had in a while and it was not good and my brain was a million different places and and of course my body was not in the best of shape leading up to that and it was bad news and richard was so unhappy and so mad at me but it was a good you know kick in the behind to get myself back on track because i had been making progress then i lost that progress so of course the test that i think now i've come in twice since then twice yeah i psyched myself up a bit and i'm like i'm nervous and like you know get get all into it but fortunately i've done well but is that true richard i mean do we really think like i guess do we know that that the cognitive test reflected her change in effort around the preventative measures or is it confounded by the fact that she was having a very very stressful distracted day even though both of those are true is the test really able to distinguish those things and i mean my blood work wasn't great that day either but i'll let richard answer yeah you know it's it's really interesting and i have the whole trajectory here i mean this is worth its weight in gold like all these all this decess now let me take a step back and talk about cognitive assessments now when we do a cognitive battery related to alzheimer's prevention we use something it's a modified form of the alzheimer's prevention cognitive composite these are mostly computer-based tests nih toolbox as well as other kind of traditional tests that people with mild cognitive complaints kind of come in and take but we use a battery that is sensitive to detect changes in brain function before symptoms and different cognitive domains or different cognitive areas are related to alzheimer's disease pathology as well as other things like vascular pathology vascular cognitive decline or age-related cognitive decline so i am not going to pretend that our cognitive assessment battery is anywhere close to perfect it is as good as cognitive testing can be because people can have good days and bad days but it's funny to learn like you i remember you that day that was a that was a whole day didn't we do a video shoot that day with well that was the day you you filmed seth and i went for other blood work and then i just was in such a state i couldn't even stay oh my what a that's right that's right i remember that day my in-laws were with us yeah uh that was a lot yeah that was a whole that was a whole day so i guess what i would say is there are certain when someone doesn't sleep well then the thing that i would expect to have a bad effect on cognitive testing that day would be related to processing speed and attention when someone has let's just say early alzheimer's before symptoms i'm more paying attention to certain types of memory tasks certain types of naming tasks when someone has vascular risk factors i'm i'm more concerned with how are they doing in executive function measures so when i see homocysteine and vitamin d and in the cholesterol i i correlate that or i i associate that in my brain with different cognitive domains so this is hard to explain but like lauren you felt like you did bad that day because maybe emotionally you were whatever but looking back on it if you take that into consideration it made sense that you were having a stressful day however in the next couple of years when you i think i may have scared you because i i got ups i mean i was concerned i think you saw the concern i think i think we all did yeah i mean my in-laws were there they were concerned yeah i mean i didn't know i was going to call your brother like what do i do like i was you know i don't want to involve other people with hipaa and all that kind of stuff but i was like how do i address this and i just said i'm sorry you're having a crappy day but here's the deal like this is this is what's going on and i'll be frank i was getting worried things weren't going in the right direction you were doing good and then bad and then good and then bad and then your cruise ship situation and then the stress and i said lauren i'm sorry it's got to change now. and i think maybe that's when we got peter involved or maybe a little before that we hadn't sat down with peter we'd been talking about peter yeah that's right so all i can say is in the in the two plus years whatever since that time peter i know you've you've been cautious about cognitive tests because of the variability the imprecise nature and i agree with that but you can't fake lauren your last set of cognitive tests you can't fake this you have optimized your cognitive function in my opinion period like no discussion you said there's an element of practice effects now i i totally agree with that there are certain things because i have a because i have a four that doesn't help me wow look at you little insights that's higher order processing there you go wow dr miller rogan you're learning good job correct epoe4s are more resistant to practice effects and also men's brains and women's brains have different strengths and weaknesses for example verbal memory so when we really digest your trajectory of cognitive function over the last several years i'm going to be honest i don't know that i've really talked about this too much in public or on a recording but your brain is functioning and again you can take all the practice effects you want there are certain tests here that i believe are resistant enough and it's not like you're taking these every day you're taking these like every you know six to twelve months and we change it up we change the versions and stuff like that so you have a plateau at some point with the practice effects but your brain is absolutely without a doubt hands down i have visual proof your brain and biomarkers your blood-based biomarkers you're optimized you're different your brain is firing on more cylinders like you can even just let's just say we'll average out the first three sessions right i mean there's just no compe you're more than a standard deviation above normal like you've improved like you're processing speech my brain is above normal i know yeah uh well no i mean it's interesting because i really want to see if you feel anything but just can you tell the difference but the most important test that we do for age-related cognitive decline you're you're several years older and i know you're um 30 something to 30 something big deal well no the brain ages in that time frame your brain is younger now than it was five years ago like you're greater than 90th percentile on all these different tests your you know your memory function is a standard deviation above the mean and when you started out it like was 0.87 standard deviations below the mean yeah i mean i remember this lauren because i our very first meeting was at cornell and we were going over your results and i remember we were kind of looking for an explanation for how it could have been so poor and the best explanation that you came up with which frankly i thought was a viable one was you said look i did well in school but i did poorly on standardized tests and is it possible that my cognitive score is low because i'm not a good standardized test taker so it's been very exciting to watch this progression one element of the standardized test i want to ask you about richard is odor you put another one of our patients through this test recently and i was very surprised to learn so he came back is it ten nine nine item test nine and in this case the patient correctly identified eight and i remember thinking oh that's awesome and you were like if it had been seven i would have been really concerned and with eight it was we're going to do a retest why is odor identification so important in this disease yeah i mean there's so much subjectivity to cognitive assessments you could be sleep deprived you could be like you know distracted by i don't know you forgot to silence your cell phone you could i don't know it's warm in the room or cold in the room and lauren's always freezing so you know we got to get the temperature just right for lauren lauren's coming you know regulate the temperature you don't do that no i'm kidding and then seth's coming oh change the temperature change the thermostat now as we get older we change now he's the cold one and i'm the hot one wow i know i've been huddling during this because the air is low but no it's that's honestly it's the funniest thing the older he gets the colder he is and the hotter i am and of course it used to be different anyway fascinating um so odor is more objective rather than subjective and odor identification like what is that well it's your ability to recognize a smell and name one of this and again in med school decreased odor identification the first thing i thought of was parkinson's disease that's something that's that's common in pre-clinical parkinson's so before someone gets the tremor and the slow movements and the shuffling gait meaning the walking is slow and and and the rigidity odor identification loss of smell is something that can you know be a harbinger of badness for a neurodegenerative disease to come well the studies have shown that loss of smell or lack of the ability to precisely identify certain smells can be a harbinger of alzheimer's disease as well my mom had a very poor sense of smell and and not an amazing sense of taste either but sense of smell was she never had a good sense of smell that's impactful with kovid i mean it's a different thing like you know and peter you know i talked about this but i lost my smell for five six weeks which is a little bit longer than some people and we can talk about has your smell returned back to normal so i'm seven months out now and you know just for folks know what we're talking about you you had a pretty good case of covid i did yeah i had one of these cases where oh i'm fine three four five days later i'm like you know okay cool i'll exercise tomorrow and then on day nine ten i went with my o2 sat dropping and all that stuff and i'm peter help and paul help and what the heck i called every doctor in my rolodex um did an ekg on myself in my office at midnight because i wanted to stay the heck out of the er my o2sat was 94 ptsd time but they wouldn't have admitted me because it was above 90. but anyway i had a pretty reasonable case of covid and my smell after five weeks started to come back i mean like ahead of a thing of bleach and i smell nothing i mean like zero i'm like real smell sensitive then i had phantom smells for a while ike was like uh oh the dog peed uh oh bon bon kitty you got my dog's name is kitty how's zelda doing by the way well honestly i've been worried a few i don't know if you saw me i was checking to see if my microphone has picked up her snoring oh because it's she's right across me and she's been snoring so loud this whole time so if anyone has heard that it's it's just zelda oh no it's golden yeah bon bon had his second snoring surgery but he's great now he's awesome king charles cavalier fan club of america we're talking to you right here anyway so i had phantom smells and then my smell is basically back but i'm like a little smell sensitive can't explain it so that this covid may change our ability to use smell sensitivity for alzheimer's related testing but anyway we'll cross that bridge later sorry for the tangent what about what about hearing because you see these reports from time to time that say we've got to get more aggressive with hearing aids in people the moment a person has even the slightest amount of hearing deterioration we've got to correct it the implication being that hearing loss will have a causative role in alzheimer's disease such that correction of it can delay or prevent versus just the obvious correlation between hearing loss and dementia given the obvious age association what's your thought on that yeah i don't i don't know that i have a perfect answer but hearing loss when they've done the studies the lancet commission 2020 report came out and basically showed that hearing loss is like the most impactful modifiable risk factor that they found in in their study which is like striking like a huge number of cases of dementia could be potentially reduced if a person gets early recognition of hearing impairment and and gets it addressed now why is sorry why is that yeah this is confusing and this is a quote unquote new risk factor i mean it's been around for you know the the evidence has been emerging for years now but i don't know i is it because you're i hate to say i'm not an expert in this at all but you're just you disengage you can't hear you you kind of you're in your own little world you you miss social cues you have different interaction levels i actually don't know the answer to this and this the classic line we need more research to truly be able to figure this out i mean i feel like it's one of those things richard that we because we're constantly updating our protocol and i've been thinking for about the past three months do we need to now take those high risk patients that we described and say everyone's got to go to an audiologist and of course the implication is you're going to get people in their 30s and 40s that have low low low grade hearing loss are they actually going to want to wear hearing aids or is it just going to be hey we're going to use more noise cancellation stuff and and sort of try to protect hearing longer but i'm curious as to this it also strikes me that from the precautionary principle there's no downside to protecting your hearing and as much as one can do that i don't see a downside to it i think we meaning doctors need to do a little bit of say a better job doctors have it really hard so it's this is not doctor's fault it's like our medical system is in disarray and broken beyond i have no idea how to fix it with 10 minutes or 15 minutes per patient i have lots of empathy for tremendous empathy for physicians working out there but uh in the trenches but hearing screening i think is something that should be part of at some age at some point an evaluation real briefly though i want to go back to lauren's odor identification so this is a weird comment and i i've never really also said this on a recording but lauren this is not the first time that i've seen patients that have really firing on all cylinders done 23 of the 25 things we told you to do like compliance out to wazoo 10 out of 10. your odor identification this is weird and this may be a red herring completely random or whatever your odor identification has improved i think it's because and and maybe this goes again goes against my four it's because now i know the difference in the cards between the coffee and the gasoline smell which used to really throw me off gotcha okay so even with an objective test we still have subjectivity with learning effects and stuff now i now when i smell it i'm like okay really be sure is this the coffee or the gas all the yellow ones are easy but between those two those always uh trip me up gotcha interesting you know just to get back to one thing lauren yes i have objective data but you know data is only as good as data is and all of our tests are imprecise and peter and i talk about this a lot sure your calculated cardiovascular risk when we put all your numbers in a calculator much lower your calculated alzheimer's risk based on the different scales much lower like we're doing a great job like in terms of living longer yeah knock on wood yeah we are really we're really doing well do you feel anything different in your brain or or not so much and just be honest no no and you know and i don't i don't know how much we want to get into any of this but i'm on my own hormonal journey and often wonder you know if that plays a part in it i i've always been someone who's enjoyed sleep we kind of talked about that and like you know i like sleep and i i can i love a nap as i get older and my hormones become bigger players in my health i sometimes think that has to do with it but overall do i feel cognitively better it's hard to say but physically i feel better my overall health is i can tell that it's better from a total body energy the way i can approach a situation i feel like i have a different type of body energy if that makes any sense cognitively you know knock on wood i fortunately feel like someone who is pretty in control of their cognition most of the time so you know do i have moments yes from like i feel tired or weird or even that you know like you said that brain fog which i don't think i understand at this point but the black and white answer is yes i feel better do i feel greatly better i'm not sure i mean to me i think there's an emotional piece here too right which is we go back to 10 years ago there's this depression that basically feels like there's something inevitable that's going to happen to you and i think you know by now richard and i are very much in the camp of saying there's no reason to believe you're going to get alzheimer's disease yeah like there's really no reason to believe that if you stay this course that you're on you get to be like normal people in their 80s so maybe that's the greatest single benefit of all this is that it changes the way you feel i wasn't physically in such rough shape that i could really pinpoint a difference but emotionally yes so much of the fear has dissipated because i have control in a way that i didn't before i see i see my blood work you know i see numbers going from red to green and that gives me a hope that you know i think translates into my physical being but also into my into my cognitive health as well i don't want us to to close without talking a little bit about hilarity for charity which we started talking about a little bit but bring us up to speed on specifically what the mission is how you decided to pick the lane that you guys are going to be in you know we touched on this a little bit before but i have been so fortunate in my terrible journey i think i've had the best situation of a horror show that could happen with alzheimer's and that one my family was able to afford care for my mom and that too i have because of my relationships and the advocate that i've become i have met smart people like you guys who have helped me take control of my brain health and so hfc what we've done with that is try to help other people be at least a part of that situation and so i like to think of hfc as sort of like this is our non-official you know mission statement which is like we're here for your for your brain today and tomorrow meaning that you know we're here for people today through care through our numerous support groups which are personalized and which we really take the time to connect people to people who would understand their situation early on i went to a support group where you know i was like 26 and upset about my mom and there was a guy there who was like 56 and who was upset about his mom and not that i didn't feel bad for this person but also like i did not feel bad for this person you know because i was like you're 56 you have your mom at 56 like i'm 26. and so you know we really try to recognize that in our care we put people together who would understand a situation and of course then there is the other aspect of it which is i think what makes the greatest impact in people's lives today which is our care program you know like i said my family could afford care for my mom so that my dad could catch his breath and take a break and go to the grocery store if he needed or you know come have dinner with me if you wanted and so many people are with their loved one 24 7 without a break without relief and that is a completely thankless job and so we provide care for people and provide caregivers to go into people's homes and give the primary caregiver respite and give them a break and then there's of course how we invest our dollars in research which is in brain health hfc really focuses on activating young people in the fight against alzheimer's we don't think that people should wait till they're older to start talking about their stories or losing loved ones to alzheimer's and they certainly shouldn't wait as we've talked about today to start taking care of their brains and so we really do our best to share what we've learned from you guys and educate people that it is never too early to start taking care of your brain and how important that is that's really our focus i i wish that we raised the kind of money that would research a medication that could cure alzheimer's but no one has yet given us five billion dollars i'm out here ready to receive it if someone is listening wants to send it our way but for now i'm gonna do what is practical which is help people today with support and care and teach people how to take care of their brains for tomorrow so that's who we are so people can go to the website they can obviously donate directly is there any other way people can get involved or be up i mean there are all sorts of events yeah what's what else can people do yeah i mean obviously this year the event thing has sort of taken a turn for all of us and all non-profits i think are feeling the strain of not being able to host our normal fundraising events and you know in the strain of that a lot of philanthropists who normally would would donate our way feel that they can't this year because they are donating towards covid related organizations or even racial organizations which please keep donating these things are very important i'm not saying you shouldn't but at the same time people still have brains and unfortunately there are still millions of people in this country with alzheimer's and their caregivers are in in even worse situations now so what we do is even more important these days so yeah you can go to our website of course give us your hard earned dollars we're happy to do something good with them but we also give people space to share their story if they have one we provide infrastructure if you want to throw your own alzheimer's fundraiser we've had so many amazing individuals over the years who have done their own fundraisers for what whatever speaks to them one of my favorites is a guy like drove do you say a tuck tuck do you say drove a tuk-tuk i guess a road one whatever pulled one across india and raised money for hfc like how cool but like that's what spoke to him that was organic to him and seth and i always say when it comes to fundraising or philanthropy like do what's organic to you what makes sense for your life so we provide an infrastructure if you want to raise money for us we're happy to help you do it you know again if you need support you can come to us we have so many different options we have an amazing partnership with the rosalind carter institute in which we train caregivers we give them one-on-one caregiving training which is really i think so invaluable i mean there's the truth is there's no there's no training to be a caregiver it's every day is a surprise and who knows but there are certain tools that we can give people and you know and i think we try to do it all in a way that is approachable certainly you know our original name is hilarity for charity now we're hfc because we want to seem like grown-ups and we want people to take us seriously but we approach everything through a way that you know has some comedy that is certainly our work but we often say alzheimer's is so devastating and it is so sad and people don't want to hear about it so we'll tell them some jokes and trick them into laughing and then all of a sudden we hit them with the facts and tell them how important it is and we rope them in that way i think overall we're just trying to provide people the hope that i have found over the years you know we started this podcast talking about my dark devastating times and like that's not who i am anymore and that's not my vision about all of this anymore and i think there is so much control that can be had that we did not have even just a few years ago and you know we through hfc are just trying to teach people that they have that control too well lauren richard it has been such a pleasure to sit down with you guys today and it has been worth every bit of the weight from almost a year ago when we wanted to first do this and no one would have imagined a year ago all that was going to happen in the next 12 months but it's also it's also given us a chance to see one more year of your incredible progress lauren so thanks for being the poster child for what alzheimer's prevention looks like well we're trying it's a journey right i don't know if i can be the poster child yet but maybe in some time we'll see if i think you know we'll keep going no pressure just post a child for the journey there you go well hey if we would have done this podcast a year ago i could have only said one out of every three cases of alzheimer's is preventable but now based on the latest data four out of ten cases of alzheimer's may be preventable if that person does everything right so i'm gonna have to change the signature in my email i'm sorry what you're saying to me who wrote that signature geez someone wrote that signature i don't know who it was unbelievable typos everywhere fired peter thanks for uh sharing our story and lauren thank you for um being courageous and uh you're the one that puts i mean i get to sit here at this desk and hang out and like you know whatever and you actually have to go home and do all the 27 things that peter and i tell you to do so thank you things too good sport you do your own things yeah got to do what you got to do yeah and we're really grateful to your family for also feeling that it's been okay for you to talk about this because i know that these are things people don't want to talk about and yet i think the understanding that hey we talk about these things that suck because they make it makes a difference because there's a lot of people that are listening to this right now that can relate to what you're saying yeah i hope so well there's so much that can be done so i appreciate the chance to talk about it all right guys thanks so much thanks so much thank you for listening to
