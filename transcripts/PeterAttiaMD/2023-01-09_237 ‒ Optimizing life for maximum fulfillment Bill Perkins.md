Bill Perkins is one of the world’s most successful hedge fund managers and entrepreneurs, and the author of the bestseller, Die With Zero. In this episode, Bill unpacks the Die With Zero philosophy which challenges conventional thinking related to the balance between health, wealth, and time—the three variables important for fulfillment. Bill makes the case that we should strive for maximum net fulfillment rather than net worth (or even health). He argues that we need to optimize our life to have memorable experiences before it’s too late and that most people are over-saving and under-living. Bill also explains how one can apply the principles in Die With Zero to break out of “autopilot” and optimize their life to achieve maximum net fulfillment.

This episode features a discussion with Bill Perkins, author of "Die with Zero," focusing on optimizing life for maximum fulfillment. The conversation centers around the concept of balancing three key variables: wealth, health, and time to maximize life experiences and net fulfillment. Perkins argues against the traditional model of accumulating wealth until death, instead advocating for strategic spending and experience acquisition during periods of life when they can be most appreciated.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Discussion of physical decline curves and their impact on life experiences [01:31:09]
- Relationship between age and ability to participate in physical activities [01:32:18]
- Force calculations in sports activities (F=mv) and impact on risk assessment [01:38:37]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Consider health span alongside lifespan when making life decisions [01:31:09]
- Balance risk and reward in physical activities based on age [01:36:13]
- Transition to lower-impact activities as you age [01:37:13]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Adjust physical activities based on personal health conditions [01:36:13]
- Consider timing of experiences based on physical capabilities [01:37:13]

**4. Notable Quotes**:

**6. Follow-up Questions**:
1. How does one calculate their optimal "peak net worth" age?
2. What specific metrics should be used to measure "net fulfillment"?
3. How does one balance health optimization with experience maximization?
4. What role should insurance products play in risk mitigation strategies?

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA Bill thanks so much for for coming by I've been looking forward to this for a long time I have too I'm I'm really honored to be on your pod podcast you know so um I don't know a little while ago I made a a video on Instagram where

[00:00:20] I talked about sort of three books I've read in the last 12 months that I didn't expect to sort of a have such an impact on how I thought about things but also be even though they're completely different books they strike me as having kind of a unifying theme in qual in this sort of thing about quality of life um so so the the three books are one of them was uh from strength to strength one of them is 4,000 weeks and the other one is die with zero now what's interesting is I know exactly who suggested I read uh 4,000 weeks and I'm really good friends with the author of from strength strength so that's why I just read that knowing it was coming out

[00:01:03] I still don't remember who recommended die with zero to me um but I remember just thinking okay well cool sounds interesting uh ordered it and then kind of just couldn't put it down and as I think I mentioned in the video you know immediately made my wife read it and then immediately just went out and bought many copies of it along with many copies of the other two books so I basically started handing them out as like a triplet copy like if someone was over and they hadn't read them boom they were leaving with all three copies of the book so that speaks to kind of why you know I wanted to sit down with you and um I guess I just let's give people a sense of who you know who you are so you grew up in Jersey right yeah I grew up in Jersey City New

[00:01:47] Jersey you also you're an engineer we have that in common right yeah except you know I don't want people to be impressive as an engineer you know we had a saying on the football team D's get degrees until later I found out wait you can't graduate with a in engineering you have to at least get a c so I barely graduated I was a super slacker so I don't want to be like I'm an engineer you know uh what position did you play the bench I played the bench but I was a defensive back a cornerback at the

[00:02:13] University of Iowa um but did it pay for school no no I was actually a walk-on I was trying to get a scholarship I had a partial scholarship which means they just give you some food um I basically broke my uh leg at the growth plate was pretty much has been before I ever was but you know when you love football you love the sport you never want to let go right you're not like oh I'll just dive into my studies and pick up this hobby you're kind of like football is life at that age so um what what took you straight so you you graduated college with the degree in engineering maybe you're not first in your class you decide though you're going to go instead of going to grad school or something like that you're like I'm I'm gonna go to New York is that your first job yeah I mean you know uh I love that uh not first in my class the understatement of the year uh so the um I was kind of like lost didn't know what I was going to do really was pretty much a slacker underachiever at the time and um my godfather calls me with one of those like what are you going to do with your life at the point and I knew I didn't want to go into engineering um it was kind of this cookie cutter life uh you know you don't really have any kind of entrepreneurial spirit in it you work on like a subsection of a chip here's your career path Etc was all kind of laid out for you and that was unattractive to me it kind of seemed like death to me um and at the time I saw this movie Wall Street uh and I was like oh that's what I want I want to be rich I want to go work in stocks so when my godfather called me I go I want to be a I want to be a stock broker or a stock Trader and and he goes

[00:03:56] I I don't know anything about equities but there's this firm in a commod ities I mind you I didn't know what a commodity was uh that's looking for screen clerks um you know go go check it out and so I got an introduction um came with my resume and this is this is what you're like 80 late 80s early 90s 90 like 91 okay um and takes my resume tears it up shows me or walks me around the floor people yelling and screaming and you know they're kind of in casual wear and and it's like

[00:04:28] Trading Places and I'm like all this energy and I'm like wow if that if that guy can be rich so can I and so they didn't want to hire me actually uh they were looking to give the job to someone else another friend of the firm so I like kind of hung out downstairs waiting every day calling like can I come up can

[00:04:45] I get this job as as a peon can I get can I become a peon here can I become a peon and finally after three days uh they let me become a peon so what did that job entail it's checking trades and sneaking sandwiches on the floor for Traders it's like literally the the version the worst version of the mail room right but the system in the old days where guys would yell and scream across a pit and write their trades on a piit card and also in their their trade book they throw the pick Cards into a center there's a guy with glasses and a a giant net and all these cards would go to him they would catch them put them in the in down the shoot and they would be entered into a computer system okay my job was to check the trader log versus the computer slog right and your name becomes your Trader so if your Trader was why not or SMN SNM that was your name so clerks are running around the floor going why not SNM why not and then you know if you're if you're why not you're like why not here I got a I got a error here I I know selling five Lots at 5480 not three lots at 5480 what do you know and if you know the same trade then it's a simple process to correct it in the system right and if you don't you're like no no I definitely know only three lots right then you go to the Traders immediately and they kind of reconcile it and that was a system like running around all day you know checking trades so uh this is this this job is down on

[00:06:11] Wall Street this firm is on Wall Street yeah so back when the World Trade Center was there uh um this was in uh four World Trade Center and um how much were you learning the business cuz I imagine one could take a job like that and not actually learn what's happening like what the machine is doing yeah um that's when I decided to turn it on you know I I always tell people like hey I was pretty much a can I say [ __ ] up yeah I was pretty much the [ __ ] up of fuckups right for given what I had um before college but then I decided to turn it on and like that poverty that like being a peon and not and and that desire to make it forced me to be like

[00:06:56] I'm going to learn every single thing there is about this business I was reading books at night about trading about the oil business about options about whatever I was a sponge and I really turned it on and said I'm going to be diligent I'm not going to mess around and as much as I possibly can as a 20-year-old right and and really really trying to make myself invaluable no matter where I was so where were you living at the time what part of the city did you actually live in Manhattan no I had I mean when I first got there I had to live at home with my mom which was completely cramping my style right and so I was like I this is you know I started um driving a limo at night the company limo at night to make ends meet and what were you getting paid in that first job oh jeez I I think it was sub $116,000 a year I have to have to go look sub6 yeah I think it was like 166,000 but I was getting raises very quickly because I made myself valuable and I would work at night and I would make more money driving the limo on a daily basis because Traders would like take me here and they'd be drunk they tip you and you know you weren't there necessarily for your current income you were there for your future income right and so um I I had a another clerk named

[00:08:10] Jason rufo who had a studio on the upper west side and what he did was um he we put up he put up a wall by the kitchen and kind of made this small room in the studio and I eventually got an apartment with him on the west Upper West Side living in like a pizza oven type space you know um but it was great because I was in New York City I was out of my mom's house right I could have girls over you know what I mean and and that

[00:08:40] Pride that goes well I live on the upper west side you know everybody wants to say they live in New York City and so as I uh was getting raises and kind of moving up you know I I gradually got into that life of you know what I call a buppy black urban professional you know buppies and yuppies uh and and that was kind of you know the beginning of my journey tell me was your dad in the picture at this time um so my dad is is is now older in in in poor health uh in in in in Jersey City so he's he's during this time he'd had multiple strokes and my dad is kind of like me uh which is he's fairly stubborn but he was stubborn to the extreme uh you know doctor says don't do this all the things you would tell him not to do and you need to be doing he's like ah the hell with that you know what I mean I guess and so um he's he's in the picture my parents are divorced he's in Jersey City and had your parents gone to college um my dad did so my dad got a scholarship to the

[00:09:43] University of Iowa like he was a he was a real bad ass he had no intentions of going to school um he walked by a football field when he was a kid in high school he's like I want to do that coach is like you don't know anything about football and he says it seems like it's about hitting people I know how to hit people so they give him some FY uniforms and next you know he comes out for a practice and in the next practice he has a brand new uniform he winds up you know he's all everything gets uh recruited to go to University of Iowa to go to college and so there he is in college in 1959 at the University of

[00:10:15] Iowa you know all badass from Jersey City um so he had gone to college and then my mom went to college finished College while I I think I was like young teen early pre-teen or or late teens but so they I had the benefit of two college educated parents and how much were they understanding your call it hunger your drive your aspirations in this new role I mean because presumably they had seen you in high school and college not achieving it your potential and now all of a sudden you're hustling you're working two jobs you're reading you're learning you're doing all these things were they were they you know perview to that sort of metamorphosis in you they they later you know you I'm the kid that like didn't take out the garbage right like it's I always say don't tell your parents your dreams because they'll just piss on them right because they've seen you at your worst at your failures as you're growing right it's like they they they they H they have this kind of image of you um when you were the caterpillar not the butterfly uh and so you know so you weren't necessarily like advertising to them this is what I want to do no no it it started it started uh you know they started seeing it right like I remember remember the time when I finally made more than my I got a raise and I was like I did the calculation just like holy [ __ ] I make more money than my mom like I've made it like it was one of the happiest days of my life I'm like I'm real I'm Legit I'm a buppy you know me with my badge you know used to wear around as a badge of honor like I get on to the New York merile Exchange Etc um but you know they'd see like I'm going out or I'm flying here or I'm doing whatever and it's like oh the kids kid must be doing okay you know it wasn't until I got recruited to go to

[00:12:05] Houston um you know started buying the assets that adults start buying uh and and I paid my mom back uh for something that I did when I was a teenager that she didn't know that they're like okay what was that so when I was younger I I I had a stick Toyota that my mom had it was her car was driving it and my friend uh Pete thel it's like I want to drive the car I want to teach me how to drive the car when to drive the car I'm not supposed to drive the car so anyway long story short he hits the gas instead of the clutch spins the car out the back of it spins around hits a telephone pole trunk pops up it has this big giant Dent I'm like holy [ __ ] what are we what am I going to do you know so I tell my mom the story that you know we went to go pizza and parked it and then you know a truck must have hit it on the side or bumped it and went on and that was my lie to my mom about this car that

[00:13:07] I felt guilty about I said one day I'm going to pay for this car in Spades uh that that happened to my mom and so one day I you know I give my mom $40,000 and I was like Mom you remember that time the car had that brown mark on it and you we told you it was a truck well this is what really happened so how how how did she react to that that's a she started started laughing she was laughing she like she go I knew something was strange about that you know it it it it the story fit right but but there was something strange about that you know she just kind of laughed and and was was thankful that you know one and and you know it was a great investment you know having that car beat up but but she just kind of laughed and and we just reminisced about it so let's go back to when you're on the upper west side because there you you you write about this in the book which was um you and your roommate kind of had a slightly different uh I don't know call it a point of view on future earnings and what that allowed you to do with your time you you told a story about something you did that seemed kind of bold oh that that he did that was kind of bold you're talking about when Jason took the uh the trip yeah yeah so yeah sorry sorry yeah yeah yeah so so Jason um you know I I don't know if our views were very thought out or just wired in right but like I was head down like I got to make it I got to become a Trader

[00:14:34] I got to have my head down I'm I'm I'm saving money I'm I'm I'm I'm really at this point in my life like super diligent like you know trying to convince my boss to get the uh on the bus program to save money you know not you know writing down every single nickel that I bought Etc and really focused on my my career trajectory and

[00:14:56] Jason is like does Jason work in the same firm uh he works at another firm right in if you look at the old pictures all the foam booths are right next to each he's like right next to me even though he's not at the same fir we're all crowded into one area uh and Jason's like I'm going to go backpacking for your for a couple months I'm like wait what and and I'm like what how how are you g to do that well I'm G to borrow money from from this guy who was a lone shark and I'm like wait wait what you're going to borrow money from this guy you're gonna go and you're gonna go backpacking in Europe I'm like this is insane I'm like this is insanity my head is about to explode I'm like you're going to miss out and what if they hire another screen Clerk and your job's not there when you come back and how are you going to pay this guy back if you don't pay him back this is not like oh penalties and interest this is like you know knees and ankles right uh uh and so

[00:15:54] I I just didn't get it like I just didn't get it like that experience and that you know I wasn't thinking about like die with zero and certain experiences burn belong in a certain priority of Life Etc I was just like ultimately on this autopilot of trying to be successful and make money right at that time in my age that time of my life and Jason was like I'm going backpacking so he went I stayed he came back had a screen clerking job you know different firm or same same firm same firm wasn't that much noticeable different like I moved up a little bit but it wasn't that much noticeable different but he came back richer right he came back with stories and experiences and romance and lifelong friends and I was like you know at the beginning I was kind of oh wow maybe I missed out maybe I could have jumped in for a week you know that type of thing and as time went on I really really regretted not joining him on that trip I was like that when I that when it finally came to where like I'm going to go

[00:17:00] Europe right I'm going to go I'm going to go have this backpacking experience I was too bougie I had money I wasn't going to go stay at youth hosts I wasn't going to capture these trains I I was going to have an experience but a different experience the type of experience he had was for that time in your life and a type every experience even though it was wonderful it was not as rich as his experience right because the time had passed me by and and it's one of my it's one of my big big big regrets in life so how did you start to formulate this understanding about these different types of resources be it time be it money which is the resource I think a lot of people think about experiences themselves as you know for lack of a better word an asset or a thing the actual experience uh the people you're meeting all of these different things when did you start to coales around some of the ideas that that ultimately of course would go on to become the thesis of this book it it was slowly over time you know even when um you know I got to

[00:18:05] The Exchange I was like in this hurry to get rich right um and the reason why I was in a hurry because I had this bias I had this belief I was like yeah there's Rich guys here but they're old like what can they possibly do with the money right like I'm young I'm 21 like I'm ages I I I I can't imagine you know the use of a million dollars when you're 40 right like what are you going to do buy a nicer car to drive your kids around like you know know it's it it just seems like loss on them right like they don't get to do fun things now I was wrong about that but I was right about the utility of money over time right and I and I was also read this book at this time called your money or your life that kind of transformed my understanding of what money is right it's a very detailed book that has these exercises that has you look at how you spend your hours from going to work getting ready for work the things you spend on work and really figuring out what your true hourly wage is right like after tax this is what an hour of your time of your life is worth and then it has you not think of everything in money but in time so instead of going to the movies and say it cost me $10 is like that cost me 1 hour and 15 minutes of my time to go to this movie to buy this shirt it cost me 3 hours of my time and so you get this idea that I'm exchanging my life for certain things right the experience of buying a shirt going to the movie going on a trip and that hit me hard how and where were you at this point this is before you went to

[00:19:44] Houston this before I went to Houston before I to Houston that hit me hard and that's what really turned me into like I'm going to save right the two things I got out of is I want a lot of money and I'm going to like become this very frugal person you know there's this movement called fire which that book is kind of like the Bible the precursor to the fire movement which is financial

[00:20:01] Independence retire early MH and I was kind of like an early fire guy like I'm going to save my way to riches right I'm going to save and then retire early and um uh I had Sor did you know what you wanted to do when you retired no I just went on I went on to another autopilot I went on another version of autopilot I read a book I got these concept out of it right and I was like this is what I'm going to do right I didn't think about the big picture of everything but some certain concepts are coming to me right like I exchange hours of my life for money and then that money is used for the things I want let's take the abstract of money out of it and look at what I'm what hours of my life are being exchanged for right that was a great concept for to SN in very viscerally um the idea that it it's also just to double click on that bill it's also visceral when you start to think of the difference between using money for activities or trips versus uh things so uh you know I buy a shirt and this shirt basically works out to three hours of what I make per hour so this is a $3 shirt I mean a three- hour shirt right um conversely like I take my daughter out overnight we do like a daddy daughter date night go out to dinner stay at a nice hotel have a fancy you know breakfast the next day uh that's you know that's 5 hours of my time in terms of work right but do you see those sort of differently at the time that that one of those is like an experience and one of not in a way that you're properly analyzing it but in more of an intuitive way my value because when you start to think about things in time is like wait a minute three hours for a shirt versus you know hour you know going here having a sandwich and hanging out with my friends or whatever it is your values start to you really get in touch with your values right because it's not an abstract land it's like when you're in a casino and they give you chips it's one of the greatest things to do is give you chips it's not money you're tipping $25 you're throwing and let it all ride because it's so abstracted from money so it's an abstraction on an abstraction right by removing that abstraction right you get closer to your values right right imagine that you have $25 chips you figure out your hourly after tax

[00:22:19] Allin wage is 25 an hour every time you flick a chip it's like I gave an hour of my life boom boom boom so when you start thinking about things in terms of hours of your life and you have finite hours you start to really get closer to your values you can still be on autopilot but you're closer and so things like this were happening and and you know at that time at the exchange like most people had like what is it all for like what do

[00:22:44] I want you know I'm here to get rich but but why are you having that discussion with other either people who are your peers who are presumably on the same treadmill or the people who are already rich but still still presumably killing themselves trading their health for wealth no I'm I'm generally having it with myself and reading books right and

[00:23:04] I'm just but I'm still asking myself but why like what what do I what do I want you know and I'm remembering conversations that maybe I've had throughout my life where people like there was a uh a college football player named Dwight cistrunk and I was like trying to do engineering and we we were debating something he's like look listen you might want to pick a fence and a wife into something like that and that life I don't want that life I don't want that cookie cut of life that's fine for you but that's not my path right

[00:23:28] I thought about it and I was like do I really want that right and then you know certain things that he said that he didn't want that I was actually working for you know thinking that this was my path I actually realized no I don't want that right and so you know I'm pretty hard-headed it takes a while for these things to seep in right and so you know so I would I would argue a little different bill I would argue that at this point you're 22 23 24 I think that's remarkably early to be having that thought don't you yeah I guess it took a while for it to finally percolate into some sort of action plan right to like kind of like actually I'm thinking about these things but they're not resulting in the proper behavior changes yet right so I'm still I'm still formulating it right so so you know you know everyone says I want to be rich before I'm 30 or I'm rich Before 40 no one's out there saying I want to be rich before I'm 86 right so intutive in there there's something about the utility of money right that it's not as valuable to you later on in life right yeah it's one of the games I often play with my patients um and I always I I I sort of or you it's anybody I could play this game with anybody which is listen if right now and you always do this with someone who's younger obviously I say like right now would you trade places with Warren

[00:24:54] Buffett or Charlie monger and they're like everybody says of course not and I was like what do you mean of course not like Warren Buffett's worth a hundred billion I mean how would you not trade places with him and they're like I mean he's 90 years old or whatever and I say okay so would you rather have not a penny to your name and be 20 or have a hundred billion dollars and be 90 no other difference right like I'm not going to stipulate anything else I've never met a person who wouldn't take being a completely broke 20-year-old right and and and that I think speaks less to health because look ostensibly

[00:25:29] Warren still appears somewhat healthy right he's cognitively intact he doesn't you know it's not like he's like a frail 90y old or whatever he is but it's about Runway it's about yeah but maybe Warren might have 10 years of life left that 20-year-old could have 80 years of life left and and so when you face it in such

[00:25:46] Stark terms only then I think does the average person start to realize how precious time is yeah and I think they also see that you know Warren can't Sprint yeah dunk a basket ball you know go wakeboarding like there's a lot of other things too in there that that enjoy me and that's what I thought about and you know I thought to myself if you know after reading this book like I'm spending hours of my life to acquire these experiences and I mean experiences in the broadest sense whether it's like you know going on a a walk or or being able to choose to go on a walk or go get a sandwich or buy a shirt or whatever um if I'm exchanging hours in my life and I don't don't go acquire these experien I pretty much wasted hours of my life right so that thought hits and it's like okay you don't want to leave anything on the table right in the game of life when I die you don't want to leave chips on the table right like you want to use all your resources before you die right and and that you know inherent in that is that your choices your experiences those those experiences are what make you you those are the things that fulfill you and everybody's going to be different and so so consequently having more of it and enjoying more of it will lead to a more fulfilling life so that if I'm if I'm solving for fulfillment right this is I don't care about the money I care about the things I want the experiences I want to have if I if I'm if I'm trying to solve for that one of the things you come quickly to is that you need to use all your resources up before you die okay the second thing you come to with the fact that your resources particularly money or less valuable to you when you're older then you start to think well there must be a curve right because if you're going to end at zero is it you know this kind of rectangle shape that just goes down is it a a 45 degree angle SLP or is there's some sort of curve and so what I like to do to understand certain things it doesn't always work is think of zero and think of infinity right so when you're like all right let's run it all the way back to one you know one years old how how you how useful is money not that useful to you right let's run it all the way forward to 96 on your deathbed how useful is money to you not that useful right so clearly there's like some sort of ramp up of utility and then a decline of utility right and I became obsessed with finding what that curve was because I was like this is it um if you're making more money for delayed gratification later in life you approach Infinity you're actually wasting your time you should be spending down your assets at a certain certain point there's an inflection point where not a number but a date where your wealth should be going down in order to get the most fulfillment now let's pause for a second bill is that standard thinking SL teing within the wealth management community no no but is it is a standard problem if you look at uh kind of JP Morgan or other wealth managers one of the biggest problems they have is accumulation getting people to spend down their assets right they've been saving they got their money they they've hit retirement and it's like their net worth is going up into their 70s you know and we're like when's the party you know that's why I always ask them like you just tell me when the party is like you know I have I have conversations with older people or other people I'm like listen it's co okay that you're saving what are you saving for and when's the party I just want to know when you're going to use up all your resources right now let let's also pivot and talk about um because because I remember one of the stats that always stuck with me um was during 2008 so a really good friend of mine named Jim lamri who was at the time the president of the XM Bank um when the tarp program kicked on because he was close with Hank

[00:29:40] Paulson and already spent so much time in China and had had government clearance basically Hank brought Jim lamri and Neil kashari who was with him uh already at the treasury I believe to run tarp so basically Jim and Neil are doing all the deals for tarp and Jim is getting steeped in how bad is this going to be right like what is this going to mean for the average person and I remember one day he called me with a stat that I couldn't believe and I forget the stat so this is only directionally it but it was what fraction of people in the United States could not produce $1,000 with three days notice meaning they they didn't have that excess liquidity of $1,000 right again I don't remember the number but it was in the ballpark of like 30% it was a it was a high number and so I don't know what those stats are today I've tried to look some of them up and they're not maybe quite as um as as dire as that but they're not that much better no they're not great it's not great so so I I'm what's the natural history of that person who's 40 years old who's total net worth is $50,000 and their available liquidity is ,000 and they're you know they're thinking I'm going to work till I'm 65 or 70 or whatever and then I'm going to collect my Social

[00:31:05] Security does this thinking still apply there yeah it applies in different in in different ways so what I've come up with this book is there's three variables your wealth your health and your time and we're taking those three variables and we're solving for net fulfillment right so we're not solving for maximum wealth we're not soling solving even for maximum health maximum time we're solving for net fulfillment right I'm saying that's your purpose if you're with me we're solving for net fulfillment and so you know one of the things we look is that that the total

[00:31:42] Arc of your life right given the resources you have how do we allocate them right a lot of we we definitely want to focus on the money right that's a big everybody wants to talk about the money and the resources but there's decisions that you make even without money whether you go on a walk with your daughters or you play cards with your friends late at night do you tuck them in at night or do you go hang out with the boys right and so in the book we talk about the seasons of your life certain activities transfer nicely to the next season of your life from 20 to 30 to 30 to 40 and some of them don't transfer well they're less enjoyable and some of them don't transfer at all it's impossible you know so one of the things you know when The 40-Year-Old who has $50,000 it you know one of the things I would say is is what's your survival number have you calculated that at retirement are you surviving retirement or are you in serious negative Dire

[00:32:37] Straits and once we've calculated that okay I need to work and save this much and plus Social Security I've had my survival number now the rest is for experiences things I want to do an allocation of my time how do I allocate it right is it the cruise at 70 or is it the ski triip right now right and that's going to be different for every single person right or is it a shirt or whatever fulfills them or to go play in this chess tournament and pay the pay the entry fee and for people with zero money you still have an allocation game to play right you still have your health and your time right you can still decide hey um I'm going to sit down and watch friends you know or I'm going to go hang out on my mom house and make a meal and spend time with them because I'm only going to see them 20 times before they're gone right so this type of thinking about allocating your resources at the proper place getting off autopilot holds at all wealth levels it doesn't hold at all Health levels because if you have zero Health you have zero you're done it's over but it holds at all wealth levels so that type of thinking to maximize fulfillment and knowing that you have seasons of your life that your body decays your attit udes change and and they pass that type of thinking and that I need to get things in the right order and use my resources properly that's going to help you have a more fulfilling life whether you have zero money or hundred million right there are many people with zero who are having a way more fulfilling life than Warren Buffett I would say yeah I I think one of the things about the way you framed it bill that I really like um is the it's a very nonlinear problem right so let's look at look at those three variables at the surface one might suggest well wait a minute it is a min max game with one of them you always want Max Health but technically even that's not true because if I told you Bill I have the secret for you to have Max health I can preserve your health span and lifespan indefinitely but here's what it's going to cost you every minute of the day you have to be working on your health so from the moment you wake up from sleep you have to do a 2-hour meditation we then have to go and do this yoga we then have to go and do this workout when you're done that workout you have to go and do this and then you have to go to bed you'd be like well Peter that sucks because yeah

[00:35:11] I'm GNA live for a hundred more years and I don't get to spend any of that time doing anything other than improving my health corre it's a it's a glib example but it factors I think it illustrates it gets the point across I usually say you know um there's no amount of money you can pay me to do 10 years in Sing

[00:35:31] Sing right like not at this age right like I'm there's no there's no amount of money right like and so you know I say that to certain people who are just like always delaying gratification and I'm like you're kind of in a jail like like you're you're basically doing a version of I'm doing time right and and maybe maybe you shouldn't be doing time at this point in your life right and so these are kind of just ways you know people absorb information in different ways you can say it in all kinds of different ways and then they finally aha I got it that really spoke to me the way you said it and so I I try and hit people with different different versions of this you know one of the things I like to say to people is life is like

[00:36:10] Tetris you got to get the order right in order to get the high score of n fulfillment so let's say you're in Heaven by the way Tetris is the only video game I enjoy okay gotcha like I I go through periods like where I won't play it for a year and then I go through periods where I'll waste 30 minutes a day which is a lot of time for me for me 30 minutes in a day is an inordinate amount of time and when I'm sometimes in those phases of playing it a lot I dream in Tetris I literally dream that everything I'm seeing in the world I'm trying to optimize the shape and interaction of well we got to think about getting your life in so I I in the book I talk about this thing about time buckets basically that you you take your life in in segments any kind of segment you want 20 25 35 to 40 50 to 60 and then you you think about you know

[00:37:02] Leisure job career what experience you want to have in each of those periods right and as you're doing that you realize that wait a minute the going to the clubs and strip clubs and hanging out probably should be before I get married not after right the reading books to my kids when they're children right that must be in this book this must be in this bucket and so I give because they're not going to want me reading to them in college exactly or even when they're 13 14 they don't even want to know you right and you know that's one one of the errors I made and like you know you always do it wrong as a parent right like you don't want to spend too much time with them Etc it's like wait a minute maybe I should have been doing this activity instead of that activity right kind of the die with zero thinking right optimize your life and so the way the you know the thought experiment I says listen you're up in heaven you have the bucket of experiences these are all the choices you can have and God says take as much as you want you're thrown it in you're like I want to have sex 30,000 times and

[00:37:54] I want to climb him out kill injo and I want to play hockey I want to be in a high school team and I want to do you know and you're just throwing them in right everything I want to meditate and yoga right and then God goes great I'm going to let you have all those experiences but there's one trick you got to get the order right and what's it saying is is if you don't get the order right like if you save certain experiences to the 80 to 86 bucket you don't get it right if you if you you're not climbing kill them yeah if you're like in like nightclub and road trips with your buddies before you're married and you have two kids or whatever you don't get that if you don't go backpack it with your friend and youth hostiles Etc when you're 21 when you get the shot you don't get that experience right or it's or it's a bastardized you know not as fulfilling experience so you don't get the the net fulfillment points and so it's kind of di with zero it's like what do you want out of your life get off autopilot what do you want on a life where does it what resources do you have and how do we optimize how do we get the most out of it so how do you think about your own risk tolerance now again this is I guess there's a maybe a caveat The Listener needs to understand at this point which is what you do for a living today yeah so you are an energy Trader among other things you know you you do many things but but is it safe to say that the majority of the wealth you've created came through your ability to understand how natural gas moves and trade on that yeah the majority of my wealth came from predicting the future and that's the future of natural gas prices um John Arnold who is you know one of your closest colleagues someone who I've had on the podcast nicknamed the king of gas the greatest gas Trader of all time um do you look at a guy like

[00:39:42] John and say he has a high-risk tolerance do you look at someone like yourself and say you have a high-risk tolerance or do you not feel that way at all and feel like nope I'm completely in control of calculated risks and that's why they net out to be positive in other words I'm less swayed by short-term volatility because my methodology you know doesn't feel like

[00:40:03] I'm gambling I I think the the the best Traders I've seen have been pretty stoic about about things they think about very robotically about expected outcome and they don't seem to be disturbed about negative outcomes as much as tell tell folks what expected outcomes mean because they want to understand that the probabilities and how these work right so like if you if you if you uh place a bet and the payout is one and four but the odds are 50/50 right you're you're going to get half the time you're going to get four times your money and half the time you're just going to lose one times your money so that's positive expected outcome right you're going to make money this is a great trade but remember 7% of the time you're gonna lose right or in this scenario no the payout half the time you're gonna lose half the time you're gonna lose the payouts one and four so half the time you're pissed you're upset right um and and a lot of people can't deal with that they need four or five or seven positive events emotionally psychologically forever every negative event in trading that just doesn't exist yeah in trading if someone is right half the time they're they're pretty good right if they're if they're right 55% 60 60% of the time they're right like think about the casino's Edge in blackjack could be 51 yeah yeah 007 or 9 and blackjack and craps it's like .03 right like they're wrong like a lot of the time right but ultimately the law large numbers they make a bunch of money but if your emotional calculus is different uh where such that you need a a greater a greater being right ratio then you're not going to make it because stress clouds your thinking and your judgment right so with that said if someone says to you Bill you you just have a really high tolerance for risk I

[00:41:57] I don't you know I'm very risk adverse I I have I I you know I I don't like to take big risk I never want to have the chance of losing something uh you know loss aversion is a greater motivator for me than gain uh how do you talk to that person and how do you help them think through the difference between fear and risk tolerance well the first thing I do is just try and break down like what do they actually afraid of a lot of times when people say you the bad thing is not as bad as they imagine it their head and a lot of times you know quite frankly it's really the fear of judgment more than the actual thing right they they I find out that they can survive the potential negative Financial hit what they can't survive is oh my friends my colleagues my spouse my mom my dad the shame the the the you know I got it wrong the I Told You So Etc there's a lot of that fear baked into disguised as

[00:42:54] I can't risk these dollars I'm like yeah you can you know I mean you make you know that that type of thing then the other thing is I trying to think is get them to focus they always focus on the monetary cost of losing but what about the cost of inaction and the opportunity cost right and by talking about the opportunity costs I get them to see the asymmetry of the risk right so I'm I don't think I'm maybe I have a greater tolerance for risk but what I do is is that I fear you know my fear is reversed

[00:43:23] I fear missing out on the opportunity cost I fear not not getting the ma you know a lot of people fear running out of money I fear wasting my life right I more worried about looking back and being like [ __ ] I wasted my only ride that I had than running out of money right one of my patients said something to me once um he was about to do something that I just thought was really risky um now it was a very unique opportunity um and he saidou know Peter I'm going to go and do this thing and I said I think there's a I think there's a significant risk to you in doing that it wasn't a financial risk it would have been a a health risk a physical risk and he said I you're right Peter I I acknowledge that risk that that that is the the risk but I'm optimizing in a risk uh pardon me a um a regret minimizing framework not a risk minimizing framework yeah that that and that's pretty much for me it's risk reward right if I really love cigarettes like love them I'd smoke cigarettes you know what I mean if I really love skydiving all the time I went twice but it was diminishing returns I go skydiving right it's what fulfills you right and so I I'm I'm a risk reward guy is the reward commensurate with the risk some people like to ride motorcycles I don't get my it's for me it's not worth the risk like I have a physical risk tolerance around one in 10,000 right like if it's more dangerous than one in 10,000 I it the reward really has to be worth it for me to do it um and so you know I think that's the way I think right and then that that helps me in this kind of like counterfactual regret minimization algorithm right because so the algorithm of the book right the mental models in the book all right you know when a chess computer plays you it has a regret minimization algorithm and what it wants to do is it's solving to win right Alpha go is solving to win the game in The

[00:45:32] Game of Life what I'm solving for the regret minimization I'm solving for is net fulfillment I want the highest score in net fulfillment I don't want the highest money I I don't even want the highest health right I'm I'm like I don't want to run three hours a day to be in the top Point half a percent top three% is great enough I'll give up the tail end of my life you know what I mean or and and time like how do I optimize my time right and so everything for me is like what I'm solving for in life what this book is solving for for you is net fillment it is Relentless about net fulfillment and so if if that entails take for you in in your makeup like taking those risk going hellis sking skydiving riding motorcycles then so be it like as long as you're off autopilot and you thought it through then that's fine how variable do you think people are in their um kind of stratification of what encompasses net fulfillment um and and maybe a better question is do you think people are even understanding about and deliberate about what that means like that's that doesn't strike me as something that the average person could articulate very clearly what it is that will be their fulfillment maximizing function in terms of experiences and also I think I want to reiterate a point you made which is it's not just the experience it's when they occur correct right so so the combination of Which experiences and when they occur and who they occur with do you get the sense that the average person can actually articulate that I I think they they they had the ability earlier in life and then they get habituated out of it so we all go into autopilot right like we have this default mode Network it it it helps us survive it helps us drive without thinking oh I got to return you know when you first l a Drive like it's everything's happening fast you have to deliberately think about everything you're doing and then all of a sudden it goes into default mode Network and it's easy that happens with work right and you're like I need to work to survive and I need to do this and you're panicking whatever and the next thing you're in the groove and you're just constantly working right constantly working and it's some long along the somewhere along the way with the abstraction of you know going to work to make money to survive and get the things we want we forget about the things we want we just go to work to work to just make more money to go to work to make more money and the things we want either get pushed for ahead or forgotten about because we're an autopilot right it was a good thing because it makes us good at our jobs it's like I could do this job with my eyes closed I could do this and I'm getting promoted and you're getting rewarded and there's certain things about the jobs that you like but you're forgetting why you did this thing in the first place right people aren't like I really wanted to be a plastic salesperson I really love selling

[00:48:20] Plastics more and more Plastics and piling up numbers in a bank account those numbers in a bank account were really meant for I want to hang out with my buddies and I want to go skiing and I want to get married and I want to donate to this charity and I want to do X Y and Z right but we we kind of forget that right and and since we forgot about it we're not even thinking about when the best time it is to happen right it's just completely like oh I'll eventually do it or when I get more so we're completely out of touch of what we want what's enough the concept of enough what that means for us and the concept of when now I had a discussion with a patient just yesterday um um so runs a hedge fund and not surprisingly given the economic climate we're in you know hedge funds aren't doing particularly well especially long long Edge funds um and you know this this guy doesn't need to be working I mean even though he's now having a down year I mean he could certainly return all the capital to his investors and manage his own Capital indefinitely Or do nothing literally do nothing right um but he said what would

[00:49:22] I do like yeah what I mean what would I do like I'd sit around for three months and it would feel really nice to have no stress for three months and then I'd be bored out of my mind so he's like no I got to keep going yeah I i' I've had this you know amongst my friends you know it's one of the things like people ask a question why do people do this and and and I've had Direct conversation with my friends and you know with a friend I'm very very aggressive with them attacking their walls they put up and and what I tell them is is that you have made your work your God it's who you meet people you eat around where where work is you've learned you've given up learning how to socialize and meet your neighbors all the people you know or some kind of work or work rated you haven't exercised those muscles for years 10 20 30 years right sometimes that people have their whole life revolves around work and all the other muscles and I I'm using muscles as an example have atrop like how do you socialize without a job how do you meet people without a job where do I go eat without my job like I eat obviously somewhere within five miles of this place and people recommend all the things I get recommended the camaraderie everything that you know they when people list what they like about work that used to happen without work right and they've atrii atrophied those muscles so when you take that away they're like they don't know what to do they don't know what they want and their dreams have left them right the ski trip they haven't thought about that or hang out with their buddies or whatever all that stuff has left them and they haven't worked those muscles out and I say listen just let's start working on those muscles and building them up and you'll have plenty to do right you have plenty to do you've let autopilot and habit put you in poor health in these other activities right you're in poor health on how to meet people and socialize outside of work you're in poor health on where to go eat lunch you know except for places near work or wherever you go right you're in poor health on trips that are not business trips right you're in poor health about thinking about what fulfill you and Discovery just plain old Discovery because you don't know what you want you discover what you want nobody comes out of the womb like I don't like onions and I love chocolate and I want to go to Japan and

[00:51:45] I love F1 like you get exposed to it and you discover what you want so a lot of life is Discovery but I think my kids did come out of the womb loving well they didn't have a choice but but but these people are at a discovery they're in the familiar habituated routine they are a rat in a wheel that doesn't even need cheese anymore it just runs in the wheel now how do we differentiate that from people who uh and I would put myself in this category truthfully where you know a big part of their work is their fulfillment and they do feel a sense of purpose in what they do Beyond just the making money part of it correct and I I suspect that like again just to make character of things right so maybe the person who works in the widget

[00:52:36] Factory that makes the widget that they don't even know what the widget plugs into but they need a job like and and if if they you know inherited a big lump sum of money tomorrow they would quit happily quit the widget job right um but maybe they'd get bored and they'd want to go back and start volunteering and doing something where they don't actually get paid but they're really enjoying what they're doing and then of course you have the group of people whose job is doing two things it's providing money for all the things that you need both in approximate sense and distally but also it is a sense of purpose and therefore it fits into their fulfillment but there's but but these things can be very slippery and I would certainly put myself squarely in that category right which is I still work harder than I should and I absolutely know that I'm failing in the equation even though I'm fulfilled by this and I wouldn't want to not do this but I'm doing too much of it as an example yeah

[00:53:33] I I really push back hard of my friends on this and and and the part like I can't know only they can know right like the heroin addict is happy I'm happy on heroin you have you have a problem with my herin I don't have a problem right and that's kind of the argument I push towards them and I say listen really think about what in your job fulfills you and is that outside in the world right and and the purpose in that and do you have balance are you balanced according to what you want in life in this time period in your life and the future time period in your life now I can't tell somebody what their balance is right that's a very personal thing but what I really want them to do is be honest off autopilot really like unplug for a moment and think about it like okay I got one life I only and I have only this period once right I only get to be 50 between 50 and 55 I only get this level of Health at this time is are these the experiences is this really how I want to allocate my time at this period is this really the maximum is this the optimal thing for me to do and if they do that and they come up with the same answer like hey no I want to work at the widget Factory or I want to work at this fulfilling I can't argue that like how how am I gonna who am I to tell you how to live your life what I'm here to tell you is how to optimize your life what thought process and what steps you should go through things you should be considering in order to get the most fulfillment out of your life and then if you come to the conclusion that hey I'm at the perfect balance of work right and the money's piling up but I'm going to use it later and I'm going to go on you know a senior's cruise and that's what it's for then that's your life but maybe you might go you know what I can dial it back and you know my daughters are only going to be or my kids are only going to be this age at this time maybe I should you know take a family trip and unplug and go on Safari with them right and enjoy my success because that's going to give me a lifetime of memory dividends and discussion points and connections

[00:55:26] Etc Etc maybe maybe you know I rather have that time with them now and not have them in a hospital with me when I'm old and stinking can barely you know and seeing me this way I want I want the memories and the time they spend with me doing this and not at the tail end of life who knows right like I just want people thinking about it and if you just get off autopilot just a bit and you start thinking about it you're already optimizing your life you're already going to have a more fulfilling life right well I I think that that's probably the part of the book that most kind of resonates with someone like me which is um especially when it comes to kids right it's that you have and and I have

[00:56:12] I guess the maybe it's an advantage maybe it's a disadvantage but my kids are sort of separated in age by a bit of a gap right so my daughter's 14 and then the boys are five and eight so in other words I now know what it's like to have a teen I Now understand all the things that you kind of give up when your kid's a teenager and and our daughter's an amazing kid but the reality of it is like she doesn't really want to be around me no they didn't want to know you when they become teenagers I didn't want to know my parents when I was teenagers yeah yeah whereas conversely the boys can't leave us alone and it's tempting to sort of say I wish they would just leave us alone but now knowing that oh actually in like 6 years you'll kill to be back back in this situation makes it infinitely more easy to appreciate corre um so that's that's kind of one thing that I think is helpful for people to understand the seasons and this this this idea of seasonality right um like you I I probably think back to things I didn't do for different reasons right so when I was in college I mean I couldn't have worked harder like it's I mean I was out of my mind how hard I worked right um the my night off there was one night which was Friday when I only worked till 900 p.m. it was my break and from 900 p.m. till 11: I would I needed a little bit of you and you need a little bit of me I would I would go and do laundry after 900 p.m. on a Friday that was that was my way to just take a little time off but other than that it was six hours a day of work outside of class and I think of all the things I didn't do in college so first of all my only memories of college are pure I hated every minute of college I didn't have you didn't have have the colge experience yeah yeah now you know I could say well a lot of good came out of that because I did really well and did well that set me up for the next thing and the next thing and the next thing but like I could have traveled right I didn't having a college experience didn't mean I had to get drunk every night no it meant that I could have saved all that money I was making by tutoring and done something different this reminds me of uh you know you know the college paper had this kind of like my senior year I opened up and had the 50 things you need to do before you graduate and I just had the biggest regret when I read that list I was like and and you read it at what age like how much I was like just about on my way out like on my way out like like my life I was like never going to be able to do this I'm not going to do this you know it's like and some of them were simple like write an angry letter to the to newspaper you know go skinny dipping at

[00:58:50] L whatever actually actually did that after I read that you know you know there were there were a lot of things d this college prank do whatever like things that would be fun didn't necessarily cost you money or whatever but like things to do to have a college experience not not necessarily do them all and I was think maybe I did three or four yeah and I was like why was I so on autopilot in my way you know I didn't think about like okay you got four years here get a you know good good grades get study but like you know you want to get this out of it you want to do this out of it you want to have this college experience Etc right we just kind of like don't really think about things go on autopilot so much that we don't think about periods in our life even you know this year what experiences do I want to have this year with this person with myself with my with my spirituality with my health with my my travel my leisure my job you know how am I going to optimize and how does that fit into the jigs sport the Tetris game of my entire life right am I doing it right maybe this experience that I'm saying goes here actually goes further out my life right when I was um trying to get the book published um one of the the uh publisher said I do exactly what you're talking about in the book I really like hiking I have a she she explained she had an injury and she likes walk uh running but now she does like hiking and and she really likes concert and music and she goes on a vacation with a friend every year they pick what they're going to go do and she there's this very expensive Opera that she wants to go see and Etc she said what I and our friend decided is that the hiking trips and you know this mountain Etc going to pull these forward and the sitting in operas and these type of trips the set in trips we going to push forward push push to the push push push it in the future to to you know Max the it's like if they get that order right they get that order wrong right they go all the Opera and then they turn around like holy [ __ ] I can't hike this mountain right and so this this fits in every aspect of your life right

[01:00:51] College you know first job prear married before kids kids that are toddlers not kers not toddlers that type of thinking is really helpful and and you've been lucky experience has taught you about the seasons with your kids right and I learned the hard way too I I was like you know people tell you like oh your kids don't want to be with you're 13 and you're like you kind of forget when you were 13 right like you forget like oh yeah I didn't want to be around my parents and then you know it really hit you when they're just like Dad nobody hangs out with their dad that much come on you know what I mean like yeah one of the other things that you talk about and and you've mentioned it already today a couple times is philanthropy so um there's a story in the book about a woman who dies and leaves a large gift tell that story again yeah so there so there's a woman she she she she it's one of those you know secret millionaire stories right there they're all out there like there's a secretary and then when she died you know she you know she had you know $10 million a tussy roll stock or whatever right like the uh and so this woman was

[01:01:58] I believe a a worked at a law firm um you know saved her money lived a by all by all accounts a very frugal life and then when she died she gave a a multi-million dollar gift to education it was a charitable education and you know everybody was like you know that's so charitable and that's that's that's um um um such a great thing and you know I had a different P perspective right like um I you know my perspective was when you're dead the money isn't yours right and so and also that the the target for her you know her Beque after her death would have been much better off receiving the money much earlier a lower sum much earlier and that the return on her charitable investment would be greater than any of her investment returns right and so you know I can't really uh get into her head to determine if it's charitable like like like I'm knowingly thinking I'm doing the right thing I'm going to to save all this money and it's going to grow to a bigger pile and I'm going to give give it to a charity but but to me it appears to be a tip on the way out right the money's got to go somewhere it was going to go either to the IRS who you know which the government or rist redistribute the money the way they see fit usually into

[01:03:27] Wars and stuff but I I'm g go into that subject right or or or or or or hairs or Etc but it's going somewhere it's not yours right it's it's gone so the fact that it just wound up into this um educational charity you know I I didn't see it as charitable as much and as impactful as just giving the money earlier like life is urgent life is now and I argue that the return on investment in your charitable Endeavors is greater than any return in the market you can get well and this is sort of interesting because you know think about what our mutual friend John Arnold did 10 years ago which was before he even hits the age of 40 that's great he decides I'm no longer going to do this full-time my full-time job is now giving this money away right it was it's it's it's great Sean's great and we've had a lot of conversations about this about like you know making sure the money actually gets distributed got gets gets into the purpose you know the uh helping causes but John decided that I've been solving the problem of natural gas long enough I have more money than I'll ever spend or need and I really want to dedicate my neurons to solving other problems right so he takes an analytical approach a database driven approach to solving some of society's ills and solving some problems and trying to get it inead of some of these intractable problems which is which is awesome and and the fact that he's doing it so young I even argue with John like he did it too late he's still late you know what I mean because he was on autopilot too in my opinion trading right like it's like what are you working for you know like you know like you know

[01:05:14] I had this conversation John's like what's the money for what can't you buy you know and and to a certain extent the money became a detriment you know there's based based on your value system right like if you're like hey and I mentioned this book if like yeah I can have Maroon 5 play in my backyard every day Etc but you don't want to ruin your kids by spending the money and consuming that way and I'm using the Maroon 5 as an ex is like an exaggerated example but like there's all kinds of consumption that you don't want to have because you don't want your kids to have that then the money became a negative right like you really work too L for because you're working for money that you cannot spend you cannot consume right and you could start giving away and having an impact on the other things you want to do now and I think one of the things that John exemplifies is how to give money away thoughtfully correct and what you realize when you spend any length of time with him which you've spent more than I have um it is really hard to give money away strategically and thoughtfully which is why I suspect John and Laura set themselves up with 50 years of a Runway to give yeah and um I don't know there's a pretty good chance they still won't be able to give it all away right well I think I think what they're doing is like effectively giving away right like they they want to solve problems databased decisions like there's there's but it takes time I mean that's the other point you have to you have to invest the time to try something out see if it works if it does double down if it doesn't learn why it doesn't pivot and um you know you can't do that if you say look at the end of my life I'm going to give away a billion dollars no like it won't be effective so there there's a double issue here there's the issue you already said which is the compounding issue right no if you give a billion dollars away in 50 years versus giving away half a billion dollars or you know a hundred million dollar 30 years sooner that you that money will do more good but there's another layer to that which is you have a chance to learn from what that money did and make Corrections that themselves allow for more thoughtful giving yeah they're they're immediately jumping into the problem and let the experiments run the course and they have the time to do it so and they they're doing it you know I can't say enough about the Laura and John Arnold

[01:07:38] Foundation about the way they're going in and helping people and solving problems but the other thing that you talked about in the book that really probably this is probably the reason I had my wife read it um right away was the idea of you know we sometimes think that there are people in our lives that we want to give money to at some point you know and you sort of think like God this you know that's a person that was you know really important in my life or in our lives and you know maybe we leave them x amount of dollars at some point right and then you sort of realize well why don't you finish why that's maybe not necessarily the right strategy so so the the the the same laws of physics that govern my body and the utility of money over time for me applies to my kids right maybe they have a little bit longer lifespan or health span or relatives or anybody else relatives or anybody anybody right like the utility of money to them follows a curve right depending on how healthy they are Etc you can just kind of draw it right like you know better than I muscle Decay rates for people in shape not in shape working out you know Etc so this curve applies to them so you know a lot of people like oh when I die

[01:08:53] I'm going to give you know I I used to have people on my will that are like close to my age right like I'm going to give money to them when I die and I'm like wait a minute let me give my money to a 72y old like wouldn't it be better if I gave them less money now like let them spend it and apply it because the the the utility of money for them is drastic right like the day before you die I cannot pay you anything I cannot get you to delay gratification right that's what savings is right you're delaying gratification right and so like there is no gratification the next day right and so like if you take it from the day before you die two days before you die to right now right there's this curve right this this this this compensation you need for delay gratification and it makes no sense for me to be leaving money to 65 year olds and 62 year olds it's give it to them where the money has the most impact right where they have the most utility of that money and so when you're off autopilot and think yeah that's what everybody does they write down a will and when they die Etc now the will has a purpose if you die early you got to distribute the money but really before you die if you live a normal a normal life there should be nothing left to give you should have already given it away again when I read your book and you articulate it that way it's such I mean it's such a gut punch of this realization um and one example is kids right but I but I I you know I I think like my wife and I have people in our lives that we're not related to that we value so much and we we've always said like yeah you know like we want to give them X number of dollars at this point in time i' I've had that I had a I had a I had a good year and you know I there was people that I would you know give money to if I had a good year or I'm not going to wait till I'm dead that or there people in my will and I just went down a list and you know the the maximum taxfree gift you can give per year per person is $115,000 and I had a I think a 30 to 50 person list of $155,000 to to to give to people right because I was like I need to apply and this was me reading my own book right like so a lot of people like why'd you write the book well I wrote it to save my own life right I I don't want one waste my life I want to get the most n fulfillment and after I wrote the book and I you know mainly I talk about children but I thought about that applies to everybody right if I'm going to do something nice and give something or leave something to somebody it's like it's now yeah absolutely it's right now well especially when you think about exactly what you said which is that person will do much more with that in applying it to their fulfillment curve correct in in real time right because when you when you when you're really giving somebody money right you're giving them Life Energy you're giving them ability to make choices right like you you're giving them fulfillment right so you know waiting till they're 96 on the deathbed right they can't really convert that into fulfillment you really didn't give them what you wanted to give them right so when you look at their their curve of their life right like wa oh wow here's the maximum insertion point and as a matter of fact wow $5,000 right now at let's say 33 is like 150,000 at like 86 you know yep absolutely actually more more impactful right there's more going in life more choices things going on and then the cumulative effect the fact that when they have that experience not only do they enjoy that experience at that point whatever that experience is they get dividends from that experience right they talk about with their friends they become more interesting they recall that and they get enjoyment out of it's like oh remember that ski trip we went on we had a great time with the kids yeah that was great they get fulfilled from that so they get memory dividends Associated from that experience whereas if you give it to a '96 they do it once they consume it if they can even do it and then they die right how do you help a person do the math because we've talked about this quite a bit and you've alluded to it there is really a curve and um you know this is where both your background uh primarily is an engineer and a Trader come into solving what becomes a mathematical set of equations right where you have certain variables you need to understand right so you if you're if you're so let's say we're solving this for for me or for you or you know an arbitrary person who's sitting here who's 50 years old okay so 50y old person is listening to this or 30-y old person I mean we should do it maybe we do a few different scenarios so let's start with the with the kind of 50-year-old who is firmly planted on the treadmill of autopilot okay so they're their kids are in you know middle school and high school they're I mean they realize how much money they need for college for their kids they've got a mortgage payment they've got a good job um and they have a fuzzy notion that they're going to work another 15 to 20 years and they come to you and they say bill um I read the book I buy the thesis

[01:14:13] I don't know how to implement it for my numbers and for my fulfillment curve how do you help them think mean the main the main thing is is it's very individual right it's like what do you want like if if you're if you if you're sitting there like I just like working and going in and that's all I do no okay so I'll be the guy so I'm going to say uh you be the guy yeah so so Bill no I I um I do have interests but I got to be honest with you man I've backed away from them you know I've kind of let them go I've let myself go a little bit um so I before my wife and I had kids we loved traveling uh and before our kids were born we we hiked the entire rim of the

[01:14:47] Grand Canyon we went down to the Colorado River back up probably the greatest thing we ever did and then once the kids came we were kind of head down in work and I just want to make sure that my kids don't have debt when they go to college so what what I what I do is is like okay will your kids have win in debt I I get what's reality and what's what's what's uh you know just fear fear-based thinking okay right so we try and get on that and one of the things I'd look for is like why don't you go traveling with the kids and you're like well it's a pain in the ass whatever I was like well no it's also so expensive bill I mean you understand what it cost now I mean right now if we wanted to take I mean you know one of my kids has a friend who did this African safari a year ago they said it was amazing but I you know to price that trip bill today $330,000 to go do that

[01:15:32] African safari now with the with the airlines with the Safari I mean it's that's a lot of money so what I say is is when you die like will you have $30,000 or you in trct to die with $30,000 $50,000 yeah I hope so okay so then would you rather consume that $30,000 now or and and have this experience with your kids Etc or would you rather have $30,000 left over when you die I just want to be safe I mean how do I know what wrong so then what then you know we can sit down and go down the hard numbers is like do you have insurance if you lose your job what is safe what do you need what do you

[01:16:10] Invision yourself doing in retirement that you can't afford right what what bad thing that will happen that we can't buy an insurance policy for is it long-term care insurance you know if you get that while you're young it's actually pretty cheap it's very cheap right you know I I look at what risk they're they're having and I look at ways to mitigate them right so a lot of people who are conservative like oh I'm worried about something happening I'm like What's the something happening that you're worried about right and when when you do that with people Bill how often are they able to articulate clearly what they're afraid of versus it being kind of just a fuzzy notion of a lot of it's fuzzy notion and we just keep pushing pulling it out what if this happens what if I get sick what if whatever right like we go over like medical insurance like then it's worth basically what happens is people try to act as their own insurance agent with a client of one right that's very difficult to underwrite right so so so they have a client of one they really don't understand the odds of the bad things happening right and so what they tend to do is put it this big giant fear bucket of insurance premium and they just work and save and save and save to think that they have the notional to cover all these bad things happening and and a lot of times I'll point out two things I go one um some of these bad things that you're saving for you'll never get the notional right you get some you know maybe you will or whatever but most of the people I talked to I was like do you know it was like $225,000 a night for my dad in the hospital like if Insurance didn't cover that gz though doesn't matter right like

[01:17:55] I'm not you know what I mean he's only got X days right like you're not you're not saving some of these things are like you shouldn't be the insurer right if you're actually afraid of that and that's important to you you need to buy the insurance policy where they have the lower large numbers and their Edge is 6% or 8% you're are going to be woefully inefficient and on top of that you don't even know the odds like some of these things are like you know robot alien space Insurance like wait you're worried about this you know what I mean like and then I also like to do you know a comparison like okay here's the risk of this scenario happening and this bad thing happening and it's bad right we accept it and here's the risk of you not doing the thing that you want to do now right here's the risk of you not doing the trip like what does that look like on your deathbed when you know you couldn't have gone on the Safari and had this wonderful time with your kids and and connected with them and something to talk about forever and expanded your world view you was it worth the $30,000 was it worth the insurance policy that you're trying to was it worth you trying to play insurance agent and so the lot of these are thematic conversations they're not like hard number conversations right but you have a model yeah yeah we have a model but but the problem with the model is it's an abstraction right the variables we're talking about are infinite yep right and we have to abstract and abstract and

[01:19:18] Abstract so what the model does it really tells you the direction and it's very good on the direction but the the magnitude it may be off right and so for you as a person it's like what's your survival number we have that model like really think about like okay just survival not I'm hanging out yeah not thriving but surviving what do you need then after that right it's all your choices right and depending on who you are right because there's infinite choices and what those choices will cost and the experiences you want to have your in your life plus the discovery the you know 20 to 30% uh discovery you know maybe all your experiences go in the 50 bucket right you didn't realize it and you're actually inadvertently pushing them in the 70 bucket and you're not going to have them and so that's kind of what I try and get people to do I was like are you going to have $3,000 trips in your lifetime and they'll go yes when is the optimal time for you to have $30,000 trips and with whom right if you're ever if you're never going to have a $30,000 trip I'm like okay let's think of a different type of activity that you can do that doesn't come that will get you the same fulfillment or close to it that's not a $30,000 right I mean to me that's the interesting distinction right it's like maybe somebody listening to this says are you freaking crazy like I'll never take a $30,000 trip ever ever my life yeah the bigger point is is there a trip that you think you will take near the end of your life and you're holding back on taking it now I mean to me that is one of the big aha insights from this philosophy and if you're you're you're in that thing well I'm I'm saving because of just in case it's like guy you're not the best insurance agent you're actually the worst insurance agent you don't know the odds you can never have the notional and the the the edge the premium that you're extracting from yourself and that edge is your own life right like you have to give up hours of your life to have this insurance premium is way way more than just paying the insurance company right so people worry about running out of money I'm like get an annuity you're worried about Long-Term Care Health uh long-term health and what if I'm sick and I can't move and I need nurses get long-term care insurance it's really cheap when you start early it's really it's surprisingly cheap you know what about this like there's an insurance product for a lot of things people are like quote unquote saving or worried for

[01:21:37] ETC and I'm like let's mitigate the risk with the professionals let's get you living your life so how do you get through to somebody when you confront perhaps an even more illogical problem because the problem that we just discussed is actually quite logical like it's easy to understand why a person would think I have to save for a rainy day right that's that's been pretty ingrained into a responsible person to me there's a far less logical reason that people foro doing things when they're young and by Young I mean kind of like middleaged like in their working right now it young is right now yeah and it's because they're so busy making money yeah so so this is probably the one that's the rat in the wheel with no cheese right like you know they got habituated that's right they got a habituated like you take a rat you you know get him to run the wheel you give them the cheese you give them to run the wheel to do the cheese and pretty soon you don't even have to give them the cheese they see the wheel they just start running right and and and the reward is no longer the goal it's just to do the thing right it's to do the thing and so how do you help somebody break that that that is the hardest one to break because they've been uh brainwashed into thinking that this is what I want to do and it's one of the hardest things to extract somebody from and so I have to explain to them like where do you socialize you know we just go through it like where do you eat where do you eat lunch well I like the people at work and like hanging out you know I get I get this like I don't want to quit work I like hanging out with the people I'm like you can quit work and take the people on a trip with you you can vacation with them you can still visit them at night and play Bingo games like the people don't go away just because you don't show up at work you can still spend time and you can actually spend more quality time with the people at work if you exercise that muscle but they don't know how to invite people over their house or hey we're going to go see the Chris Rock show tonight which I'm gonna go do is Chris

[01:23:35] Rock in town tonight or is in Houston no here in Austin tonight I didn't even know see there you go a new experience you might have but anyway like they don't know how to do that right and so I I try and like it's a very long conversation like you can do this you can do that you can actually everything that you're getting out of work that social benefit all these little excuses the mental stimulation I'm like you know

[01:23:57] John was like these real life problems are more mentally stimulating than than the natural gas puzzle I still like the natural gas puzzle but these are more mentally stimulating more purposeful more fulfilling to me right and so I have to break down Brick by Brick right how and show them how they got habituated and how they haven't exercise these other muscles and how they can replace it and realize it's not work is not the unique thing to get the things you're getting out of work right it's actually a bastardization of it it's minimizing those experience you're not actually getting the most quality time with your co-workers in the working environment you're actually not getting the most mental uh exercise that's not necessarily the best mental exercise for you in the work environment right it's just you know nothing else because you've been stuck in this lab running on this type of wheel you know yeah and it's really hard because people will be extremely extremely resistant right like change is painful right if you don't if you if you if you get somebody who hasn't worked out forever and you're like hey let's go in the gym we're going to work out it's like oh God why am I here I don't like this you know what I mean like just to develop the muscle to do the thing to play the tennis the F filming thing it's it's a process right and and and you know you have to show them the reward that life is Rich it's fat it's um it is one of the biggest cliches ever which is the person on their deathbed who says I wish I didn't work so hard and yet we all know this cliche and yet many of us still work too hard habits are powerful like one of the things I took away from like you know the Habit books like tiny habits by BJ fog uh is a great book is that they're powerful they're extremely powerful and so we have we get habituated in many different ways right for for or bad right like if you if you have the snacks in your house and you eat 200 calories a day you know and you know two years you're like 40 lbs heavier right 200 extra calories right like how did that happen right you know how did I forget you know how did my life pass me by how did I not go on these trips how did I not have these experience how did I not call my mother how did I not say I love you to these people even pick up the phone because my habits took over right they took over towards this purpose and it just absorbed my life and so um um you know I I you know outside the book with my friends you know I really um talk about you know the good of habits right you can form good habits that keep you healthy but some of the habits you know the consequences of some of our habits to be successful and how it takes away from other things right and so so how has that been a struggle for you oh yes I wrote that book for me I wrote it to save my life people think I didn't you know the first life I wanted to save was my own put your life mask on first you know I am just as guilty as the next person is being on autopilot I constantly have to remind myself that

[01:27:02] I'm going to die that life isn't forever this period ends these Seasons with my daughter's in these Seasons it it with my startups and all these things and I have to think about like how what do I want how do I balance them what's optimized right and I don't get it exactly right but I do it better than if

[01:27:18] I was just completely on autopilot and then sometimes I I was like oh [ __ ] I was on autopilot why didn't I think about this you know um and what do you use to help jar you out of autopilot on these things I mean the the the first macro thing is is the death clock or right now I have this this this calendar up and it's it's it's uh 4,000 weeks and you mark off each week and it's a very viseral uh representation about like life is finite you know this period not only will you you know die somewhere around here but this period is going to end right and and a lot of times when people go on vacation right knowing that the vacation ends on Friday snaps you up you're like oh [ __ ] I'm G to go here and do this and I'm going to stay out and you know we only have a couple days so let's do the cafe and let's you know do

[01:28:09] XYZ and you actually get more out of the trip knowing it's going to end as opposed to living obliviously you know and all of a sudden time to go wait it's time to go I forgot to do this or go see the Eiffel Tower or go whatever it is on your trip and so same way with life when when when you know life is going to end it becomes more urgent right and even even the segment in your life when you know you know your early 50s are going to end you're like it becomes more urgent you become more deliberate you get off autopilot so that's the first layer the of of of of so each week you do check off a box each I check off now I've been nsing and traveling but when I come back

[01:28:46] I see it I see it's in my closet so I walk by it every day it's a constant reminder right where'd you get this calendar by the way I online it was like some sort of stoic Reflections out there a momento myy remember death you know and so I saw it and I I used to have it on my phone it used to count down backwards to my estimated death date uh that that that app no longer works but the the the the seeing at every time you know is is is great you know if they get if I get another widget that counts down

[01:29:15] I'll have both of them right and I used to do it for other things like till Christmas till your daughter's 14 till till till the job the 15 year anniversary right it's like wow my daughter's going to be you know 16 she's going to be driving what how am I going to pry experiences out of my daughter because your daughters don't want to know you right before she's really gone right she gets a car and she's see you

[01:29:37] Deuces you know that that type of thing so that really helps me you know it gives me kind of an alarm that wakes me up out of autopilot right and then and and and that's the thing I personally use how do you help somebody think about when they're net worth should Peak because a a clear uh implication of everything we're talking about is net worth probably needs to Peak a lot sooner than it currently does as you said I think the default for most working people is that net worth Peaks sometime after retirement or certainly around the time of retirement even if they're thinking about drawing down but again for most people given the age of retirement there's a a mismatch between when they're hitting Peak net worth and when they're hitting Peak capacity to utilize net worth this is a massive it's a massive Mis mismatch you know I you know one of the things I wanted to do and and I I wish I knew you back then because you could have you could have helped me is I was like I wanted to know about all these Frailty curves like bone density lung capacity what activities yeah become less enjoyable first and then unable to do right because that determines a lot when your net wor should Peak so I I estimated it's somewhere in your 50s wow right like like and the data kind of shows that like when I when I went to St Petersburg and climbed the 20 I think it was 11 steps to walk around the banister there all these tour buses coming in St

[01:31:09] Petersburg Asian whatever not one person over those tour buses that was elderly climbed the 2011 steps so St Petersburg was a different St Petersburg for them they didn't have the same experience I got more out of St Petersburg for them now not saying it wasn't a wonderful trip and a nice trip for them but they probably pushed St Petersburg too late in life yep and so you know there's so much hidden data and data out there in reports if you read it where you know we talked about it earlier like trying to get people to spend their money down right and one of the things answers I give you know they say well why do you think people are still their net worth is still going up into 72 and you know part of it is you know asset appreciation and going faster than they can spend it but the real answer is they can't yeah they cannot spend it down life has passed them by they no longer have the attitude or aptitude you know to do this like they they can't do it you you'd be surprised how many people die on those cruise ships trying to swim when they get to St

[01:32:18] Thomas it's it's it's you know it's I'm going to do this and you know they think their life's going to be like a carnival commercial and I'm like that carnivore commercial will kill most Americans right they're having heart attacks going down those slides right yeah and so um and that of course just speaks to the imbalance between the three variables it's like if you spent a little bit more of your time on your health you would buy yourself a bigger

[01:32:44] Runway to utilize your wealth on the experiences so particularly for Americans like this book my book is most successful in Japan which is which is strange yeah say why um I I think one you know you I I believe you'll get value out of this book in the way of thinking even if you have zero wealth but Japan has a savings problem problem like you know Japan saves save saves then they die and they give the money to the Next Generation they save save save and I'm just like well what generation actually has fun right so I'm really counter to the culture there right we here you know one of criticisms of the book will be like well there's so many people have zero and trying to make ends meet I'm like I get it they can still get value out of this about getting the tetris of their life right but maybe you know a wealth building book or like how to make dollars book might be you know more useful to them at this time in their life right and Japan it's the opposite and also Japan Japanese um they're healthier like and they're healthier longer yes if you walk around Japan like old people around you know it's an older Country but they're around they're moving they're doing things they're having activities Etc they're doing they're enjoying the life for Americans um looking at you know the Obesity epidemic and and and and the lifestyle of

[01:34:01] Americans that that their ability to consume experience is way deteriorates way way faster and way earlier than than say the Japanese let's go back to risk again you uh we were talking before about how uh what's the Mantra of the energy Trader or the gas Trader yeah yeah yeah uh the name of the game is is to stay in the game right like sort of like Simon s's book The Infinite game right it's not about winning it's about being able to keep playing over and over and over again so inherent in that is never making a bet or a trade that can completely wipe you out and take you out of the game it it I mean by nature of the business even the smallest position can can can take you out of the game it's really about taking prudent risk reward and then stopping out when you can right life is risk right you can get hit by a bus a meteor can hit you you know you can get some sort of crazy infectious disease like you can get a bum deal right just going out but you're not going to live in a bubble you're going to take calculated risk so in trading you the the the we're optimizing for profits right you're going to take risks that in a tail Scarrow can blow you out the key is taking prudent risk-reward decisions right like you know I don't smoke it's not a it's not it's not the rewards not great enough I did go skydiving the first time the reward was great the second time it was half is great I didn't do it the third time because the risk was the same and the reward wasn't right the reward was going down and the risk was still the same yeah and so this is the same thing in trading right like you we we look at everything on a risk-reward basis and and the likelihood of dying right and if things go orai can we get out right have

[01:35:41] I sized my position can I get out is the liquidity there and all these things are going on all the time right you have to how do you think about that in a person's life I mean I like the example of skydiving how do you think about this now in terms of the seasons of the person's life where are there are there certain Seasons where certain risks make sense um be it Financial risks or I'll give you I'll give you a great example of physical risk yeah okay so I have a a cartilage disappearing in L3 L4 right bones are hitting each other so I'm they

[01:36:13] I'm I'm Vis against doing impact things and I was 50 years old in the islands and guys were goingon to go wakeboarding I was like I don't want to go I don't want to go I'm going to hang out on the beach I'm going to Loaf and I thought about it for a second I said I don't have many wakeboarding times left like I'm not going wakeboarding at 60 right I have a

[01:36:37] I have this degener of back thing you know caros you know it's going to be more dangerous for me Etc if I am to wakeboard it has to be now it is now it is in this time period and then I thought okay it's in this time period I'm like okay how many times I'm going go going to be in warm water with my buddies where there's a wakeboarding boat ready to go in the next two years I don't know this is it I don't foresee it happening you know like I could make a special effort for it but like it's just there in my lap and I don't have something else to do Etc and

[01:37:13] I was like I'm going to go weight boarding this is probably the last time I'm going to go whiteboarding that was the last time I went wakeboarding how much did it hurt it didn't hurt it didn't hurt I actually jumped the Wake too I made a nice jump of the wake I said I'm going to send it I sent it you know it didn't hurt that much it wasn't like that but afterwards like there was a little tension in my back Etc and you know stretching and trying to like you know but like I was very conscious like okay I got to be you know careful right coming across it and now I wake surf right like I do the low impact version of the sport which I absolutely love uh until you know there's some tech technique to like put cartilage in my back and R strengthen my back I you know I'm waiting for the technology to catch up so maybe I'll get my back back but right now it's the last time on my way wakeboarding you know that was the risk was worth the reward there was no other time that I'm you know now as I get older wakeboarding is much more dangerous right and so I've gone to a sport where the speed of the sport you know a lot of people think you know well um you know if you're going 10 miles per hour versus 12 mil per hour it's only 2 miles per hour difference but it's a 44% difference in force right because Force equals MV and so you know people don't realize that well I I'm I'm acutely aware of it and and I'm like okay I want to be in a something I can get fulfilled where the the risk is not as great right and so I

[01:38:37] I have a 44% reduction in you know Force which is great you know great for me when I fall so what year was it that you had that incredible birthday gosh uh I'm pretty sure it's 40 right but I've had incredible birthday since then but like the one in the book is 45 I'm pretty sure it's 45 I think it's I think it well how about this uh it was 2008 run around 2008 okay no no no there was the second one I had two birthday parties it was 45 45 let's say 45 all right so at the time you spend a lot of money was it for you enough money that you were like am I crazy doing this like did you have second thoughts about it I I had second thought like you know the the events and the things I was planning remind me what was the it was down in the oh so so so I

[01:39:32] I I I I I went to St Barts I love St Barts it's it's where I had my honeymoon it's a great Island I think it's one of the best islands in the Caribbean um I I obviously not everybody can go to St Bor and you know I tell people that become successful um you either get new friends or you scholarship your friends right because you you want to do experiences a lot of times a lot of people want to do shared experiences right they want their friends to come they can't afford to just pop up and spend thousands of dollars to go to St BS or do XY andz when you're you know and it happens in various levels of success right whether it's on a trip to Chicago you know or super like I can't do that you know like some people can and can't and so as you become successful you know one of the experiences you want to have is to be r on your friends and have shared experience with your friends and so I I

[01:40:26] I coach people I say you have to lose this attachment that they have to pay right or they need to pay or whatever like you have to think what's the most important to you get off autopilot it's a half shared experiences and is it worth it for you to have them around for me I've had good friends throughout the years it's it's it's unequivocal yes right friends and family so but it gets expensive right and you have this you know you got to R out the hotel rooms

[01:40:54] Etc and entertainment and plan this thing but I was like some of these people you know they have their own lives and own complications and and and conflicts you won't get the time to do with it uh some of these people won't be alive right may or may not be alive you may drift apart this is this is the time right I want to do this and so as I was you know adding these people in and and having my mother down and and all this stuff I had just like a Heavenly experience you know like walking on the beach my mom's coming out of her beach house my friends are hanging on the balcony looking down it's beautiful the birds are out Etc and hi all the people I love and we're going to do this fun activity we're going to listen to music Etc you know I imagine that that's what Heavens is like right like you're just just having this experience and what I did was I convert you know I realized that that's what I was working for I was working to create these experiences these are the things that fulfill me right when I was planning it it's like oh [ __ ] this's a lot of goddamn money you know what I mean like what am I going to do is am I doing the right allocation right like you never know if you get it exactly right right nobody gets it perfectly balanced but this is the right direction right you know it reminds me of something um so when my wife and I got married in 2004 [Music] um it was I remember um looking so you know we got married at a golf club you know we did we did have two nickel strub together right so it was like I think the the wedding the ceremony the reception we all at the same place the whole thing cost less than $20,000 but it was obscene amount of money for us at the time right and um and it was amazing because everybody we actually cared about in our lives was there we were really fortunate that hey almost everybody could make it who we invited right and you know there were almost 200 people there so at one point

[01:42:54] I I grabbed my wife and um we we kind of walked out onto a balcony and could see everybody and I said do you realize that this is one of only two times in our life that we will be surrounded by everyone who's meaningful to us uh who's alive and the only other time it's going to occur we're going to be dead we'll be in the castle we'll be at our funeral correct so we got to really take this in yeah and I I realized now there was a there was a huge error in my logic which was that was totally untrue that didn't have to be true at all you can create it you can create that any time you want right you can decide for no reason I want to bring everybody in my life who matters for a birthday party to a to a it could be a birthday party it could be just a party correct could most of my life is is finding excuses to throw parties you know we get we we autopilot waiting for certain events like weddings or funerals or or or special special anniversaries or things like that we autopilot like oh that's when we get together right so we we we allow autopilot to dictate when we do these things instead of thinking hey I really want to hang out with so and so so and so and so and so let me design a trip or let me have a bowling alley or something it could be lowc cost it be like let me have a picnic whiffle ball game talking [ __ ] you know one of the things I I want to do which I guess the startup cost will be will be something expensive but like I'm getting some laser tag guns and

[01:44:23] I put it in my group I have this group called cool awesome people I'll put you in it if you want to be in it and I'm like it's on I'm going to get laser tag out bestass laser tag things and we're there's going to be some Seward and everybody's like yes you know what I mean like I'm creating this experience like yeah I'm gonna kick some ass on laser tag right and [ __ ] talk but I'm also going to connect and have a good time with people right and I could do that once I put the initial cost we could do that all the time right we can have a league we can have do all kinds of things and it's like you know it doesn't have to be laser tag it could be whiffle ball at the park you can have a whiffle ball league low low low cost you know Dollar Store pick up a pick up a whiffle ball bat and then you're you know you're creating memories and somebody brings sandwiches and you can do that right and that's getting off autopilot so I'm sorry to interrupt you about but but you you really hit the nail on the head about that it's like design your life think about what you want out of it and make it happen now let me ask you a question at that birthday party when you're 45 how many people were there we took out the taiwana hotel and some of the other one 80 80 100 something and how much time did you get to spend with each person there we were there for a week so

[01:45:37] I got to spend time whoever wanted to spend time with me they got to spend time with me um some people you know I have this thing this is just me I don't I don't know this isn't like coaching some people I want their presentence but not saying anything just I know you're okay I get to see you being happy maybe I don't talk to you as much but I get to enjoy you enjoying yourself that's one of my favorite things at a party when I throw a party they're like are you having a good time it's crazy whatever I'm like I'm having the best I'm watching the best [ __ ] movie of my life right now I am in an immersive theater of people I love doing the thing they want to do now I'm kind of antisocial like I don't like to talk that much to people like I get awkward sometimes you know what I mean sometimes

[01:46:20] I grab my my wife and I'm like talk for me talk for me I'll go to a part party and I'll be like you got to talk for me babe I can't take it I can talk to a million people no problems the stadium or whatever but it sometimes I get awkward but what I really really do enjoy and what really fulfills me is watching people I love have a good time yeah so so that's funny that's you know

[01:46:39] I think after my wife read the book that was one of her first thoughts which is I've never had a birthday party uh so last birthday party I had was I was seven years old and after that I just decided I never wanted to have a party and I never have and she's like look I really want you know I know how much you are obsessed with your friends and how much you share with them individually but wouldn't it be great for everybody to be Under One Roof for you know your birthday and I'm resisting it to to know and she's she'd never throw a surprise party for me she knows that would just kill me so she won't do that but she's really negotiating with me to sort of have a party and my view is like it won't be enjoyable for me because I'll be the center of attention and I'll feel an obligation to give everybody the same amount of attention whereas like having dinner with five friends is infinitely more enjoyable right so I'm trying to balance her it's just a different experience like yeah yeah but I guess what bums me out is like I feel like I wouldn't even know how to appreciate a party yeah I mean I

[01:47:50] I get that like I walk around and I just really enjoy people meeting and socializing and connecting like at my wedding people like you know they're friends that didn't know each other and they're like they're great like you know great people of course I do like you find somebody's great love you keep them close by I don't care if you dated them or whatever like you keep them close man like the people that Vibe with you is very important to me and me seeing them succeed I'm I'm a person that rootes for people to hit the long ball like I'm not a hater I'm a natural like I hope you crush it I hope you become a trillionaire I hope you whatever it is right and so seeing people at a party and like you know I like that there were parties and and make people have fun and create environments for them loosen up enjoy each other have a good time and and watching that success and watching them interact is enjoyable for me even though I might be just sitting there smiling right like not really talking so so you you can enjoy a party as much if you're the host or it's your birthday as if you're at somebody's party I you know it depends it's not always the same because you know you gotta solve problems someone can't get in the The

[01:48:54] Ice Maker's broken whatever like there there's that type of things but yeah I I I rather watch that movie than go to the movies I'd rather be in that immersive theater than um you know mckitrick hotel and in in sleep no more in New York which is an immersive theater that's the best theater right and even so what I only got to have a small conversation whatever like the feedback there was like I met this person we had a great time it was awesome like very fulfilling to me very fulfilling to me what year did you finish writing die with zero let's see it had to be it it's supposed to come out in 2020 so it's probably 2019 2019 so 2019 in the in the three years is since you've written the book yeah um has your thinking changed in anything have you evolved are you more nuanced in anything that you wrote about um I'm more I'm you know it's kind of like when you write a formula um you know and it's not like I like came up with this formula this life cycle hypothesis thing which is basically the book right this counterfactual regret minimization algorithm and I'm solving for net fulfillment it's not as if these ideas weren't out there right like I always say like anybody could have like just thought about it and wrote this book it's it's it's how I present it so that it hits the whitest audience and so that it hits them viscerally so they actually apply it right and so I think about it deeper and deeper layers of it right and sometimes I go deep into the subcategory because I use these variables wealth health and time and I'm like what's the maximum level of Health I should be there's tons of Health books out there right tons of Health like I'm not writing a health book but I'm like how can I optimize this right how these two interplay the time and health how much time do I really want to spend on a pelaton how much time do I really want to like regimented eating all the time and being a pain in the ass you know how or and how much time how many chocolate chip cookies do I want to eat before I die right and just suffer like you know

[01:51:00] I I have to think about that like if dying one year early means uh you know living one more year but I don't get any chocolate chip cookies I'll take the chocolate chip cookies I want a fulfilling life like thinking deeply about these things you know that's kind of a cartoon version of it but you know and I hear other people think about like I wrote the basic macro formula but there's like you know it's very fulfilling to see other people like they've set up spreadsheets like this is how you die this is the optimal way would die with zero they've done it better than me right these these financial planners and they built these spreadsheets and your returns and these are the things you like to do Etc it's a you know I'm like this is great you know so they've taken the ball and run with it and I've taken the ball a little bit and run with it a little bit myself and the way I'm applying it mainly is um more socially more more of these things like uh you know at my wedding I said to somebody I said probably no one in this room will see each other more than 50 times and most of us will probably only see us 20 times in the times of our lives right you know how many people were this is the recent wedding 117 117 117 and um and so you know that's that's you know kind of hit people they're like yeah you're kind of right like I I put the over under at the max at like 50 for any any pair that's not you know married obviously and and and and probably 20 and so then that that made me think like I don't that made me think I don't want 20 I'm gonna throw parties like my whole I've taken throwing parties and social things very seriously because I thought about what fulfills me so the last party I had which you were invited but you didn't come I was throwing a party that night you were throwing a party that night at F1 yep um

[01:52:51] I went all out I'm like this is this is this is this is what this is what I'm going to work for to have these types of experience like there's other things right but this is in the category in the top of the category socializing seeing my friends happy having a good time Etc travel is a big one charity is another big one you know my kids money is their money it's not my money it's in a trust it's already taken care of they'll get their money turned over when somewhere between 25 26 and 33 right because that's the optimal time for them right when they're mentally mature and at physical maturity you know not in Decline and how much will you talk with them about you know what you think or don't think they should do with that money is that one of those things where you feel it is your responsibility to say absolutely nothing and let them figure it out on their own or do you feel like you I I want to give him a road map you know I want to teach him that it's a tool right A lot of people one of the biggest mistakes they they make is is assigning some sort of good or bad to money or what it is ETC it's it's not money that's good or bad in in the Bible it's the love of money that is good or bad right and you know I I I use this analogy I you say like money is a tool much like a hammer and saw and nails and rail guns right do hamon sols build houses no you need to know how to use those tools people build those houses right so do does does uh money make you happy no but if you know how to use the tool of money it can make you happy right or it can make you miserable so some people you give Hammers and saws they build a house they build canoes there wonderful things you're like how the hell did you build this right some people get H in SS and they're just sitting there they cut their arm off right and so what I'm trying to do is not tell my kids what they should do but teach them how to use the tools now once they know how to use the tools if they decide to build houses or canoes or cut their arms off that's up to them right but I want to make sure that I gave them the instruction manual and and got them a a little bit proficient on how to use the tools and that's it then then then my job is done right like I have so many friends that try and control people from the grave that use the money as a control mechanism and you know I'm very big on like that's my dream my dreams are my dreams my dad always tried to get me to be an attorney get the hell out of here I'm never doing that right uh but but you know you try and push your dream dreams on to your kids and you know I want you to be a doctor I want you to be this I want you to be that whatever and that's not necessarily what they want to do they have their own life and it's their adventure and what I want to do is set them up to with the tools to choose their own adventure now I might not agree with that Adventure I probably won't because I come from a different era and a different culture and all kinds of things right but I will be rest assured and happy that if they're fulfilled great well bill I want to thank you very much for writing this book Because as I said at the outset it really is um one of a handful of books that has caused me to rethink a lot of what I've been doing how I've been thinking about uh the the problem of optimizing these variables and I and I'm I'm really confident that people are going to pick this book up and and and find similar value at least in magnitude they might find different things that speak to them more or less than me but I believe that from a from a from a veillance and magnitude perspective people will uh across the board find this valuable so so thanks so much for for writing it and also for coming today thanks that's great feedback I mean you don't you don't write books to get rich right you write books to get your point across and for me um you know I see it as saving lives right and a lot of people like uh you know I've said this before they're like what do you mean saving lives Perkins you're [ __ ] crazy like what do you mean saving lives you're not saving lives and I'm like well listen when when when somebody's drowning in in the river right or lake Lake Austin you pull them out you mouth the mouth and you see save their lives guess what they're still going to [ __ ] die just not that day right so what did you do when you save their life by pulling them out of the river you've given them more choices more experience more life right so when you read my book and you get off autopilot and you get more choices more experience more life isn't it the same at least in my mind it is and that's the way that's what motivates me and so when you say it had an impact in you and you're going to you know have a more fulfilling life I I'm it's like I [ __ ] did it you know I mean I feel very happy so I appreciate it I I I I I think the the example you gave there is is a great one and I would agree with you completely because I too fall in the camp despite my profession uh of believing we are all absolutely going to die and in relatively short order and therefore um anything that changes our experiential existence for the better is part of living yeah so thank you thanks for having me it's been great [Music]
