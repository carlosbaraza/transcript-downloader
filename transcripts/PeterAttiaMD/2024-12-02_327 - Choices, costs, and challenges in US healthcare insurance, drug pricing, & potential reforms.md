## Transcript

[00:00:00] I think that you know if you look at the concept of insurance I mean insurance is for random infrequent and unpredictable events okay and when the primary role of insurance was to prevent catastrophic loss if you had a heart attack or you had an accident or you an appendicitis or yes or you had a cancer which back in those days was less of a chronic disease the concept of insurance made some sense right now if you look at what drives expenditures from a health status standpoint it's a lot of chronic illness and in many cases it's multiple chronic illness you know we'll get into obesity diabetes heart disease lung disease even you know uh the innovation in HIV care in this country AIDS has become a chronic disease cancer is becoming more of a chronic disease we try to ensure somewhat uninsurable events right you don't wake up every morning and think oh I've got car insurance let me go figure out how to use my car insurance to get oil change but when we think about we're going to go to the doctor to get a preventative checkup or refill my regular diabetes medicine which I'm going to be on for the rest of my life we think insurance but it's not really an insurable event insurance today is a discount card it's not Insurance in healthcare like Insurance traditionally would be in other parts of your life where you procure insurance for random infrequent and unpredictable events hey everyone welcome to to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:36] AA s thank you so much for coming down to Austin to have this discussion I appreciate the opportunity yeah this is this is a conversation I've wanted to have for a long time both for my edification but also because I think it's such an important topic and um you know interestingly for for whatever reason it it waxes and remains in public

[00:02:01] Consciousness over time there are periods of time when uh when Healthcare is on the Forefront of everybody's mind in in some aspect right it can either be cost or quality or access um for what it's worth at this moment it seems to be dwarfed by other Affairs uh but that doesn't mean that it's not going to be front and center in six months or a year or whatever and therefore I think in many ways this discussion today um My

[00:02:26] Hope Is serves as the master class on the United States Healthcare System um one other point I think I would make just for the listeners to understand is I fashion myself as a person who tends to get deep into things and then quickly come to an understanding of them um I have been rather unsuccessful in understanding healthc care uh I'm I'm sure my understanding is is greater than the average person but it still feels woefully uh inept relative to the effort

[00:02:58] I put into understanding it uh so I'm personally just looking forward to how much more I'm going to understand this in a few hours than I do today well I'm sure with good questions I'm going to learn a lot too so I'm looking forward to it as well s we're going to talk about the things that people care about right which is why is it so expensive why isn't everybody covered why do we not have the best life expectancy in fact on average why do we have horrible life expectancy despite spending twice as much as anybody else but we can't have that discussion if people don't understand the system and that gets to kind of what I just said a minute ago it's a really complicated system uh you're one of the most structured thinkers I know of so I'm going to actually just defer to you as to what framework do you want to put to this for people to understand how so many trillions of dollars flow in how many so many trillions of dollars flow out who's paying who's receiving what how does how is this thing organized and why are we different than every other country on the planet yeah let's so let's start with how the system works from a financing perspective and then I think we can talk about how that's different than other countries we can talk about the impact on outcomes and and we can probably even start to set up the framework on as you say the things people are interested in why and what can we do about it um but it's but it's hard to start anywhere other than you know this is now close to 20% of the US economy Healthcare 17 18% currently and but let's give a number to that cuz that is such a people don't understand how big the US economy is so how many dollars are we talking about yeah we're talking about a us you know US economy gross domestic product that's probably $28 trillion okay that's 20% of the world 20 to 25% of the world's economy with about 7% right or less of the yeah and another way to think about that's almost $90,000 per person in the

[00:04:57] US okay we spend to 12,000 per person in the US on Total Healthcare expenditure just to put that in context $4 trillion of expenditure in the healthcare sector if you added up all of the exports that the United States sends out across all Industries you're talking about three trillion we import more than we export we're consumer culture that's close to 4 trillion but not quite at 4 trillion today I mean you just put that in context in terms of how much how much we spend in in healthcare in the US it's a huge number and I appreciate the comments about you know how healthc care is a topic waxes and waines with respect to being top of mind but any discussion about the economy about inflation about jobs you're really talking about Healthcare in many ways it may not be as direct as talking about

[00:05:55] Healthcare policy but you're really talking about Healthcare given that it's almost 20% of the economy and there's no escaping that do we know that it represents roughly 20% of the workforce as well well it probably represents in terms of wages a little bit more than that um because the average wage in healthcare is higher than in other areas and this is something this is something that as we get into how you think about the future we should talk about because as healthc care as a percentage of the

[00:06:23] US economy grows you can't have that happen without considering what it does to the rest of the economy and that's going to be an important discussion around us competitiveness us affordability us coverage Etc given the nature of healthcare and Healthcare issues today so so do you think it makes sense s and feel free to shoot this idea down does it make sense to go back to the 1950s to start with Hill Burton to start with and then progress into

[00:06:51] Medicare and Medicaid like does historical context give people a sense of like what happened after World War II what did the United States because I think I think and we can do it quickly and give people a sense of what happened but let's let's just start with painting the picture of where we are today and then let's back up and say how did we get here okay so $4 trillion and again I just to keep this simple about a trillion of that okay 1/4th comes from consumers now some of that is spent in you know you and I both would contribute to the insurance we procure and some of that we're directly consuming Healthcare by spending money on Healthcare Services out of our pockets but think about it as 1/4 or 1 trillion employers put another trillion into the system so how do they do that largely through employer sponsored insurance so that's the second trillion so now you've accounted only for half of it so where's the other half coming from the other half is coming from government federal government and state government these days a lot of it is federal government and the federal government contributes in two different ways direct expenditure and as we'll get into when we start talking about history employer sponsored coverage being the dominant source of coverage is unique to the United States right which is that your employer procures health insurance for employees which then provides a form of coverage that's relatively unique as a mechanis let's make sure that people appreciate that because someone listening to this might say what I have a health insurance card and it says Blue

[00:08:27] Shield on it so doesn't Blue Shield provide my insurance that's correct but it's coming through your employer and most people would recognize that because of their annual enrollment right so they're picking Blue Shield or Etna or siga or United or you know if they're in a Medicare plan they may be looking at human or other Blues plans from that the point is that the blue that the human the Etna the whoever is on the card is usually providing an administrative service only if the employer is large enough that the employer is bearing the risk which we get into that maybe we should explain that a little more okay so you've got a fourth that people are spending out of pocket in one form or another some of it of course to subsidize their ability to buy insurance a fourth that's coming from employers directly right out of their profits now think about that trillion dollars for one second total Us corporate profits are about interestingly coincidentally just south of four trillion really so corporate profits okay post tax so the expenditure in healthcare is pretty significant right when you think about it that way now off of Total revenues of course it's a lot lower as a percentage but if you think about it from the perspective of total corporate profits that's a big big big number the US consumer spends you you should think of it this way for that $1 trillion doll it's about if you have a $20 bill $1 of that is going into direct

[00:09:56] Healthcare expenditure like 5% of of someone 's expenditure in an annual average basis okay then you've got the government the government's spending about 2 trillion again it's direct spend plus there's tax subsidy for employer sponsored Insurance we'll get into that because that's a unique feature when you talk about 1950s 1954 the tax benefits for providing employer sponsored

[00:10:19] Insurance were codified into law by the way going back to that one trillion dollars that employers are spending that is a pre-tax benefit basically to employees and that's the incentive and that's the incentive that started back in 1954 which is that giving people Health Care coverage through group purchased insurance by your employer is a pre-tax benefit rather than a post- tax benefit so it created an incentive y for employer sponsored Insurance to grow and now of course ultimately become the dominant form of which people procure insurance today outside of government what's the approximate cutof in in um company size at which point it makes sense to self-insure which is what you're describing oh I think it's I mean to your point it's mostly larger companies that do that but you know the definition of large isn't that large I mean there are entities 500 people there are entities with less than 500 employees that self-insure at times not that common but certainly as you get above that level it makes sense okay now you put the put let's for a second put the federal spending in context right I mean close to with the direct and the tax in-kind contribution to health care that the federal government is making you're getting close to 2 trillion 1.82 trillion defense spending just let's just put that in context that's about a trillion Social Security 1.2 trillion and to be clear Social Security doesn't come out of tax revenue directly that's that's prepaid the number that I keep thinking of some is the government collects 5 trillion a year in taxes that's the government's income is 5 trillion and we're putting 40% of that right back into Healthcare if I'm understanding this correctly well yeah I mean we we that may be what we collect but obviously the government is spending closer to 6.8 trillion or something like that that's right there's a trade def there's a deficit so uh this is the other thing that we were talking about the other day that just blows my mind which is we collect 5 trillion a year we spend 7 trillion a year so we have a deficit of 2 trillion a year in perpetuity oh and by the way we're sitting on 35 trillion of debt total Deb we're going to come back to this point in a minute I'm going to I'm going to borrow from Paul tutor Jones on his very eloquent explanation for how do you put that in context yeah no and that I mean ultimately that is I think the question when Healthcare is such a large part of the economy how sustainable is it what we're doing in healthcare expenditure so you know look you take all that money and financing and then in the US there's a system that it goes into right you got $4 trillion a quarter a quarter and half from government and you're flowing it into a system and in our system about 2 and a half trillion of that plus some from the government is flowing into private insurance okay they're covering you know what we would traditionally call Commercial Insurance but the private insurance Community is also covering a bit ofic Medicare and

[00:13:29] Medicaid increasingly large proportions of that as that's through programs like Medicare Advantage medic advantage or manage Medicaid or other things like that that allow for theoretically better choice better benefits and other things and maybe even cost control and then there is a retail component and then obviously the government does pay directly to Providers through Medicare and Medicaid some amount of money and that's about a trillion dollars so the split and flow you can break it down pretty simply from from that perspective look when I look at how the money's spent in a way that people can understand I I think of very simple rules we'll get into this which is

[00:14:11] Administrative cost in the US is probably one of the biggest gaps to what we see in the rest of the world and that can be good or bad you have to make a judgment about whether all that administrative spend is creating a better system with more choice and better outcomes or not but we do spend that and that that takes up you know close to 10 to 15% of the total pool of dollars when you think about that number on $4 trillion do that's a huge amount of money going into Administration we'll talk about that for the remaining dollars look about a third goes into hospitals about a third goes into hospitals and infrastructure based care about a third goes into Physicians offices and other Clinic type activities and about a third goes into drugs again simplification from that perspective Ive in the drug and and I would add to that maybe drug and device category I'm including the cost of pharmaceuticals that might be administered in a doctor's office or a hospital right so just think about it as a third a third a third and that's how people can think about when I go spend my money or I go into the Health Care system and I'm spending money on average a third a third a third is happening there obviously some people never end up in the hospital many you know small proportion of people end up costing us a lot in hospital for example some people are not on any drugs some people may be on five or six drugs the system has a variety of what I call cross subsidies in it and and just so that folks who are maybe thinking about other ways that they've heard this because I know you've described it this way which is it's often presented as half of the healthcare dollars are flowing into the facilities uh 2third uh pardon me onethird of the do of is going into payroll and Physicians and then one sixth is going into drugs that's right but what the the problem with that view and the reason I like your 1/3 1/3 1/3 better is it's more transparent which is in the previous world where we say half goes into the facilities we're discounting how much of that contains physician salary and how much of that also contains Pharma so when you strip that out it's actually more elegant to point out one3 one3 one3 the delivery industry is a pass through to other things in some ways right and the 321 framework was probably an older framework I mean the if you look at the rise of uh of the total drug costs which I'm sure we'll get into the third to third to third is is absolutely a more transparent and simplified way of looking at at how we're spending our dollars okay so with the that's where we are today let's go back it's 1950 what what is someone comes home you know it's late 40s early 50s the US is on top of the world we're we're the greatest country in the world our GDP as a percentage of global GDP has never been higher and may never be higher again in fact even today by the way I just looked this up because I was so interested if you look at the percentage of global GDP that is the US's today it's quote only 20 to 25% which is still staggering it was close to 40% post

[00:17:12] World War II right so what's happened over the last 20 years is China's GDP has expanded so much that as much as we continue to grow our relative share has gone down so we are economically the the we've never been more dominant than we were post World War II what is true of healthcare how does a person take care of themselves yeah and the one the one piece of context I would add to that introduction is that at the same time the US economy has grown robustly since then yeah so proportionally exactly and I think that's an important factor in affordability which is had the US economy stagnated and others grown this affordability question would be a very different question than what we've seen happen which is the US economy has grown incredibly robustly but if you go back to the 1950s and and by the way this is a global phenomenon in and around the late 40s and let's say into the late 1950s in many places significant investments in social welfare programs in healthc care were made so we'll talk about the us but just as context the NHS in the UK was created in 1948 okay so the systems that were designed to increase coverage originated in that time frame roughly now for us it was 1965 when

[00:18:31] Medicare and Medicaid you know came into being but it was somewhere in that range so you go back to the 1950s I mean first of all we were spending less than 5% of GDP on Healthcare okay I mean I was put that and yeah we're almost 20 at this point almost 20 from that perspective more than half of those dollars were spent out of pocket meaning you went to the doctor to 2% which is today 25% and actually if you look at direct expenditures where the dollars some of the dollars that you're putting in are going to the are going to cover your insurance premium it's really 15% so your direct exposure what you see and feel in terms of what you're spending on healthc care is down to 15% that's important because the socialization of coverage of costs has made the American Consumer less sensitive to the price points that they're seeing for everything for drugs for doctor's offices for hospitalizations

[00:19:39] ETC the other thing that's interesting is today that means 85% of healthcare expenditures are covered by a third party right whereas it used to be about 50% so again that sensitization phenomenon is real the federal government contributed about 125% uh to expenditures back then today it's north to 35% right I mean we've already been through that when you add up direct spend plus tax benefits and other things that you know loss taxes for the federal government Etc when you look at that you're about a third of the expenditure being the federal government so the rise of the federal government's role in health care has been material and almost as rapid as the rise in health care costs from that perspective so it's a very different system of consumption now you could ask why yeah I was just about to say do we have a sense historically why as the NHS is coming uh into its existence in the UK and as most developed nations are developing systems that look far more like the NHS than what we've done was there something about our geography being much more vast than say you know England was in the 1940s that that that led itself to this was it the nature of states rights versus uh Federal power like what what was the difference I think there are all kinds of things in the ecosystem including Geographic diversity State versus Federal rights and even fundamentally the drive that the

[00:21:18] American Consumer has in determining their own outcome and if you look at our system today much of its construct is based on on a desire for Consumer Choice okay many of these these programs these coverage programs or some would say welfare programs that evolved like Medicare and Medicaid were designed to solve some substantial problem so if you go back what what happened at that time two things happened in the 1950s one was there was a significant commitment to investment in hospital capacity at the time I mean there were people in

[00:21:53] America not just rural but Suburban that did not have easy access to acute hospitalization and the technology and ability to intervene and save lives in that setting was improving significantly and I think at the time there was a belief that it wasn't fair or Equitable that that access wouldn't exist that's called the hill Burton act you referred to it earlier which you know if I think about it in simple terms it guaranteed a hospital within every for 10 or 15 miles of every American in concept right and that's what happened and that that legislation drove our thinking in terms of access you know all the way until it expired in in you know close to 2000 1997 if I recall from that perspective so we made a massive investment in infrastructure from that perspective to provide people access okay and that that's important the second thing that happened of course is that by the time you were in the 1960s there really wasn't a coverage mechanism for seniors I mean there was

[00:22:53] Patchwork stuff and there wasn't really a coverage mechanism for those with less means you know what we today call Medicaid and it got to the point especially with the importance of the seniors power not only of the purse but from a political standpoint where on average seniors were spending a quarter of their retirement income from Social

[00:23:15] Security on Healthcare that wasn't sustainable so they neither had consistent coverage it was inequitable and on average a quarter of the social security check was being spent on Healthcare and so why Medicare and and ultimately Medicaid associated with it was you had a country whose economy was growing rapidly we could afford to take care of our seniors and that was the decision at the time and it was met with great support right obviously at the time and so you created a system in which that coverage existed and therefore the federal government's expenditure jumped up significantly now why did we not do with Medicare what was done with Social Security in other words uh my understanding which again I'm embarrassed to say how little I understand this but my understanding is social security is funded directly it is not a budget line item so the when I pay my Social Security on my paycheck it's directly going to pay somebody correct it's not like building up a war chest that the government has to use to be paying down in the future but Medicare works not the way Social Security does why was but I still make a medicare payment every month so in other words why haven't we at least been able to eliminate the challenge of Medicare and make it more like Social Security yeah well we do pay Medicare taxes today right I mean now there are special taxes to help fund Medicare but it's really it's really problem issue well then it's a fungibility issue as well you can use a Medicare tax to do something else absolutely and hindsight's you know 100% clear if you think about when the legislation was put in I said in 1950 we were like four and a half% of GDP in healthcare at the time Medicare came about in 1965 that number was in the mid sixes mid duer sixes okay at best so who would have guessed that it would have risen to 17 18 you know potentially in the future 20% I I think well-intended I mean the US Healthcare System in many ways is a story an optimistic story of well-intended policies that now are questioned based upon the way the expenditures have increased there's another thing that's important to understand which is as the US Healthcare expenditures increased as a percent of GDP so did the rest of the developed world right so every developed nation that put in place programs their version of Medicare or

[00:25:39] Medicaid I understand more state run than privately run their expenditures increased right they started like us in the fours and they've landed in the 11 to 12% range we've just accelerated up to 17 18% think about it this way from that time forward the US economy relative to the Health Care economy the healthc care economy has grown roughly 2% per year faster than the US economy and the US economy has grown robustly better than the rest of the world and so that's why the expenditures have gotten so high and there have been periods where that's been slower and there have been periods where that's been faster every time there's a new coverage event Medicare

[00:26:26] Medicaid you know some of what happened with the Medicare modernization act in in 2000 we'll get into that when we talk about drug costs and then obviously the Affordable Care Act which created significantly more coverage that rate of increase for healthcare expenditures relative to GDP growth has widened let's um maybe we we're taking some things for granted here just Define tell people what CMS is what Medicare and Medicaid actually do who do they cover how do it work sure yeah yeah well CMS center for

[00:27:00] Medicare and Medicaid services as it's called um Medicare covers people over the age of 65 and a bunch of special categories of people with severe chronic illness take dialysis as an example uh that it might be hard to find coverage on the private Market over a long period of time given their needs okay so it is a it is more than what I would describe as a safety net program it's it's a coverage program for people over the age of 65 how long does one have to have paid into it to qualify for it everybody qualifies for Medicare at the age of 65 it's not like Social Security where it's not like

[00:27:38] Social Security the benefit doesn't vary anyone who is a US citizen will qualify regardless and so Medicare another interesting piece of context you know think about life expectancy right I mean we're going to get into life expectancy differences in the US I mean the fact is what was life expectancy in and I don't know what the exact number was in 1950 or 65 it was what it is today right and and the other thing you would say is that look I think you would agree over the last 100 years in the broad context and scheme of things life expectancy in the developed world has improved remarkably 2X and yes there are now differences at the top of the spectrum between the US and others which we'll get into but this is in the context of a very very rapid Improvement in overall life expectancy health status may be a different thing and I think that's also something you know to talk about what really drove and Medicaid just to round that up okay so Medicaid let's let's Medicaid is a safety net program right it is a program designed for individuals below different definitions state byst state of certain measures of federal poverty level and the idea behind the coverage is that for those people not only are their needs unique but their ability to access health care services can be challenged and the benefit of having programs like

[00:29:05] Medicaid is it increases I won't say it makes it entirely Equitable it increases their ability to access the Health Care system in a reasonable manner with a coverage system that avoids taking those least fortunate down a path of severe medical debt that would be overwhelming to their personal financial situation that's how I think of Medicaid can you do you have a ballpark sense of where those c offs are in like in California for example yeah I mean the cut offs range you know somewhere between 100 and 200% plus a federal poverty level and we we'll get into maybe with the Affordable

[00:29:42] Care Act the exchanges and whatnot but they're you know Medicaid covers a lot of people okay if you think about this it now today covers 90 million people in the US more than Medicare Medicaid covers 90 million people to in the states almost a third of those covered think R spelt States and our Medicaid today so this is a very large program

[00:30:10] Medicare covers probably I would guess 65 million or so today and growing right as the population ages we forecast that that 65 million will become close to 90 million at the peak of the baby boomer aging you know which is around 2032 um in in terms of time frame but Medicaid today covers about 90 million people that's a big number what is the federal poverty level today I don't know yeah we should we can look that up in terms I can tell you that the income level that defines federal poverty is pretty low you or I would not consider that to be a reasonable living wage or income uh for a family in this environment with the cost of goods being what they are today yeah in other words there are people who are will not meet the criteria for poverty who maybe should B Bas on purchasing power and who will be underinsured and and that's where things like the exchanges from the

[00:31:03] Affordable Care Act have stepped in to provide at least options for additional coverage so that people's healthare costs can be offset so okay that that's helped bring me back to Medicare and Medicaid so if you really look at you have these programs that came into play so what what drove the rapid expansion because like another view of the world would have been that you had this coverage the healthare system Stood Still and maybe the costs increased but but they didn't increase Beyond 6 7 8% of of GDP now let me ask a question I'm sorry to interrupt you and and you can tell me to just punt this and come back to it I want to go back to the 1960s yeah we go to the

[00:31:40] Great Lengths to create Medicare and Medicaid why did we not at that moment say hey why don't we just roll this out for everybody just as the NHS has done why did we instead continue to keep two completely different worlds which is we have a government funded system for people of low socioeconomic status we have a government funded system for people over 65 or with very chronic conditions but for everybody else we're going to do this crazy thing where your employer takes care of you what was that decision the the the employer sponsored

[00:32:19] Insurance system was already entrenched right because of the tax benefits that exist so that was a decade earlier that is right I and so that was entrenched and and why does that matter right I think this is an important point about our belief in consumerism and choice the marketplace provides choice in a way that many of the nationalized healthc Care Systems that exist in other countries don't okay and if you really look at many of those other countries while they have a nationalized healthcare system that reportedly has Universal coverage they also have a private system system no differently than ours where people with more means can procure better insurance and better access and a private Health Care System Etc it's just not as widespread yeah as it is here in this country there was a belief that was institutionalized by incentives that employer sponsored insurance was working and remember at that time it wasn't that expensive okay meaning employers often covered 100% of the premium so the employee did not end up having to contribute like they do today to the cost of their insurance as an employee that they're receiving for their from their employer and that's that you know again it it was a comfortable system if you imagine at the time and based upon the system you got choice right which product do I want what kind of network do I want Etc what happened as a result of that expanding especially employer sponsored

[00:33:56] Insurance expanding is that insurance moved from being an individual product based upon your or my individual risk to Group Insurance right what are you doing with employer sponsor Insurance you're aggregating all the employees and all their risk and you're socializing that risk among the whole group and saying look in order to protect each of you individually we're going to share the risk as a group we're going to buy the insurance collectively and it'll spread the risk among us to avoid individual catastrophic loss from a healthare perspective expenditure perspective right that's what we did we socialized in Group Insurance that was a big move in the insurance industry as Employer sponsored Insurance took off of course

[00:34:41] Medicare the concept of Medicare Itself by bringing all seniors together was also socialization of Health Care cost across all seniors not all seniors spend equivalently as you can imagine so that was one what happened on the other side is absolutely a story of incredible Innovation over the last 50 to 75 years in healthcare okay and and we can all debate what's resulted from that but development and maturity of the pharmaceutical industry development and maturity of the medical device industry innovation in procedures and services that have allowed people to have have invasive procedures in manners that used to hospitalize people for 3 weeks and now it could be 3 days and in some cases if you're having a knee or hip replac it's at best three hours in and out the door is amazing right and yet the impact of that along with the socialization of healthc care costs and therefore removing the individual from understanding or feeling that cost directly because they're insured together was a virtuous cycle that just drove up consumption right I'm not an economist but you know people would look at this and say okay there's moral hazard and Concepts like that that exist with an insurance system like that and we should spend a minute on you know what was Insurance designed for back then and what is it now right yeah I I I loved your analogy there I've told this story before on the podcast but assuming someone's listening who hasn't heard it it's it's a great example so I had a friend who um uh is's a mar but he lived and worked most of the year in Riad in

[00:36:31] Saudi Arabia and I was out visiting him in Saudi Arabia this is 15 years ago and um we're at his flat and he was it was in the spring and he was just kind of getting ready to head back to DC where he lived um and I so I said to him I said God you know I can only imagine how hot it gets in Riad in the summer so if you leave here in May you come back in September how hot is your apartment when you get back just talking it AA and he goes 70° I'm like what do you mean he goes I leave the air conditioning on the whole summer I'm like you leave your house and leave the air conditioning on for four months he goes yeah I go that's crazy he goes I'm not paying for it right like the government subsidizes all of our energy costs here I pay the equivalent of a few cents per you know whatever it is like it was he pays a few dollars over the summer to air condition his place this is the exact point when you don't have skin in the game you can't make rational economic decisions yeah and I think you know if you look I shouldn't say that it's a rational economic decision for him but you can't make decisions that are that are wise in the context of of resources yeah and I think I think that you know if you look at the concept of insurance I mean insurance is for random infrequent and unpredictable events okay and when the primary role of insurance was to prevent catastrophic loss if you had a heart attack or you had an accident or you had an appendicitis or yes or you had a cancer which back in those days was less of a chronic disease the concept of insurance made some sense right now if you look at what drives expenditures from a health status standpoint it's a lot of chronic illness and in many cases it's multiple chronic illness you know we'll get into obesity diabetes heart disease lung disease even you know uh the innovation in H care in this country AIDS has become a chronic disease cancer is becoming more of a chronic disease we try to ensure somewhat uninsurable events right you don't wake up every morning and think oh I've got car insurance let me go figure out how to use my car insurance to get an oil change but when we think about we're going to go to the doctor to get a preventative checkup or refill my regular diabetes medicine which I'm going to be on for the rest of my life we think insurance but it's not really an insurable event insurance today is a discount card it's not Insurance in healthcare like Insurance traditionally would be in other parts of your life where you procure insurance for random infrequent and unpredictable events is this manifested in the financial so if you if you look at the insurance companies and you strip out their ASO business the that's the reference the part I referenced earlier about the administrative part where they administer Insurance to the uh employers but if you look at the part of their book of business where they bear the risk yes do they look like Travelers do they look like Geico do they look like the types of companies that Warren

[00:39:37] Buffett is OB is obsessed with because of float and or do they just totally function different from a no no they function differently from that perspective I mean obviously they have a tremendous amount of expertise in managing risk but the nature of that risk they understand isn't random infrequent and unpredictable events it's not car insurance it's not life it's not life it's not death it's not disability that's right the fundamental understanding that the insurance companies have to have to be successful in their risk business is understanding their risk pool right so you're going to have a thousand people in Insurance 5% May cost you 50% of your total spend 20% may be 80 85% of your total spend and then you'll have a large group of people that really on a unit basis don't spend very much and they have to understand that risk pool if you and I wanted to start an insurance company tomorrow I'm GNA hang up everything I'm doing you're going to hang up everything we're doing we're going to go start the Peter insurance company where we take risk yeah we don't have an ASO business what would it take for us to be successful it's very hard because the number one thing that would create the foundation beyond all of the infrastructure and systems and other things required to function in a complex ecosystem would be a large enough population of patients with a risk pool that you can understand I mean look at all of the folks who' have gotten into the newest exchange products that offered an opportunity to do that are the exchange the exchanges that have come out of the Affordable Care Act and there have been you know insurance companies that have popped up and have failed and there have been some that have struggled but still exist and there have been some that have been gobbled up the vast majority of success on the exchanges has been through traditional insurers who have the foundation of the systems to do so and the innovation in that SP has come from the Medicaid insurers who adapted their processes and systems to be able to come on to the exchanges at a lower cost point so it would be very hard it would be very hard to do that right remember the other thing you'd have to have if you had an insurance pool given that you have to make payments timely is you've got to have enough Capital backing the insurance risk and so where do you raise all that Capital that's another thing so we I think there's so many more questions I have on on that that I'll punt for when we get to the ACA yeah so look the the two things we we got a $4 trillion system it's almost 20% of our

[00:42:07] GDP it was not anything like that in the 1950s there are a number of coverage welfare programs if you will that have been put into place many of them done in that context in that time not only with good intention but reasonable projections that things would not have grown like this medical innovation I mean just look at the number of patents in the industry and how they've grown the combination of medical Innovation drugs devices service Innovation procedures along with coverage created a virtuous cycle coverage that was disconnected from Individual that's right accountability created a virtuous cycle of spend increase that has gotten us to this place and it has been faster than GDP and at the same time it hasn't broken the system because the US economy has been thriving right I mean the arguments about affordability that we may get into would be well at this level of expenditure the US economy it's draining the US economy from being competitive well I'm not sure that that's actually true yet okay and we can get into forecasting where it's going to go I'm not sure that's true yet okay all of the dollars and benefits that have gone into creating a Health Care System have created millions and millions of jobs if you look back over the last 20 years Healthcare is probably created more jobs as sector than in any other sector in the United States yeah I was trying to think of that some we the only two things that I could even put alongside it as huge sectors probably still don't create as many jobs would be energy and agriculture right those those c those would be the only two industries that could even come close to being in the same zip code AS

[00:43:51] Healthcare and what's unique about those three energy putting it aside the defense industry energy Agriculture and healthc Care are the three most subsidized industries by the government the three most subsidized industries by the government because they have obviously some public by far right I mean agriculture has been for a long time energy is very much so today not just from a national security perspective but in terms of the

[00:44:16] Innovation needed there in healthcare has been so again as we said in the US probably since 19 the early 1950s certainly since 1965 when you had Medicare and Medicaid come about and and so the expenditures have just grown obviously aging contributes a bit to that and there there are some differences we can outline with other countries if we we have an interest in it but you know aging contributes a little bit to that and then obviously as business has grown the value of this pre-tax benefit as more and more people are employed has grown to continue employ employer sponsored insurance as a vehicle of private insurance to match the public the public programs Medicare

[00:44:56] Medicaid and otherwise and so the expenditures have grown significantly one of the things that comes up is well what what have the industry participants done to actually help with this problem and and so and the argument will always get made well it's grown so quickly they've done nothing and I don't think that's even remotely true sadly I think you could be in a situation where where expenditures would have grown even faster so think about this from a hospitalization perspective the number of bed days per thousand so how many Hospital days is a per thousand population have fallen by a half since 1980 okay the number of

[00:45:40] Physicians per thousand people has more than doubled the industry has added significant physician capacity in order to help with access do we have shortages still in certain areas and C of course we do but the number of Physicians has doubled from about 1 and a half per thousand to 2.8 per th000 so the industry has expanded its capacity the insurance companies through their Managed Care programs have demonstrated the ability to manage cost if the consumer were accepting of some of that management that that's that's a different issue to get into which is how to do Managed Care in a way where it doesn't reduce and frustrate consumers or

[00:46:27] Physicians with respect to choice and professional freedom but make no mistake about it tight Managed Care has controlled costs for short period of time until there's been a bit of a Revolt in terms of that and product Choice within insurance companies has created choice so if you go back you know you had Medicare for a very long time sometime around the late 9s 2000

[00:46:52] Medicare Advantage really took off why why did Medicare Advantage get created medic Care Advantage was a way to was a way to create product and benefit choice for seniors that wasn't just traditional Medicare right they'd have a choice it's sort of the equivalent of the private insurance in the NHS system where you're you get the state sponsored thing but you want more choice right and the government gave an incentive I mean I think that payments to private insurers as an incentive to get into the Medicare space were almost 115% of regular Medicare expenditures cuz they were to incentivize bringing people into the system privatizing part of the system providing better benefits giving them choice and ultimately have that Managed Care hopefully reduce cost and the jury's out on that right in terms of whether it's really reduced cost or shifted cost or whatever but it is a highly functional private system built on government Dollars called Medicare

[00:47:52] Advantage and increasingly managed Medicaid is doing the same thing so the industry participants have done a lot in many ways over the last in particular 30 years in this space to try to curb costs without necessarily reducing this fundamental driver that defines our Health Care system which is the desire for immediate access and choice and and that defines our system is that desire for immediate access and choice I would

[00:48:22] I would even add another point to that um because we're going to go deeper on those two but you know you even mentioned that the number of Physicians has has doubled basically over the last 40 years while the number of hospital bed days has fallen in half yeah and the number of hospitals has declined the other thing to keep in mind is we physicians in this country spend infinitely more than in any other country to become educated and therefore the debt that they assume upon completion is also a big part of what drives presumably we must have the highest physician salaries in this country yeah the US has the highest physician salaries relative to other countries but I would tell tell you that physician compensation on a real basis since the 1990s has been flat or declining I mean that is a yep that is a stunning fact it grew rapidly from the 1950s roughly until the early 90s but since then physician compensation has been flat or in in many cases declining and you know that has a lot of implications given the medical uh training debt that you're describing about our ability to continue to grow the pool of Physicians to meet the growing demand of healthcare services as the population is still aging but also aging with chronic illness so that their needs are more intensive rather than not and I'm not even yet getting into mental health which has been an area that's been underinvested in for the better part of three or four generations which you know as we now realize actually costs a lot not just for mental health but the on physical health which drives our healthare costs especially in in the context of chronic illness we've been talking a lot about choice but is it is it worth maybe spending a minute to explain to people some of the terms that I'm sure they've heard but might not fully understand like what's a PO what's an HMO what's value based care how does Kaiser work like can you explain what those things are so that people understand when they're making their uh selection at uh open enrollment they they get a sense of what those things mean the way I would think about a PO plan is it's one in which you're procuring Insurance where you have relatively open network Choice okay so there may be a preferred network where you get somewhat of a discount but you have the choice to go wherever you want however you want Etc HMO Health management organization is one in which that choice is narrowed you're making a choice upfront to come into a program with less options such that the penalty for going out of that set of options is high and theoretically comes at a lower cost okay and then you have systems within those that kind of operate in the frame of one of those two models if you will in the US the PO business has been growing significantly faster than the

[00:51:15] HMO business back to the point around choice right it's it's uh let's use the right word it's more important than cost right now and has been more important than cost to Consumers that's not to say that people aren't feeling the costs of Health Care increasing and the burden of healthare costs increasing in the way that they're getting their health care but they're choosing po more than not the marketplac is speaking uh you know the simple the simple answer on an example like Kaiser

[00:51:47] Kaiser is largely a closed Network Health management organization where what you're doing is you're buying an insurance product through Kaiser it's a not for-profit that you're buying an insurance product through Kaiser and you're agreeing to stay within their network of hospitals doctors Etc they have a Physician Group that is largely bilaterally aligned to them on an exclusive basis that's a for-profit entity the physici group and the two of them together produce a product that ought to cover the vast majority of your Healthcare needs and in theory based upon that integration of care you either get lower cost or better outcomes or both and again I think the jury from a long-term perspective relative to other models is out but it's

[00:52:41] Innovative and it's worked in some places really really well and they don't try to cover everything right so if you have a child that's born with the most obscure congenital cardiovascular uh malformation they might just say you know what that's something we will just send up to UCSF because they've got the right person there I mean my personal example my mother had a rare form of brain cancer we had terrific oncologists at Kaiser who were incredibly dedicated and knowledgeable about oncologic care who without hesitation sought expertise from

[00:53:14] UCSF when they needed it for the more sophisticated parts of her care including letting her go there so I my personal belief from personal experience is that clinicians do make a lot of choices at Kaiser they get knocked sometimes uh that somehow there's a corporation sitting there telling them what to do and yes it is managed care and yes there are restrictions on in some ways how they construct their system but when you have an esoteric problem no one stops a physician from sending you to the right place there in my experience so and and all systems that are in Managed Care have outof

[00:53:55] Network EXP expenditure for rare rare things but it's I think that's a really important point and worth bringing up um from that perspective but you have these systems then that work in certain places and don't work in other places that effectively look the vast majority of the country today from an employer sponsored standpoint is working in some form or another of a PO system where people have choice because that's what they want and again that choice comes with a cost as as we've talked about right and that that maybe explain some of the differences um between us and other countries I was just going to sort of say you know I grew up in Canada and

[00:54:33] I still have experience with the Canadian healthcare system because my entire family is there and I I don't know if you have experience there you know previously because I know at McKenzie you did a lot of work for different provinces and stuff like that and and obviously through the NHS and here here's my take and again it's so anecdotal that I'm curious if it's reflective um my take is that if if if you needed heart surgery you know if you needed you know aortic valve replacement and uh you know a root repair and a cabbage the there's a surgeon in Canada that's just as good as the surgeon in the US meaning the top 10% of the surgeons in Canada and the top 10% of the surgeons in the US are going to be indistinguishable in that regard you're really going to get great care in that regard the difference is you're going to wait a heck of a lot longer the hospital experience could be entirely different um obviously you're you know you're not paying for it well I think you have to be careful about that you're paying you're paying for it of course your taxes yes yeah yeah yeah you're not paying through it you're not it's not coming out of your wages directly um and you're not paying out of pocket to your point again you're shielded you're more shielded from the cost um but boy if you're dealing with something like you've injured your knee and you need an MRI like the difference in how long you will wait to get that is it's it's it's it's immense right yeah the the access the the speed the choice the access is really what goes down the quality is not really the thing that has at least in my experience been degraded in a in a system like Canada I think there are excellent Physicians around the world in developed countries all over the place there's no question about that and and I would I would tend to agree with your description of the top physicians in both places I would I would draw one distinction which is I think emergency care is accessible on an emergent immediate basis in most developed countries now the interventions that they may take how

[00:56:33] Interventional it may be how aggressive they may be using the modern most modern Technologies or modern devices or whatever you know may be different but Emergency Care is available right if you had a heart attack immediately in Canada went to the emergency room you're going to get treated very well I think where things change is the elective care yeah right and by the way heart surgery can be an elective you might think of elective as you know cosmetic surgery no

[00:56:59] I mean a hip replacement a knee replacement when you can't walk a cataract replacement when you're half blind or heart surgery can be elective you're just scheduling it in advance and you're absolutely right in many parts of the world the weight times for those things are much longer right the the cynical view of that is of course that it's a cost management system but but what I would say is they've made a choice it's an infrastructure it's an infrastructure the way you descom terms that you have

[00:57:31] Universal coverage which creates the same moral hazard problem that we described here people would consume infinitely but they choose to cap it with supply side interventions constricting the supply or available supply of services in order to manage the demand and what does that do it creates weight times right or accessibility problems and you have a lot of Canadians who come into the us for Healthcare on a more immediate basis or they buy private insurance which can reduce the weight times from that perspective if they can afford it I mean for better for worse right or wrong nowhere in the world no matter what health care System you're in in a developed country do you have fully Equitable access okay those with means there is always a system to procure better access from that perspective the thing that's different in the United States at scale that I think is interesting is not just the focus on consumer choice but the United States has become comfortable in healthc care being the driver and leader of innovation so in healthc care services that is the proliferation of academic Health Science centers that conduct research much of which used to be supported exclusively by the NIH which is a brilliant construct over the history of the United States to really fund basic research and Innovation now clinical research and Innovation and increasingly funded through Private

[00:59:07] Industry and that has driven a large proportion of the innovation in the world like the science that supports pharmaceutical development for example comes out of us academic Health Science centers right largely speaking and then you have us-based pharmaceutical companies that develop 75 80% of the world's Pharmaceuticals and you know you can keep going and we can get into drug costs but it is a unique feature of this country that we have chosen to make that investment for the rest of the world um you know as I said the other day it's no differently than we've seems to have made that choice in defense right and and there are differences between the two this is and this is what I want to come back to right so we're going to go into pbms because I'm amazed we are as far into this podcast as we are and we haven't discussed PBM M so we're going to get right to it for the people who are listening to us going how have you not talked about drugs yet yeah but here's the fundamental difference you made a great point right so post World War II Breton Woods Accord the US makes a deal with the rest of the world effectively which says there's a cold war coming and if you choose to be our Ally we will provide you security specifically through our Navy we will Ure that your ships can pass freely throughout this entire world we will not plant a flag on your soil um we might use military Bas right we're not we're not we're not here to be conquerors we're not here to be Emperors um but if you pick our side we will assure your security and um and so that's an example of how we greatly subsidized defense for the world um but we got something out of it now when we are subsidizing drug costs for the rest of the world because as you point out we develop all the drugs it's not like we get different drugs than everybody else everybody else in the world gets the same drugs we developed everywhere else in the world has price controls that lower the cost of that and in true economic fashion it's sort of like somebody is squeezing down on the tube of toothpaste all that toothpaste is exploding in the United

[01:01:26] States with drug costs so the question becomes what are we getting for subsidizing the rest of the world's drug price yeah well first I think you got to look at this in the context of when it developed right you're back to the question of could anybody have predicted that we were going to go from 4% 5% of GDP to 17 could anybody have predicted that the drugs that were going to be developed and the advances in science would result in multiple therapies for common diseases and orphan diseases which are rare diseases that might cost over a million dollars a year right could anybody have predicted that I think the system as it was set up especially because drug development at that time was new and particular small molecule development and then somewhere in the late 70s early 80s you had the

[01:02:16] Advent of biologics which then grew into commercial products especially in the late in the mid 90s you know raise the bar on innovation pretty significantly and also everything that happened with respect to genetics opened up a whole broad range of Therapeutics that didn't really exist before when you were just taking small molecules and at scale testing them against targets right the cost of drug development went way up therefore the price of drugs went way up at least in the United States where you have a market now you end up in a situation if you just fast forward to what people are thinking about today especially because it's all over the news you got glp drugs that may have broad benefit okay for the population in one form or another why fundamentally the drugs may be affected but but it's because our health status is poor in a country where the health status wasn't so poor as it is in the United States which chronic illness the cost of those glp drugs might not be projected to be so high because less people would need them right and we can get into that a little bit around Healthcare policy and what

[01:03:25] National objectives for health would be but you have common drugs now for common conditions that are extraordinarily expensive right I mean there are alternatives that are much cheaper that might do a significant fraction if not from any people all of the job met Foreman would be a simple generic example that might take care of many of those things for people at a price point that's a thousandth of what but nevertheless you have this Innovation and you have also a culture that's obsessed with things like medical approaches to weight loss that you know has proven to be difficult to achieve through other other means was there ever a place when the US um like what's the closest the US has come to trying to enforce some measure of price control in Pharma in the US well remember there's there's one thing that's important to understand is that the Medicare modernization act that was passed in Circa 2000 okay which we've talked about some of the the other aspects of it forbade

[01:04:27] HHS from negotiating for drug for drugs as an entity as CMS I mean we legislated that right we gave away negotiating power yes the inflation reduction act which was passed in the Biden Administration has cracked that door open a bit for negotiation because the Dynamics of drug pricing the nature of the drugs the widespread just go back to 2000 is did did did the US government at least for

[01:04:56] Medicare say we will resign the right to ever negotiate was that a concession to was that a concession to Fara to get something else well how it came about in the lobby I don't know the details right I mean I'm sure there was but it was an absolute direct concession that forbade HHS from NE what did they get in return for that concession well there were a whole set of other things that were part of the Medicare modernization act that we talked about like Medicare Advantage was created and scaled up which created a way to potentially have managed care maybe manage the utilization of drugs and therefore maybe curb the expenditures create formularies that might encourage people to use generics rather than branded drugs if they were equivalent there were other mechanisms put in place to try to control what people did understand as rising drug costs they've just risen more substantially in the future again I go back to you know context at the time you know what should have been well- intended and and what were the unpredictable consequences is going to say you know s that sounds to me like

[01:06:00] Pharma had better lobbyists than anybody else I mean you know we live in a political system in which our Representatives that we elect vote for us and they are subject to lobbying yeah right so that's that's the nature of that's the nature you would hope that that would sup you know be superseded by good policy decisions at some point in time and I'm not saying Medicare modern ation act wasn't a good policy decision but I don't think it was a predicted effect what would happen and so I think cracking that door open is good look we get into these philosophical debates about we're a free economy a free market economy the government should not be engaged in price controls but think about this doctors are price takers from Medicare

[01:06:47] Medicare sets their reimbursement it's price control they're price takers from private insurance for the most part hospitals take Medicare prices as they're given so Medicare is a monopsonist right they're the they're a monopsonist at the end of the day they've applied it to doctors and to hospitals and other infrastructure based care where they set the prices based upon their purchasing power it just hasn't happened yet on the drug side and you have to think I mean the the obviously the debate is how do you do that in a way that doesn't deter

[01:07:23] Innovation is there a sh sharing with the rest of the world that needs to happen or how do you do it in a way where if it's just the US it doesn't deter Innovation because that innovation has been incredibly beneficial to us in a number of different ways and again we're going to get into health status and and outcomes and why there aren't is so good but it has been helpful and at the same time leave enough of a return that actually The

[01:07:46] Innovation won't stop right and start to take advantage of some of that purchasing power and I think that that's that's going to be an ongoing policy debate you know now that that door has been cracked open and I think what's new is that both the more and I really don't want to get into politics but both the more populist brand of Republicans and

[01:08:07] Democrats seem to have understanding that drug drug prices are on their radar screen on both sides maybe in different ways right so the industry will evolve and we'll see you know we'll see how that goes well let's let's talk about this drug thing because we going back to the very beginning of the discussion a third of the 85% so again I just like to Anchor people to it we're spending 4 trillion a year on

[01:08:33] Healthcare 15% of that is Administration that's something that exists virtually nowhere else of the 85% that of that four trillion that's not Administration roughly a third of that is drugs and devices and more of that is drugs than devices so drugs are a really really really expensive part of the US Healthcare System it also should be patently clear to anybody listening to us right now that we in this country are singularly paying infinitely more for every given drug than our peers are

[01:09:04] Elsewhere for the exact same drug let us now talk about the elephant in the room the Blessed PBM pbms okay so let's talk about what a PBM is because there's two issues with uh the pbms that we should talk about one is what do they do what are they let's just explain what they start there then there's the question of who owns them and how do they work and is that vertical integration helpful or not helpful to the system which we can get into but the pbms in essence are organizations that formed as intermediaries between Pharma companies insurers and pharmacies where you get much of your medication in order to help manage an increasingly large complexity of drugs I mean today there are probably 15,000 Pharmaceuticals of available the pbms were designed to do a few things understand the market for those drugs make formularies that were either broad or restrictive manage benefit plans for employers who were looking to have preferred pricing on certain drugs versus other drugs right so they were created to try to say okay we've got a lot of expenditure here in the drug

[01:10:24] Arena the choices are complex the number of drugs has gone up 15 or 16,000 whatever that number may be and we need entities that help people make more informed decisions in some ways at scale through employers or insurers and in some ways at the retail pharmacy level when individuals are going to fill prescriptions by the way which includes things like generic substitution and things of that nature when that's appropriate and is allowed that's what they were created to do okay what did that create it created a complex payment system because it used to be you buy a drug the money goes to the Pharma company from the pharmacy the pharmacy buys a drug they pay the Pharma company you know you have a direct interaction or you in a hospital you get a payment you know the hospital buys the drug from the Pharma company you pay them something for that drug you administer the drug and you get paid as part of your Global fee for taking care of that patient whatever the case may be the pbms came in the middle when did they show up well I think the the growth of pbms PBM showed up forms of them showed up in the 80s but the growth of pbms has been in the last 20 25 years and really has taken off recently for reasons that we'll get into about their ownership structure if you think about it that way um which has brought more scrutiny to them than used to be there you've created a system in which now money is Flowing less directly in many cases through the PBM so the Pharma companies may sell product but depending on what the PBM is doing in terms of committing market share to the Pharma company the PBM may earn a rebate okay so you have a rebate that the PBM can now that rebate the PBM may share with the insurance company or the employer who's signing up for that PBM service because they're saving them money through that rebate so you have this new flow of dollars again the idea behind this was to have better formularies better understanding allow people to have

[01:12:34] Choice do you want a broad formulary do you want a narrow formulary of course incentives are incentives and and part of what's happened is that with a rebate structure you can imagine incentives can exist for higher price product to move through a PBM and pass through and some of that being offset with rebates on both ends yeah so this is this is the classic example of and I'm sure I don't know who said it first but it's been said a million times show me how a man gets paid and I'll tell you exactly how he's going to act and and this is this is straight from the horse's mouth I will not identify this individual other than to say it is the CEO of a major Pharma company who shared with me that he wanted to price one of his drugs at a low level right he wanted to undercut similar products on the market and come in at a lower price the pbms flatly told him we will not put your drug on the formulary until you triple the price interesting don't worry we will make it up to you with a rebate I mean I mean this is I don't even know how this is legal right W I mean you you know it just doesn't it it you understand why that is happening from the incentive system how is this legal yeah how do these things exist yeah well

[01:13:57] I mean I I think in some ways um you know it's it's it's what we've said about most of the US Healthcare System right which is well-intended reasonably constructed structures that might have been effective in one setting as things have changed become less in set less successful in this in this setting and economic incentives can sometimes change to drive behaviors like you're describing which I hope is not the norm right which I hope is not the norm but even if it's not as overt as a situation like that subconsciously what we've done is removed any incentive for a drug company to be concerned with the sticker value of the price of their drug right it's a meaningless entity because of these machinations and payments that you've outlined where rebates and kickbacks completely change the economics again the system was so opaque to begin with you know you've already outlined this idea where we're so uncoupled from our decisions I don't just mean as patients I mean as doctors we have no earthly clue what a drug costs when we prescribe it if I'm trying to decide to write somebody for ruist

[01:15:12] Statin versus atorvastatin I couldn't it couldn't possibly enter my stream of Consciousness why one of those might be 10 times more than the other and yet we continue to just add unnecessary cost to a system well I think you're getting at some of the more fundamental questions around what is innovation right so do we reward the innovation of a stattin itself as The Innovation or do we reward the meos that come after it which sometimes grow to be larger than the original stat and sometimes they're better right is better than semaglutide absolutely they they could be better y but how do we reward that Innovation right what happens often times as a floor is set in terms of the reward for the initial Innovation as things get better rather than competition with more molecules driving price down it often drives price up because the market moves to the better and better product I mean this gets back to supply side intervention in other countries right yeah which is a very interesting point I never thought of it that way which is how much they throttle Supply in a system where demand could be unlimited and they have nool in some of those countries they will just say look 90% of the benefit is acred with simvastatin which was one of the original drugs you're not going to prescribe a tattin or Rua stattin right that's just not going to happen and so there's a limit and you have to qualify with certain criteria that are stringent to get to that more expensive for the incremental 10% benefit we don't work that way in this country right physician Choice around physician decision making around those choic and we've made the decision that we want to be able to afford that type of choice for the incrementally better drugs sometimes better uh from a side effect profile standpoint right can drive get can drive some of these decisions we've made that decision on an individual basis rather than a population basis and

[01:17:12] I think the point that we're talking about today is it's getting expensive right and it's getting expensive to the point where 171 18 approaching 20% of the GDP may be okay but the next 50 to 75 years if that grows to 35% of the US economy I think then you have some very very serious arguments about how sustainable is that if the US economy doesn't grow as rapidly as it has been growing well now

[01:17:42] I'll bring up my my favorite thing I've heard recently when Paul tutor Jones was speaking with with Andrew Ross sorin and he and he he wanted to put it into just the simplest terms for why there was no rational argument why anybody should buy a US Treasury right which was imagine I have $700,000 of debt you you've lent me $700,000 um my income is $100,000 a year so what does that mean that means I have he's taking that from $35 trillion of debt currently and 5 trillion of tax revenue so my income is 17th my debt and as you pointed out I'm going to continue to assume two trillion of debt a year in perpetuity and I'm saying to you the US Bond holder the person who's going to buy a 30-year treasury I have $700,000 of debt I make 100 Grand a year

[01:18:38] I want you to lend me 40 Grand a year for the next 30 Years and I promise you at the end of 30 years I'm going to pay it all back I mean what do you have to believe for that to be true you you really have to believe I'm gonna have a remarkable growth of income or a remarkable reduction of cost somewhere along the lines yeah or a devaluation of the currency yeah I'm gonna have to inflate my way out of this thing and again none of these things are desirable but when you say health care costs over the next two decades could potentially go from 20% to a third I is it how in the world could we imagine that the other costs contract to accommodate that that's right and that's that's the issue right which is that ultimately that's a very difficult proposition to actually get your head around and believe believe and in particular I I think we should get into the outcomes in the US to explain what we're getting for all those dollars but it you're right it's very difficult to

[01:19:35] Fathom expenditures getting to that level now one optimistic point of view on Healthcare expenditure growth out there is that if you just look at the Aging curve of the population in particular the Boomers and how they're growing and even with increasing lifespan the Aging of the population in the us Peaks at about 2032 is time frame you know you can look at different projections and it's so in the next eight years we're going to kind of reach the peak of Aging in other words when I say aging the number of people will grow every year that enter the above 65

[01:20:10] Medicare world and that number will Peak and then will start to come down so you and I will be right there we will be right there yeah that's right and and then that number will start to come down it's not just the Boomers obviously but I'm just giving you the demographic and the question is when that comes down will that mitigate this long-term trend of Health

[01:20:33] Care expenditure growth okay so that's the optimistic view that there is a mitigant built into the system just with the Aging of the population now think about all of what you do if at the same time the Consciousness and awareness of just basic interventions in health status can improve health status us even a little bit from a chronic condition standpoint those two because that's not going to be a onee or two-year phenomenon takes a decade those two could together make a big difference in

[01:21:05] US Healthcare cost expenditures the challenge in terms of what's happening on the other side especially in this context of debate around immigration is we're not growing the population of people under 65 who generate the economic productivity to fund the system to get to 2032 right if you go back a number of years like the 80s and you look at the number of people Prem Medicare so call it 40 to 65 years old to Medicare it was two times the population two to one two times we're paying in two well you know I'm roughly saying highest economic productivity is 40 65 two times the number of people as you had Medicare that number is trending towards .0 by the time we hit 2032 so the generators of economic activity and you know economists will get into this discussion of well one of the reasons the US can afford to spend more on Healthcare is we tend to work longer than than much of the rest of the developed world right 65 people talk about working into their you know low 70s and other so we generate more economic wealth y to subsidize this healthc care system and other things that we may want to subsidize in the country but that drop from 2 to one is significant and that's happening at the same time that we continue to have this aging so you know while it's interesting to think 20 years out I actually do think for the next 10 years we got a problem right we've got expenditures that we know will grow because of the continued aging the demographics are clear and we have a reduction in the work how the the only way to fill that is of course to have the US economy still be an attractive place for immigrants to come and work all types at all levels of of work in order to fill that demographic hole and and we've got to get our head around that problem I mean who would have thought immigration is related to healthcare we talked about this election people are talking more about immigration than Healthcare actually it's relevant to healthcare because Healthcare is such a large part of the economy everything comes back to it in the end when you think about it at a macroeconomic level one of the things you pointed out that I was unaware of although it totally makes sense and we could argue it's another sort of potentially shin spot is most people are very familiar with the fact that relative to our peers uh as developed

[01:23:31] Nations the US has a pretty poultry life expectancy in aggregate um most people can point to two things that tend to be the biggest drag on this uh so the first has to do with uh fetal maternal Health the second has to do with overdoses in sort of middle-aged men and you know we spend time on both of these These are you know related to both access to health and deaths of Despair respectively but the point you made was once you reach about the age of 70 your life expectancy in the US exceeds that of any other Nation yeah right like this is to your point that's when the system actually kicks in in terms of dragging out life pretty well so let's let's talk about life expectancy and I again I I think the most important context to consider here is that whether you look over the last 50 to 75 years we used 1950 as a marker or 100 years life expectancy has improved remarkably a lot of that has to do with infectious disease and other things and that's fine so when we say our life expectancies in the US are P I think what we're really asking is why are we 3 years behind everybody else behind everybody else especially when we're spending we're spending the most right and I think you make a really good point which which we've talked about before which is somewhere between 60 and 75 the equation slip we go from dead last to first because the medical system we've created that optimizes for

[01:25:01] Access quality sophistication technology the best drugs flips yeah and it's actually quite effective at creating long longevity from that standpoint we can all discuss whether or not you know to use your language the lifespan is improving with or without the health span but nevertheless the lifespan you know is is the best in the developed world so what's going on you know in the younger population I think you hit on some of it look infant mortality is two to three times the rate that we see in the rest of the world why we have a higher rate of teen pregnancies there's a higher rate of sexually transmitted diseases you've got drug and substance abuse issues that play into that and some of it is just again going back to this notion of access for care uh in the prenatal window and that's really important two which which you didn't really touch on I would describe as broadly speaking injuries and homicides I mean the rate of those in the US is significantly higher I mean homicides seven times the rest of the developed world I mean some of that goes back to gun violence of course that's unique in the United States versus others if you look at this over a long period of time by the way you know some of the the mortality in the younger younger

[01:26:22] Generations had to do with Wars um but but put that aside is not something as relevant today drug and substance abuse issues and just the flow of things like Fentanyl and others that are creating a different generational impact of mortality is is quite significant obviously the penetration of things like

[01:26:40] HIV and AIDS and and even though that's become a chronic disease over the last 25 years it's been a significant driver of mortality so you have these features that create excess mortality in the US especially under the age of 65 now when you combine that with the fact that our rates of obesity leading to things like diabetes and heart disease when you're older are higher than the rest of the developed world you have these unique issues plus you have a fundamental health status issue that we're now recognizing cost the Health Care System money obesity and its consequences don't just emerge when you have out of control diabetes 15 20 years later the expenditures the loss productivity in the workplace all of those things happen earlier so when you put those two together you have a health status problem and and by the way they overcome and overwhelm the things we're better at

[01:27:39] I mean oddly enough you know we're we're better at getting our vaccinations we're better at cancer screening we're better at treating blood pressure and cholesterol in this country back to the pharmaceutical you know culture we smoke less significantly than other parts of the develop but guess what that's being overwhelmed by these other factors in particular under the age of 65 or 70 whatever that range may be and if you look at those conditions unlike how effective the public health model was in infectious disease in reducing mortality over the last 100 years it's kind of been ineffective right I mean the combination of Public Health and nutritional science together in the way that they've evolved in the last 253 years have been ineffective in managing or you know dealing with these issues now you can get into debates about where they adequately funded or not funded and the quality of the science and all that but the fact is they haven't been that effective relative to other interventions and we've got to deal with that right this isn't you know this isn't an insurance coverage problem I mean we pretty much cover everybody other than undocumented today in the US or people that choose not to get covered because there are options now for everybody right and in some states we're even covering undocumented it's not a coverage problem okay this isn't a system problem in many ways the Health

[01:29:00] Care system can accommodate the illness right it's the question of what led up to the illness that we haven't really fully dealt with in the country and and there's two forms again societal issues you know whether that be gun violence or poverty leading to bad access to prenatal care injuries Etc or the chronic diseases that seem to be more prevalent here and I you know how you fix that you and I have talked about this for years I mean it's hard to change Behavior if you really want to change trajectory you really want to improve health span it's hard to change Behavior and the more of that that can get built into the background that just changes the way people eat or changes the way people engage in physical activity which could mean you know designing cities where you have to walk to work the vast majority of time rather than drive like many European nations have done those interventions themselves must have some benefit right because you're seeing different outcomes between the countries and it overwhelms all these other other factors I don't know that the Health

[01:30:12] Care system as it stands today is going to solve our cost problem that's driven by the factors I just described it's certainly not going to dis it's certainly not going to change materially our outcome problem tinkering with the different parts of the system we might be able to affect cost the outcome problem is a more fundamental problem yeah there's so much you've said there some which is pretty is is pretty typical of your

[01:30:40] Brilliance which is uh you'll you'll you'll you'll say something for 10 straight minutes and at the end I'll be like that's that's like a a thesis that that might have taken me a year to come up with but what I took away from that that's just in you know again very insightful is um prior to the age of 65 you know the reason that we're in last place is a few of these things that are unfortunately more American than they should be right so we we talked about um access to guns a k a culture of violence uh things you haven't even alluded to but greater mental health crises that you know just go hand inand with all these things uh poor access to prenatal care um relative to other developed Nations that's leading to a far higher degree of of infant mortality and these things just add up we talked about the drugs I mean for heaven's sakes right like it's we have a fentanyl pipeline coming into this country that's an embarrassment and as a result a 100,000 people a year more than that now are overdosing by the way it gets back to this issue the border is a healthcare issue right it just is you can't escape it everything ties back in one form or another to healthcare what I really thought was interesting is you know I talk about it in terms of medicine 2.0 and Medicine 3.0 and I've talked about how our system is really good medicine 2.0 right it's really good at treating chronic problems and grinding out incremental years of life when you're chronically ill um and that shines so much when you become a senior citizen and that's how we LeapFrog every other country between you know ages 60 to 75 we go from last place in life expectancy to First because our machine shines it really kicks in and of course it begs the question you know why can't we have the best of both worlds like these don't have to be mutually exclusive you you can you can preserve the ladder which is you know we have all of these remarkable pieces of technology and Innovation and access and infrastructure and quality that give us that boost of life expectancy at the end why don't we increase the number of people that enter that that sixth that seventh decade of life let's increase that by 10% by applying better medicine 3.0 and access early in life and by the way I think you would increase it by more than 10% um the other thing that I think just I keep playing back in my head is I've always talked about these as three variables so when I've talked about this I've always talked about three variables I've always talked about quality cost and access but you you've made me realize that choice is a part of that as well and that's the part that I think is also very am um and I don't think we should be apologetic for it it is just our culture it is who we are we want the best and we want to be able to pick what we want right and you you know um that fourth variable puts even more pressure on the one that is unconstrained so which cost that's right so cost is unconstrained we have said we want maximum quality we want access and meaning when I want it I want it now and I want to choose where I go if I control those and I leave one to balloon and that one is cost away it goes the other systems as we've discussed have said no cost is constraint cost is cost is a capped resource now you see what's going to happen to the others and that's where we get into the supply side throttle to lower access let's eliminate choice and you'll still get decent quality and that's that's the that seems to be the choice that the rest of the world has made that is that is right and I think you know the you can't underestimate the power of and I I think by the way Choice sort of fits in a broad framework of access right if you have enough access points and they're differentiated that allows Choice uh if you look at many of these other system I actually like to keep them separate and I even though in my former model they were the same I think the way you've described it is better because Choice also means you have more drugs than you know what to do with you have a formulary with how many thousands of drugs I mean there are probably 15,000 Pharmaceuticals available today you know in one form some of them are repeats but you know my point is there's a lot of choice right and we'll do Min sectomy we'll do meniscus repair surgeries we'll do hip resurfacing we'll do hip replacements I mean we'll do PRP we'll do anything and everything you have more Choice here this is the biggest Buffet on the planet when it comes to healthcare so so why why is that you know is is one of the questions that I think comes up so I think first of all I agree with you we cannot underestimate the power of choice I mean we learned that in the 9s with managed care right when it was quite constraining and by the way as I said before that system lowered Healthcare inflation it only proved it for a short time because the backlash was so vicious against it and I don't think we can go back there like politically even from the standpoint of not politically but just the way the system is evolved to create more options and more Choice it will be difficult to go back there limited supply side con constraints I think at this stage have and are becoming a part of the dialogue as I said Medicare sets prices for doctors and hospitals they probably will start doing so for certain drugs okay it's purchasing power and and one could argue that in some ways that's a form of supply side constraint well let's even start with the choice before that because I always think we should start with the null Choice which is we can do absolutely nothing we can sit here and say Peter S thank you for explaining this system I actually have a better understanding of it now I want maximum

[01:36:27] Choice maximum access maximum quality let cost be damned let's just leave it alone yeah let's revisit it in 5 years how about that let's just come back in 5 years and tell me if it's 22% tell me if it's 23% of GDP once it hits 25 we want to do something about it like we we could literally just be ostriches and put our head in the sand and ignore this okay let's put that aside and say no most people at this point probably think we should at least have some ideas for how we can manage this so now you that's your first point which is Medicare has made the hospital and the physician a price taker shouldn't it be able to do that to Pharma now let's talk about what's going to happen because now you just added one more squeeze on the toothpaste tube while you're taking the cap off because if Europe and Canada and

[01:37:19] CMS Force Pharma to be price takers what's going to happen happen to drug prices that are outside of CMS in the US yeah I mean I think I think we have to avoid looking at extremes okay I mean well I would say this the ability you know I don't think the people who are talking about this in a rational way in terms of actual pricing which is not you or me really in terms of the policy

[01:37:45] I don't think anybody's saying let's bring it down to the average of the oecd ETC from where drugs are Priced Right the question is are there ways to start to curb the inflation rate of price and actually rationalize some group purchasing capability I I think that the the challenge with accepting the extremes is it will only fuel the discussion of innovation will stop nothing will happen any further and that's not going to happen no I agree but but someone will have to make a concession and I think that somebody is actually the shareholder cuz I agree with you I do not think Innovation stops and it's because Innovation isn't even happening at those companies anymore anyway Innovation is the is the biotech's job at this point but but think about again what you just said right from that that may be true in the short term but the Hallmark of American

[01:38:33] Ingenuity is to take externalities this is an externality that might be relevant take that pressure in that ecosystem better models emerge more efficient drug development will emerge more efficient distribution mechanisms more efficient sales and marketing Etc will emerge and and so you're saying the shh you're saying the shareholders shouldn't actually even be forced to suffer here it's always the case as companies have life cycles that shareholders succeed and at times suffer yeah but the innovators come out the back end stronger and sometimes they're new entrance right which changed again I mean that's the Hallmark of the free market economy so how do we reconcile that s because on the one hand you're saying if if if Pharma if drug development and distribution had to become more economical we are Innovative enough as a country to do that but at the same time the whole reason we're saying that has to happen is we must have some measure of price control in drugs which feels like a very anti-American thing yeah right I mean this is what people get into but it's it's there's there's two issues there right first of all I don't think that remember we took all the time to describe the entire complex Pharma ecosystem it's not just the pharmacos right there are companies that do basic research there are pharmacos there are pbms there are pharmacies there's insurance by the way the insurance companies own the biggest pbms right so there's a vertical integration point there that is important to understand my point is that when you talk about this in terms of Medicare purchasing drugs with their scale it is absolutely the case that that can be done in a market-based way by the way Walmart is one of the biggest retailers in the country are arguably they have one of the best procurement functions based upon the scale of what they're purchasing that gets them better pricing from their suppliers auto manufacturers manage this in Auto Supply part suppliers right I mean it's not unamerican to use scale as long as that scale is not anti-competitive to drive better pricing in what you purchase it creates

[01:40:48] Innovation across the entire value chain Medicare in this case because it has become such a large source of expenditure in a private healthc Care Marketplace behaving more like a primary buyer at scale is not anti-American okay how it gets implemented and how they do it could turn anti-American I'm using your term anti-American free market versus not right right but purchasing at scale is not an anti-American or anti-competitive but do you think it is reasonable that Americans could expect to pay for drugs what their European and

[01:41:30] Canadian counterparts pay I think it'd be very difficult to move in in one move to that level of purchasing price given what the starting point is in the marketplace I don't I just I don't see how you could do that without really having a shock to the industry I mean let's remember I think 80% of the pharmaceutical industry resides in general generates profits in the US as large employers but not just large employers large magnets for talent coming out of our universities I mean again I I think it's we have to remember between them and their supply chain they create a lot of innovation right I mean a tremendous amount of innovation uh in this in this country that has advanced you can call it health 2.0 but it's Advanced Health 2.0 because that's the construct we have so this has to be balanced but the concept that a purchaser at scale can achieve better pricing I would argue the time for that legislation from the 2000s to be

[01:42:34] Revisited is here and I I wasn't aware of this but you said that that um the inflation reduction act cracked the door on that yeah it cracked the door open right for certain for certain drugs and I think we'll see how that goes I mean you know this is going to get mired in politics and lobbying and all kinds of things that you described but if you step back and look at the big picture of where Healthcare expenditures are going

[01:42:57] I mean let's just step back and actually look at just pharmaceutical expenditures rather than Healthcare expenditures in in addition to extraordinarily expensive drugs that have broad application like the glps you have a broad range of Orphan drugs that have been developed that orphan drugs meaning for rare diseases for very few people sometimes miraculous benefit for them at extraordinarily high price it goes back to what you said about we want choice and access and we value saving As

[01:43:27] Americans that life more than what other countries may do in not saving that life and looking at it societally and then the third thing is if you look at the pipeline of drugs for the next 10 years I've done this right like look at the pfal list or whatever at the FTA the number of unique biologic infusible drugs in particular for autoimmune disease and cancer that are slated to go through the process and get approved which again not having seen the data it's hard to know whether they'll transform the care of those diseases or marginally improve them but if they get approved they'll be doing some benefit will create another massive explosion of drug cost here so the proportion that's going to hospitals and doctors relative to drugs if you look out over the next decade is poised to change again based upon the pipe lines meaning the third that's currently drugs is going to go up relative to the rest of the P yeah yeah the the inclusive version of the third where it's everything and you know the yeah and that's you know that's something we're going to have to Grapple that's going to widen the gap between us the current Insurance model that's right it's going to widen the Gap and also the current Insurance model may not be designed to accommodate that cost without passing it back to employers and

[01:44:53] Medicare and so then there's going to be a question again what are we going to cover what are we not going to cover right we're the the way that healthcare costs are rising we're being pushed to ask the supply side questions that the rest of the world has already asked and answered we're just grappling with it and it's hard because of what we've talked about we don't want to give up choice and access in the process of grappling with those decisions see for other countries when new drugs come online it's easy for them they have an established dollar amount yeah yeah it's an established framework the citizens are used to that established framework here we haven't established the framework I mean this goes to the point of you know it's it's not obvious that we have national health goals a different topic and I I know that gets a little bit kind of you know up in the sky a bit but we're at a point where what we spend and what we get for what we spend is really really good in some ways right and obviously not so good in other ways when you look at some of the outcomes but many of those outcomes are not driven by the healthare system as we've talked about and so the question is where are we going to put our incremental dollars that's the question because the incremental dollars going straight into the current system which I'm a participant in and everybody else that's going to be necessary just because the population's Aging like fact of life we're going to have more demand for roughly the next decade but are we going to do that at the exclusion of resources into these other things which in again in your language impacts Health Span in my language it impacts the two things which sit in the background that seem to be different than the rest of the world which is just basic nutrition and basic physical activity that seem to be major differences in how the US Works versus others some of it because of geography some of it because of our you know obsession with driving cars and whatever the case may be and it's it's not clear how we're going to approach that you know over the next decade because we don't have a choice but to spend for the people that are going to continue Aging in you after 2032 2033 if the pressure on the Aging portion reduces we may have some choices but we got to get there first while the Aging pressure might be taking a little bit of air out of the balloon it's hard for me to imagine that it's taking more air out the balloon than that which is being put in with the rising burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes um let let's talk about that for a moment we haven't really explicitly and directly spoken about that so you and I used to Mark our birth years roughly in the sometime in the 70s and talk about what the prevalence of diabetes or obesity was then relative to now it's it's what three fourfold up oh no no much more obesity maybe but type 2 diabetes when the year we were born is 1% and today 12 to 15% right right much more yeah so so so very conservatively a single log fold but likely more we've talked about mean it's a generational failure of nutritional science to really understand what creates obesity and its sequella yeah so here's the question right we have we have drugs now that are they seem pretty remarkable right these glp1 agonists are doing something we have never seen before which is simultaneously delivering the best efficacy we've ever seen coupled with what appears to be remarkable safety right so maybe there's some marginal edge cases that are going to become but but this is not fenfen this is not stimulant right we are dealing with truly efficacious truly safe drug the problem is they cost so much money yeah and so you know I I I'd love to hear what you're reading about this because what I'm reading is two different types of things right I'm reading on the one hand the bull case that says this is going to change the world like we we are finally going to address the burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes and metabolic disease with these drugs cuz now all we got to do is give these drugs to everybody and then the be case says that might be medically true but economically if you run the math we're going to take a system on the verge of bankruptcy and bankrupt it if we have to rely on those drugs so tell me how you're thinking about this in your un I think a couple things I I I generally agree that that um you know these drugs are very effective I I get concerned about muscle loss uh in particular when I think about consequences for elderly people especially from an orthopedic everybody knows that you know hip fracture whatever due to muscle loss creates a very high degree of mortality but in general I agree with the concept that these drugs are very effective now if you look at this from a crass economic point of view remember what's the fundamental problem we have in terms of generating the wealth to pay for the system is that we've moved from a period where we had twice the number of economically productive people from 40 to 65 and above to now the ratio approaching 1: one so the best application of the drugs if the idea is to improve health status which then could improve economic productivity to support the system ah would be applying them to the people who could still work not the people over 65 not that people can't work over 65 but generally if you take that as a mindset of a a period of retirement from so basically if and I don't even know the dollar numbers but let's just assume that the drug is $155,000 a year for one of these drugs you're saying you have to get a multiple of $15,000 a year of productivity out of it from the individual who's now more able to work because their knee doesn't hurt as much their back doesn't hurt as much due to the seele of obesity I think if you're looking at it from the perspective of today's conversation around the cost of the US healthare system and how it interacts with the rest of the US

[01:51:20] Healthcare economy that's the maap yeah right and and over 65 arguably you may reduce the burden of disease but you may increase longevity which as we know creates additional cost over time because it's kind of unknown whether you can stay on these drugs or whether people will stay on the drugs above 70 80 into their 90s and will there be a reversion in other words are you just delaying the spend or are you actually avoiding the spend we don't know right um what little I know about how these drugs work is that when you withdraw them there is a negative effect from that perspective how persistent that is and how that'll change over time uh I guess with new drugs we'll we'll find out um I go back to the notion though that I think it's fundamentally not the right answer to wish that nobody innovated these drugs I think that's crazy yeah right and and again you can get into what it costs and who paid for it and how you know but but and who is paying for it given the price differences between here and the rest of the world I will also say the prices for these drugs are too high like my view personal view they're too high I also believe that they won't stay this high as the penetration grows across newer and newer indications and the population it can't even though as you pointed out earlier the me to train on this class of drugs is so long I can't see the Caboose at this point like when you actually look at the pipeline of GP Gip glucagon and other incron out there it's we've got 25 of these things in the pipeline and will it simply be if we go back into the American ethos of choice quality best best best are they just always going to be priced so high and and and maybe you're right maybe semaglutide trades at a discount and like nobody wants it cuz that's like so 20 20 right well I think the reality is that um because they're so visible they have ended up generating a lot of political attention right yeah and I think this gets back to a lot of things in the free market culture that we live in which is we have wide operating parameters in a free market but at times when things go outside of those parameters it's not entirely a free market it's just a wide parameter free market when things goes goes goes outside of those parameters people take notice and you know that leaves organizations with the choice do they proactively move themselves back into some acceptable parameters or do they wait for somebody to do it to them and by the way the US government like any government does have a history of moving things back into reasonable parameters I mean there's no such thing as a 100% free market economy from that standpoint right when especially when we've described our own Health Care system as being somewhat free market and choice driven but the economic flows essentially Shield the consumer from the actual cost of the care that they're consuming right so meaning the insurance scheme and other things so it is a it is a it is a difficult problem to solve but

[01:54:38] I I suspect that I understand your point about follow on but I suspect that in some ways this will come back into some reasonable parameters so I'm making a note here to myself government I'm just listing out the players in the system the government the employers and the payers I'm going to lump them as one right the consumer the the medical system that I'm just going to call hospital PE you know uh ambulatory center physicians n like the staff the the delivery system of healthcare and then Pharma and I don't really know where to put the PBM would you make them their own separate thing as a system or would you put them in with the payer where would you put them in with own by the payers yeah okay so let's put mostly yeah okay so if we were somehow given the ability to do anything we wanted and we said we want to keep quality essentially where it is maybe restrict Choice a tiny bit kind of leave access where it is but we want to shrink cost by 25% is that metaphysically possible and if so H how does that list of participants play a role in that yeah well 25% is a big number no it's a huge contraction a say 25% over the next X years like it's not going to be an overnight 25% reduction which by the way let's just make sure people understand this a 25% reduction in our healthc care spend would still have us being the most expensive country of Healthcare in the world we're not even getting to cost parity with other developed Nations but

[01:56:24] I'm just thinking about I'd like to I'd like to get it closer to 3 trillion than four trillion that's all I'm saying I think the concept of absolute absolute cost reduction is very different than bending the trend yeah okay and I think and we can get into whether there are absolute cost reductions that we can we can think about within the current system and what they would mean and what they would what they would require um but I think the other way to ask the question longer term is can Healthcare inflation mimic GDP inflation as opposed to being 2% faster or could it fall below it right but just getting it to that level of being at the same level of

[01:57:05] GDP inflation um would be an enormous enormous move and curbing of the healthcare expenditures so look the first thing is the number one deterrent to Absolute like cut 25% out of the syst system is the extraordinarily negative shock on the economy of that type of job loss right so what you're basically saying is it's not healthare it's not Insurance you can't do this without cutting jobs you cannot do this without cutting jobs the

[01:57:40] US actually spends Less on infrastructure as a proportion in health care services you know like buildings and whatnot than many other countries actually but the people aspect of this both the number of jobs and also the fact that our doctors nurses Etc are on a real wage basis paid higher than in other countries the two of those together and other healthcare workers right make for a large you know they contribute to the Gap and we the administrative side is the big just about to say the administrative piece is how much of that is payroll that's mostly payroll isn't it no no the No No the administrative there's some you payroll meaning people yes yeah but it's the system of having to you know claims and all that yeah but it is mostly a people why isn't AI doing that s well it's increasingly doing that I mean those of us you know who have more exposure to sophisticated scaled businesses that work in the revenue cycle or the insurers who are increasingly doing this are using it but you know look the government is that the poster child indication for AI it's the poster child indication for more automation that requires controls okay and the government of course AI is new and usually regulation doesn't catch up as quickly as the technology moves so look at the last just seven days you have you know an article in in uh I think propublica that talked about a business that is using Ai and denying claims at an extraordinary rate because of the AI algorithms that are built in all the insurers it etc etc and and is this just due to bad training well I think it's a question of how the system is being used today I don't think the system was originally created to do that most likely right I mean there is a balance between cost management and denying people what they need yes on an indications basis right that's what their intention I always think about the organizations in the ecosystem is starting with good intentions but things can get away from people okay that has gotten away I mean if you read what's in there and it's true it's gotten out of hand okay and I think many people doctors providers Etc might feel that issues with pre-authorization and denials and other things have gotten out of hand and I'm not here to represent one side or the other despite what I do look at the flip side right you had a major insurance company come out and say that look coding is getting aggressive that's the provider side that maybe is pushing the envelope in a way that they're they see all the data and all the systems and they're seeing something okay I don't know how true it is any more than I know how true this other one is checks and balances in the system when you have a private system are required AI can either be an accelerant to reducing cost and being more efficient and effective or if not controlled could take one side or the other and move them in a direction that actually have negative consequences right yeah overcoding or under authorization of what people need as an example so we we have to work better as an industry to actually get the right balance here and that's why there's a lot of attention to this right now because the balance is off and you can't unilaterally blame one side or the other from that perspective is is my general Viewpoint as I approach this as

[02:01:10] I approach this problem so if you think about the administrative cost side of it yes it's all people yes it's built on a system that has gotten infinitely more complex in terms of paying and getting submitting and getting paid for claim both with government and with private insurance and a whole bunch of other administrivia that does have an opportunity to be fixed at this point collaboration between the two sides doesn't seem as high technology has the potential of reducing that cost but it is at the expense of job loss if it happens and and I guess your point that you made at the very outset of our discussion is we always hear

[02:01:45] Administration and we think that's garbage just cut it but the truth of it is that Administration is the price we pay to have the choice we have that is right we couldn't have the environment of choice if we didn't have the administration to adjudicate yes and does it have to be as large no but there would have to be some Administration but the reason everybody else gets to avoid

[02:02:04] Administration is everybody else has Administration it's just sitting in their government and it's in one entity rather than 50 entities and it also limits Choice by just saying there's not going to be a line by line adjudication of this it is what it is here are your three drugs right yeah so then you have you know you have the other three components of the spend and you know those are all essentially people or somewhat people-based and you know the profiles of the three businesses are very different so the only way you're going to actually if you wanted to absolutely cut costs I mean you're talking about supply side intervention and price restriction or or caps some states have tried inflation caps like we're not going to go up more than 3% per year 4% per year

[02:02:50] Etc there has been no discussion of okay we're just going to cut a quarter of the spend out of the Health Care System again because I think it would be catastrophic in terms of access and and other things uh that's not to say that we didn't wish we ended up at three trillion rather than four trillion if you look back 50 to 75 years but we're not there and that cut would be relatively Draconian why why hasn't this been a higher priority so if we go back to because the economy has done so well one of the important things that's critical is the US economy is perform the rest of the world and the rest of developed countries and we've done it despite the more rapid expansion of health care costs than any other country arguably an economist would say that as health care is a percentage of GDP and is a percent of expenditures remember we talked very beginning how much of the consumer spend it is employer spend it is would have materially suppressed wages but let's ask the question if it has suppressed wages because money has gone into that with this tax incentive has that actually made in some ways the

[02:03:55] US economy more competitive with wages that have been again somewhat suppressed which makes the American worker more competitive for various types of things that have a global labor footprint rather than just domestic see I don't I don't think it's a given yet that health care cost on a net basis increasing to where they have have been a negative for the

[02:04:21] US economy I mean facts that are hard to escape from the US economy is stronger and has grown more than other developed countries fact the expenditure rate in healthcare is higher put aside outcomes for a second depending on what we want our access and and choice which we prioritize are better right and in fact um the diversity of what the US

[02:04:42] Workforce is doing today is probably more than it was a decade ago right there's more manufacturing return you know things like that I think wage suppression play a role in that again you'd have to talk to an economist to really understand the quantitative effects there but I don't think we've reached the point yet where these Healthcare expenditures at a macroeconomic level have deterred the US economy I think we're in this conversation because the question is will it yeah well that's exactly right s my my view is you know we all know when Noah built the ark and I feel like it's important to have these discussions before we're driving off the cliff right um because nothing that we're talking about can be fixed quickly um and so I just you know I'm having this discussion because I want to understand it and I really hope that people far smarter than us who are far more influential and far more important perches are putting as much thought into this as they are into um whatever other important policy decisions are out there because it's very difficult to imagine that the private sector alone would would solve this yeah well I think I think that's that's an important Point look the role of government we haven't talked about and I I would argue from my experience Healthcare is over-regulated by a lot okay um but you have to give the government credit when when they were and I I would say it in different part when they work to create quality standards that people had to meet you know things like sepsis and other when they work to create safety standards around basic problems that you see in healthcare they have that those ulations have improved the consistency of performance of the US Health System you have a CMS regulated operating room you have a great operating room so some fraction of what they've done has really really helped and you can't argue with that and and similarly regulations that have been placed into other parts of the industry so we may be overregulation but you can't discount the value of some of that regulation where do you think the government is oh sorry go ahead well yeah no go ahead where where is it I was going to say where do you think the O the overregulation is being counter question earlier about what is value based care and I don't think we that's right we got off under different one of the things that I think we get very much caught up in is the concept that our system which is more of a fee for service system right you get paid when you versus some kind of value based population Health System would be the change that would be required and and the interpretation is always well all these other countries who spend less they're they must be a population health system or a value based care system because everybody's in One Insurance

[02:07:23] Pool and but but what we've said in our discussion is no it's a supply side intervention right they just constrain and limit cost and infrastructure they just decide what's going to be accessible that's what drives the difference in their cost and by the way for all those economies again remember their Healthcare expenditures went from 4 to 11 or 12 that's a massive increase for those countries too it's just not as big as ours so I think the concept here you you have to put this in perspective the interventions that have fundamentally tried to change the workflow in healthc care value based care mod most of them haven't succeeded

[02:08:04] I mean look at the companies and other organizations that have been in this space despite the best of creative intentions many of them have not succeeded I would argue Medicare Advantage is the most important at scale value based construct that has been somewhat successful but most of the innovation in and around that has not been very successful and that doesn't mean it's not going to get there at some point right part of American Ingenuity is trying and failing and trying and failing and trying and failing until you find a model that works and credit to those that are trying to do that but it hasn't succeeded where I think there are opportunities that are more direct is modernizing where we perform

[02:08:48] Health Care Services into a lower cost setting that's direct cost savings right we built with the hill Burton act all this infrastructure that is hospitals okay let's point the figure at the industry that I'm most closely associated with and it has been happening some of that work and is and could come out of hospitals into a lower cost setting right why is it let let's just give an example give an example of a procedure that is done in hospitals and out of hospitals and give an example of the cost Delta I would give you the biggest example that has probably had the most impact on on health status and coloral cancer is that if you go back 20 years most colonoscopies were done in a hospital setting okay sometimes people stayed overnight for them right just think about that and and they moved into an outpatient setting you're in and out in 45 minutes plus recovery time from whatever anesthesia you have what did that do to the hospital industry yes it moved business out of one setting into another setting but that's not what really happened what happened is when it got into a more convenient quick High service manageable setting more people in the US started getting colonoscopies because it was easy and it had a screening benefit that's enormous I credit the Ambulatory

[02:10:09] Surgery industry with actually preventing more colon cancers than any innovation in gastroenterology over the last because it's now normal to get these so but just just to make sure I understand the implication of that it's twofold one we've lowered the cost of each colonoscopy but we've probably flattened or even rais the total cost cuz now more people are do the total cost is probably much higher yeah yeah but the her unit cost went way down and everybody got access right so to speak or more people got access and it prevented more cancers which have lots of Downstream cost so the idea of moving things into lower cost setting as appropriate is something we generally have to brace as a way to manage the total cost especially if the demand on hospitals is going to go up with the

[02:10:57] Aging okay so what's the next version of that the next version of that that we're in the middle of is look a hip and a knee replacement used to be a 4-day hospital stay now a lot of it is done on a same day basis in the hospital but you can also do it in an Ambulatory Surgery Center in an hour and again you recover and you walk out the same day and you go home and you do your PT at home and other things what is the difference there in the payer rate for those two about half it costs about half that's a big different you got your 25% right it's significantly different um one of the interesting questions is why does the device not cost less in one setting or another but the total payment is half right so let let's spend a minute on this this is another one of those great great opacities in the Health Care system so um I I need a heart surgery yeah okay so I need a coronary artery bypass and maybe throw in an aortic valve replacement I've got aortic stenosis um I go to the hospital that is within my PO Network to get that procedure done how do how do the economics of that work does the hospital act as the single entity that bills the insurance company for everything the surgeon's professional fee the hospital fee the the device fee for the valve the drugs the ICU stay like how does it work is it bundled yeah well you know sometimes with Choice comes complexity and you're getting into medical billing which has some complexity at the simplest level we break things into professional and Technical expenses okay and I'm going to Define technical but professional may be easier to understand the surgeon who operates on you gets paid a fee to operate on on you for their skill and training and other things and that is professional fee the technical fee does the anesthesiologist also have a pro fee in there good point right there there are others involved in the surgery okay the anesthesiologist who is again trained to provide incredibly sophisticated anesthesia to go on heart bypass Etc gets paid a professional fee got it for that service their personal fee for their time the technical fee is the fee for having the surgery in the building and setting called a hospital in an operating room and in that setting you may use the operating room you may stay in a hospital bed for 3 days you may be in the ICU for a day you may be given a bunch of drugs and medications that are important for that all of that cost goes into one bundle called the hospital drg in

[02:13:43] General the reimbursement system which used to fragment all that stuff has moved into an element of single reimbursement called a drg diagnosis Related Group by the way a government Innovation from Medicare that applies in much of the commercial world today and you get paid a fee for all that stuff now we make our lives a little bit complex because we often send patients confusing bills that lists everything that they had in that drg and an individual price for each one of those things things even though at the end of the day what's going to get adjudicated is one payment very simple and one co-pay if it even exists but we make it very complicated by sending this entire list of everything you had which you know you can imagine as a patient who's just coming out of in recovering from heart surgery the last thing you want to see is a line item of 60 different things that you had done and what the cost of those were especially when those costs bear no connection to what your insurance company or Medicare may have actually paid right it's an what would be the single reimbursement on the three vessel cabbage AVR atic valve replacement oh it's highly highly variable but but pick an average payer

[02:15:03] Medicare somebody's going to reimburse you know let's say 20 something, 25,000 some number for that hospitalization and how much of that is pro fee how much of that is technical fee well the pro Fe is like I said that's us the hospital fee the pro fee may be separate I mean what a physician gets paid to do that could be $750 or ,000 let's say isn't that kind of amazing when people think about like how low that is as a I mean again the number could be higher with other insurance companies and whatnot but the point is yeah there's a big difference because the cost of a you know massive building fathom is that the cardiac surgeon who's operating on your heart might have a proy of $2,000 yeah like people can't fathom that people can't fathom how low that is right because that also bundles them seeing you in

[02:15:51] Clinic them taking care of you for point is they're taking care of you for 5 days in the hospital when you're in the ICU and they're on the floor and again it it it could be lower Medicare might be below, healthare the utility that people again using an economic term the utility that people gain from interactions with different parts of the

[02:16:11] Health Care System vary greatly relative to the actual payments that are made like another way to say what I said is this is why the the American Consumer trusts their doctor when you ask much more than anybody else in the system doctor and nurse right they trust them more than the next would be their hospital where they had their care the least would be the insurance company that doesn't mean the economics flow that way within that but the utility and which which obviously has a qualitative personal component is somewhat disconnected from those payments but if we look at now that $225,000 of technical fee to the hospital I've seen some of these bills and I don't know what to make of them because it seems like yeah the hospital collected a lot but they're getting ripped off on paying things this is where you hear the stories of like the gauze cost $16 like the little piece of 4x4 gauze that you have tens of those that you're going to go through in the case like it's almost like you it's almost like you're back in

[02:17:15] PBM land yeah yeah but I think that's a bit of a red herring I think that that when you say the cost cost so now we have this complexity of you have cost you have price and you have charge yeah explain these dis let me explain this and and again I think this has almost no bearing on macro healthare costs the cost of the gauze is what the manufacturer who makes gauze charges the hospital to buy it it is not $16 for p super of course it's super cheap as is a Tylenol pill or whatever y the price is bundled into that into that group payment that I said so you're not really getting paid that much more than cost for the thing the charge is this artificial construct created by the way in which we bill because of the way insurance billing is constructed that results in the perennial $16 gauze or $4 Tylenol pill or whatever the case may nobody's being paid that amount so why does that even exist it exists because every hospital by Federal Regulation is required to have a charge Master by the way so is every doctor's office so is every that has charges off of which the free market negotiates contracted rates and brings that $4 Tylenol down to 20 cents or the $16 gauze down to making it up because I don't know whatever it is cents and that's what happens and it's I mean it's again this gets administrative costs right this gets to the system has evolved certain ways in which the administrative costs support nonsense like this at the end of the day okay remember what I said about insurance it's not Insurance in healthcare it's a discount card meaning you're you're getting the value of group purchasing so you buy things at a lower cost if you apply that in this setting if you come into to the hospital without insurance you're not getting that group discount that's the bargain made between insurers and providers that you're going to get a better deal it's a discount card so if you come in without insurance uhoh you're going to be exposed to the $400

[02:19:31] Tylenol or the $16 gauze okay and the reality is that's what turns into something that we never really talked about which is bad debt yes there's a lot you know there's a lot of healthare that's provided that has a charge associated with it nobody ever pays billions and billions of dollars in fact I think it's about 40 billion a year or more and then there's of course under Insurance where people you know don't pay their portion of what they owe and again with those kind of prices you can understand some of that right when last I looked at this statistic medical expenses were the leading cause of personal bankruptcy yes that may be the case I don't know that for a fact but I think it might not true lead to medical debt that lead to personal bankruptcy you know is another difficult topic within this area and that's why and it's difficult based on what you just said though s it's difficult based on the idea that this uninsured individual now I want to come back to why is anybody uninsured in 2024 2025 let's come back to the ACA but you you're uninsured and maybe it's because you made a risk adjusted calculation which is hey insurance is going to cost me this many thousands of dollars a year

[02:20:49] I'm young I'm healthy I don't need it in an Ideal World I wish I had some catastrophic coverage now lo and behold I'm back the and guess what I'm getting charged four bucks for Tylenol 16 bucks for gauze and all of a sudden I've got a $250,000 bill that if we weren't playing with stupid Monopoly money would be $14,000 and I could manage that that's the problem and I think what happens as a result is that it either goes to nothing because people don't pay or most

[02:21:16] Healthcare organized Healthcare Systems have the equivalent of a compact with the ensured that rapidly discounts that price Often by tenfold in order to adjudicate that and I think that's very appropriate and yet you still have these unfortunate cases you know I mean the the the Health Care system today the insurance system today the cost of drugs today and the structure that's been created works a lot better if you're in the system not out of the system right and out of the system is uninsured yeah and and the uninsured you know today with with the with the Affordable Care

[02:21:57] Act the uninsured rates have come way down right because it expanded medicaid so the people who could qualify due to whatever percentage of the federal poverty level employment has expanded like the job Market's been good so more people have insurance through that we've already talked about Medicare is growing rapidly because of Aging Medicaid has already hit 90 million people with that expansion and then there's this kind of Gap where people their employers maybe too small to offer insurance they don't qualify for Medicaid because they make too much money and we created these things called the exchanges um and and what that is is the way to take that market and socialize the risk away from Individual risk to group risk and make it more affordable and so a lot of people have been covered through that now we had a bunch of legal debate with the idea was you would do that and then you'd have this thing called the individual mandate which meant you're going to be forced to get into something and again challeng it's important to do that if you're truly trying to manage risk because if you don't have an individual mandate and we can talk about whether or not that's a fair to ask but if you're just putting on your risk hat an individual mandate is essential because you cannot have adverse selection into your risk pool right and that again requires an acceptance that there are many many people who will sign up for insurance that won't need it and they're subsidizing those that need it and you know the argument could be made that's true in Medicare already why people why do people not fight about individual mandates and car insurance well that's my point I think that the legal challenges that occurred to individual mandate and ultimately you know disabled it if you will I'm not an expert on the legal issues but from the perspective of what we were trying to do as a society it didn't help the system nevertheless the exchanges have grown they've been more expensive than people thought but they've grown and and because of the risk um a little bit because of the risk some of it because of the pricing of those Insurance products some of it because of you know whether they look a little bit more like

[02:24:06] Commercial Insurance versus Medicaid there's two flavors out there a lot of complexity but the fact is they've created coverage and access for a lot of people and more importantly they have created coverage and access for working class generally voting American citizens and that means it's a powerful group that has access to this insurance coverage and so them losing it or losing their subsidies becomes a real issue for everybody who's in the environment that has to make decisions on this so what that leaves you with for uninsured obviously undocumented people that don't have US citizenship uh or or some legal ability and and two is there obviously people who choose you know they just decide hey

[02:24:56] I'm young and healthy I don't want to buy on this thing right I'm young I'm healthy I don't I make far too much to qualify for Medicaid but I am opting and my employer doesn't pay me my employer doesn't give me a health insurance and I'm I'm choosing not to buy how many people is that today I don't know it's I mean it's it's not a large number but it probably would be somewhere in the millions so a silly semantic question the ACA is the Affordable Care Act correct it seems like an odd name given that its mandate was not to address price but to address access and if anything it drove up price it drove up cost why I mean it's just silly but was the was there an attempt was the view that the ACA was not only going to address what it clearly set out to address which was access but that in doing so it would reduce cost well first of all it's a political name let's just it's a bill that went through Congress and it's political name um I'm just such

[02:25:52] AAL respectful way to talk about it than the way people talk about it is Obamacare right I mean I don't think that's a you know I I don't I don't think it's I think it's a more respectable way to talk about is the Affordable Care Act and and the Affordable Care Act I think I would just called it the access Care Act is all I'm saying it could still call it coverage act coverage yeah I mean that's really what it is in terms of what it eventually did I think there were a lot of Big Ideas thrown about uh mostly by academics and others that some of the policies within the Affordable Care Act would include affordability and lower cost I mean I just don't think it ended up happening that way for a few reasons and then people will point at each other about well the legal challenges affected this and that the other you know the reality is that it has increased expenditures because we know coverage at a group level that removes you from the direct exposure to the cost of care creates demand and higher expenditures we saw that principl right and and most of these exchange products have generally good physician and and other choice associated with them some are naron networks many of them have a lot of choice so again when you have you prioritize choice and access you know the costs could be higher than one may have guessed on the other hand they have been again as I said incredibly powerful tools to provide coverage because that was the purported goal of the act for those that didn't have it when combined with Medicaid expansion not all states have expanded medicaid by the way either all right I mean that was a state-based thing but in aggregate more people have been covered after the

[02:27:34] Affordable Care Act and therefore expenditures also went up which is what you would expect at a simple level we also talked about the fact that some of the value-based Care constructs that they had haven't been successful I mean CMS has spent more money in their Medicare Innovation arms C MMI in creating the constructs of innovation than they actually saved in the programs they launched right so it hasn't really worked yet again I don't this is

[02:28:02] American Ingenuity right you keep trying and failing trying and failing and maybe one day you'll get it right just hasn't worked yet has there been any credible proposal put forth to create a Medicare program that is uh that covers everyone no what would be required to make that happen well I think the first question would be do you want the federal government covering everybody when the whole purpose of the employer sponsored system is to have choice and to have access to different networks that you can pick from right I don't know that a one-size fits-all model would work I think the second thing and probably from my perspective the more important thing is that if what we've talked about here today Bears some degree of accuracy around what the driver of healthare cost are now and are going to be it's really about health status chronic disease aging drug costs related to the chronic disease the demand coverage is not what's lacking today models of coverage is not what's lacking today so when you say a Medicare program that cover Medicare for everybody isn't Sol it's it's solving the problem we don't have that much what you would rather call that would be price controls if your argument is you want to put them on Medicare because

[02:29:23] Medicare reimburses less than everybody else right commercial insurance or whatever costs yeah then you should just call it we're going to have a price control but then we're moving to a supply side intervention that's a supply side intervention says we're going to constrain everybody's access and choice the reimbursement is going to come down and the infrastructure Will Survive or not survive and what's left will be what you can access that's a different choice because that's what it would do would be a buy down remember one thing and we haven't really talked about it that much this system is built on a lot of cross subsidies right healthy people in our model of insurance cross- subsidize our fellow citizens who happen to be ill in some period of time okay in the same way employer sponsored insurance which reimburses Healthcare at a higher level than Medicare or Medicaid overcomes the unit cost cost under reimbursement of government Healthcare this goes back to the concept the government already behaves as a monopsony here they under reimburse what what you get paid from Medicaid if you're a doctor or Medicare may be below your cost relative and it's cross- subsidized so corporate profitability is subsidizing the government 100% y 100%

[02:30:45] And that cross subsidy creates this Dynamic where you can't have one go away with the other that's why I'm so concerned about the notion that our number of 40 40 to 65 year olds relative to the people that are getting the benefit from government that somewhat under reimburses unit care of cost is going down the people generating the economic rents to cross subsidize the other side is going down and what does that mean for our economy if Healthcare expenditures are growing this quickly I mean that's the essence of this discussion and by the way I haven't answered your question with any reasonable solution to how to cut 25% right I mean you probably need somebody from totally outside the system to come up with an idea for that kind of cut I am much more optimistic about the notion that Healthcare expenditure inflation could be reduced to a level that is somewhat closer to GDP growth and your argument is look we've made it this far where if Healthcare is 18% of GDP as long as we make sure it never exceeds 18% of GDP even though the absolute dollars will go from four to 4 and a half to 5 trillion we're going to tolerate that because our economy is going to grow proportionately not less and that's the price that the United

[02:32:07] States is willing to pay to be first inclass for Choice access and quality we're willing to pay that price yeah and I might frame it that sounds a little fatalist in terms of where we are I mean my framing would be we value quality access choice and Innovation and we're willing to pay for it it has not deterred the US economy to date in terms of being not only the leading but the fastest growing economy and our problem that we need to solve societally is about chronic in the US it's about two things as we outlined it's about the burden of chronic illness and aging and all of these factors that drive worse outcomes that really aren't Healthcare factors again we talked about infant the infant mortality issues the drug and

[02:33:01] Drug access issues and the mortality associated with that homicides violence injuries Etc working on those things plus the chronic illness side from the medical perspective are not anymore about insurance or coverage or whatever they're about addressing those issues directly but to your point Public Health has been an abject failure when it comes to dealing with these things that's right I don't I mean I'm not saying that the solution is public health I mean I think the success that public health the current model in public health had in in infectious disease over the last 75 to 100 years hasn't worked in this setting

[02:33:38] I mean even covid is a good example of that right so much debate exists about what happened there why was us mortality higher than most other developed countries in covid I mean the most effective thing that happened during Co was the development of the vaccines you know which was again us Ingenuity Innovation and spread around the world right in in many many ways and so I I think we have to rethink these models and before we give them more funding we need to make sure that they're doing the right thing for us but if we can bring those things in line I think we can make a difference and I I come back to which

[02:34:08] I learned from you more than anybody else the background nutritional environment if it changed could make a big difference over a 10-year period And if you add to that incorporating a degree of physical activity as we all know this isn't about going from being you know sedentary to running marathons it's about being sedentary to some physical activity and it has a huge potential benefit on the types of health care costs that come from chronic illness and those two things together and addressing some of the US unique issues could bring could bring Healthcare expenditures in line with GDP growth pretty quickly but you have to have that goal over a 10-year period if it's a one or two or threeyear goal we will fail and give up before we try but you can do it over a 10-year period I think and that's where my optimism comes from but anything that's going to be done over a 10-year period has to be government run there's no employer or individual who can subsidize something for with where the remuneration is that far out right well

[02:35:11] I think you have to start by having a discussion around what's our national health objective right I mean I don't we don't have a national health objective right now uh that seems obvious and again unless you just say by default the National Health objective is the ultimate in Access and choice and if that continues to be our objective the system is designed to produce that my point is that we can have access and choice and incrementally put dollars into these other things and make a difference to both without radically cutting access and choice and that's that's what we have to get our head around from a long-term perspective you're right short-term interests from all kinds of

[02:35:56] Industry participants and public participants as well may run counter to that 10-year goal it's why establishing that goal the question is when does that become mean go back to your point around what we did after World War II it was a national goal to have an ecosystem of countries that stood for democracy and protected security around the world and we were willing to invest in it now this may not be an National problem but it is a national problem and so we got to we got to Rally around that so I'm you know

[02:36:26] I've got all my charts here that I've been studying to prep for this and one of the things that stood out to me is one area where we actually spend less than the other developed Nations because we're spending about 2x what they are on everything we spend less on long-term care yes so I guess my question for you is why secondly we haven't talked about one specific disease that is also increasing in prevalence which is dementia um so so those two are pretty linked what do you have to say about that with respect to Future costs well I

[02:36:55] I think our biggest challenge in Innovation for the next 20 years is the management and care of neurocognitive decline whether you formally have Dementia or not one thing is true when you age people live longer they inevitably have neurocognitive Decline and they require more care now I think is a you know the culture in this country just to address the long-term care expenditure piece pretty directly I think there are many positive aspects of the culture of family taking care of generations and and that being something that's passed from generation to generation and that we we spend less in institutionalized long-term care because a lot of that work is done by families now that's also a burden right as people live longer and the cost and complexity of their care as they decline gets higher the cost of providing that care is not just the direct cost but it's lost wages and productivity in the economy as people often women come out of the workforce to take care of the elderly from that perspective so this problem is not just a healthcare problem it could become a macroeconomic problem based upon feeding the workforce and lost productivity the second reason I think this is a huge problem is just the simple and I we w't get too technical simple issue of bloodb brain barrier the traditional pharmace iCal model to care for these diseases may not work once there's onset of disease because of the bloodb brain barrier and the concept there is that you know drugs which go into the body don't get through effectively the barrier between the blood and the Brain to be able to treat brain diseases we need new forms of innovation and this is where I think you will see the prominence of engineering based

[02:38:46] Solutions rather than drug Discovery based Solutions grow materially to help with these diseases right think about what we do today with stimulation and neuros stimulation in Parkinson's that's a device-based therapy I think the role of engineers in healthc care has an infinite future and upside for us because of neurological diseases and we've got to Pivot our model our research our funding to deal with this issue because we're going to go from 65 million-ish people in care today to 90 million by the mid 2030s again go back to my point before of the number of people Prem Medicare declining that's going to help Finance the care for those people so we need models for custodial care meaning where to take care of them and how that isn't a nursing home which is or long-term care which is too expensive you got to make that job easier in the household and we need Innovative engineering based solutions that help improve their cognitive function to make them more self-sufficient to deal with their dementia for a longer period of time so that they're more self-sufficient and less dependent and solving that problem

[02:40:04] I think is one of the grand Frontiers in medicine over the next 10 to 20 years given the Aging of the population because remember the you know we're going to age up through 20132 2033 but those people are then going to live 10 15 years this is a 25e problem and and I don't know that we' found the solution to that so on that on that thread of

[02:40:24] Technology we touched on it really briefly yeah in terms of how AI can help with the absolute messiness of um of reconciliation and adjudication but we didn't talk about technology in other ways and we didn't talk about AI in other ways so what are your sort of broad strr thoughts on the role of technology in any of the variables we've talked about but obviously in cost reduction being that it's the elephant in the room yeah I mean I think today you know if we look at the system and what's being developed in AI administrative cost is the easiest and and first application I think where you can actually see real cost reduction potential so I think we hit that correctly I think I think in the clinical realm you know the electronic medical record which has been a massive industry expense what it has done is created a much more organized system of record but it hasn't really fully translated to a system of engagement for all the stakeholders and I would argue hasn't really been transformative in improving the quality of care relative to other things and it certainly hasn't really improved access or choice in any way from that perspective but taking that foundation and building in the potential benefits of AI in better clinical care better understanding of evidence-based medicine better that has potential from the foundation so while I'm not a big proponent of the fact that the foundation that's been very expensive has a huge return on investment that the industry has seen it has had an organizing effect almost table Stakes that were required to get off paper to enable things like AI to make a difference in the future and you know what's going to be interesting is it'll remain to be seen do the traditional EMR participants or do new entrance really build the AI that does that and I think there's a lot of work going on in that area I think it's early I think the hype is seriously overblown in the near term in terms of the value that it will have but from a long-term perspective conceptually the power of the tool to really improve care not just administrative cost I'm optimistic about so S three hours ago we started talking and I said I had hoped that by the end I would have and and by extension the listeners would have a better understanding of the US Healthcare

[02:42:42] System I can't speak for them but I do speak for myself when I say I honestly think I understand this better than I ever have I appreciate that and that's that's a clear Testament to to you um you know maybe just just to spend one moment on the personal you know um I've talked a lot about my time at McKenzie is a great chapter of my life when I left medicine um you know didn't know what I wanted to do but but knew I didn't want to do clinical medicine at the time um you know what what probably many don't know is you were single-handedly the person that that plucked me out of John's Hopkins and and brought me out to San Francisco uh um and and you along with Hamid samandari were you know the two single most important you just the most important mentors I had there um I you know I owe you such a debt s and it is it's such a pleasure to be sitting down with you today I I don't I wouldn't be where I am today without you um and you're your influence on me is is uh it's it's hard to overstate yeah I I appreciate that incredibly kind but the reality is that you know this and and um The Pride that we have in what you've built and I have and my family has is incredible and the thing about you from my perspective that

[02:43:55] I can't say about virtually anybody else is that what you have built has been purely based upon your intellectual curiosity creativity and drive to know the truth as opposed to anything to do with your personal gain and I I've known you from day one as having worked in that way in the environment that we were in together and all of the different things that you went to do after that in various I mean I remember algae and I remember but the point is it was always driven by that intellectual curiosity and that's something that I wish more people had and I think if there's any benefit of this conversation of us talking about this somewhere out there in your audience there's another person like you who will hopefully solve these problems because they're just as intellectually curious as you it's a gift that the world will never understand the benefit of from what you're doing I appreciate that s and thank you for this incredible uh truly master class on a complicated system I I will say this the single most optimistic thing I take away from this is we might not have to slash the cost by something dramatic like 25% if we can enact the right Pol the right combination of policies

[02:45:13] Technologies pertubations and behaviors and incentives that simply bend the cost Cur towards GDP growth we might actually be fine in the long run I think that's true yeah well thank you for the opportunity thank you [Music]
