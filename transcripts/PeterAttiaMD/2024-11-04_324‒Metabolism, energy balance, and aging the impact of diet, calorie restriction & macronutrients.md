Eric Ravussin is a world-renowned expert on obesity, metabolism, and aging whose pioneering research has shaped much of what we understand today about energy balance and caloric restriction. In this episode, Eric shares insights from his cutting-edge work on energy expenditure—a critical factor in understanding how our bodies regulate weight and appetite. He discusses methods for measuring energy output, energy balance, food intake, and appetite regulation, and explores key studies on macronutrient manipulation. Eric then delves into the CALERIE study on caloric restriction, highlighting insights related to biomarkers of both primary and secondary aging. The conversation also covers the potential of GLP-1 agonists to replicate these effects and looks ahead to how AI and technology could transform metabolic research in the coming years.

[00:00:00] I think people want to believe that there is one perfect diet one perfect way but I just don't buy it no I I'm I'm with you and I think that we are now in the era of precision medicine or personalized medicine and I think that this is what the NIH is embarking on when they do this nutrition for Precision Health when they do this study that I'm also a pi of clinical site with which is molecular transducers of physical activity to look at in Li of your genetic background your environment your socioeconomical status one size does not fit all we have the dietry guidelines they are applied for the entire nation and they tell you you know every time it's the med Med or

[00:00:57] Mediterranean diet or the DASH diet which are the best and all these kind of things but not for all and I think that this is where we are going to have a huge development it's to go I don't think it's going to be individualized but at least for groups of people having the same you know you know different strategies and restriction has to be one of that hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter AA

[00:01:33] well Eric thank you so much for joining me uh I'm sorry that we can't be in person but given that you're in the south of France and I'm over here in Texas that would have made it pretty difficult um because normally we're quite a bit closer you're obviously in uh in Louisiana um but anyway it's wonderful to see you again it has been close to 10 years right I think so I think so too long I've I've Found Me of our interactions yes as as do I um I guess by way of background maybe we can even just give people a bit of a sense of how closely we did work together for for four years um at the time um I was part of an organization called Nui and you were one of the six principal investigators for um what was a very audacious experiment um and and part of something called the energy balance

[00:02:25] Consortium along with uh Kevin Hall Steve Smith Rudy Mike rosenbom and um God him who am I missing uh Mark Mark um sorry I'm blanking on Mark's last name at the NIH Mark wrightman Mark wman yeah how I'm sorry apologies to Mark um and nevertheless uh so this this this was kind of a a once in a-lifetime opportunity to do something that had never been done before which was a multi- center uh uh indirect calorimetry inpatient study that was really aimed at trying to at least pilot what would be necessary to do the definitive experiment to answer a question that I'm sure we're going to talk about a lot today which has to do with the with the nature of calories and weight gain um so

[00:03:11] I I will leave it at that only by way of background to say that we had the the incredible pleasure of working together and uh and really getting into the weeds of of how one technically tries to measure these things and how difficult it is um and and and all of the the challenges and potential pitfalls of this but let's just take a step back and and maybe give folks a sense of your your life's work and your life's passion um you you've been the the head of of

[00:03:36] Pennington biomedical research for how many years now is it 20 years I have been uh for 24 years at Pennington I was associate executive director for clinical science I'm not the head of the Pennington uh but uh yeah I joined uh after spending 2 and a half years at Eli Lily and before I was 15 years intramural NIH and the reason I came to this country was to build the first metabolic chamber or indirect calorimetry chamber to measure energy expenditure in people over periods of hours and days tell folks a little bit about what it means to be intramural versus extramural NIH I think when people hear NIH they sort of have a vague sense of what it is um but maybe that distinction isn't clear to most people yeah the the ni budget is about 33 to $35 billion uh but there is a group which is intramural and uh but most of the money 80 to 85% goes to all the academic institution doing biomedical research in the country now intramural uh I like to be intramural and and just so folks understand what that means that means you are an employee of the NIH you work at the NIH campus and your funding comes from the organization that you work for unlike someone who at Stanford or

[00:05:00] Harvard who's receiving extra mural NIH funds correctly and I was intramural but based in phex Arizona because I worked a lot with the Pim indion we have as you know the highest prevalence of type two diabetes and the second highest prevalence of obesity in the world but uh intramural what I like you are judged after the facts you have a budget and you can do whatever you want but every three years you are judged whereas extra mural as you know we Chase these grants and you have to basically provide preliminary data hypotheses and you are judged before doing the study and I think you can be much more creative being intramural than extramural I'm sure that my colleagues intramural are going to hate me that I say that but it's true they should enjoy to be judged after the facts rather than before tell us a little bit about Pennington it's obviously a pretty unique in institution um and and you've been there as you say for 24 years but yet I suspect it's a it's a place that most people listening to us won't necessarily be familiar with yeah it's becoming I think the largest

[00:06:13] Institution for research in nutrition and obesity uh we concentrate mostly on nutrition and obesity uh we have about 500 people working at Pennington and everybody is doing research we have no teaching I mean yes I have post dos and things like that but no formal teaching uh and we do research and we Chase uh we have maybe a budget of functional budget of 80 million per year uh 50% or 45% of that is NIH extra mural money coming to

[00:06:49] Pennington uh we do some sponsored project for Farm biotech uh we have grants from Association like the American diabet Association our American Heart Association and so on and we do uh basic science clinical science and population science basically which is to reach the community and Implement uh you know some of the discovery into the community the other thing you mentioned a few minutes ago um Eric was the words metabolic chamber and indirect calorimetry and I think at some point because this is going to come up in our discussion as we get into the Weeds on metabolism uh it's going to be necessary

[00:07:35] I think for the listener to kind of understand how those techniques work and I've I know I've discussed this on previous podcast there's at least probably half a dozen episodes where I've explained how one uses the ventilation of oxygen and CO2 to quite accurately estimate energy expenditure and a substrate utilization but it can never be a bad thing to explain it one more time so why don't you explain how it works and uh you can even use the example of when I was in the chamber for a couple of days you know 10 years ago when when I was out at Pennington as a subject or you know pretend subject yeah it there's two two things indirect calorimetry and direct calorimetry you generate your energy metabolism or ATP by oxidative process and you oxidize carbohydrate fat and a little protein you don't want to oxidize too many proteins and this uh basically build up these atps uh which are used online for generation or maintenance of the cells or activity and so on now as a you know when you have this metabolism you produce eat if you have no exercise no external work all the energy which is uh provided in generating this ATP is lost as eat and this is direct calorimetry and I was fortunate when I did my PhD back in loan Switzerland to have access to both indirect and direct calorimetry and you you can really do fantastic studies we did a study of measuring invivo what we call the po ratio you know how many oxygen do you do you need to generate one ATP and all these kind of things by the combination of these two techniques now going to indirect calorimetry this is an easier one than direct I mean direct you have really and sorry just to interrupt you for a second

[00:09:44] Eric um when you're doing direct calorimetry obviously when it comes to something like food if you want to know the energy content of food you can burn the food and measure the heat when you're doing it otherwise on a living organism is it possible to do direct Cal imetry on something as large as a human or is that something you're typically doing on you know a mouse or something that is small enough that the chamber in which you can measure changes in heat is much smaller and easier to manage yeah direct calry is really measuring heat losses and we lose heat by convection evaporation and we measure these two kinds of heat and this is basically equal to your metabolic rate you generate energ energy by oxidation of substrate and the byproduct is heat and with that exercise or external work energy in is equal energy out and this is what we measured and I did a lot of these studies during my PhD but then at that time we decided to uh build a metabolic chamber which is like an hotel room uh in which you can live one day or two days and I think you stayed for two days in one of these rooms at uh

[00:11:03] Pennington in Baton Rouge and here we measure oxygen consumption and CO2 production oxygen is used to oxidize a substrate it produces CO2 and water and knowing oxygen consumption CO2 production you can calculate the energy expenditure or the energy generated by this oxidative process and you can also calculate the substrate that you oxidize

[00:11:33] If the ratio between the vco2 the CO2 production and the oxygen consumption is one you oxidize carbohydrate if it's 7 you oxidize fat and protein is something in between 082 depending the protein yeah and so basically by measuring just these two things um the actual concent ration of oxygen that's being consumed and the rate at which it's being consumed and the same with production of

[00:12:05] CO2 you can really infer two things one the total energy consumption total calories consumed K Cals and by looking at the ratio of the vco2 and the V2 you can calculate what fraction of that is coming from oxidizing carbohydrate versus fat and and and and you know having spent probably a total of eight days of my life inside metabolic

[00:12:30] Chambers across a period of a couple of years it never ceases to amaze me never just how accurately these rooms work because I use an indirect calorimeter all the time measuring V2 Max which is another type of it's it's basically the exact same technology but it's easier because you're strapping The Mask to your face so you have perfect access to exactly the uh O2 consumption and the

[00:12:57] CO2 production but it's doing the exact same calculation it's going to tell you exactly how much energy you're utilizing and um where the substrate comes from and of course in that situation you're interested in knowing the maximum amount of V2 or O2 consumption um so what do you what would you estimate as the error on uh the the hotel room sized indirect uh calorimeter where you don't have the luxury of just slapping a mask to the person's face for a few days yeah yeah when I was at NIH we did a lot of reliability uh testing in the same person or you can calibrate the system you calibrate the system with uh standard gas that you know the exact concentration to calibrate the analyzers but you can also mimic someone by burning alcohol or propane and you can vary the rate of burning and this is what we did when we did this study with four different chambers we uh validated the chambers once against the other one and we accepted to have 3% deviation for

[00:14:10] CO2 or oxygen based on stoic geometry you know exactly how much alcohol or propane you burn you know how much CO2 should be produced and how much oxygen has been consumed and this is what we did and you are right they are very very precise and you don't have the inconvenience of the Mask I mean you couldn't measure with a mask for 24 hours or two days right because when I was in that chamber for a couple of days on separate occasions we were trying to replicate as much as possible my life so

[00:14:44] I had three meals prepared I had an exercise bike in there I had uh um I had weights in there equipment to to do everything and we were very interested in seeing how that would compare with for example what we knew I was experiencing in the outside world based on um when we could put a mask on me and also separately if you may recall Eric we also spent uh about 10 days using doubly labeled water which I'm sure we'll talk about at some point as well as a a more realworld example of this so all of that is to say that um scientists such as yourself have some pretty high fidelity tools to measure energy expenditure um but it comes with a caveat which is it has to be done under this very controlled setting um these people need to be in the hospital and not just in a hospital but in a metabolic Ward and inside a chamber which is you know basically a NASA grade gas chamber with how many sensors by the way just out of curiosity how many O2 and CO2 sensors would be in a particular chamber we don't need many because we need to homogenize the air in the room in one corner of the room is the same as the other Corners uh and that's why but we have to measure humidity you have to measure uh temperature because you have to do this correction what we call stpd which is standard pressure Etc to calculate the energy generated by this oxygen but uh yeah I mean it's it's quite phenomenal the accuracy of those and to go go back to your question the accuracy is is or the Precision is about 2 and a half% now if you repeat yourself five times or and myself there's a little bit more variability because we vary from one day to another one and so on but I mean this is quite amazing that we can calculate so precisely your energy expenditure during a day or two days and so on I wish we had the same system to calculate the that we put in yeah that's a great point we outside of having food prepared in a metabolic kitchen which of course was also done for for for this experience um we're I think at best we're probably plus or minus 10% right I mean it's very difficult to estimate energy intake and if when it's in Free Living it's it's worse I mean you know when you do that under supervision and you provide all the meals like Kevin Hall is doing like we're doing then you have a good estimate and you subtract what is returned on the plate or this kind of things but it's not it's not normal life and uh as soon as you go to normal life and free living conditions things are falling apart well I think I think that is a a really nice uh intro into kind of a philosophical question that will take us towards some of the experimental work so um I was actually going to launch into the explanation of the energy balance model and and talk about the the work that you and and and the other folks that we just talked about did a decade ago but but let's pause for a moment on the statement you just you just said which was look in the Free

[00:18:14] Living environment we cannot estimate energy intake worth a damn and and which is to say that 99% of people out there who aren't weighing every single morsel of food they eat every single time they open their mouth which again is virtually nobody um are going to have enormous variability in what they're eating and so I put myself in that category right I pay no attention to how much I'm eating in terms of weight I'm just sort of eating by kind of my appetite uh sometimes I overeat too much my appetite gets the best of me I'm surrounded by you know highly palatable foods that I overeat and other times you know I'm just really busy like yesterday

[00:18:55] I just didn't get around to eating that much but here's what's interesting Eric my weight lives within about a 2B uh variation for years and I don't think I'm unique in that I would guess that you're pretty similar as well I think many of us find ourselves in kind of a couple of pounds of variation most of which is probably water weight varying over years and yet we're not really paying attention in excruciating detail to how much we eat so first of all do you agree with the assessment that that's not an uncommon phenomenon yes but on the other hand if you take your lifetime history maybe you're an exception but I have gained some weight when I got married uh in 1975 uh I weighed 69 kilos now I weigh close to 77 uh now it's 50 years later of course but uh you know you you have this change you have also a CH change in your body composition yeah uh and it's very rare that people are staying the same uh constantly I mean you may be an exception no no I yeah I I I would not suggest that I'm an exception I've had probably more variation in my weight than even what you're describing over the period of time but when I guess the question I'm getting at Eric is how does the body regulate energy storage which is effectively what is determining our weight it's how much are we storing as fat how much are we storing as lean tissue um that seems very very regulated despite very little control over the input and the output we are free living animals who you know live in an environment with endless inputs so we have to somehow regulate that um and frankly very little reason to do deliberate outputs right like obvious ly the majority of our energy expenditure is based on essential function of life um you know just the the the necessary

[00:21:06] ATP production as you described it for cellular function um but it's not like most of us are out there expending energy deliberately I.E exercising and moving you know uh NE necessarily to to expend energy so as we as we enter this discussion of the energy balance model let's just talk about energy balance why are we so largely able to conserve

[00:21:34] Mass despite very noisy inputs and outputs into the black box yeah I I think I had an answer but I hope that I had an answer but I don't and I think that we are still you know when uh leptin was discovered it was a haha moment we have a signal which comes from the energy storage and therefore you know it seems to regulate food intake also energy expenditure and all that I was fortunate to have access to uh the three Turkish leptin deficient people that we measured in these Chambers in in in Baton Rouge and uh we thought that we would have a clue and it was not the case we know that leptin is very good to defend against the loss of weight when it becomes extreme but it doesn't work on the other side of the equation when you creep up you know with your weight because you become leptin resistant and you know your leptin is not telling you stop to eat and I I think that uh this this was uh we learned a lot about the biology of energy balance thanks to leptin but then we need to think that we have also signals coming from the fat-free Mass now what is the fat free

[00:23:00] Mass you know we measure it as everything but the fat and we call that fat free Mass but you know it's liver it's uh it's muscle skeletal muscle it's everything but the fat and I think that there are signals that we are still chasing you know John blundel showed that we eat according to our fat free Mass which is basically we eat according to our resting metabolic rate because fat freeass is the m determinant of your resting metabolic rate but what are the signals I don't know I mean I I still don't know and I we have to be uh you know modest here and say there are still things that we don't understand when it comes to this energy balance now I can understand that why why do you you don't weigh uh gain 5 kilogram over this coming year because you know in response to to creeping up your weight you burn more energy you know if you do the same physical activity this extra 5 kilos or 10 pounds is going to cost you more energy your resting metabolic rate is creeping up and basically you offset that but why are we so good at maintaining like you said within a couple of pound over a year or two years or three years or five years and I think that we are still missing some signals but I think that there are signals coming from you know when fgf21 which is a signal coming from the liver was discovered I said oh maybe that it or when you have some of the uh myocin you know coming from the skeletal muscle I said maybe this is it and it's it's it's not been it and I think that we have to be modest and say hey we still have things to discover when it comes to this Reg regulation of energy balance but as a population we have not been very good I mean from the 1980s to 2010 the American population has gained 10 kilogram uh you know it's 22 pounds in uh 30 years it means that there is still the major driver is this environment and the change in the environment has been the trigger of this weight gain but of course most people some people are successful some are less and uh this is a problem and of course now we have an epidemic of obesity and uh you know it has replaced the contagious the disease of the past and now we have all these constellation of conditions which are associated with obesity so Eric if you were to guess which I think is the best we can do although I think it's informed guessing I don't think we're just guessing in the dark how much of the uh regulation do you think is occurring on the appetite side meaning feedback from uh feedback from whatever is happening in the system and let's just POS it as you said that it's coming from the lean part of the system so the organs the skeletal muscles all but the adapost tissue and that that is working to feed into the appetitive system uh or think the balance is more on the expenditure system where those signals are feeding to make us move a little bit more uh or simply as you say just it's the extra weight you have to move around if you if you're going to carry you know people should pick up what 10 kilos is that's an awful lot of weight if you have to carry an extra 10 kilos up a flight of stairs and every time you get up and move around you're going to expend more energy um so so so do you have a sense of the balance of that uh of that regulatory pressure yeah Peter when I first joined the NR I I did a study in

[00:27:08] Pima Indians who are very prone to weight gain as you know and we measure in 150 people the 24-hour energy expenditure as well as the resting metabolic rate and we found that there was large variability between people after adjusting for their body size fat free mass and fat mass now we do better because we have organ size and we do MRI and all these kind of things but there is variability and this variability is associated with family membership in other words we can say that there is a genetic background to that but what we found was that low those people in the lower tertile of this metabolic rate adjusted for body size we at much higher risk of gaining weight but when we try to attribute the weight gain either to energy expenditure being low or the other equation intake was 80% it means uh you know I have always this this it reminds me there are so many system which are uh basically regulating energy expenditure and food intake take nicotine nicotine is a stimulant of energy expenditure smokers have higher metabolic rate but they have less appetite take the activity of your sympathetic nervous system it is also thermogenic but it cost it cut appetite and I think that we have to understand better these two system But to answer your question I would say 80% is on the side of the energy intake intake yeah okay that's that's sort of been my intuition as well um but because I don't keep up with this literature nearly as much as I used to I I I wanted to make sure that that was still largely the the the view of of the people at the

[00:29:11] Forefront of this field and and you know for example uh sorry to interrupt but uh we know that uh exercise is pretty bad for weight loss if you just tell people okay go to the gym like three times or you even do Under supervision people don't lose weight and Donley at University of Kansas has done ton of study like that and the uh physical activity for weight loss is a B minus at

[00:29:40] Best in term of evidence that he plays a role and let's talk about why because again it is counterintuitive I mean again I I I I know this and I preach this to my patients left right and Center which is you know you you probably heard me say Eric I I will I will go to my grave maintaining I suspect uh until New evidence emerges that that exercise is the single most important thing we need to do for health but I'm always quick to follow that up if asked with but it's not the tool you're going to use to regulate body weight right energy intake nutrition is the more important tool to regulate body weight um and so explain to people why perhaps like if you could provide a teic explanation for why because it is counterintuitive right if you just look at the human body as a machine it you should have no preference for expenditure of energy versus input of energy that you you should say they're equally efficacious but but again any clinician will tell you that's not true and any scientist will tell you that's not true but do we have a reason for why it's not true yeah I I I think uh you know first of all if you uh try to put calories on your exercise it's easy on a bicycle you know the efficiency see 25% you know the workload and so on and you can calculate or you can use your mask and measure oxygen consumption it's very easy like that and I think that there is a compensation now there is probably a higher you know exercise very uh vigorous exercise is anorectic you don't want to eat after you finish a math on or or at least I don't no and and by the way just to project I interviewed George Brooks from Berkeley recently and he shared with me on the podcast something I didn't know before which was that lactates specifically is probably partially driving the anorexia we experience following intense exercise that might not be present with low intensity exercise so I thought that was an interesting way to connect a fact that I think most people appreciate which is go off and do you know interval training the last thing you want to do for the next hour or so is e but light exercise has the opposite effect I think it drives a little bit appetite and I think uh Tim Church who was at

[00:32:08] Pennington did a study called e- mechanic and basically they measured every calorie spent on exercise on a treadmill on a bicycle agrometer and all that and look at the weight of the people with these different doses of exercise and there was a compensation now was that what what it didn't measure uh was to use W label water did they compensate by being less active out of their periods of exercise you know you you have 90 minutes of exercise but then you know you relax a little bit more rather than fidgeting or moving and so on or you sleep a little bit longer uh this he didn't measure but there was this compensation with food intake and I think uh first of all I didn't say say that exercise is not good for health right no no no I didn't I didn't I didn't suggest you were I was just making sure people knew the distinction between I want to make sure because I'm

[00:33:10] I'm an afficianado of exercise know how good it is for health but it's not as good for weight control in general and I think that uh you know you you have to do the calculation of how many calories are burned you you know when you run a k or a mile and so on versus how quickly you can ingest the calories the the the same amount or much more and I think that there is a difference here that people understand but exercise and physical activity is the key for weight loss maintenance and you know the the weight registry uh from Reena wing and Jim Hill they showed that those were SU successful at maintaining the weight loss at 5 years after the intervention where those who engage in more physical activity and I still believe that you know a nutritional approach to uh weight loss without physical activity or exercise prescribed is is not a good strategy we should Implement both and try to have people enjoying the exercise most people I remember one of my colleague Richard mman said I would never exercise I'd rather be sitting in a cold bathtub to generate some heat rather than exercise and there are some people who cannot exercise but you know

[00:34:45] I I I think again this is from childhood that you take the taste of exercise that you become more physically active in the rest of your life it's not at the age of 40 because you have too much weight that they can tell you oh you have to do your 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous ex activity and all that it doesn't work in general but I think physical activity is a key uh point in metabolic Health in general well I agree with that completely when I look at the the data from Jim Hill that you've just cited um

[00:35:25] I've always found it difficult to refer the direction of causality and it so so you're you're correct that the people who are most successful in maintaining weight loss are going to be on balance far more likely to be people who do a lot of exercise than those who don't um and so of course it could be that doing a lot of exercise is a valuable tool to drive weight maintenance I.E maintenance of energy balance alternatively it could be the people who metabolically get fixed through weight loss are the ones that have an easier time exercise in but

[00:35:58] I will say this and I'm curious how robust the data are I do think one thing that exercise can do for you and I feel this personally and I know a lot of my patients do as well is yes you know you could go ride your bike for an hour and you could burn 600 kilo calories and you can eat 600 kilo calories in way less than an hour but exercise seems to sharpen your appetite to a point that makes you a more responsible eater if that makes sense in other words I think it hones your repetitive signals and the one thing you as the individual have to do is just be mindful of the speed at which you eat so that you give the brain a moment to recognize what is happening so let me give you an example of how that works tangibly if I do like a zone two bike ride for an hour again that's going to be for me I know because I measure it

[00:36:57] I measure it exactly that's going to be about 600 pardon me 750 to 800 k Cal is how much energy I will expend in your resting uh no total total energy expenditure is 750 uh to 800 KCAL in the hour so call it 800 to make the math about easy um so if I wait an hour before I eat and I don't eat very quickly I don't do the usual Peter AA there's someone who's going to take the plate from me if I don't finish this right away um I won't overeat and and I'll be fine for the rest of the day it will re my appetite will actually be not it won't I won't have a hyperbolic appetite um conversely if I go to eat within 20 minutes 30 minutes and I pay no attention to the speed at which I eat I can easily consume a thousand calories in that one sitting and abgate the entire energy effect of the exercise obviously I'm still getting all the benefits of the exercise so first of all curious if you have seen this if you have any insight into the effect of exercise on how we subsequently regulate appetite and how we might sense the hunger hormones everything from leptin gin uh and and and even gp1 yeah I I you know I don't have an answer to that because it's not my field uh energy intake but on the other hand you just mentioned the glp1 I think these gut hormones I mean you take gp1 Gip cck uh p p glucagon if if you put glucagon and

[00:38:44] Insulin I was talking about the gut uh the GI hormones but anyway I I think that there is no question now we start to know more because they are such good targets for weight management we start to know more about the physiology of these hormones and I think that there's no question in my mind that the speed at which you deliver this food in the stomach and it leaves the stomach is very important for the kinetic of these gut hormones which are important for the regulation of your food intake in general and I think uh there there I think this is one of the thing that uh these glp1 and combination of peptides now is shed light on is that they are potent uh you know modulators of your intake now the interaction between the exercise that you do before and the meal that you have 20 minutes after and the speed of the meal and all that I don't know this triangle how it works but I think it would be a very good topic of research to know you know the interaction between your physical activity or the bout of exercise the speed at which you ingest the calories and the delivery of these gut hormones yeah and and and again to make it an even more interesting experiment but now much more complicated you introduce a fourth variable which would be the macronutrient composition of the meal itself at isocaloric substitutions you know and and maybe that's something we'll talk about now as we go back to the the idea of energy balance so so you know going back to how you and I met and um the the kind of work that that we were interested in we we we were interested in a question very specific question and I like specific questions uh because you know the the more the more specific uh the question the easier it is to design an experiment to test it and the more likely you are to get an answer that you can interpret as highly probable and uh feel free to modify this Eric but I think the question we were trying to ask was under isocaloric conditions does varying the macronutrient composition specifically between carbohydrate and fat while holding protein constant have any bearing on non-deliberate energy expenditure would you first of all would you agree with that statement and then we can turn it into English but just scientifically would you agree that that was the question we we were trying to answer yes it was the question the the isocaloric is the important word that's right that's right you know because now can you do that in the everyday life under you know that's right not isocaloric condition but what you want to eat yep and which of course we'll we'll we'll talk about that in Spades but this was a very important question although truthfully I think most people felt the answer was known right I think most people well I guess I should translate what I just said into

[00:42:04] English feel free to interject and help me uh what we basically said was if you give people a bunch of people meals let's just not even use a bunch of people one individual you take one individual and you feed them meals on subsequent days or weeks or whatever where you don't change the total number of calories one iota you don't even change the amount of protein you simply manipulate the ratio of carbohydrate and fat such that obviously when one goes up the other has to go down such that you can preserve the total number of calories and when you feed people meals under those conditions the null hypothesis should be that their energy expenditure doesn't change why would holding a fixed number of calories in to this system change the number of calories that the system expends again it's important that we held protein constant because we know about the thermogenic effect of protein so that can actually sway things if you change protein a lot um but the alternative hypothesis that was being tested was no actually if you really swing fat and uh carbohydrate a lot you could indeed change energy expenditure would you would you add anything to the

[00:43:23] English version of the question no I think I think it was the question and we were a little bit skeptical uh it was the start of the carbohydrate insulin model and uh you know we were used to the energy balance model and uh but I think it was a good question and I like the way we kind of debated that with the red team the Blue

[00:43:49] Team if I recall correctly and we were arguing about the best design and at the end you know now if I had to read designed this study I I would do it differently but uh well let tell tell people how it was done and then tell people what you would do different because this is probably an experiment that that might be worth redoing under improved conditions but I'm very I'm very curious because I haven't given this much thought but I'm very curious as to what you would do different but let explain to people how this experiment was done the experiment was done to do a high isocaloric uh intake or over four weeks

[00:44:28] I think we had the basine diet which was the sad diet the standard American diet and we had after a low carbohydrate diet or ketogenic diet for four weeks and the hypothesis was that and this was led by the people we have been bringing up the uh carbohydrate insulin model uh saying that you create a basically uptake of these substrate from the blood into the storage mostly the adpost issue and maybe some of the in the liver and you kind of deplete from uh substrate or energy substrate your circulation and it puts you in a state of semistarvation what is happening when it goes to the brain when you have semi starvation you shut down your energy expenditure you increase your appetite and this was uh playing with that saying that now if we switch to a diet which is going to be less conducive to storage

[00:45:41] I.E less insulin secretion because it was less less than 10% carbohydrate between 5 and 10% if I recall correctly uh we would cause this uh you know basically this semi starvation condition in the systemic circulation and this would basically increase your energy expenditure and I think that David lvic at the time had some data already showing by W label water that there was an increase but we were arguing that doubly label water is not precise enough it goes back to our discussion about indirect calorimetry and we said why don't we do it in the confinement of a metab public chamber and this is what we did and to my surprise there was an increase at least early because we had couples of I I didn't go back to the papers but we had measurements uh you know every week for two days if I recall correctly for the four weeks and uh the first week and maybe the second week there was an increase which was significantly higher in sleeping metabolic rate as well as 24-hour energy expenditure under the ketogenic diet and boom it it was yes there is an increase and uh now was that a significant physiological increase I mean we can argue about that you know when when we talk about metabolic adaptation because people are talking about that now uh we always say we need at least 150 calories in the study we achiev statistical significance but it was just above 100 calories per day uh but you know it was there and I was surprised myself of that now we didn't measure the appetite of the people I mean you know were they less hungry under the ketogenic diet now it brings us to all the weight loss studies which have been done either with a lowfat diet or low carbohydrate diet if you do a metaanalysis it seems that there is a slight advantage to the ketogenic diet for the weight loss period and uh you know I mean basically I was surprised and I was as a Swiss you know I was kind of a little bit more neutral sometime rather than the two camps the red and the blue I I I was surprised that there was this effect but it disappeared at the fourth week or the third and the fourth week but anyway now Eric if so so again just to make sure people understand that finding so the the finding and I'm glad you remembered it cuz I forgot I I forgot the numbers I didn't think it was 100 for some reason

[00:48:32] I thought it was 90 but again it who cares at that point it depends we had sleeping metabolic rate or 24 hours right that's right yeah that's that's right now so um what the study basically found and the study was again it was a very well-designed study in that you know there were maybe 16 subjects which is obviously sounds like a very small number and it is but given the complexity and cost of keeping 16 subjects housed in a hospital for a month and then also putting them in metabolic Chambers every few days uh you know this isn't a St study that you're going to do with you know 500 patients um but to increase the statistical power of the study it was a crossover study which meant that every patient was their own control and that's what allows you to get away with having so few subjects um so interestingly I think it's safe to say that the effect size was large enough that it suggested a signal um but not so large that it dis positively answered the question and in many ways it it served as uh fodder for more questions which I guess is not uncommon in research right it's very rare that one experiment gives you the definitive answer and rather it just points you in a slightly different direction and gives you more questions which then begs the the question uh which is you know if if if if resources were not a limit what would be the follow-up experiment to that yeah I I wish I had an answer I mean I'm I'm tortured between very well controlled studies like we do like Kevin

[00:50:14] Hall does where you basically domicile the people you feed them uh whatever you want you know exactly what you feed them and you look at outcomes I mean I like that but then how do you transpose that in real life and one of my mentor was JP flat and JP flat says you know obesity scientists they have a tendency to either look at the expenditure side of the equation or the energy intake but they never put the two together and he he was right because you know a lot of studies you have an outcome which is on this side or on this side and you maintain the other one and I think that uh to me uh designing a study uh would be first of all in Freel living condition but it would need a lot of people uh because you know you can prescribe all what you want to people they're going to do what whatever they want at the end of the day some of them if you screen them very carefully are going to be much more compliant and dear and to the instruction but this is what needs to be done and by changing here we changed not the calories just the composition of the two diet 10% carbohydrate versus 45% or 50% carbohydrate in the other diet and that's all what we did and I think we concentrated only on the energy expenditure but we even didn't ask very much they had visual analog scale if they were more hungry or all these kind of things but we kind of ignored the food intake that we were clamping and this is not real life you you you know if you do something and you know you you talk about engaging on physical activity regimen or you know exercise and all that I mean you have to look at the impact on the other side and this this is the same question that I have now I'm not helping you in designing the perfect study by saying that but but on the other hand the again we have good tools to measure energy expenditure we have reasonably good tools to measure where do the calories come from but we have no tools to measure energy intake but it's going to come I bet you that you know within I may not be here but within a couple of decades we'll have a color here which is going to measure your calories coming from fat carbohydrate or protein yeah and I think

[00:53:00] I think it should be sooner than that Eric I mean I really do think as image recognition uh gets better and better with AI to me I I would actually hope that within a decade if not less we are at the point where if you can weigh something and take a photograph of it you know we should have enough training data that you should be able to know exactly what is in it now that doesn't account for how much of that thing you eat but assuming you you have something that you weigh and you can photograph and you say I ate all of it or I ate half of it that should we should be able to do better than 10% we should be able to do within 5% what is what is the um uh what is the caloric uh density of that food and the the Macer nutrient breakdown again when I and and

[00:53:52] I wouldn't have said that 5 years ago like five years ago I would say that's impossible but give given what I'm seeing with image recognition in AI um that to me has to be the future for nutrition research um in a free living environment I think you put your finger on the the exact point and now I'm the pi of one of the six clinical sites for nutrition for Precision Health and you you know this is basically a uh ancillary study of all of us all of us is a million Americans uh who are basically providing bio samples access to their uh Health electronic records and all that and then this subside this substudy is really to look at the intersection between their health and their nutrition and uh there is three modules one is on uh 10,000 people and one of the way to measure is exactly this little camera sitting in your glass on your glasses and also a system which is measuring if you are chewing or not you know it's it's not enough to see the food and going but do they is it chewed and I I I agree with you I mean I was not thinking about that I was thinking about something much more like like a

[00:55:19] CGM you know who was dreaming of CGM 30 years ago when I was working with the p we were not thinking about that now you have CGM and you you you can measure your probably your insulin from contact lenses and things like that and I think this progress are going to help us now are we going to be smarter at designing the study I'm not so sure but we'll have the tools to be a little bit more real life rather than incarceration in metabolic w yeah I mean I I think that um and and again it's you know you're you're so much more thoughtful on this Eric because it is your world it's not my world but I occasionally will think about it um but as I'm sitting here now reflecting on it with you I my my intuition is that the questions are complicated enough that the difference between efficacy and Effectiveness have to be separated in studies and I I think if this question of macronutrient composition isocaloric macronutrient manipulation impacting energy expenditure is to be put to rest it it it can only answer that question it cannot attempt to answer the impact of appetite uh as a movable variable it can do it as a swing variable meaning as you said you can force people to eat a clamped amount of food and then measure subjectively or even using you know ppy and gin other hormones um so somewhat objectively somewhat subjectively measure a petitive response to that but I think I think the biggest mistake of that study was actually not creating a big enough divide in the macronutrients

[00:57:12] I think as an efficacy study that was testing a theory just a theory with again you start with a very theoretical response uh and then you build from there to say okay is this Theory applicable in retrospect I think it should have been more extreme in the carbohydrate and fat differences I think one should have been if the carbohydrate insulin model was being tested one should have been a very very very high insulin diet and a very very low insulin diet that were isocaloric I'm with you to take the extremes to to really see the system yeah yeah yeah and by the way let's assume you do that experiment and you get a difference of 250 K Cal a day well you still don't know if a ketogenic diet is a better diet in a free living environment because you're probably not comparing it to somebody who's eating 80% carbohydrates so then you still have to do the next experiment which is maybe the one we did and then ultimately you have to be able to do the Free Living experiment where people make their own choices based on appetite um but that's you know that has to be sequenced I think to answer the questions um so anyway these are difficult these are difficult and costly experiments to do but Al also one thing that you you know

[00:58:39] I still have in my mind all the studies which came from Europe about modulating the composition of the diet and look at the impact on the matching of oxidation to the intake and you know even Steve Smith that we we were working with did this study called adapt it was isocaloric all across but all of a sudden you continue with more fat the fq of the diet the food quoti was decreased and then it takes days to basically have a matching of your RQ to the fq which means you oxidize what you eat whereas if you do the contrary you increase carbohydrate it takes one day and that's why I still believe and back in Switzerland we did this study where we were giving extra fat as LCT longchain triglyceride or MCT because the MCTS are oxidize quicker and we found that against the culprit is always the fat and you know we are very good at matching carbohydrate oxidation to carbohydrate intake very good it it's very difficult first of all you have what 500 gram ofen stores 100 in the liver 3 to 500 in the muscle that's all it means you know if you have a lot of carbohydrate that's a huge signal and uh protein the same thing you know how difficult it is to build up your muscle mass or your protein mass in the body by just eating more protein you have to exercise or you have to take anabolic steroids or whatever uh but the fat is the is the one which is not regulated that's why I still have this problem with the carbohydrate insulin model it's it it works let's say there wasn't slight increase in energy expenditure it seems to work for weight loss it's better with ketogenic diet than with a lowfat diet but on the con you know in your entire life I don't think it works and piling the fat I mean you have done some some of that oh yeah no I I I I did it for three years my intuition is that um and this always sounds like a cop out when you say it and I hate when people say it but I do think it's kind of true when it comes to nutrition is um there's so much heterogeneity between individuals both genetically and environmentally that we have to release our agenda from this idea that there is a perfect diet for everybody even even never mind health even when it comes to weight maintenance let's keep let's pick a simpler variable which is nothing but a subset of Health weight maintenance as a as as one piece of the health puzzle it strikes me as impossible to suggest that there is a true diet that is good for everybody I think that again based on a person's genetics and their own living Evolution I.E their epigenetics and their environment and other factors psychological factors which of course can be quite genetic um that there are either several or few dietary options that are easiest for a person to adhere to to maintain weight balance and I think that carbohydrate restriction especially extreme carbohydrate restriction happens to be one of the more efficacious ways for individuals to restrict something in the larger service of restricting calories because at the end of the day whatever you choose to restrict whether it be certain macronutrients alcohol the time during which you allow yourself to eat or just directly the number of calories some form of restriction is necessary for weight balance in an infinite food environment which is the one that we have now found our eles living in for the past 0.01% of our genetic existence as a species so it's a very it's a very new problem that we have to be so surrounded by infinite nutrition and therefore it requires some degree of restriction and you just have to pick the pick your poison do you want to directly restrict calories we're going to talk about that that's the calorie study do you want to pick do you want to restrict the timing in which you eat we're going to talk about that as well that's time restriction make a smaller and smaller eating window or do you just want to pick some boogey men within the diet and say they're the bad guys I don't eat fat

[01:04:02] I don't eat carbs I don't eat animal protein I don't eat whatever and if I do that enough I'm going to also restrict energy intake and and and so so that's not a very satisfying answer right I think people want to believe that there is one perfect diet one perfect way but I just don't buy it no I I'm I'm with you and I think that we are now in the era of precision medicine or personalized medicine and I think that this is what the ni is embarking on when they do this nutrition for Precision

[01:04:39] Health when they do this study that I'm also a pi of clinical site which is molecular transducers of physical activity to look at in lie of your genetic background your environment your social economical status one size does not fit all we have the dietry guidelines they are applied for the entire nation and they tell you you know every time it's the med Med or

[01:05:11] Mediterranean diet or the DASH diet which are the best and all these kind of things but not for all and I think that this is where we are going to have a huge development it's to go I don't think it's going to be individualized but at least for groups of people having the same you know you know different strategies and restriction has to be one of that but now how do you restrict do you restrict by public policies by you know taxing things or yeah I I I I feel

[01:05:48] I feel strongly against that but of course I'm I'm a staunch I I would describe myself as a pretty staunch libertarian when it comes to that kind of stuff not an extremist um I do believe there's a role for government but but I I I I think that um I think long-term compliance and and and Trust on the part of the public will not come through that that type of environment um so what I think is really the answer is one is is better education and I don't mean education like we're going to sit kids down in first grade and teach them this I just mean public education and and better advocacy and educ education from the scientific and medical community which says kind of what I just said a few minutes ago which is hey you're not broken you're not defective but you might be one of the people for whom the average approach is not going to work but Step One is every one of us needs to accept that in exchange for living in the greatest period of civilization which is where we all live right none of us would trade places with the King of France or the king of England 500 years ago right you just wouldn't do it right I'd rather be the most average human being in 2024 than the single most important person in 1400 so so so we just have to accept the fact that we are all so shockingly privilege to be alive at this moment but that privilege comes with a couple of expenses comes with some costs and one of the costs is we live in an environment that has a little bit of toxicity with respect to things like food and we we have to we have to pay a price we have to pay a price we're going to have to make a tradeoff and a restriction and I just think people knowing that can take a breath and go ah okay I'm not broken now different people will have to do a greater amount of restriction that's just the way the cards crumble not everybody has the same

[01:07:48] IQ not everybody has the same athleticism not everybody has the same you know emotional intelligence and not everybody has the same metabolism so some people are going to have to be you know not very restrictive they just have to be somewhat mindful of what they eat and the cards fall into place that's my wife barely thinks about anything and it all works out and you get people like me in the middle I have to be thinking about it every day not crazy it doesn't have to occupy my every minute of my life but I can't eat on autopilot and of course there are people even further where Unfortunately they they're going to have to be very very Mindful and restrictive of what they eat in lie of potentially using drugs like glp1

[01:08:30] Agonist and and then I think that's that's step one Eric in my view and then step two is which goes to your point about personalized Precision Nutrition then what we need are the technological breakthroughs that allow people to become their own laboratory animals and allow people in the real world in the

[01:08:49] Free Living environment to do the empirical stuff that you and I are talking about and will talk about with respect to the experiments to test the hypothesis you know how much how much fat and protein and carbohydrate should I be eating to optimize my appetite to to to to optimize and regulate my appetite and my energy expenditure and again we're sitting here now talking about the fact we can't even give people that tool yet like we don't have the tool that allows the person to do that test with any degree of accuracy um so I know that's not the most optimistic response but that's kind of my view is like that has to be the direction we go in uh as opposed to continuing to try to answer the what is the best diet question which obviously you're not trying to answer because you realize the futility of that as well as I do but I but I still think many people in the in the public view that as the question that's trying to be answered y you're you're correct and I see that with this new study that we are doing people when you say them the word diet they think weight loss they think something Miracle is going to happen and we tell them no no it's we want to know what you eat in relationship with your health and your genetic makeup and your environment and all these kind of things and uh I'm with you on that now I'm a little bit more pessimistic that education is going to I

[01:10:23] I always say education is is a major Cornerstone uh Stone of that but uh we also are going to need to have public health policies I mean we you know it's been done with trans fats it's it's it's being done now in South America with black label on you know dangerous thing in ultr processed food and all this kind of thing but isn't that isn't that kind of an educa like I I don't know that I'm opposed to labeling things I guess I just I do worry a little bit with excise taxes on things although In fairness In fairness if I'm going to be critical of my own point of you I do support excise taxes on Tobacco right I do I do think I do think alcohol and tobacco should be taxed to cover their consequences on the back end so maybe maybe I need to revisit my thinking on this but but I I do sort of bristle at the idea a little bit of of taxing food you know certain foods more than others only I think Eric because I've lost faith in the government to determine on the margin what's healthy and what's not healthy right like is butter healthy or not healthy right do we should butter be taxed disproportionately relative to bread I mean that's that's an area where

[01:11:42] I I simply don't want anybody at the at the FDA or the USDA or the ATF or anybody else weighing in but but any tell me more of what you think from a policy perspective would be helpful yeah I I think that the government should work very closely with the nutrition you know companies and and you know the the N the nutrition companies have been Masters as at doing two things to produce very palatable and very cheap food I mean the I remember John blandel so saying those are the two things that people don't compromise on it is to be tasty they need to enjoy it and it needs to be cheap and you know this is what we have now I mean a lot of added sugar a lot of fat and it's very delicious and all these kind of things but we have to reverse some of that and I think that now we know enough about that and you know I was at a conference uh a months ago in sa Polo the international Congress of obesity and they have been very very uh active in South America when it comes to ultra processed food and I was impressed to see even you know the protein content of all the ultr processed food is is on the side of 12 to 133% whereas you know we need something between 15 and 18% and and you know if you believe in the protein leverage uh Theory uh this is an important factor tell tell folks what that is I I know that I've talked about it a little bit on the podcast but let's let's remind people what that theory is I I actually think I don't think there's any one Theory I think it's a an amalgamation of theories but I actually think there's some validity to this Theory what tell folks how that works I mean in simple words is that we eat for a given amount of protein which is proportional to our body size and all that and and by the way I I remember when I was studying we were saying you know during a low calorie diet you need 1.2 gam of protein per kilogram of body weight or these kind of things but they uh the the experiment started with insects and then they went in rodents and they manipulated the content of protein of the diet and they found out that basically the intake was all to gravitate around a protein content which was sufficient for the weight of the animal and so on and this is called the protein leverage uh Theory and uh you know now I'm a little bit more skeptical when you know uh Simpson and Rob um the two guys in Australia are saying you know the pandemic of obesity has been paralleled by a decrease in the protein content of the the diet and this is what has triggered the increase caloric intake to get the same amount of protein yeah it's basically they're arguing that it's it's not that total protein has gone down it's that protein density within food and especially processed food has gone down and so people are seeking more calories to subconsciously get more protein yeah and and the data I mean I reviewed these data in huge detail for a previous podcast um the data in the rodents is staggeringly compelling um it's unambiguous I mean it's it's a rodent will consume to its level of protein in the studies where this has been tested um even if it means eating way more calories um I do think humans must be more complicated because

[01:15:43] I don't think the human literature are quite as clear do you no once again you know with rodents you can feed them whatever you want yeah with people you don't mhm and uh you know I remember Dr George Bray saying you know these these dietry recall are not worth the paper on which you write the data yeah I I couldn't agree more with Dr Bray on that and uh you know this is where we lack tools to know exactly you know and you know your glasses with the camera or whatever is going to be useful but uh I think we need better ways of uh measuring what people eat and what is the content of their meal and all these kind of things and and that's why it's so easy to do that in rodents because you feed them with this or these three diets or five diets and you look at how much they eat you weigh the food and you know the calories that's why I'm a little bit more pessimistic yeah yeah you know you mentioned that George Bray made this funny comment offhand about the role of food frequency question questioners which is they're not worth the paper they're written on uh and of course John iones has famously said that um the food frequency questioner belongs in the waste basket I mean that's basically the only place it belongs and yet the food frequency questioner is the backbone is the scaffolding of nutritional epidemiology and so do you as an empirical scientist an experimental scientist have concern at how much food policy is being driven by nutritional epidemiology rather than experimental science when we understand why you have to you know why why there's an effort around nutritional epidemiology because these questions are otherwise difficult to answer but given the Fidelity of the data I.E the thing you put in the system to calculate isn't worth the paper it's written on according to basically anybody who understands how it works so how do we how do we reconcile this problem right which is I mean even things that we're talking about now which is the role of ultra processed food well that's those are determinations from epidemiology it's it's epidemiology that's at least telling us or hinting to us that Ultra processed foods unbalance are bad that confirms what I think most people would

[01:18:15] Intuit it but where do we draw the line between what we are letting nutritional epidemiology tell us from a health policy perspective uh to to where maybe it's overstepping and getting things wrong because of the data Integrity problem I think the problem is really jumping from uh you know basically nutritional uh epidemiology to policies or labeling or dietry guidelines and I think to me now we are at a point that the epidemiology should basically provide us with hypothesis to be tested in better controlled situation and maybe in domiciled with full feeding of people I know this these studies are expensive but we are missing a step and I think once again uh these new studies uh from n this consortia of nutrition for

[01:19:18] Precision Health are going towards this direction of basically you are right the food food frequency questionnaire is here every day for 10 days in this module one of the study but then there are these other ways there is the remote photography system that you take a picture with your phone of the plates you have these cameras and all that and

[01:19:43] I think that now we I hope that we're not going to make policy only or policy or guidelines only based on the nutritional uh epidem ology but also on uh diet on studies basically testing some hypothesis related to what the nutrition uh epidemiology has shown yeah again I I think all roads both from a personal health perspective and from a nutrition science perspective need to point towards Ai and and I it's that you know it's such a cliche thing to say right now we everybody basically everybody's saying AI is everything um but when people ask ask me how is AI how could AI change medicine um it's not by being a better doctor and being better at diagnosing if you have syphilis or not you know sure that's valuable um but a lot of it's in the very unsexy stuff image recognition and

[01:20:41] Radiology um insurance billing reconciliation um and this you know when you want to talk about biomedical research the thing that gets all the attention is protein folding and that is truly magnific ific the protein folding predictions from the amino acid sequence is mindboggling um and that will absolutely shave some time and money off drug

[01:21:04] Discovery but if if AI could solve this quote unquote simple problem I say simple in conceptual terms not technical terms you change nutrition science you really start to answer questions that have vexed us for hundreds of years and uh so anyway I hope somebody out there is who's got serious AI chops is listening to this and thinking this is an area to pursue um let's let's pivot a little bit Eric to talk about one of the the most important parts of your career um and I

[01:21:37] I believe you are if not one of the senior Pi you might be the single most senior Pi on the calorie study is that is that correct yeah I was uh yeah I was one of the four piis but I was the one who kind of drove the ride up and and the design of the study and all that uh calorie was an important study it was funded by the National Institute on aging and it was really the first attempt to look at the impact of caloric restriction on biomarkers of Aging now don't ask me what are the biomarkers of

[01:22:16] Aging because there's still a lot of discussion around that but you know if I tell you it's your fasting insulin going up with life it's your V2 Max going down it's not your gray Air or your lack of air or these kind of things but anyway you have some more sophisticated protein glycation and production of iso prain and all that and how much uh I want to talk about the details of the study in a moment but just before I forget how much banked serum do you still have that is available for analysis in 5 years or 10 years years when better and better tools or biomarkers become available is that is it all been spoken for and has it all been tested or are there still some banked samples it's great that you asked the question because it's uh we are still uh now there is a calorie Legacy study which is to follow up these people but also there is a bio repository of all the plasma samples muscle biopsies fat biopsies uh at Duke uh which was the coordinating

[01:23:28] Center and these samples are available of course with a request uh to uh and the pi of that is Bill Krauss you may know the name he's a cardiologist but uh he's at uh at Duke and uh it's interesting that you ask that because there's some uh you know one of my colleague just published a paper in science on a uh postto analysis of adipose tissue in these people before and after caloric restriction he found a gene of Interest he is a neologist deep

[01:24:12] Dixit is at Yale and he really mined these uh transcriptomes from adipose tissue and found a gene which is related to the immune function and found that if you knock out this Gene in mice they are resistant to weight gain and this is like a calorie restriction my medic and they improve the immune function and all that and uh to yeah your question is very appropriate there are still uh samples available of course they become less and less uh available or more and more difficult I'm just uh digging in some of the samples that we had to send to somebody at UT Southwest

[01:25:01] Southwestern uh because he has a new molecule that he would like to test before and after weight loss in non-obese people but yeah uh the gold mine of these studies is really to be able to bank bios samples you know we all Bank the data and the results but the bio samples that's the treasure TR so so tell folks about the study so how many subjects what was the intervention how were they monitored and tracked how long were they followed and let's just start with the basics yeah the calorie first of all I became interested in caloric restriction uh because of um I don't know if you remember Peter Biosphere 2 I sure do it it was a uh glass and steel structure southeast of Phoenix in between Phoenix and

[01:25:56] Tucson and uh eight people went into this uh biosphere they had seven different biomes there was Desert Marsh ocean how wasure habitat it was about three three acres okay and and they uh this was a rich Texan uh donor who wanted to do that uh basically for the sake of NASA to know how people can live in aasy otasi anyway uh eight people entered this uh

[01:26:35] Biosphere 2 it's called two because biosphere one was the earth and they decided to call it two and uh among these eight people there was a uh faculty from UCLA Roy Walford who wrote The Textbook with Rick wein Brook on caloric restriction and while they were in the biosphere and I was in Phoenix Roy called me and said we would like to do measurements of energy expenditure can you can we sneak in a Delta track or metabolic C to measure our energy expenditure and I said oh absolutely and we can also measure your Freel living energy expenditure using W label water and we did that and any way remind me how long they stayed in the biosphere 2 two years yeah God years Lord in from 1991 to 1993 and uh Roy Walford was a physician of the group but he was very very well interested in caloric restriction what he didn't know things went South the agriculture you know they had pest they couldn't control some of the insect they had goats Dy and very quickly they didn't have enough food and they lost on average 15% of their weight none of them except one was maybe a BMI of 26 or S they were all between 20 and 25 and uh they became calorie restricted and you had the guy who was writing the textbook on calorie restriction being the physician in The Biosphere 2 and uh we started to collaborate and then then when this RFA came out in the early 2000 a rep request for application Grant from the ni immediately I called Roy and I said Roy we have did done this study of energy expenditure and they came and they they stayed in the chamber five of them for one day uh right when they came out of the biosphere and uh we need you as a consultant and we want to write a grant which is going to be competitive I not

[01:28:56] I'm not known in aging research and he he accepted what by the way what did you what did you find of their energy expenditure when they were in the chambers it was low I mean very low because of their caloric restriction they were about we we have to compare to a group of 72 people I mean it's all published and I can send you some of the papers uh they they were about 200 calories below what you would expect for their weight and body composition interesting even correct even correcting for their highly reduced weight and altered body composition they were still 200 below yeah wow and then we uh the same five because three of them said hey we have been stuck for two years now in this biosphere we don't want to go to a metabolic chamber in Phoenix but the the five who came they came back uh six months later and they regained their weight they were normal weight like at the entry and we published this data and and was their energy expenditure normal as well or did normalized normalized y there was no no uh you know there's this argument with metabolic adaptation how long does it last and these kind of things but it was normal Roy passed away kind of prematurely didn't he uh yeah he he blamed it on on biosphere a little bit because they had you know they were supposed to be totally independent except for light from the rest of the world but a few times they had to purge CO2 and in flux

[01:30:35] O2 but he he said there was probably gases but it was his story I don't know yeah how true it was but uh he said that uh he was Intoxicated by gas in in the biosphere so I didn't realize that story Eric that it was the back of Biosphere 2 that your personal interest in this uh hypothesis emerged and that that's that's the first thread that pulled towards the calorie study so I'm glad you shared that story with us yeah and uh anyway now move uh almost 10 years later uh Roy Walford and um I don't remember the the name of the investigator in San Antonio came we bring brainstorm what should be the hypothesis I was very serious I wanted to have this Grant and we said what are we going to test because if you ask

[01:31:34] Steve aad how many theories of behind calorie restriction he going to tell you more than 50 or 100 and so on and uh myself I was pretty convinced by two things the rate of living Theory you know the higher your metabolism the shorter your life life and uh you know the elephant is a very low metabolism per unit of tissue compared to a shrew and all these kind of things and the oxidative stress theories by the way does that does that explain the difference between a human and a dog is that explained fully that the the 10x Delta in lifespan between a human and a dog or whatever it is you you you you can look at the the cber book you you the energy metabolism yeah yeah I need to and it's not 10x I said 10x it's probably or the same line they are all on the same line got it interesting okay and uh you know we brainstorm for three or four days I have beautiful memories of these time uh and we said okay we're going to write a grant there was it was a seven-year

[01:32:46] Grant the first two years which was you do a study show us that you can recruit people and maintain them in C restriction and they have to be not obese they can be overweight and the second is from the three chosen group we're going to design one study and it's going to be a two-year intervention and the first uh study uh we decided was basically to test if caloric restriction decrease your energy metabolism more than what you would expect on the basis of the body weight and in other words do you become more efficient and the answer is yes and you know we talk about metabolic adaptation now this is in non-obese people here but they become more efficient which by the way always sounds like a good thing but it's not really a good thing when it comes to weight maintenance right it's the exact opposite you becoming efficient is not what you want when you're trying to you want to be the most inefficient uh consumer of calories in an Ideal World po ially Energy

[01:33:55] Efficiency can be very good for longevity and it has been shown in some studies the Baltimore longitudal study uh showed that some people with had lower metabolic rate were living longer on the other hand Energy Efficiency is a liability uh for weight gain for example because you are more efficient and you are more prone to weigh gain and I think it's a balance between the two but anyway I think uh there's no right answer but having a high metabolic rate can be a liability because associated with the generation of ATP you have some what we call production of reactive oxygen species in other words the efficiency of the transfer of oxygen into ATP is not perfect and sometime you have some uh reactive oxygen species being generated by the mitochondria and these mitochondri these re reactive oxygen species can damage not only your

[01:35:09] DNA but your protein your lipids and so on and this is one of the Theory of Aging it is too many reactive oxygen species and therefore a higher degree of of oxidative stress yeah and when we designed the first part of our calorie study it was a six month intervention we had four groups a ad libitum group 25% caloric restriction another group being 25% energy deficient but half by caloric restriction 12 and a half% and half by increasing energy expenditure by exercise and the last group was weight loss 10% with very a low calorie diet and maintenance of this weight loss it means you are in calorie restriction compared to that basine so just to be clear the last group the target was the weight reduction whereas in the other groups the target was the energy intake and or energy expenditure correct now how did you even do this Eric because in theory this sounds like a brilliant experiment right

[01:36:23] I mean that those are big enough those are seismic changes right you take a 100 kilo person down to 90 kilos I mean that's a big loss of weight right you know 190 lb person is going to be 170 lbs when that experiment is done that's meaningful uh the caloric restriction of 25% is enormous one way or the other but now the question is you're doing this in the real world over in one case I think months ultimately over years how did you think about tools for compliance to see that you could hit even close to those targets I think it was a lot of work with our psychology group who said you know we have to screen the people we have to screen them for Biers to the intervention for adherance and so on and there was a lot a lot of screening of our volunteers do you remember what your what your sort of uh rejection rate was you know for every 10 people you screened how many would pass the the psychology test it is in the in the conso diagram of the publication but I I I know if I recall correctly for the twoyear study we screen more than 5,000 people to enroll 225 wow wow so basically only 5% of people there was telephone web screening telephone screening a in-person screening visit and there were five screening visits you know to make sure that they show up if they don't show up for the screening visit forget them yeah uh in the first study we published that in jamama and we did find that there was metabolic adaptation or you become more efficient and we had also some indication of less oxidative stress we did what we call a comet essay you look at damage of DNA uh in nucleated blood cells uh and we measure isoprostane and all that after that the three sites where Washington University with John hollosy was uh toughs in Boston with

[01:38:47] Susan Roberts and Us in Baton Rouge and we uh you know after our our study was 6 months our preliminary study theirs were uh one year but after two years when we analyzed the data and all that we started to design the study which was going to be the same for the three sides and was the only difference in the short study Eric the uh duration of the study and the sample size to just confirm the technical doings of the study no they they were all different uh you know we insisted to have these four groups ourself in the preliminary study uh Boston had only uh two groups low glycemic index versus higher glycemic index in the diet of the caloric restriction and wasu I don't remember the details but there was a component of physical activity in their study he was John hollosi was a you know a uh B chemist of exercise and all that but after that we uh you know compared our end points and our uh basically intervention and we designed this study now the RFA was specifying that they have to be non-obese uh in our preliminary study we didn't want to go because of this 10% weight loss you know if you start with

[01:40:22] BMI have 26 and you have you are 70 kilos and you have to lose 7 kilos you become thin and uh we anyway uh we decided uh about the range of BMI and we decided for the the the study to go from 22 to 27.9 of BMI for admission means you know normal weight on the upper range yeah mostly normal weight you know on the plus or minus side of normal weight up to 27.9 and you know it was we we know that we knew that they were going to lose at least 10% and therefore you cannot take somebody with a BMI of 20 to start with uh you would have problems with bone mineral density you may have problems with some safety men and women or just men men and women right so the other thing you're going to have you're going to have problems with menstrual cycle and things like that if you're going to and how long did they have to lose the 10% of body weight was they given six months to do this or what what were they forced into oh we we didn't have that in the final uh in the final protocol but he now preliminary Pro protocol he was over over 3 months he was a low calorie diet he was like 800 and some calories per day it was all liquid diet provided by Pennington yeah yeah and and but we could do kind of muffins and things like that from these uh it's called

[01:42:07] Uh uh Health one diet and it's still on the market by the way uh but uh the two-year study then we decided to my surprise that they agreed to do the rate of living slash oxidative stress first end point and now primary end now let's go back to the subjects age 21 to 47 for women and 55 for men uh BMI 22 to 28 and then uh going through a lot of screening to make sure that they were going to stick with us and I can tell you we randomize two two calorie restriction 25% for one to ad libitum we had 95% completion in the ad libitum group and 82% uh 85% in the calorie restriction it's amazing for a two-year study and the retention was spectacular and uh they were randomized 2 to1 to uh caloric restriction uh unlike the prelimary study we did in which we fed them entirely they came to Pennington to basically learn how to cook whatever diet they wanted could be a low calie diet a lowfat diet a low carbohydrate diet Med diet and sorry Eric tell me again it was 25% CR Target in the CR group yep and the uh it was based on two measurements of w Lael water the average

[01:43:53] I just checked that this morning the average energy requirement was 2400 it means uh you know on average they were cut by a little bit more than uh uh 500 like like 600 calories and for two years and uh the first three months they could come whenever they wanted to learn to cook and they were also provided some of the meal if they needed to I remember one one is still our star of the volunteers is daughter thought he was working at

[01:44:33] Pennington because he was going every day to Pennington and his daughter was five when they asked her at the kindergarten where where does your work your dad work oh he works at Pennington and he was a volunteer for our study and uh yeah I mean after that we had a lot of measurements about resting metabolic crate about oxidative stress and the uh end points were really uh the first RMR the second Ross formation and after that it was cvd markers it was insulin sensitivity immune function neuroendocrine uh parameters quality of life and cogn cognitive function what was the average uh percent weight loss of the individuals in the treatment group versus the weight gain at one year the average was 12% and at two years it was 10 10.4% now the caloric restriction that we kind of estimated by W label water it's called the intake uh balance method you measure energy expenditure you measure change in body composition we had about almost 20% of caloric rest rtion for the first 6 months and this is where the weight loss was uh and after that it started to decrease to uh close to 15% at one year and then at the end of the two years the overall caloric restriction was 12 a half% basically we got half of what we were asking for which which is not bad for like you said it's an important cut in your intake and it was Square from day one it was not a ramping up and then we did this measurements at 6 months 12 months 18 and and uh 24 months just for the Pennington part of this not including the other two sites what was the budget for everything meaning the preparation planning the study the an analysis for the first

[01:46:45] Publications Etc not the ongoing but just the bulk of what you would call that that that calorie study had a budget of how much my original Grant was uh 10.4 million and it was in 2003 yeah uh and after that because we were recruiting so well they asked us to boost up our Recruitment and they gave us another million and a half was 13 million 13 million in uh yeah close to 13 million to and the the that was the direct cost or direct plus indirect no plus indirect total cost so let's just apply a little inflation to that and say that that's 20 million in today's dollars conservatively yeah yeah yeah again that sounds like a lot of money but when you think about the fact that the NIH budget is on the order of $35 billion for both intra and extra mural and the extra mural budget of which this was part of is you know on the order of oh you know $28 billion $20 million on a $28 billion uh $28 billion budget is a drop in the bucket it's less than a tenth of a percent um and yet this is a very important question um and and you know it kind of uh I think your success in this study which is it has to be described as one of the one of the I think it's the single best study that's ever looked at uh even attempted to look at the effects of restriction in a free living environment uh in large part I I agree I think your recruiting was exceptional and your handson ability to work with the subjects longitudinally is what made the difference people think that the study is like you design the study you recruit the subjects you go and then you forget about them but like that you wouldn't you would have failed so so you you did all the unsexy stuff so well and that's why you got something so remarkable and as we to now talk about the results of the study um you know part of my frustration is I I I I I worry that the NIH is funding some stuff that's not that interesting uh and not that relevant compared to the jugular questions of human health and this would be a this would be a great example of the kind of work that that should be getting much more funding in my view but

[01:49:14] I'll get off my soap box now um okay so let's let's talk about the findings at the end of two years what were the most notable findings ings aside from the obvious which is weight loss one amazing was the retention rate I thought that it was exceptional that between the three sides and it was much more difficult in

[01:49:33] Boston to be honest you know uh than he was in Baton Rouge or even in St Louis but anyway retention was exceptional uh the camarad re keep interrupting Eric but what did the subjects tell you like you got to know these people really well why did they stay in the subject why did they stay in the study I mean it can't be pleasant to be that calorically restricted for uh two years or did they say actually you know guys it really felt lousy for six months and then it didn't feel lousy at all and I really became you know I I came to really enjoy this like I'm very curious as to what their subjective experience was it's it's interesting that you are asking because we we have been interested in that and we are even now following up these people with studied from 2005 to 20 2008 and they are part of this Legacy study caler

[01:50:30] Legacy study uh but it was really a kind of building a team between the investigators and the study coordinators and you know the the study managers and all that and the people he was also providing them with some of the results and we had to fight for that because uh you know normally you don't want to have people having their results but we said you know it's not going to change their we tell them about their total cholesterol HDL L LDL and it's not going to change anything or the body composition they love to see this dexa and you know uh my percent body fat went from uh you know 15 to 12 in a guy and so on and and uh he was kind of building a uh we had Migra with the uh with the volunteers we had every two months we had a reception and all that sending postcards for birthdays and all these kind of things are part of the retention and building a team between the investigators and the study volunteers and I think we succeeded in that but again this was the screening which was essential because you are right I I remember the first person that we randomized she ended up in the ad lib group she came to my office and said you know I want to do this study because I have read about what it does to your metabolic Health to your cholesterol to your body composition and I'm in the control group she was crying and but we're going to give you data and after we're going to offer you maybe a weight loss or help you for caloric restriction and all these kind of things of course two years later we we still see them but not on a regular basis like during the study but uh it's a lot of investment from the invest the investigative group and also for the study participants because they had so many visits yeah so um talk to me about the lipid changes the markers of insulin sensitivity the body composition changes let's just kind of run through the list of of of what what improved again I I I I I don't think it's a surprise that these things improved but but the magnitude in some cases is interesting um and again this question of I'm very curious as to subjective markers of satisfaction in that group because most people would say look if you told me I have to restrict my calories by 20 or 25% there's no amount of benefit to my health that could justify the unhappiness and unpleasantness of that experience so where where were they psychologically as as that as that trial progressed into its second year I think first of all uh there was quite a lot of press around the study at the time done at a national level as well as local levels and they like to to know and to know that they are part of an important study it's like this nutrition for

[01:53:59] Precision Health now or motor pack are are things which get some press and all that and they most of the people like to be part of a kind of key study uh the the second thing was really building this relationship between the investigators and study volunteers and also the return of results and the sharing of experience with other people uh you were asking you know how long does it last to have this problem with hunger and you know suffering and all that and it seems that for most people after one month he was totally uh manageable we taught them also to increase the volume and decrease the fat content to satisfy you know on a volumetric basis how much food they were eating with less fat and less calorie density in the diet against the ketogenic diet here and do you have a sense of how their macronutrients shifted so did the adlib people effectively mirror the standard American diet of you know 50 to 55% carbohydrate and did the CR group end up at you know a higher fraction of carbohydrates because of this attempt to lower caloric density I we have published I I I don't remember exactly if there was a clearcut impact of being in the caloric caloric restriction group versus the ad group uh this I don't know but I know that quite a few people wanted to make a difference in their diet and they wanted to know more about the med diet the DASH diet the low fat diet and all that and uh surprisingly uh there are some people and like I said in this Legacy study and

[01:56:01] Dr redond is the pi now uh people are still uh you know a lot of them uh did not regain all the weight and now it's more than 15 years after and uh they are still kind of using what they have learned during this two years because there was a lot of learning do you when was the last time you took blood uh or any gathered any sort of data on those people besides weight like in other words is there any way to infer whether two years of caloric restriction 20 years ago had any lasting difference relative to the controls like like I said this Legacy study is is recruiting a targeting all the people now I don't know how many but we don't have the results we're going to get yeah no okay no it's ongoing now okay but us we did a six Monon followup study uh at Pennington and here you know

[01:57:04] I mean people were continuing their caloric they they were continuing that's not the the thing they said oh heck with this study I I go back to my normal life he was a game changer for their lifestyle for these people so what do you think think from a from an anti-aging perspective were the most important uh biomarkers that changed like for example did you do ogtts or ug glycemic clamps I mean how much did you uh scrutinize glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity in these people yeah we we didn't do clamps uh let me tell you there are two kind of Aging there's primary aging which is more like cisin or mitochondrial dysfunction or you you know leaky membrane and there is secondary aging which is basically the impact of your environment and your lifestyle when you ask about insulin sensitivity or cardiovascular factor it's more secondary aging and here we did a lot of measures and Bill crra published a a quite sided paper uh like five years after the end of the study in jamama on all the cardiovascular cardiometabolic risk factors and everything was tremendously improved despite the fact that these people were healthy to begin with BMI 22 to 27.9 and so on and remarkable

[01:58:44] Improvement in all these markers of secondary aging now when it comes to primary aging that's a different story because you know it's much more difficult to measure autophagy to measure mitochondrial function to measure leakiness of a cell membrane in these people and what we ended up to measure was really uh some of these uh biomark or you know the Hallmarks of

[01:59:14] Aging you have probably seen these papers there was one in 2012 and one 10 years later uh you know we we don't have as many data that we would like but for example we did measure mitochondrial biogenesis by looking at the relationship between nuclear uh um markers and mitochondrial DNA and we uh observed in humans that there was an increased mitochondrial biogenesis despite the fact that you use less energy you become more efficient you in you increase your biogenesis of of mitochondria which is quite spectacular because the Ross production of these react reactive oxygen species are produced by older mitochondria the new mitochondria are much more efficient they they they don't produce as many rust so let me make sure I understand that Eric sorry you're saying that the people in the CR group had a greater turnover of their mitochondria yep and it's interesting muscle skeletal muscle he was yeah and and and so we would expect that people who were calorically restricted would have lower Ross generation but we would expect that the reason for that is lower substrate utilization you're saying yeah they had lower Ross generation but it might actually be just as much from the fact that they had more mitochondrial biogenesis and they were using newer machinery for the substrate utilization so it could be both of those things are reducing Ross is that what you're saying you are right absolutely right I think it's both uh you you know when it comes to mitophagy you know these all mitochondria it's been shown in insect in rodents that this is improved with caloric restriction autoag of course all these organel in the cells did you measure any of the tubules or anything for autophagy no LC okay but we measured mitochondrial turnover by by this method and we found that it was increased with uh with caloric restriction and I think you you are right on the on the point here there's both mechanism less energy requirement but also more efficient mitochondria today if you were to do this study for example I mean I know the Legacy study isn't the same because not as many of the people are going to still be carrying out but if you could go back and look at the banked samples are there any other biomarkers you would be able to look at today Visa the Hallmarks of Aging is there anything we could be doing to better understand syence um what would you look at in terms of inflammatory markers I would certainly put that down as primary aging how much of a a suite of the inter lucans uh tnf and things of that nature did you look at yeah I mean we did we did at at uh 6 12 and 24 months we didn't do 18 months for that but we had the whole panel of uh inflammation and high sensitivity CRP and then all the

[02:02:44] Incan tnf alpha everything improved or just some things no everything improved one thing which was spectacular when it comes to immune function we did some Imaging of the thymus and there was loss of fat involution oh oh involution okay fat reduction yeah there was a reduction of uh fat in the thymus and our friend deep

[02:03:14] Dixit was all excited by that and this is why he he pursue all the uh immune uh you know responses from transcriptomics in different tissues and all that but you know we chronic inflammation first of all it was not abnormal to begin with but there was tremendous Improvement and I think that Bill Krauss in the discussion of his paper if I recall he he used the

[02:03:46] Framingham index of cardio cardiometabolic health and there was an improvement uh in the age y i I don't know exactly the index yeah using the using the Framingham risk calculator of course everything would have got better based on the biomarkers and he was quite spectacular it was like they were gaining 10 years in two years I mean again Eric I I think it's very interesting and I I think it is hands down the best experimental evidence we have that caloric restriction for those who can do it may indeed be um a great tool of course there are other questions that I think can't be answered by this study based on its duration and the age of the subjects and that is would those benefits extend into the eth decade of Life a period of time when sarcopenia becomes um a significant driver of not just mortality but truly morbidity um and would we indeed see a tradeoff in lean muscle um again the answer is not necessarily that you would I do think that one could indeed consume fewer calories without any restriction of protein and while doing all of the necessary strength training so other words I think there's a deliberate way to do this but um you know if one were just to kind of restrict calories um and and and and lose lean mass I I don't remember Eric but did the obviously the subjects got lighter and obviously their body composition improved meaning they disproportionately lost fat to muscle but do you recall if there was uh also a meaningful reduction in lean tissue independent of the Improvement in body composition I I would have to go back to the publication exactly but he he he was less than a quarter less than a quarter yep and that's that's we we like to hold on to that as the gold standard of yeah limit limit lean body mass to a quarter of total weight loss um any other indic we didn't restrict physical activity but to be enrolled they they they had to be screened for not being regular exercises for example do you know the cronies the calorie restriction optimal nutrition

[02:06:16] Society I've never interacted with them but I'm familiar with their their movement there there is about 200 self imposed calorie restricted people yes they are they are afraid of exercise they don't exercise at all right because they are afraid that exercise is going to increase increase their appetite yeah their appetite and their food intake and they are religious with that and uh and that's why I mean your question about sarcopenia when you start with people with a BMI of 4 and you lose your 10 12% and you keep this 12% off and you go in your 70s and 80s what is happening to your muscle mass and these kind of things and I don't think we have an answer I mean to me

[02:07:08] Eric the experiment that I want to see done is not even an experiment at this point frankly it's literally uh I mean it's it's it's a much easier experiment which is your your tissue and serum samples provide a very compelling case of you can take healthy people CR them for a couple of years and make them better across the board by every objective measure of both primary and secondary aging the secondary stuff's so obvious it's not even worth talking about so people that are interested in that can go back and look at the papers and see the lipid profiles and see the insulin sensitivity but um but it's really these primary markers of Aging I didn't I I had forgotten or didn't know about the thymic fat reduction that's very interesting to me um so now the question is this well you you were dealing with a very narrow population right you you started with 200 people and through intensive psychological profiling you winnowed it down to the 5% of people who were going to be able to most adhere to this and then on top of that you provided arguably the most robust support for those people during this journey the kind of support they couldn't buy outside like you those people as you know regular people on the outside world couldn't have purchased the level of care and support and encouragement they got for that two-year study so all of that is not to be a crit a Critic of the study it's to Simply say those were the necessary steps to get such exceptional compliance which is what was necessary to get such a meaningful answer but if we want to ask the question how would you help the 99% of people who on their own could not adhere to that the answer of course becomes

[02:08:59] CTIC drugs right this is the question that is on everybody's mind which is Eric you've convinced me that CR to this extent will absolutely help me live a longer better life but I just can't do it you know I'm not in that percent of the population but will a GL P1 Agonist give me the same benefit will rapy give me the same benefit will a carbos give me the same benefit will an sglt2 inhibitor give me the same benefit will metformin give me the same benefit and those studies are much easier to do we can easily put people on those drugs for two years and do the exact same analysis you've given us the gold standard you've given us the template now now we just need to compare every single marker you've measured plus some you haven't I really want to see the epig genome in these subjects pre and post um and so I don't know I mean is that is it just me that feels this way or is that also screaming out to you as the most interesting question to come out of this it's been a little bit of a roller coaster uh the CR my Medics you you you remember all the sir to in St stories yes but but notice I picked something very carefully I only picked drugs that with the exception of gp1 Agonist I only picked winners of the

[02:10:32] ITP and yeah cerin are garbage everybody knows they're garbage I'm sorry to offend people who work on them now although I don't think anybody's still working on them but the cerin were a scam story that never materialized and it never ever ever was the mechanism by which CR worked ever I've gone back I have talked to Matt cllin who did the first study I have gone through every experiment that was done in that lab there is zero evidence that sirin's supposed efficacy which I think is true in yeast by the way was mediated through

[02:11:09] CR and of course CR and ceran have had no efficacy post yeast so anyway just I'm just I'm just being a little pointed in my language to make the point that I'm I'm being I'm particular about which CR mics I discuss yeah okay and you pick metformin and of course I'm sure you you know NE Bazi and and my H my hypothesis by the way is that metformin is not a CR mtic but I just think we should include it like it's it's it's it's there's a reasonable enough probability that all of those molecules I suggested I think should be tested I mean the glp1 are so potent when it comes to weight loss metabolic health and all that I mean there's not a week without a new paper on I just read a blood pressure one today on tepati and uh and uh you know why why would that be because when you calorie restrict yourself you eat less and therefore you stimulate less these GI peptides and why why would you know I I don't see n makes sense none of it makes sense but you know if you tell me I mean are they true caloric restriction my Medics and and do they do uh decrease oxidative stress do they do improve uh insulin sensitivity and all that among the one you cited there's a lot of those and uh now the the question is is how do you go about to test that that and uh of course there is all these failed drugs and things which have been tested for toxicity and safety and all that that some people want to recycle in you know in aging and uh I'm not sure where it's going to be to me the secondary aging which is the impact of your lifestyle and your environment is what we should Target first the primary aging you know it I I I like to hear uh David Clark talking about oopy or the people on the east coast and all that but what do you do to have more autophagy or more mitophagy and all that I don't know

[02:13:41] I mean we know exercise does it right I mean we know that autophagy is not just fueled by chloric restriction but exercise is an incredibly potent driver of that for for similar mechanisms right you could argue that it's basically a substrate utilization problem it's the input it's the output and when you transiently deprive the output right by if you drive more output and you transiently create a deficit of energy I don't think at the cellular level the body is particularly concerned with am I short on what's coming in or am I short because too much is going out um and and again this doesn't have to be an either or like that that's the beauty of biology is we can we can look for a

[02:14:22] Creative Solutions so um I I I think it's I I I think that you know those particular Jor protective agents Eric are probably not going to be as impressive on the secondary markers of Aging with the exception of The glp1 Agonist because of the obvious weight loss I don't think met foran Raa sglt2 a carbos are going to result in weight loss and even in the uh in the itps they did not result in weight loss remember the hypothesis of David Allison who proposed a carbos is this is going to be a CR mimic that induces weight loss because of bad absorption well guess what those mice weighed the exact same amount they just lived a heck of a lot longer suggesting it was actually the glucose metabolism that that gave the benefit but I don't know anyway I just I just think Eric what you've done is amazing I think that and I know it just wasn't you of course it wasn't you I mean you had an incredible team I've been to Pennington on many occasions I think it's a it's a wonderful place and

[02:15:22] I I I I think it's dedication it's just it's the little stuff that matters Eric it's like I I know what your staff is like I remember working with Courtney and the entire team of nutritionists there I mean that's the stuff that's not sexy but that's what's necessary to do this kind of work and I I I hope that through this podcast we're giving people an appreciation for how hard it is to do uh nutrition science if you're an experimentalist anybody can do epidemiology and I kind of share the view of George and John and the people who think that it is a very very limited use not of no use there is a case but we over index on that stuff when what we really in my mind need to be doing is doubling down on the kind of work you do um because that's the only place I think we're going to get causal information um and information that we could make people's lives better with so thank you for what you're doing my pleasure and uh stay tuned because you you mentioned Tim restricted eating and now there is a study which is going to be implemented in a year or two a five-year intervention calorie restriction versus Tim restricted eating what's the time window of restriction going to be I I I don't know the details the protocol is not finalized it's one of these exercise where you know we were part of one of the study you the brain and but it's it's going to be probably hours a day all right my my my vote if you if you give me a vote

[02:17:01] Eric make it more restrictive I I just think we we did the the first study we did was six six hours yeah I would go I would go if you really want to see if there's a signal independent of calorie restriction because I think the goal has to be you're going to have to match their calories right so it's it's this is the isocaloric difference between CR and Tim restricted feeding uh in my experience 8 hours will give you a null answer I I would bet I bet a million dollars you'll get a null answer if you compare eight hours but four to six is interesting and I'd be very curious yep

[02:17:38] I I mean it's interesting you bring that up but our study was the first in humans uh and this was Courtney Peterson who did that yeah and we had six hours hours and people said it would be easier with 8 hours and all that but after if I recall correctly after two weeks anyway they were perfectly fine with eight hours with hours me it's a question it uh with six hours sorry uh even if at the end the exit interview they said it would be easier for8 hours but I think it was at the start yeah and you can maybe ramp it down you know from from 8 to 6 hours yeah yeah yep well Eric um great to spend time with you today thank you I know you're in Europe So that obviously you've had to stay up a little bit later um but hopefully the next time we do this we're talking about this study and maybe the follow-up studies that I'd like to see done on some of these CR mics and we're we're doing it in person all right thank you very much

[02:18:39] Peter thanks
