This clip is from episode #357 ‒ A new era of longevity science: models of aging, human trials of rapamycin, biological clocks, promising compounds, and lifestyle interventions | Brian Kennedy, Ph.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Intro to Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AKG) – The discussion begins by introducing AKG, a central metabolite in the TCA cycle, and its potential as an anti-aging intervention
- Lifespan vs. Healthspan in Mice – In mice, AKG extended lifespan by 5–10% and significantly improved frailty scores
- Importance of Time-Release AKG – The benefits of AKG are tied to its time-release formulation, as standard AKG is metabolized too quickly to be effective
- Combining AKG with Vitamins – Mouse studies found synergistic effects when AKG was combined with vitamin A (for males) and vitamin D (for both sexes)
- Future Potential and Excitement – Optimism about AKG’s role in aging intervention and hints at unpublished studies on vitamin A’s impact

## AI Summary

Based on the provided transcript segment, I'll analyze what was discussed. Note that this appears to be only a portion of the full episode.

1. **Executive Summary**:
The discussion focuses on biological age measurement tools, particularly comparing epigenetic clocks and clinical chemistry markers for predicting mortality. Dr. Kennedy and Dr. Attia discuss the value of different biological age measurement approaches and their practical applications in healthcare settings. The conversation emphasizes the importance of actionable biomarkers versus purely predictive ones.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- First generation clocks tried to predict chronological age, while second generation clocks predict outcomes like mortality [00:02:48]
- Some first generation methylation clocks perform worse than chronological age at predicting mortality [00:04:25]
- Clinical chemistry clock using about 50 parameters outperforms methylation clocks [00:05:38]
- Study using NHANES database with 200 months of forward-looking data showed improved mortality prediction [00:04:46]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Monitor standard clinical markers that are actionable and interpretable by doctors [00:07:11]
- Pay attention to markers even within reference ranges, as combinations can indicate increased mortality risk [00:07:48]

4. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Complete blood count (provides about 30 parameters) [00:05:38]
- Standard clinical markers including:
  - LDL
  - Blood pressure
  - HbA1C [00:03:04]
  - Inflammatory markers
- Cost approximately $300 in Singapore for complete panel [00:05:38]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"These are actionable things... you can treat LDL, you can treat high blood pressure, you can treat these markers" [00:08:08]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What are the specific 50 parameters included in the clinical chemistry clock?
- How do insurance companies' mortality prediction models compare to these new biological age measurements?
- What are the specific principal components mentioned in the clinical chemistry analysis?

Note: The transcript ends abruptly during a discussion about potential drug interventions, so some sections (like Exercise & Movement, Nutrition & Diet, etc.) cannot be completed without the full transcript.
