## Description

Original release date: 10/7/19

In this episode, Jason Fried, co-founder of Basecamp, shares his beliefs around achieving business success in a modern world which tends to disproportionately focus on the massive success stories (the outliers). Jason gives his honest take on companies like WeWork, Uber, and Lyft that may give off the appearance of wild success but may instead provide an example of the dangers of perverse incentives. We get into Jason’s backstory, and how his affinity for optimizing efficiency and production in the workplace culminated with the creation of Basecamp, his very successful web-based project management software business. Perhaps most importantly, we get really deep into all aspects of work-life balance and what it really means to “work hard” (Stay tuned for an AMA-style deep dive into the topic of work-life balance with Jason in the near future). In addition, Jason provides many more valuable nuggets including thoughts on some common mistakes made by businesses today, the value of giving employees autonomy, how to take the right types of risks, why he doesn’t set any goals, and much, much more. 

We discuss:
-Jason’s background and his early entrepreneurial spirit [9:45];
-Views on completing higher education and the notion of hard work [24:00];
-Beliefs around success in business [35:00];
-WeWork, Uber, and Lyft: Poor business practices and the dangers of perverse incentives [41:30];
-Jason’s early career: his redesign approach and personal motivation [56:00];
-The genesis of Basecamp [1:10:00];
-Why Jason does not set goals but instead focuses on a vision [1:12:15];
-Workplace motivation and hiring practice [1:20:30];
-The importance of luck and not overworking [1:32:00];
-A framework to work less and optimize for workplace autonomy [1:38:00];
-The importance of saying ‘no’ more often (and tips for doing so) [1:55:00];
-A shared passion for watches [2:03:30];
-Guarding against the perils of phone addiction [2:08:45];
-Jason’s views on email and chat for communication [2:15:00] and;

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something

[00:02:13] I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:17] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription I guess this week is Jason freed Jason is the co-founder of Basecamp a privately held company based out of Chicago committed to building the best web based products and tools with the least number of unnecessary features this is sort of a hallmark of Jason's personality he's also the co-author of several books getting real rework remote and it doesn't have to be crazy at work now some of you may recall back from when I started the podcast that one of the reasons I wanted to do this in the first place was

[00:04:27] I kind of found myself having conversations with friends that after the fact I thought man I wish that had been recorded some others could hear it and and this conversation with Jason is exactly one of those it's in fact it's an extension of a conversation that we've had several times over meals we talked a lot about Jason's story we get into some turns and had some side conversations that I thought were really interesting and we talked about his background and you know how he grew up and how that sort of shaped what eventually led him to working on

[00:04:55] Basecamp and we even had a little side tangent on a whole bunch of other companies that you know everybody sort of thinks of his great examples of companies like uber and we work and things like that and one of these about Jason that's pretty unique in the space is he's just incredibly blunt and not in an obnoxious way at all he's not being blunt for effect he's just very open about how he feels and he doesn't sort of mask his feelings about some of these companies and the way they do things and how he you know feels about that we talk about base camps focus on hiring and they have a really unique culture around that and the importance of writing and things like that at the end of the podcast we get really deep into all aspects of work-life balance which in some ways is something that I really wanted to talk about with Jason I would say about a week after we recorded this podcast both

[00:05:44] Jason and I sat back and sort of thought that we could have even gone deeper into that very particular topic specifically work-life balance which is something that I just think every person struggles with on some level so we actually hummed and hawed about going back sitting down again and going even deeper on this topic but after kicking the idea around what we decided to do was something a little cooler which was set up a special

[00:06:13] AMA that Jason would do much in the same way I've done with Matthew Walker where after this episode whatever questions you have about anything we talked about but I think work-life balance is probably the most important thing we talk about here we're gonna take a bunch of questions from our members and we'll do a specific AMA with Jason that focuses on that so if you have any questions that we didn't get to or areas that you want to go deeper on this is a great opportunity to use the

[00:06:43] AMA to help us put together a follow-up discussion with Jason so with all that said please enjoy my conversation with Jason freed the first of at least two well Jason it's great to see you as always thanks for having me here yeah New York to Chicago it's not as much of a shock as some places to New York right like Chicago is Chicago's a small New

[00:07:07] York very small like probably I feel like it's an eighth well actually is 16th of New York but I get it I know how to like roll in New York you know but I feel like if I came from Kansas City I wouldn't really know what New York was it'd be a big shock to me yeah yeah it's a beautiful place but I do love it I'll offend all the New Yorkers when I say this I love it I just couldn't live here yeah that's how I feel I feel like I missed it I wanted to live here in my 20s and I miss that never happened and now I want to kind of live here but only for four days at a time that'd be I think kind of perfect actually so every time I'm here I love it but then like if I'm here for three or four days at the end of four days I'm tired I'm just really tired and burned-out yeah I mean as I was saying you earlier one of the things I like about New York which is really maybe even less about New York and more about just being in a short concise zone of work is like I always lose a little weight when I'm here I eat really well for the most part sometimes I go off the rails but like I don't have like kid food around

[00:08:08] I can just be more this really is not a statement York now that I know that's coming out my mouth I realize this is just a statement of people who being on your own who are working on their own sometimes yeah I was gonna say I can meditate when I want I can do this when I when I can sit wait I was like I'm saying I don't like my being with my family which couldn't be the further thing from the truth no but like a little bit of separation is healthy for all things it's good like to get away from work although you're kind of working when you're here but just to have a change of scenery I think's really healthy for for people for all sorts of reasons this is definitely something I want to talk about with you today because you know someone might be listening to this and saying what's the CEO and founder of

[00:08:41] Basecamp on a podcast where we talk about longevity because even though you and I both have a lot of shared interests outside including watches I definitely don't think anybody wants to hear us to talk about watches so we're probably not going to my watch as much if at all but work-life balance is actually something that I think people can immediately and sort of intuitively appreciate a is something most of us don't do well I think if I were gonna scorecard Peter Atia on health by far my closest to an F is on work-life balance and frankly it's something that seems to know no limit meaning it doesn't matter how educated you are it doesn't matter how much money you make it doesn't matter how prestigious your job is I think everybody on some level is struggling with this or at least most people are and and it's such a high priority for you it's something you've you've written about and you're just kind of one of the few people for whom this idea of culture in a workplace means something everybody says that everybody says that it almost doesn't mean much so part of me wants to go right there but I also think part of me thinks the listener who's not familiar with you needs to know a bit of the background so would you humor me too if we back up a little bit and explain how you got to be where you are yeah sure I feel like my career started when

[00:10:05] I was 14 maybe 13 that's when I wasn't allowed to work I got a workers permit my dad took me to the city hall in the city out of town I grew up in which was Deerfield Illinois which is about 25 miles north of Chicago and I went to work at a grocery store and I eventually went to work at a shoe store and did some other things but around that time I started getting into computers a little bit my neighbor had a Mac plus or Mac se one of the original like early all-in-ones and he showed me the flight simulator in a blew my mind I'm like what the hell is this thing it's like the graphics are crisp this is amazing this was black and white simulator right black and white seem who's Microsoft's simulator egg or something like that I don't remember this early days and it just completely blew my mind because before that I had only seen like an

[00:10:51] Apple 2 which was a you know traditional computer you know green kind of screen and and the Mac was so crisp so I convinced my parents to get me one eventually and from there I sort of learn how to make software but only because I wanted something I didn't care about software I didn't really care about computers but I wanted a tool to organize my music collection had a bunch of CDs and tapes so this is are we in the late 80s where let's see yeah late 80s because the Mac came out in 85 so this is still pre CD you're in kiss your music the reason I'm asking my question is to know what kind of music collection were talking about were these cassettes mostly cassettes I had some

[00:11:26] CDs though I'm also super early after of the CD Pink Floyd the wall my first CD mine was double inbox a good reasonable to remember buying it mostly was that right 80 bucks for a 5 disc CD I remember yeah see these are like 16 bucks each or 18 bucks each at the time I had this collection of music and I was loaning out to friends and I would never get back you know I forgot who I gave it to and it's gone I need to spend all this time making mixtapes and you know whatever gone and so I'm like there's got to be a way to track this and of course I could do it on paper or whatever but I had this computer thing so I eventually I got this thing called

[00:12:04] FileMaker Pro I don't know if you're familiar software right it's not programming it was like plugging stuff together so I plugged a bunch of stuff together I had always had an interest in interface design for some reason design and so I learned how to like make an interface I built this thing which I eventually called audiophile which was a way to keep track of the music collection that you had and all the tracks that were on the CDs of the tapes and who you loaned it out to and when and they would send you a reminder to get it back and the whole thing and I put up on AOL because this is before the

[00:12:34] Internet basically the internet really hadn't happened yet kind of 95 96 is when the internet sort of happened I put up on AOL and in that I put it up meaning like that's where you stored it or that's where you were then allowing people to access it the latter so AOL had this like these file library sections I don't even know what they were call see I don't recall this is a bit of a blurred this was a little bit early days and like file-sharing where you could there's like these special interest areas and you could upload files that were called binaries basically at the time and you could upload these files to

[00:13:10] AOL and share software with others so there's something called shareware this is kind of where you would put things like this there's also bulletin boards which is like you dial into with a modem and that kind of but aol's the big was the biggest one at the time so I uploaded some stuff to AOL and and in that was a text file saying hey if you'd like this send me 20 bucks like here's my addresses like my parents house just like send this to me and that summer I got 20 bucks in the mail from some guy in Germany remember getting the envelope it was like the red and blue checked airmail and Vilonia and Mike who - I don't know what been in Germany you know and like inside this envelope was this was this printout of this paper I had in twenty dollars and I realized for the first time that I could make something that I wanted that other people might want to and they were willing to pay for it so that's kind of

[00:13:58] I think even though today I'm doing the same thing now I have an business name and a 54 employees the whole thing it was just me back then in in you know the late 80s Early 90s doing this and I feel like it's the same exact business I'm in the same business which is making something that I need that I want recognizing that there's a lot of people in the world and there's probably some people out there like me who wanted to and package it up make it nice take care of it and put a price on it and sell it and that's what I've been doing for 30 years now basically so in your business sort of career was the contraband sale because we there's some really funny stories that you know you've told me and you've called Tim and and where you I mean you you definitely have an entrepreneurial spirit to put it that way mm-hmm so where was that occurring I'm trying member like the age oh this is junior high school so I don't know what is that 13 yeah it's something yeah I was into knives and throwing stars and switch blades and butterfly knives and teargas like office like military stuff that you kind of get into as a boy at least I did no no I'm the same way in fact this is the weirdest story - sorry to interrupt but it's so ridiculous that someone's mentioning a butterfly knife which I've almost forgotten what they are until you say that at an 8th grade party I had my butterfly knife because I was so cool and this girl she was the girlfriend of one of my friends and she was just like the coolest girl in the class like she was like a cool girl right and her name was dotty short for

[00:15:28] Dorothy and somehow like I let her talk me into carving her initial D into my shoulder with the knife which she did and I actually still have this scar on my arm I still have the D on my right shoulder from that 8th grade party with the butterfly knife and I didn't see da da ended up leaving school and stuff and we lost track of Jedi but I kind of came back into contact with her in 2016 and I was looking the first thing I showed her

[00:15:59] I was like do you remember this that is crazy so this want to encourage you to do that and you did it that's how I like yeah where you just kind of in this like misty eyed I'm gonna impress this girl thing or was there the funny thing is like I was sort of my quote/unquote you know air-quote girlfriend at the time was like another girl anyway who I was really into so no I don't even think I was trying to impress Dottie per se as much as maybe just everybody there like look at I'm tough enough that I can stand here while a girl grinds a knife into my arm while I bleed and I won't flinch wow your next level I mean I think it's speaks to just how it's amazing our species survive sometimes and you think of how stupid someone like me could be especially when we all get to be 13 you know just stupid and you're no stranger to stupidity no offense no stranger - yeah we're in the stupid we were in the stupid 13 year old

[00:16:55] Club so somehow I stumbled on this catalogue called the sportsmen guide which was like one of these mail-order army supply camping kind of things I think maybe my dad was on some listing like that showed up or something right that and I just loved it how could you not as a camo gear and like tactical flashlights and like all this kind of stuff and I had a job so I had money because my parents didn't give me any but I had a good job a good job selling shoes when I was in tennis rackets and but it was actually a pretty good paint job because out of commission and I was a good salesperson so I could sell enough and I was making like I remember 250 bucks in a week and I bought a bunch of this stuff that's a ton of money it was a lot whole week there was a certain tennis racket called the Yamaha secret ten and if you sold that racket you got $10 commission now I didn't play tennis

[00:17:47] I'm ashamed of this now I didn't play tennis but I told customers I did and I said I've never played better than with this Yamaha secret tank such a horrible lie like I feel terrible about it but anyway I amassed a small very very small small fortune but enough for me to place an order for some stuff that I wanted but I didn't have a credit card because you can't you don't have one you're 13 so things came C OD cash-on-delivery yeah remember that I totally forgot about co d yeah I don't know if they still do that or not but the UPS guy would come to our house and I would give him cash so I'd stay home from school that day I'd fake that I was sick I'd sail from school and the UPS person would come and I would I would give him give him cash and I get this box of stuff and then I would basically make a catalog and sell to my friends I'd like

[00:18:34] I'd get the stuff and it I actually physically made a catalogue by cutting and pasting things and doubling the price and Solent olds my friends and it wasn't even for the money I didn't care I was just like fun it's fun to get something and sell it for twice or whatever so I did that for a while until

[00:18:48] I got in trouble why did you get in trouble I get in trouble doing some other things that were not directly related but all related to like being a hooligan basically some friends particular friend of mine he I don't know who convinced you to do this so I'm not gonna blame him or take the blame one of us decided to fake assists just again terrible fake poison one of our friends by putting like a tic-tac in his milk at lunch and then he drank and we told him we poisoned him stupid stupid right so we didn't of course but he passed out in math that day later on the power of the placebo or the placebo we go there we go and so then like they had to pump his stomach because it's like I got in trouble for that and then that was just tied into all this other stuff and then like some friend got caught by his parents with knives where'd you get those well I got him from Jay it's like the whole thing came crashing down so your empire comes crashing down Empire crashing down but it was interesting because my parents told me they said hey look if you don't clean up we're gonna send you to boarding school and I cleaned up like that moment I wasn't bad

[00:19:54] I was just having fun I was pushing as far as I could until I couldn't anymore and then I couldn't and that was it did your parents not put limits on you before not really and now I'm asking this question through the lens of being a parent who's like I think anybody listening to this who's a parent including you the challenge I think there are many challenges being a parent but one of them is by definition there is enough of an age gap between you and your kid that this notion of setting limits is arbitrary enough because you don't have a great frame of reference as an example an obvious example what is the limit around electronics well it wasn't an issue for me when I was growing up we had this one total sack of cathode ray tube in our house that you wouldn't want to watch anyway like there were no limits around TV because all you wanted to do was go outside and play sports so like that whole concept of needing to limit television or things that didn't yet exist like phones and iPads I don't have a reference I don't I can't look back and say well this limit was placed on me and it was good or this limit was too stringent presumably for our kids their kids will be in a situation where the limits will look different so I really I enjoy this topic because I feel like there are some limits that must be preserved across generations limits around respect limits around Authority or things like that so so have you reflected back on the limits that were set on you and how you thought about those with your two children for example I have and I'm terrified of it honest because um I know what I got away with and I feel like where I lived was a lot safer to do some of these things perhaps but I remember my parents were very and still are now they don't control me anymore right but they were very forgiving they were very supportive of me they were there all the time whenever I needed something whenever I wanted something you were an only child right only child so that was probably part of it my mom actually tried to have a few kids before me but had I think three or four miscarriages maybe three before that puts a little extra pressure on you as this sort of chosen one yeah it was sort of me I mean I didn't know that that I didn't really care but like looking back I can see that now and it makes me ashamed of some of the things that I did as a child for example I ran track and my parents were at every single track meet I was on play basketball freshman year and

[00:22:16] I sucked I got into one game but my parents were at every game even though I was on the bench the whole time you know like so they were always there for me always were supportive always always gave me plenty of latitude in lots of room to do what I wanted to do and I really appreciate that and I think that that's it was valuable but I I got away with a lot of things that I probably shouldn't have

[00:22:35] I certainly pushed them a bit too far and I pushed myself a bit too far and there was quite a bit of tension near the end of my hooligan time and then I remember they just kind of told me this eventually like you got to stop this or we're gonna send you away said you're what like 15 16 I don't think I was driving yet so it's probably 15 I got in with like some of the wrong kids my parents knew it they called it from the beginning

[00:23:00] Nega you shouldn't be hanging out with these people but I did cuz you know that's what you do it's cool right and and then the pressures that's the sort of one I'm aware of now like my son's only five and my daughter's 11 months so like I've got some time here but you can only do so much as a parent I mean kids are gonna sort of do what they're gonna do I think anyway they give me a lot of room I did a lot of things I learned a lot but they also taught me from an early age to be very independent like getting a job right when I could and working and that sort of thing so I think the independence part of it was really important I think it really did shape me then I could figure things out on my own and get where I needed to go without a lot of support let's say there was support in terms of were there for you but I figured a lot of things out myself

[00:23:40] I was never really good at school either I was okay but I wasn't great I think it just kind of bored me thinking back to your point about kids now I'm just aware of these things now it helped me think about what it was like to be that age again so when these things come up with my kids I'll hopefully be able to to empathize a bit more then maybe if I was more perfect you know so you managed to dodge this boarding school bullet right yeah I did and then you go to college and what do you study sorry finance went to University of

[00:24:08] Arizona I picked finance because I didn't know what else to pick I loved business I was kind of doing business before right my dad was working for himself my grandfather started a grocery store chain way back when I think it's something I've always wanted to do and I felt like I good at it I like to stock market and like on the stock market I guess that's a finance degree I don't know right so I did that and truthfully I went to Arizona to chase the weather and and to chase a girl at the time in high school who was also going there and some friends I had were going there so I didn't really care I didn't think that much about college and I remember a couple years in I just wanted to be done because I was actually doing business I was then by that time I was starting to do website design after that he's offered a job in San Diego and I moved to San Diego for about six months I lived in the Gaslamp way back in the 90s when it was even dirtier Hey it was just beginning to turn they just built a Horton Plaza if that's right they just built that and it's starting to change down there but anyway I start doing website design and I actually felt like schools interfering with my education like I felt like I was learning so much more from doing business and finding clients and delivering work and getting paid or not getting paid and understanding what it's like to work with people in the world that school began to feel faker and faker to me because everything was very abstract everything was not real the work we were doing the products we were doing the projects we were doing they were all manufactured in a way where I just didn't feel like this is real like

[00:25:34] I can learn the real thing why would I spend my time doing this but eventually I finished but let's pause there for a moment because I'm really curious as to what the real assessment is of this phenomenon that everybody loves to talk about which is how many of the great entrepreneurs that we think of didn't finish college right everybody loves to tell the story about you know Zuckerberg and jobs and gates I'm curious now that you've been in the workforce for a long time but not only that but you're you're so highly attuned to the notion of recruiting talent are there a subset of people whose talent is such that going to university or college is truly a waste of time they're gonna go on and be really successful without it versus there's another subset of people who have the potential to be equally successful but they need that time to be on the rails versus it doesn't matter so could Jeff Bezos have just said forget

[00:26:29] MIT I'm literally gonna create this thing if the timing were right and he could have started Amazon if he were 10 years younger could he have skipped college and Investment Banking and just started Amazon and would we be adding him to the list of the Zuckerberg the gates the jobs is it's hard to say I think that there's some mythology around some of that I mean some people like

[00:26:50] Steve Jobs went to school like at a liberal arts college and sort of got into all sorts of interesting things like taking calligraphy classes and stuff but influenced his sort of flavor for exactly so the fact that he didn't finish school to me doesn't matter doesn't matter if you finish school or not in our field I mean perhaps an medicine it certainly matters right really but like in our world it doesn't matter so much because I think it's about what experiences you want what experiences you find interesting and being motivated by the things that you're doing so some people are motivated by learning in school some people are motivated by learning outside of school I don't think that there's a specific breed or type of person that couldn't finish school and needs to leave the world a school the educational world and get out in the real world like there's some moments in history where timing really matters I mean timing always matters but for example

[00:27:39] Zuckerberg like Facebook only exists because he went to Harvard it only exists because he wanted to build this thing to get to know other people at school or like the fact that he finished school that's what he didn't or did yeah exactly and you could even get experience right yeah if he had not gone to college like everyone likes to focus on he didn't graduate like that's cool whatever and maybe it is maybe it isn't but what's interesting is that to me although I have a big problem with

[00:28:02] Facebook but Facebook exists today because he did go to college I think that's actually the more interesting thing to focus on rather than like did you finish actually finish and get this piece of paper yeah so if we want to play with all these myths like Steve Jobs calligraphy classes will that influence design that influence typography on the Mac and that made a huge that changed the world in a lot of ways so school was important to jobs and school was important to Zuckerberg I don't know Gates's history he and Paul

[00:28:26] Allen met in high school didn't they they might have been old friends yeah but again like here's the other thing that I think's interesting we all like to call out the exceptions and think there's a lesson there right and we don't really know what the Graveyard looks like right the contrapositive and it's the same thing with venture capital

[00:28:43] I'm sure we might get into this but I can jump into it for a second which is that people like to look at or like hard work let's say hard work is actually a better example Bezos and so whatever they were work their ass off so like well there's a lot of people who work their ass off we get nowhere and they work really really really really hard and they make minimum wage if they're lucky and they work their whole life and it's very very difficult so this idea of hard work getting you somewhere I don't buy it

[00:29:06] Wow I wanted to go down the path of contrarian for going there Jews were there we're there I don't think that hard work the argument is that like no one else is working as hard as Zuckerberg therefore Zuckerberg worked hard and he come on please there's only 24 hours in a day to begin with I don't even know what working hard means like in my opinion if you get to sit behind a desk all day in an air-conditioned room there's no such thing as hard work hard work is picking strawberries in the field hard work is roofing and 120 degree heat that's hard work the intellectual work can be challenging work no question about it and it can be difficult work but as far as like the hard part of it the word hard like to me that's physically hard sweating and not getting paid not being respected that's hard it's hard to go to work every day when that's your reality I know I have a slightly different take on that I suppose than most but going in circles a little bit but basically there's a lot of myths around these exceptions and we tend to focus on the exceptions is like those are the exceptions and the exceptional people a lot of this has to do with luck and timing and and also skill and talent and observation and an opportunity and all these things but I think we put a lot of weight into things that probably have very little to do with it in fact so we can find patterns like these people dropped out of school therefore I should drop out of school and there's a lot of people who feel that way they want to follow their idols what I would say is well what did they get from that experience maybe that's something you should look for versus the drop out they drop out just a moment in time you decide not to go anymore that doesn't really mean anything I think that is actually a great point and you're right about the patterns I mean I think we are pattern forming machines and it probably served us incredibly well in fact I wrote a blog post on this a long time ago it's rare that I would even remember a blog post I wrote truthfully this is like one of my favorites I don't know why I just really

[00:30:56] I probably even gone back and read it once or twice so I don't remember the details but the gist of it was were not wired to think scientifically so all of these critical thoughts of reason trying to distinguish between correlation and causation these are incredibly modern phenomenon in fact you could argue that they represent less than 5 basis points of our genetic existence meaning like less than one twentieth of one percent of our genetic existence has been in exposure to the idea of thinking logically going through formal logic and reason the scientific method has not even been around for four hundred years and if that sounds like a lot you know obviously just reflect on how long our genes have been around but what has been around for a long time is pattern recognition in fact you would argue that it hasn't just been around for a long time we have we have sharpened that tool so well because as I think the example I remember using in this blog post was like if you were walking around in a tribe of thirty people and you see somebody over they are getting the desirable mate then you want to emulate what they're doing you see somebody over there getting sick well presumably whatever he ate or drank you shouldn't be doing and again will you ever be able to tease out the correlation versus the causation not a chance but if you were a good correlation identifying machine that was a very beneficial trait to be able to carry on and I just think that on this topic which is a low again it's off topic but it's it's it's such an interesting notion that we observe in ourselves most of us default back into that without even realizing it even when we think we're smart and smartypants in the end we're still kind of a bunch of knuckle-dragging pattern recognizing brain stems for sure but and also we look for the patterns that correlate with our own stories then you get into all of the biases of course right yeah so you have the confirmations that come with these things right and that's that's sort of where it gets to be dangerous but you kind of have to I mean you can't go through the world looking at everything fresh all the time you just wouldn't get anywhere I mean that's what so I think fastening about looking at kids I assume from what I can tell from observing kids like they don't have those patterns yet especially when they're young and they see a leaf for the first time they see a plant for the first time they see a caterpillar for the first time they're fascinated by it you and I walk right past those because we know what they are and weave the pattern is clear like that's a leaf that's a thing so you you end up missing all these interesting details probably because you jump over things it's like not all leaves are the same but we saw that's a leaf big deal but a kid's like what's this leaf once that leaf once this leaf and you're like come on we got to go like get your shoes on but they're fascinated by these little things so I think that we have to of course function with patterns or through patterns but I think oftentimes I end up reinforcing our own wishes like we were excited about the person who dropped out of school therefore like we find the patterns we find the things that line up and then we can tell our own story that matches with our own internal story but

[00:33:55] I try to look for things that are a little bit outside of that because it's a little obvious some of these things are really obvious in terms of if you don't dig a little bit deeper you end up believing the myths and I think there's a lot of that going on especially the entrepreneurial world right now where people are they look to companies like these big companies and they go well that's the way we want to build our company and that's the way we want to be what they do they took a hundred million dollars so we should take on your million dollars and they their founder is whatever and so we should be that way and the thing is is that I think people follow the wrong pattern so they're looking at big huge companies so they're starting a new business let's say there's three people in the business or themselves just themselves and they're looking to like well how does Apple do it well Apple is at a totally different scale from where you are you should not be following their patterns those are the wrong patterns to follow they don't make any sense for you just like you wouldn't expect Apple to follow your pattern it's like you're just one person but we end up following the wrong patterns and doing the wrong things because we want to get what they have but we don't realize that they started out where we started out - we just kind of feel like they just jump to be Apple and so like let's just do what they do when we're gonna get to where they're gonna get and I just don't think that's usually true what do you think is sort of among the top mistakes / myths that people starting businesses make not not even making the looking at Apple model but looking at other successful startups looking at like Dropbox or people like companies where you can say well look there was I can still remember when they were in their infancy but look what they're doing now like what are what are some of the common mistakes you see people talking about I think that most of this stuff is actually luck in timing and there's a clearly talent and skill involved too but sometimes things just happen at the right time meaning most of the successes that we look to as these beacons of brilliance we're under appreciating how much luck is involved I think so partially because if you just think about it this way like what if they all started again right now I could drop box

[00:35:53] B with drop boxes ten years from now like it is ten years in probably not and you'd say well why not they could do the exact same thing well because it's a different time and there's different competitive pressures and there's just different timing and there's different economic things going on if you can't replicate these successes then there's probably a lot of luck and timing involved in these things and it's not that people don't pay attention to that I just don't think they give enough value I remember early in my career I thought there was no such thing as luck

[00:36:18] I thought I was hot and I knew it all where in your life cycle is this this is in college post college i'll post college after starting our business probably i gave a talk will have to look this up i gave a talk at startup school which was a Y Combinator's thing i don't remember what year this was maybe it was 2007 I'm just guessing I mean I remember someone asked about luck and I remember answering I don't believe in luck

[00:36:42] I remember that answer distinctly and I am so ashamed of saying that but that was me at the time and I remember just being like no no I did this I did that we did it this way it's all intentional this has happened for a reason the whole thing and now I realize that that's probably not true at all in fact if I had to start the business again right now pretty good chance I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to do it at all so I think luck and timing has a lot to do with it and there's multi-dimensional luck and timing there's like how like your time there's the markets time there's competitors time there's there's the appetite for the public's time like there's a whole bunch of timing things in here I just don't think people pay enough attention that that's number one or maybe number two and three the other thing that I think people who start businesses don't realize is that it only gets harder business only gets harder it doesn't get easier so Basecamp is harder today than it was 20 years ago absolutely because we have more people we have more customers with those come all sorts of things customers you have expectations there's more competitors employees there's just more people-people are difficult there's just the notion of doing the same thing for a long period of time and and becoming blind to new things and you're so used to the way you've done things it's safe to say it's harder or it's just different like I'm trying to think of an example like I don't know every example I can think of I can immediately think of a counter example let me give you something kind of more specific than perhaps to frame it I'll hear a lot of entrepreneurs saying like I'm gonna work my ass off now so I don't have to later the assumption is is that if I put in all this time now it's going to be easier later so therefore I don't need to work those kind of hours are all hire people to do that stuff never works out that way well why is that the case well

[00:38:25] I don't know how much of it is the drive to work so hard now under the guise of not having to work hard later when you get to later you have failed to address that which it is that's driving you to work so hard in the first place and so you know work expands to fill available time you just come up with more stuff to do some of which may not even be necessary most of it I would say is probably not necessary I think that one of the reasons why it happens this way is that we just are creatures of habit so whatever you practice you get better at and sometimes you don't even realize you're practicing but if you're working 80-hour days you're gonna get really good at work or not even ADR weeks you're gonna get really really good at working 80-hour weeks that's just where you're gonna do a 12-hour days like that and then at some point you're like that's the only way to do this right because that's what I've done that's how

[00:39:14] I've gotten to where I've gotten and it's because of the hours I put in and therefore like if I pull back like this is all gonna fall apart so we just that's what we begin to do and that's how we begin to work the other thing is I think people underestimate how difficult it is to have employees I love our employees but like it's difficult to have employees like when you're starting by yourself it's just you you'd make all the calls you bring someone else on maybe it's great bring the fourth or fifth person on at some point there's personality conflicts things get a little bit more difficult and then you have to manage people and you have to hire managers and then you're a little bit out of the loop and before you know it you own the business but you're the last to know everything it's important about the business you don't know what people are upset you don't know what's going on you're so far removed from it and this is what happens and I think business just gets harder it does also just become different so there's just the difference that that's true but I think it becomes harder and I don't think people realize that and so I just see people going into things not recognizing that and just assuming that they can be self-destructive in the short term because in the long term it's it'll be worth it now I just haven't really seen a lot of that play out I see a lot of people actually ultimately destructed themselves and destroying themselves and then maybe selling their business or getting out and then trying to come back and never be able to do it again so the other thing I would say I don't know what number I'm on here if there's even numbers but I would say like if lightning strikes like keep that lightning in the bottle like it's a lot of people who are serial entrepreneurs

[00:40:35] I'm not one of those people I don't believe in that necessarily I think if you are lucky enough to have a hit ride it out until it's over versus stop and try and do it again chances are very slim that you can able to do it again if you actually truly have a hit so I'm not ashamed to say I don't think I could do this again but

[00:40:55] I'm totally comfortable with that a lot of entrepreneurs feel like they need to prove something to someone or themselves that they can do it over and over and over that's just not me so I think putting that idea out there is a good alternative because a lot of people think that by starting a business selling in five years in doing other ones song in five years in it's like the way to make a career I think the way to make a career sustain business not to get out of business now again is it possible that there's just a different edge that's being scratched I mean I want to come back to sort of this because you know your motivation is you know it's clearly not driven by some exit I mean base camps a private company mmm how many times a year you asked when are you gonna take this company public probably not that much anymore not that much because we've made the answer very clear yeah I get a email or two every week from a VC for ever private equity firm whatever it wanting to invest and the answer is always no I just don't want I don't want that pressure on me like the other thing I think that becomes clear or has become clear for me and probably everything I'm saying is my point of view none of these are facts I this is just what what I'm saying is that people end up making things really hard on themselves

[00:42:00] I don't think business is that difficult if you don't make it hard on yourself but people make it they they grow too fast they raise money from the outside they put unnecessary expectations on themselves they are forced into a growth track where they have to grow and they have to produce returns they have to then hire people because they have money in the bank from the investor because that's where you spend money on people basically in marketing and then you get ahead of yourself and you're over your skis and now you're screwed you're in trouble so now you have to keep fueling the growth and raising more money and it's like I've talked to a bunch of people who have done this and they all pine for the good old days when they were a group of eight people just doing it right I mean it sort of got out of control for them so I see that happening a lot too and I think this is like self-destructive behavior even though people don't know so see it that way they see it as like business building but a lot of businesses are destructed and destroyed by unreasonable expectations of growth and having too much money in the bank something I'll talk I've talked about before is that making money is a skill just like playing guitar as a skill just like anything is a skill and if you want to get good at it you have to practice it in our industry in the software industry a lot of companies will lose money for years and years and years and they think they actually say like we can just pull the lever and become profitable whenever we want that would be like saying you can walk on stage and play guitar really well whatever you want you can't you have to practice you have to practice making money which means that if you keep borrowing money and keep having other people fund your operations you don't have to get in the black then when are you going to get good at this skill and to me like an entrepreneur needs to be able to make money they need to be able to make their own fuel to need to be able make their own food in their own water that's what profit is and profits the only thing that keeps you in business ultimately and if you have to rely on other people that provide that fuel for you I think you're at a real disadvantage and I think you're putting undue pressure on yourself so let's use an example that's very top of mine because it's just it's somewhat recent which is uber right yeah terrible business uber is not profitable but the story is it could be profitable at any moment it just has to choose profitability over growth right well it's a great example because it's a textbook terrible business everyone thinks it's a great success it's horribly lost about 1.8 billion last year on 11 billion in revenue or whatever it is or maybe last quarter I don't even know if it's quarter a year or what numbers there's huge losses right the fact that you can't remember that it probably says in a massive losses and in their CEO says you know like just if you we're just getting started on this amazing journey it's like you've actually been in business for a long time yeah about ten years ten years you've raised over a billion dollars in capital you're a public company not like what is this journey when is this gonna work because right now I think right now for every buck they make or they pull in they're losing 20 or 30 cents or whatever it is it's like terrible like the economics are terrible and they don't seem like they're gonna change unless they actually change the pricing model which might make it less attractive to two riders on top of that uber is a dumpster fire in terms of ethics they've done a lot of bad things let's say with tracking journalists and the way they went after competitors and all whole bunch of stuff that's pushed by growth they have to show numbers these businesses like uber and even like lyft and like we work and like a number of these businesses that are quote successful they're not at all they're actually terrible businesses the dry cleaner on the corner is a better business they're gonna be around longer than we work

[00:45:22] I don't follow this stuff at all so it's this is all sort of again I'm one of those guys that would just naively say well they're everywhere so they're doing well right yeah or just that oh they sent the concept of we work makes sense but truthfully I've never put like my business hat on and actually scratched the back of the envelope and looked at what they're paying per square foot and how they arbitrage it and then what their middle costs are like I don't actually I haven't done that analysis all I have to do is look at their filing and they say there's a good chance we will never be profitable like they know that themselves how is that possible that's what like almost all of these

[00:45:56] IPOs that file these days in the tech world say like there's a good chance we will never become profitable that's what it says in the in the rest ones is we works s1 on the street yes it is no it is okay yeah these businesses are terrible like parking but then let's use the counter example of Amazon sure okay so Amazon went public long before they turned a profit continued to lose incredible amounts of money while growing an equity value like crazy and the now that would you argue that AWS basically saved Amazon or do you argue that at some point Amazon just turned the ship and said look we're gonna focus more on profitability than on pure growth well let me even step back further go I don't care because it's one example and this is the thing that like ends up happening you know so you think Amazon might be an exception as sort of what you're I think pretty much most of these companies are exceptions because if you think about like most of the the ones we all talk about our exceptions I will address the Amazon point a second toe but people always will go well what about Amazon well you're not Amazon and if it was so easy everyone company would be doing this they're not like Amazon is a very different kind of company they've basically said we don't want to pay anything in taxes so we're gonna roll every offer profits back into the business AWS is a huge part of their business maybe for people listening to this who we're getting a little deep in the weeds can you tell people what AWS is and how that sort of is such an important piece of Amazon yeah so AWS is

[00:47:24] Amazon Web Services which is basically an outsourced cloud like you can basically use Amazon services and hardware to run your own business in their cloud they're kind of they built it for themselves and then they basically made it available for everybody else so instead of having to buy a data center or co-host physical machines somewhere you can just buy a slicer there's if that hopefully maybe yeah and I remember just a position perspective I remember in 2014 one of my best friends maybe was 2013 it was 13 or 14 one of my best friends who was running a hedge fund we were having dinner one night and whenever I'm having getting with people I'm much more interested in there were held in mine so

[00:47:58] I try to monopolize the conversation around them so I don't have to answer a bunch of questions and this was one of those nights where I was like tell me about the most interesting long position you have right now that and he's like Amazon and I'm thinking it's gonna be some company I've never heard of and he's gonna tell me about some offshore oil company in Brazil that's got this thing and vulva and it's like no it's

[00:48:18] Amazon and I'm like why and that was the very first time I ever heard of AWS and he basically showed me the entire share price of Amazon is captured by AWS you're getting a retail business for free in 2013 and you're you have a appropriately valued AWS and of course me naively I was thinking but their price to earnings ratio is so 200 or you're saying about this the wrong way so what you're saying is look that's a bit of an exception I don't know enough about Microsoft but given that they're a software business and we've been talking about where I assume Microsoft was pretty profitable at the outset they've been profitable for years as has Apple two great companies wonderful companies I guess my point is this their stories actually don't matter because that's not like in my world that doesn't matter because I'm more interested in small businesses and like real businesses that have to show profit like you can't be

[00:49:16] Amazon the dry cleaner in the corner cannot be Amazon the pizza shop in the corner cannot be Amazon they're not gonna if you said hey pizza shop well let's say this let's say a pizza shop owner comes up to you and goes I got an idea I'm gonna lose money in every slice of pizza I sell but I'm gonna sell a lot of them what do you think of my business you go that's stupid what are you talking about you're gonna be out of business and everyone in the world would know that so like those are the economic laws that most people are under Amazon and some of these other companies are exceptions now Apple hugely profitable

[00:49:46] Microsoft is profitable those to me are better models than like but what about Amazon I have a lot of respect toward Amazon's done I also lately have a lot less respect for what Amazon's doing I think that they might be a net negative given a number of different things I think the pressure they put on the system the fact they don't pay federal income tax and I know they say well we're doing with what's within the law like okay fine but I think there should be a little more corporate responsibility in the world and I think like companies that generate billions in revenues have an obligation to pay taxes but aside from that I also think that given their largesse I feel like they could they could treat workers live better and they can do a number of things I also think they put undue pressure on smaller businesses and they sort of dominating the market for example like our book 98 percent of sales come to your Amazon and that's just kind of wrong I don't think that's good even though it's convenient to buy they've made that the user experience incredible so I can't fault them for running that kind of business but it still feels like in the world things are a little bit better when there's a few more options not fewer options and I think that Amazon has a reduced the number of options people typically have these days but that's a that's an aside my general point is that we all like to look at these outliers and go but what about and I got you that's not your world you don't get to be them unfortunately you don't get to be them you have to actually generate more money than you spend you have to pay your employees the public is not going to endlessly give you money forever you're just not that so we can look at these examples but I just don't think they're relevant to most companies truly what's the natural history then of these businesses of the we works and the Ebers of the world like you I mean you sort of I think basically said look at some point the public will either demand profitability in which point prices have to go up in which case profitability might not be as much as you think because at some point you're going to drive people back to taxis or whatever the alternative was I'm still sort of reeling in this idea that these companies are that bad from a pure business standpoint they are you should look at the numbers they're terrible and this is like I know you don't read fiction and that's something you and I have in common we've just basically decided there's too much other stuff I need to read fiction I've read one work of fiction since 1999 so I'm at 20 years one work of fiction but this is another one of those things that I used to be very interested in when I worked at

[00:52:08] McKinsey like there is nothing I enjoyed more than reading the entire Wall Street Journal cover to cover every morning I don't even read the news anymore I've just decided I'm not reading the news like ever I'm the same way I don't read the news either but I've looked into these numbers because I'm curious it's relevant they're vulnerable you're terrible numbers and the thing is is like these companies there's a sense that they deserve to exist no matter what no they can go out of business like uber could go out of business and why shouldn't they it's a crappy business it's a terrible business right now maybe it'll turn around at some point they've had 10 years maybe I'll turn on some point but there's this assumption that these things are now part of our world therefore they must be there forever I just don't think that that's true there will be other people who come along who maybe make a profitable model out of this but and there's been a number of things around ride-sharing lately that have come out traffic is worse because of ride sharing pollution is worse because of ride sharing there's a lot of cars idling with nobody in there so will autonomous vehicles change this for uber I think they might although I think that's much further off than we all think I think it's very very far actually but I do think that that's probably what they're holding out for they want to dump all their drivers because they don't want to deal with them and they've kind of said this publicly which is amazing to say that about people who work for you right now like we're basically trying to eliminate you and they want to go through autonomous but I think that's also selling the dream to investors right to buy to buy a longer longer position and just go in but and make the investment but I think that's very very very far out so they're of course running trials and doing all the stuff and they get new stories for it but I think we're very very far off from that you can just see like the best in the business at this Tesla we don't have one now but we had one and their autopilot like it's actually a crime to call it autopilot I think they shouldn't have called it that that's part of the problem the expectations are wrong it's not autopilot it's like assisted driving and it's really quite good at that but to leave your hands off the wheel and Trust the thing which is what autopilot would basically suggest you're gonna kill yourself so if they're the best in the game and that's where they're currently yet maybe there's there's some massive technology advances around the corner that we don't see over the hill whatever but as it is today were nowhere near autonomous vehicles like really driving on the streets with human beings and pedestrians and bicyclists and all that stuff I just don't think it's anywhere close yeah that's sort of been my uninformed I guess bias would be the only way to describe it which is I think the problem is way harder than it's being sold because it's way more asymmetric yes and I think it's easier if you for example I have to think it's it would be easier if you had like dedicated roads only for our autonomous vehicles where they would all behave the same way and follow the same rule not only that and if each car could be autonomous overnight in other words if you could immediately allow every vehicle to communicate with every other vehicle and you could eliminate all of the humans simultaneously I think that's actually easier to imagine than a gradual transition where you infuse in autonomous vehicles you know and there's a point when like 7% of them are autonomous and 93 percent are driven by knuckleheads well the 93 percent of us who are knuckleheads driving cars I don't know if AI is good enough to fully understand the depths of our stupidity I totally agree so it's the phasing in which seems like but that's the part that I've decades in decades away I agree if there was dedicated lanes where all the cars talked then they all follow the same rules and they all have the same language different story but that's not the story like we can't build more roads right now like there's where you're gonna build roads in Manhattan like where is that gonna happen so they're gonna have to phase in and that I think is really far away but anyway we work lyft uber look at the economics terrible businesses uber and lyft I mean the public markets are saying these are actually quite bad they're down quite a bit off they're off their highs with named IPO so like people are starting to wake up to this and they're saying I don't think there's anything here the funny thing is like I love talking about this stuff so much and I realized it's probably somebody at this point of the podcast saying what in the world does this have to do with anything that I want to hear these guys talk about so let's let's go back to post college you're doing some software stuff right website design website design you ever get any interesting feedback on website design I remember when I was first getting going with this

[00:56:22] I I thought I was good there was this award thing back then I think it's called high five Awards something like that and back then this is before you had like WordPress where people could basically take a template and to it you're doing this from scratch from scratch this is like writing basic HTML website code basic stuff this is mid to late 90s this so this is about 95 96 is when I started doing this stuff because that's kind of when the web became visual before that it was like mostly text-based right so most mosaic was a big step forward and I remember the summer of 94 when I was using mosaic on a Sun workstation and it was like I didn't know what I was looking at yes that was Game Change that was the moment that everything changed in the world

[00:57:02] Netscape IPO in August of 95 if I recall I remember when that was okay 94 95 was a that's when I changed was a step function yeah exactly and and that's when a change and that's when it became commercially viable for companies to have websites or even begin to think about the web there I was in college board the junior I think in 90 I graduated 96 I love design and I knew a little bit about computers and back then it was really easy to learn how to do this stuff cuz no one knew what they were doing and so like it was just dead simple today it's really hard another example I could I pick up what I know today probably not it's really hard I mean yeah I could but like everything's got more complicated back-end was simple anyway I figure out how to make some websites I went around to some sites actually financial sites email that the bottom and said like webmaster at whatever because that's what everyone had back then so I've emailed these people and say hey I like your site but I think I could make it look better like will you give me a shot a couple of them replied yes and so I did some simple work first job I ever had was like six hundred bucks doing some guy's website actually guy named

[00:58:03] Tim forget his last name but it was called profit data services it actually based out of San Diego Tim Knight was his name he's still around actually doing this stuff but anyway I he gave me a shot and I did some work for him and I did some work for another guy named Keith Cruikshank in San Diego and start doing more work for him and then he offered me a job when I graduated from college in 96 so went out San Diego and sort of worked with him was just me and him for about four months five months and I realized

[00:58:29] I'm just not built to work for other people I just knew it at that moment I kind of had a like a suspicion before I've had jobs before but they were like you know part-time jobs and that's fine but as far as like a full career job I couldn't work for somebody else I had a hard time doing something I didn't believe in or didn't agree with it just couldn't do it what do you mean by that like wizard I mean these guys weren't asking you to do anything unethical no no nothing so what did you not believe in I realized that my motivation went to zero because it wasn't your idea no it wasn't that it was more like for example an aesthetic decision or like if

[00:59:04] I had to do something that I just didn't agree with aesthetically or like structurally or in terms of like copywriting a sentence that I didn't like I just it's not that I couldn't do it it just my motivation went to zero I just didn't want to do so it wasn't about you having a boss it was about you having a client if I'm your client and I say Jason you know you probably noticed the attea medical website sucks can you help me redo it is the issue that I would say well I really I much prefer to have serif fonts here but sans serif fonts here and if you thought that was wrong you just couldn't do it or is it that I'm talking to a guy between us who's telling you what I'm telling him it's not the client side I'm okay with working with clients it was more the boss situation it wasn't this fellow named Keith who was a great guy it wasn't that it was just purely a function of motivation I realized that I don't want to spend my day on something

[00:59:58] I feel like I begrudgingly have to if I don't have the intrinsic motivation to get it done like I just if I just look for example with writing like I love writing if I had to write a sentence in a certain way just to appease somebody because they were paying me like it was it was my job I would write the sentence but I'd be miserable by the end of the day I'm like

[01:00:17] I don't why am I doing this like why am i spending my day doing things I don't want to do and I don't agree with that like you could do that once or twice or five times of course but like when that became something that was clear to me that we had like a we had like aesthetic differences and with my boss we had like just fundamental principle outlook differences around the work itself yeah

[01:00:40] I could do the work but I didn't want to do the work and if I don't want to do the work why was I doing it why was I wasting his time while I always think other people's time I was out wasting my time I realized that I have to be motivated by the work itself that's what drives me it's not the money it's not success it's like I get the plug it's like Fineman like the pleasure is in the final thing outright it's not the awards it's that and so for me that's what it was and if I have to do something I just didn't enjoy

[01:01:05] I just motivation was gone and if you don't have that you're screwed because then there's no carrot that can pull you along I mean they can pull you along in the short term but long term can so which I want to come back to this theme by the base camp but let's keep going with this story so I quit live in San

[01:01:18] Diego for a few more months moved back home to Chicago and then start doing freelance website design on my own which in the mid-90s looks like what how are you finding clients same way I did before which was that I would just reach out to people who had websites because everyone's website at that time is are you finding the people who don't have websites aren't they the people that need you even more no so I've never focused on that I always focused on redesigning because I felt like I could show an improvement if there's context it's certainly there's always context from zero to nothing but I felt like I had the ability to take something that someone had and elevate it basically in a way where they'd be like I want that version of the thing that I have so I always have focused on redesigns so I would go to websites that I use and I'd find out how to get in touch with the owner and say hey sometimes I would send them like a free mock-up that I would make or something and say here's what I would do with your thing and eventually you get a few clients and you a few clients and sometimes you don't have any so you make up a fake client and design something yourself and show someone something this is what I would do to this Bank if I could which is something we eventually did at our company where we did this whole thing called the Better Project where I was so frustrated with how FedEx is website worked that I just redesigned it for myself I mean I couldn't use it cuz it wasn't FedEx's website but I made a mock-up of it this is how you'd want it to be is how I'd want it to be and we got a lot of publicity over doing like better FedEx better Bank better car interface better PayPal we didn't get hired by these companies but we it was a way for us to show what we could do if we had the chance and so sometimes you have to create your own clients that's what I kind of did too and sort of got that word out there and then word sort of spread it was just me so I've out my cost was zero my rent I was paying a hundred bucks a month to live I lived in working the same place of course my costs were zero basically not zero but nine hundred bucks I could cover that this is one of my things I never get ahead of myself I never spend more than I make I never put myself in a bad position I'm a believer in risk but never putting yourself at risk which is it different so I had there firend she ate those for me risk is like taking a shot that if it doesn't work no big deal and we do that all the time at Basecamp but what I will not do is bet the company on something I mean maybe I would figure out that I've done that looking back if something didn't work but I would not knowingly go into something go this has to work we're going all in on this or else like it's over and this is another great example of history is littered with these hero stories of betting the company on you know what was Apple bet on I mean Apple was bet on the Mac yes when we released the Mac in 97 was the entire I mean that company was hemorrhaging cash yes when

[01:03:58] Jobs came back disaster and they bet big they had now in retrospect yeah was that I mean well yes but even even I mean but member Annie Duke I don't know if you ever heard the podcast I did with her I mean any I think does this great job of differentiating outcome from process and stuff like that but in retrospect do we still think like if there were a thousand universes with a thousand apples all in the same position and the company was bet do like 800 of work out well or did we see one of just 75 of a thousand that worked out well well I think there could have been a course a bunch of different outcomes

[01:04:34] Microsoft could have bought them someone else could have bought them but looking around this table right now I have an iPhone you have an iPhone you have an iPad these things would not have existed in the world had Apple not made that initial bet with the the Bondi blue iMac so all those things led to these things whether or not that's clear saying it's not in your person at like that's your type of leadership is not designed to be in that moment maybe the way Jobs was the right guy for that role yes although

[01:04:59] I will also admit that I haven't been in a position where I had to do that and that's sort of partially intentionally and also perhaps by luck but Jobs came back he had nothing to lose Apple was dying you could almost say like what else were you gonna do why come back and do the same thing make another Newton make another Newton which didn't really pan out although some of those ideas were not prescient amazingly yeah totally not his Yeah right but but anyway like looking back on it of course was the right move but there's a bunch of littered you know histories littered with the companies they try to but for me I just don't see the point like I'm about the odds what are the odds like with any decision I make I don't really think probabilistically necessarily but

[01:05:43] I do think about it in a broad sense like what if this goes wrong like David's my co-founder my business partner we always talk about this like what if this doesn't work what's the worst that's gonna happen and it's like well like we're making a new product right now okay we have Basecamp we're gonna do another product what if this we spend a year building this other product what if it doesn't work out then we spent a year building it and we're not going to go out of business because of it we still have a very healthy business with Basecamp still growing we're fine the worst that can happen is we spend a year if we spent 10 years that'd be a problem if we spent seven years that'd be a problem but we can afford to spend a year on this I'm not gonna do something I cannot afford to do I just don't see the point in it like I'm more for self-preservation I don't need to like hit the Grand Slam like I want to keep doing this like I found my dream job which is running my own business why would I want to put that at risk now you could say if you don't take more risks someone's gonna beat you and I would say you're probably right and at some point we will lose and our company will go out of business and the company will die and that's what happens to every single company in the world essentially except like there's some Japanese companies that burned like 40 generations or whatever companies die and that's okay too this stuff doesn't have to last forever but if we look back David and I've talked about this too like let's say in six years it just Peters out well that would suck but also like that's a 26 year run that's not so bad so I always tend to look at it that way but I'd also want to stay in business so

[01:07:10] I don't want to take the risk they could put us out of business I want to just take risks but not put ourselves at risk so that's kind of I don't know if that defines it well enough but that's how I think about these things so before Basecamp now going back to the mid-90s your one-stop-shop you're one man nine their daughter apartment guy and then how is that going I mean that this is the story I'm pushing you to is this funny submission to a contest yeah so yeah so around that time I thought it was good I mean I was I was good enough for clients they were paying me and I was staying afloat and this is great there was this award site and I was sort of excited about it because a lot of I wanted an award like I wanted to be recognized which is like a very human fundamental thing now since then I've realized awards are nothing I'm interested in but at the time I was young and like excited to be on the scene right get someone else's approval so I submitted this website design to this award site I got an email back saying like basically you suck you should not do this this should not be the line of work you're in I think maybe some people would be destroyed by that but I've always felt that to be motivation like okay let me show you what I can do or well button like I didn't care do you see a grain of truth in the feedback did you think no I didn't believe it I thought it was good

[01:08:20] I thought I was good at what I did I am good at what I do and I thought so but like what I realized was that like everyone's opinion is purely subjective especially when it comes to this kind of stuff like this is just a guy I don't even know this guy why should I let this guy piss me off but he did like now I look back at that go why would I ever let someone else take my mind over like that and make me upset that his opinion who cares about his opinion but he was sort of seen as a Rainmaker kind of type at the time so I didn't get that word but it just motivated me like I've always been motivated by that like if I someone thinks I'm not good at something or can't do something that fires me up it doesn't piss me off

[01:08:56] I mean it pisses me off but it doesn't make me upset so it's sort of a productive channeling of at least a quasi productive channeling except you could say it's revengeful which is not productive in that regard but like I wouldn't do it to shove it in his face that's that's not why I would ever do it

[01:09:11] I would do it because like I think I am good and just motivated me to keep keep working at that so I got better and better and better eventually you hone a craft like that where you're on the it's the Wild West stay yeah practice you just keep doing it and then you find your you find your aesthetic you find your your eye you find what you're good at what you're not good at and you kind of double down so for me what I was good at was I actually wasn't very good at making I'm not a trained designer so I couldn't make sophisticated three-dimensional design

[01:09:43] II things right what I was really good at was laying out a copy a writing copy laying out text laying out simple graphics so things were orderly and structured in a way where people who hit the site will go I understand what this company's selling because a lot of companies have a really hard time explaining themselves and helping people get to the thing that they're trying to sell they just can't explain their own thing they're too close to it so I got really good at that because that was what was within my ability that was it I didn't have the desire to flex outside of that let me just get good at what I'm good at like why do I need to get good at everything like let me get good of that so I kept doing that got really quite good at it eventually hired another person cuz I got a really big gig somehow I won this gig for Getty

[01:10:23] Images which is a big huge company if I make the stock photos and stuff like that yeah they're launching this new service called Getty one which was a the first aggregate they had a bunch of different stock photo libraries and you had to search all the separate stock photo libraries to find a picture of the the Empire State Building or something so Getty one was gonna be a new site where they aggregated all their results into one place it was just me at the time I won the gig to design that site actually from scratch because they didn't have that site but they had an identity and they had some other stuff but I beat out a bunch of big companies and someone really took a bet on me made it bad I mean so I ended up hiring my first employee then a guy named Matt

[01:10:59] Linderman who lives here in New York now and he was with me for like 12 years after that we work together for a long time and that was my first employee from that we grew very and how did that become Basecamp is that the vehicle that became Basecamp well eventually so that was the company was called 37signals at the time and we started getting busier and busier and doing more and more projects and then we needed a better way to manage the work that we were doing is we were managing our projects using email at the time and and phone calls and in-person meetings and and paper and like stuff was slipping through the cracks and we couldn't figure out where things were I didn't know where to find something somewhere else put something in the wrong place like you can't work that way you can kind of work that way for a minute and then an hour later it's a total mess so we built Basecamp like when I built my audio product we built Basecamp for ourselves for our own specific needs didn't even realize it was going to be a product but then we used it with our clients and they said hey what is this thing you're using we have projects - can we use this thing - manager more like no it's just this thing and then eventually enough people asking like ah there's a product here we tightened it up cleaned it up put a price on it put out in the market called a base camp in February 5th 2004 which happened to be the same day Facebook launched interestingly enough about a year and a half later was making more money for us than website design so we stopped doing website design and transitioned to do software entirely I'm skipping over a few things like when I met David my business partner and stuff but he was a student Copenhagen Business

[01:12:23] School he's from Denmark I hired him to do some projects before that and we ended up building Basecamp together so he did the backend to Basecamp but I did the front-end design along with another person we had at the company that's what happened but it wasn't a plan I don't plan I don't have goals yeah the next thing I want to ask you about is your very famously said you don't set goals mm-hmm I'm not a goal driven person how does that work how doesn't it work I mean it works well you're talking to a guy like so by contrast like everything in my life seems to be about a goal or something and so when I was in high school every day I would wake up and write a new my goals because sometimes they would change a little bit so I would like to I would have a goal I don't know how this really started but I had goals in what I perceived as all areas of physical fitness so I wanted to run 5 5 minute miles so 5 miles in 25 minutes was a and I wanted to I had goals in strength so I wanted to be able to bench press squat and deadlift certain amounts I don't exactly remember what they were but they were very very high much higher than anything I could dream of doing today you know I had certain anaerobic goals certain goals with respect to flexibility and muscular endurance like

[01:13:39] I mean I really had this long list of goals and I would literally write them out every day in many days I was just rewriting what was there the day before I mean no change right but over the course of years there was tweaking you know I was realizing oh you know what you that's that's a bit of a sandbag goal you're you're actually gonna hit that goal within six months let's stretch it out a little bit and then there were times when you know for example like I never could do the five 5-minute miles I don't know what it was like I could do so I really I changed that to five six-minute miles which I could do again not just to move the goal line but because I also realized like I was just not gonna get to five five so you could have that goal on there forever but at the time I certainly didn't know how to train for that I'm not sure I ever could have but the way I was training which was in retrospect running far too long and far too slow was gonna plateau me there so that was kind of a goal modification basically that has sort of stayed with me forever that habit I don't think I'm as literal today I don't actually write them down on post-it notes anymore but you know then in college I wanted to be able to spend you know this summer I would want to go through the entire book of integrals and know how to derive every single interval and all these sort of things so so no for me it's like everything in life comes down to these these goals and I still do have a to-do list which is kind of a mini goal list of I have a daily weekly and then non time constraint personal and non time constraint professional to-do list so yeah this is a totally foreign concept people should do what motivates them what I realized was that goals don't motivate me because goals turn into one of maybe three things like one is just disappointment you don't hit it and then you're disappointed like I'm not sure I want to do something that ends in disappointment like why should I even set myself up for ending up in disappointment to you end up just like hitting it and then setting a new one so like so you're on a treadmill or on the treadmill of like forever setting these fake numbers I mean you just pick you guess like five minute mile like that's just a round number it's easy to say but like what is it why is it better than a 512 miles is it what does it mean the other one is that you end up I think just kind of chasing things without really thinking about it my feeling is that I had some experiences where I didn't realize this until later but for a while

[01:15:54] I did want to run like certain times you know you go out for a run and let's say you want to run a six-minute mile like recreationally you go for a run you want to set a six-minute mile you wear your watch you time it and you end up getting like a six oh six or something or six oh eight order around you didn't hit your goal you're disappointed now you could say well I'm knocks next time I'll get it but like at some point you're like I didn't get this this number that's like the wrong way to frame it the better question is like did I enjoy the run did

[01:16:22] I get some fresh air did I move my body did I feel challenged to some degree like if I did all of those things what does the number have to do with anything the number is nothing it doesn't mean a single thing a six versus six oh six it's different if you're like an athlete like training for something you need to beat someone else's time okay that's a different story but I'm not that so why should I focus on trying to hit a fake number why not try to hit things like did I have a good time at it did I get outside and run for 45 minutes and get my heart going did I enjoy myself did I get a break today get to think about some things like those are the things that are more interesting to me so there's that side of it the other side of it is I just want to do the best work

[01:16:59] I can anyway so because I want to run a five minute or six minute or seven minute like I'm just gonna run the best I can anyway I don't need the number to tell me what that is this is maybe tying back to the whole thing one of the reasons why I quit that job is if I'm not motivated by the work itself it doesn't matter I have to enjoy the work and for me the pleasure is the thing itself just doing the best I can and given day and just like seeing where it comes out like okay that's not necessarily incongruent with having a goal right so let's use your health as an example because that's something we obviously talk about right which is again putting semantics aside if we're gonna take the word goal off the table you have objectives correct I mean I want to go in a certain direction yeah well also I think it would maybe even more than that I mean don't you have a model for or in your mind's eye a sense of what the 85 year old

[01:17:56] Jason should be able to do what does success look like when you're 85 this is kind of this back casting idea from Annie Duke right don't think about how many miles you have to run tomorrow or how much weight you need to lift next month or next week but think about what the wind state looks like at 85 not that that's the end of your life but let's just use that as a point in time and you have to have an objective of that to sort of at least get in the direction of getting there don't you I think about it in terms of at base camp we don't have company goals but we have a vision like we have a direction we're going we have things we want to do because we think they're the right thing to do and the right way to do them so for me like living trying to live to be 85 and be able to goblet squat 30 pounds or ever these things are like to me that's more of like the vision side of things like I want to get there because it'd be nice to be alive that long and to be healthy that long why would I want to not be that way it's I don't I just don't see it as a goal I don't see it as like a distinct thing that I either here's what maybe what I think if you don't hit a goal most people are disappointed like when I'm 85 if I can't do that

[01:19:02] I don't want to be disappointed when I'm 85 years old I want to like I tried or I did whatever but like I don't want to have this point where I have to go did I make it or did I not am I disappointed or am I happy like dude that's the thing maybe it's subtle but I think it's an important distinction like when I will just go out for a run I don't have to measure up against something and decide whether or not I worked hard enough ran fast enough whatever I can just go did I enjoy it it was a good for me did I like it so you could say like the goal is like health yeah there's there's that but it's very broad it's not a number maybe it's the number goals I don't like maybe it's like the milestone goals I don't like but like directionally I do have definitely I want to go in specific directions it might just be also again I think the process part of it if you want to be able to goblets go out 30 pounds correctly when you're 85 you'll have to do a lot of work between now and then to maintain it because you can do that today quite easily but gravity is going to really work against you over the next 40 years and if when you get there you goblet squat 25 pounds instead of 30 I don't think anybody would say that that's a failure and more importantly I guess it's that objective which you know for me we use this example because I it's one of the things on my centenarian olympic list of you know 20 different events to be able to do but what's it in service of I guess is the question maybe that's where we are probably saying the same thing in a different way I mean to me it's not about a goblet squat it's that 30 pounds represents the weight of a toddler and a goblet squat which is to say a squat position where you have to be in scapular protraction and be able to pick something up in front of you that's what it's like to pick a toddler up and I want to be able to pick up a toddler when I'm 85 I would agree with that but to me that's like a direction versus I see so let's bring it back to the company because this is still a very unusual concept within the company which is really a big part of what I want to talk about today there is no shortage of stories horror stories really of companies that have just gone so far ethically off the rails because of creating perverse incentives so you know this great story with on the podcast with Katherine event about the generic drug companies REM backsies only goal is profitability like literally nothing else matters and unfortunately that goal superimposed in a cultural environment that produces sort of different sets of ethics that are deemed almost acceptable leads to devastating consequences where

[01:21:25] I mean they'd sell you cyanide if it was profitable if they could make enough money on it they despite your medication with with that so you have to motivate people should we even start that that's not necessarily an assumption like you have 54 employees do they need motivation and if so do you feel you need to provide some of it everybody's very different I think we have to set a vision a direction of where we're going that's people want to be on board with that if the trains going this direction you want to be on that line or not like there's that but I think a lot of it is more day-to-day in the actual work itself and that people have the autonomy and the control over their own work and their own work environment and their own schedule and their own time that to me is the more important side of it versus dragging someone along with a carrot which is like this bonus or that thing or whatever or the it's point that's coming worth 17 billion and you've got this much stock equity and options and you can convert that it's like yeah some people are can be motivated by that but I don't think that's that's a healthier and long term motivation so for me it's more about the day to day autonomy of the work the time they have to themselves every day and the environment that we can create for people I think that's the thing that's often most overlooked is that people always talk about we want to hire the best in the world we want to hire you know it's like and you can hire the best in the world but if the environment is crap like you're not gonna get the best work out of those people and they're gonna leave at some point I'm more interested in creating a great environment than I am motivating people around specific business goals it's just

[01:22:55] I don't think people care about specific business goals that's not they they're a writer they're designer they're programmer they they care about the work that they're doing and how it all relates of course but like whether or not we hit some number I don't think most people care unless your compensations tied to it but I think that's a whole other problem I don't think that's a good thing to do either let's talk about hiring let's start with hiring you have some hiring practices that are not always in the norm how do you guys hire we spend like weeks writing job ads first of all a lot of companies like oh that's HR department just like throw something up there with a bunch of bullet points you need 5 to 12 years experience this and whatever we actually try to write in a way that truly conveys what it's like to work in this position and what your day-to-day would actually feel like and we put a lot of time into it because we feel like if we want to get the best people we can we're gonna attract the best people with with with that kind of job description so we're very clear about that we also put salaries in the job descriptions and job ranges because there's no reason not to why is that typically not the norm I think the big reason is because companies feel like it's their job to negotiate the best rate they can from a person like they're trying to get the most out of somebody I don't feel like that's something I'm interested in in terms of like I don't want to if I could have paid this person 160 they would have taken 140 or something like that but I got him for 130 or like you know are like I got him lower than they would have they would have gone or whatever like or we're willing to pay 180 but like they accepted 165 like a lot of companies see that as a victory to me like if there's any place to spend money it's on people I'm not interested in having leverage over anybody or forcing anyone to be an ace negotiator to get what they deserve so we publish our salaries because that's the actual number we're going to pay it's not like come to us and let's negotiate it's like this is actually what we pay a lot of companies just won't do that because they want to try to take advantage of people or they don't know what they're gonna pay there's a variety of reasons for it some people think there's some ethical issues around like publishing salaries because then other people would know what people make and I can appreciate that but we've just decided that we want to remove negotiation completely from the from the picture so do you ever get down the path where you you know you post this thing this is a job that's gonna pay ninety seven thousand five hundred you get a bunch of people you put them through you finally get your dream candidate they're awesome and then the fun and then they say look I know you guys posted this at ninety 75 but I'm not working for that like if I'm not working for less than 115 how many times you find yourself in that situation we don't that's a non-starter because like it's published that's the number and that's what we're gonna pay this is something we did a few years ago we decided this is sort of a very unusual angle that we take here but we pay everybody in the company top 10 percent of the industry rates based on

[01:25:40] San Francisco rates we don't have anyone who lives in San Francisco but in our industry San Francisco has the highest salaries so we use these uh these benchmarking tools to figure out what the industry pays and we're just saying we're gonna pay people basically the best there's of course always companies that aren't hire and if you're in the top 10% they're some they're in top 5% but we're gonna pay people the best we possibly can and we're going to eliminate negotiation from that from the equation it's unfair to them so you're sort of like Carmack's yes we're like Carmack's because here's the thing why should you have to not only be great at your job but also be an ace negotiator most people are not good negotiators they don't like negotiating for cars or for houses or for anything so why should your livelihood depend on how good of a negotiator you are that's not fair to somebody but they should get paid in our opinion the best we can possibly afford which is basically top of the market and so we've we've basically said that that's the deal and so we have different tiers of based on the different roles but everybody with the same set of skills and experience get paid the same amount of money in that month that number is published so it's not necessarily clear like how much each person individually makes but like it's basically you could figure it out if you want and that's part of the hiring process - which is like it's no this is the number this is what its gonna be and there's no negotiation from the start so if you feel like you want the 120 or you're like an extraordinary person and you want double like because some people said that like I'm worth more than this and that's cool go find another job like there's a lot of jobs out there if you want to work at Basecamp we're gonna pay you incredibly well we're gonna give you the best benefits we believe in the world overall and this is the number and that's let's look can we eliminate the rest of it like why do we need to play games around salaries the other thing about hiring for us is that we look primarily first at their writing ability so no matter what the job is you have to be a great writer if you cannot write well if you if you submit a cover letter and it's bad you're out I don't care like what you're if you're the best scientist in the world like you're out because you have to be able to communicate with us and the rest of the company it's primarily written and you have to be able to express yourself that way so that's a core thing for us as well - like the first filter that we have now you talked about this before that when you were website slinging your strengths was more on the copy side so you n you've written how many books four books yeah four five maybe depending how you count so you obviously like to write were you always a good writer no it came down to motivation again remember I was terrible writer in high school because like I had to write papers I didn't care about about subjects I didn't care about they write about this like okay but like I'm not I don't care it's only when I got to college and I was able to write about things that I really cared about I thought we were interesting that I started to develop a love for it like I love sentences I love just a well-crafted sentence that just nails it that just few things are satisfying to me is reading a great line only when I began to be able to write for those reasons that I begin to love writing and

[01:28:24] I think it's just like it's so true with a lot of kids in schools like you don't get it until something applies to you and you really get it or you find a teacher a professor who knows how to put something in a perspective that makes a lot of sense to you then you begin to Excel so that's kind of how they I mean whenever Tim talks about his professor at Princeton campus I'm blanking on his name right now do you know what I'm talking about it's okay I heard him speak about this but I have one of his books actually whenever I hear Tim talk about it I just get insanely jealous that I was not smart enough to have found a similar experience in college because even though I wouldn't have had it's John something of his name but even though I couldn't have had a professor that good necessarily like how did I not put more effort into writing a good writer now though I mean I think I'm okay but I wish I was a hell of a lot better I agree with you it's just one of these things that you got to find topic

[01:29:14] I mean now you do so you get to write things that you're interested in but there's something else I think that's interesting about learning how to write in school which is that I don't especially in business school I mean I didn't go to an MBA program but like my business classes they don't really teach you how to write they teach you how to put words on paper and it's usually like length based it's not even about like substance in the sense it's like write a five page paper on whatever it's like

[01:29:36] Wi-Fi pages like why is that a class that I'd love to teach if I ever taught writing or I'd love to see I don't care someone can take this idea and run with it that's not something I need to do for every assignment let's say there's a writing assignment I don't even care you pick whatever type if I was writing teaching writing pick whatever topic you want I want a five page version of this

[01:29:54] I want a two page version of this I want a one page version I want a three paragraph version a one paragraph version a one sentence version in a one word version they don't teach editing that's the really valuable part so I'd love to see you write a long thing and then keep writing a shorter shorter shorter and try to distill it down to assassin so of course one word is that's more of a fun exercise but write these things at different lengths that to me is the skill it's not like can I fill up five pages of course you can but can I fill up three paragraphs and get pretty close to what I had on five pages that's the real skill and that's not being taught as I was thinking about talking today I was like I wonder if I can coax

[01:30:32] Jason into reading my book before it comes out and I'd love to it is so long my poor editor and the publisher are like they're humoring me but I think deep down they're losing their mind how many words no the contract said 80,000 with the appendix it comes in under two hundred that would be a miracle obviously it won't be published at two hundred thousand words it'll be better if it's half as long you know that too it just will be I know you have a lot to say but you know what it is the the desperation is I don't know want to write a book again part of it is

[01:31:09] I have 10 books inside me I don't want to write them I want to write one and never do it again so it's like there's this sense if I can't not talk about this and I can't not talk about that which of course is sort of a dumb idea but can you do like a double album style thing like two books it's use Your

[01:31:23] Illusion one yeah and use Your Illusion too which is the greatest in my opinion at least the greatest double album ever simultaneous books were like our contracts at 40,000 words and we handed in 20,000 and initially we had to argue with the publisher about it because he's like well thick books sell better and the whole thing it's like I know but we just read can you read it please can you read it like it's so funny these industries like they don't what about the book itself like what is the thickness and like the word count like what about the material and so eventually we ended up patting it with pictures so every essay had a picture not this current our latest book but our previous book rework I had a picture of with each essay to thicken it up that was the compromise content was great but it wasn't thick enough to sell apparently which is so ridiculous but anyway so you mentioned that in 2007 you're given some talk at Y Combinator and you're up there in all your confidence basically saying hey there's nothing about luck here like I made my destiny here we are well we're 12 years later and you don't you don't have a bone in your body that reeks of that so what happened in the last 12 years that changed your outlook on the role of luck and presumably a lot of the other things that you've written about that I want to talk about with respect to work-life balance it was probably a slow shift I typically think most things our event-based like something must have happened but I don't recall something that happened I think it's just a mellowing of age and growing older and sort of seeing things in being more honest with myself and self-reflection I don't think I reflected much when I was younger I thought it was just like cuz you don't have as much to reflect on I think just sort of recognizing that like at some point that I probably couldn't do this again if I tried and wondering why would that be like I thought it was really really really good and I kind of probably realized that like maybe I was really really really good at that time at that thing in that place and I've been able to continue to be good at that thing but starting another business for example I don't think I would do well with that at all and part of this also might come from the fact that I've written about this which is like they ask the wrong people for advice maybe this was sort of the genesis of this so people ask me all the time how to start a business I don't know I haven't done it for 20 years I'm the wrong person to talk to about how to start a business expert advice has a shelf life and it expires pretty quickly you're much better off talking to somebody who just started a business six months ago than me even if they're struggling I don't care like that's the right person to talk to they know the ground game there they know what's going on I don't know I don't remember and things have changed so I think I kind of began to realize that reflecting on that you kind of realize like well a lot of this has to do with when we started it what was going on at the time hopefully like you just continue to reflect on that and you develop some more humility

[01:34:12] I think you have to grow into that though at least I did certainly have to grow into that and I still have more to grow when did this ethos around wait a minute what if you don't have to work 80 hours a week what if you don't have to be checking email all the time what if we don't have to have meetings all day every day like how did that begin to take hold for you I remember this was a distinct moment I used to write proposals to get work back when I was in like 98 99 whatever and I was mostly on my own actually 97 probably I would spend all night out stay up all night and do these proposals for client work to get a project 20 page proposals or whatever and I would just do this and do this and do this and do this and and I realized like I won some jobs and I didn't win others but I put a lot of work into that process because I felt like that's what I had to do and then I was redoing my kitchen at my apartment and someone sent me their proposal and what did I do I turned to the last page and looked at how long is it gonna take and how much is gonna cost and it realize like that's all people really care about when it comes to proposals because they are if they've asked you for one they already know what you can do they already know what you're doing they just want to know how much is it gonna cost how long is it gonna take and that's what they're really comparing that's it and so I started going okay wait a second maybe I should just write shorter and shorter and shorter proposals why do I need to put all this work into this document so I start doing like I was doing ten page and five page and three page kind of like the writing like the writing yes yeah and eventually got down to basically one or two pages and it's like here's the thing and here's the cost and here's how long it's going to take and if you want to know more about me like call me or like here's our here's my link to my website whatever I didn't win any more jobs or lose any fewer jobs like it was the same and except you get to sleep more I got to sleep more and I realized like wait a second all this work I've been doing I don't need to do and that wasn't the first moment I realize I can kind of poke this expectation of like god you have to because all the proposals I'd seen up to that point we're huge and they're fancy and they're glossy and all this work and everything's personalized it's like when

[01:36:14] I was on the other side of that I just looked at the time in the price that was the moment when I realized like I don't have to do all this work and so then that kind of extended until a whole bunch of other things like why do we need to work 12 hours a day what am i doing like why do I need to push this hard on these things like maybe I can just do a little bit less and figure out what the essence really is like what is the price and time of all this other work that I'm doing and then when you finally kind of get into that mode you realize like most of the time you spend on things it's probably wasted time and this is a huge exaggeration of course but there's a lot of time you put into things that you don't need to put into things and I've gotten really good at editing that down so I can put a little bit of time into something because I just know what the essence of the thing is and just do a really good job on that and leave the rest alone and we've tried to develop that habit and that skill internally at Basecamp with all our employees so we really get to the essence of something we call it the epicenter of whatever it is that we're doing what are we doing so you could think of like if I was to open a hotdog stand on the street it'd still be a hotdog stand if I didn't have ketchup and mustard and onions and pickles and relish even the bun I could just sell the hotdog if it was a hotdog it would be the hotdog stand still if I didn't have the hotdog it wouldn't be a hotdog stand all those other things wouldn't matter then so the epicenter is the hotdog itself not the quality of it necessarily I wouldn't care about that but like all these other things like they're nice to have but you don't really need them to still say that you sell hot dogs on the street so that's how we kind of think about like features and functionality like what is the core essence of this thing that we're trying to do there are always going to be more powerful much judgment involved in that and like

[01:37:49] I've tried to play this game with myself and I'm so bad at it I would talk myself into saying well really you can't just have the wiener because then it's like the Wiener stand you have to have the bun and I can't be just handing people buns I at least have to have the napkin and and honestly there's gonna be somebody that wants a paper plate I ought to have that and how could you not have ketchup and mustard and and who's not gonna want to drink and by the way there's ancillary revenue and they drink

[01:38:11] I probably a bigger margin on the drink I should have the drink like you can see how I would spiral that into something that is the antithesis of what you just described and I mean I don't think I'm alone in that no I'm not either it's like I think about that too but then I edit it down so all about editing and is this something that only works now let me just actually throw this thing at you too because what you could also say is you know what I'm gonna be the hot dog guy that just serves hot dogs on a stick or I'm gonna be the hot dog guy that just like has a hot dog with it with a fork in it or something or like I'm gonna be the hot dog guy that whatever I don't know like you could be the other hot dog guy like that's that's an angle too it's not just like I need to be like everybody else and I think this is the problem especially in the software world as you see well this competitor has these five features and this one has these seven so I need to have these twelve I need to cover everything because if I don't cover everything they're gonna go here they're gonna go there I think the more interesting thing is to see what do you really need to have and what can you live without and execute at a really high level on the things you absolutely need to have and then let other people deal with the things people can live without and recognize it at the markets large and there's lots of people who will not like what you do and there's some people who will love what you do and some people hate what you do and it'll be controversial but I think there's a lot of value in that further it allows you to work less I take pride in that I think a lot there's a lot of macho boasting in our industry of people who work long hours and get no sleep so guys every industry yeah now it's turning into every industry especially finance and a bunch these industries I think it's actually been a bit of an export though from tech tech gets a lot of publicity for this which may have exported it from medicine well yeah medicine I mean that I don't even know how that's legal to work like 24 hour shifts and the whole thing and whatever but people brag about how little sleep they get and how much they work I don't understand that and if you pay attention to what they're doing if you really ask them about why they're working so long and this is I think that the deeper insight it's not that there's more work to do it's that there's less time to do good work because people's days are broken into smaller and smaller and smaller chunks of time and I think you need contiguous amounts blocks of time to do great creative work you can't do it 15 minutes at a time then check your phone then to get twenty minutes and there's a conference called and you're pulled into a meeting and before you know it's the end of the day you've got nothing done even though you've been busy all day if that's what's going on at work then it's crazy at work like our whole point of view is that it should be calm at work like the title of our book it doesn't have to be crazy at work it doesn't have to be crazy at work we have to give people a full block of eight hours a day to themselves and you cannot allow people to look at each other's calendars and take time from each other if you get to that place which is where we're at you can get a lot of work done in eight hours I mean a ton of work eight hours is a long time fly from here to I just flew to Amsterdam with my family isn't it about an eight-hour flight it's a long flight it's long you like look at your watch that come on guys only half done you look at your watching you know that got to be done it's only six and a half hours in like eight hours is a long time if you have eight hours most people don't have eight hours at work they have like 45 minutes to themselves and therefore they're working late nights and working on the weekends because there's no other time to get their work done that they're expected to do work is shooted a lot what you're saying makes sense but the part I still struggle with is but how do these teams coordinate with those teams and how do these guys you know present their work to their manager or you know whatever it else that someone might be having to do a few things number one we try to work independently versus being dependent so I think there's a lot of companies that work there they're grinding gears like this gear has to pushes this gear and there's lot of dependencies and so people are waiting around and there's so many things that can go wrong if one person's late the whole thing we try to glide past each other we're more like glide wheels than gears with teeth almost no one should ever have to depend on another team to get anything done at Basecamp every team is autonomous and sell under their own control sometimes they might need something from operations to make sure a new server is online or something like that but for the most part every feature and everything is built and can be deployed independently of one another so there's no dependencies how is that possible in a software business I'm glad you're asking this because this is really interesting stuff I think at the end of the day the size of the project matters so we only work on things that take six weeks or less to do so every feature we build in the Basecamp there has to be a six week maximum version of that and many features are only two weeks or three weeks can you give an example because I can't fathom what this could be let's see like so take a calendar feature in Basecamp so for a number of years Basecamp didn't have a calendar a lot of people wanted calendars so you start think about like what does that mean what is a calendar well calendar is like complicated we built calendars before and they've taken this is before we started working in six weeks cycles years ago we built calendars and they can take six months eight months to do well but what do people really want a calendar is just a manifestation of something what do they really want and you you're talking to people and start digging into requests and you start to understand what they really want is they want to see days that have something on them and they want to see what those things are on that given day that is a lot easier to build than like a full-blown calendar where you can drag things across cells and have events that span different cell blocks and have to read have to span like another line there's a whole bunch of complexity that gets involved with building a full-blown like if you try to build a Google Calendar in six weeks you cannot do it but there's a version of

[01:43:42] Google Calendar you can build in six weeks that solves 80 to 90% of the issues so you have to kind of file it down to that you really file it down to that and go we're going to build that and then if we want to build something else that's a separate project what we don't do is we don't hold that back that calendar feature we don't hold it back until we have seven or eight or ten other six-week projects and launch it all together we launch these things as we go and therefore they're small enough that they don't depend on other things and there's nothing held up that ends up becoming stale because other people have committed new work so and how many people would have spent the six weeks working on that account on three max so this is the other thing on any given feature we have three people maximum working on that feature typically two programmers in one designer sometimes just one program one designer and that's intentional too number three is really important to us it's a small team it's a wedge it's odd so there's never any ties it can be self-managed once you add a fourth person like something happens where like you can now have sides and someone has to kind of come in and mediate and it just becomes more complicated it's all harder to get four people on the same schedule as everything gets harder the more people you add so three people maximum to anyone one feature they have six weeks maximum to complete it and oftentimes it's less than that and then we move on but all these things slot independently but that trio reports not to you they must report to a manager who reports to somebody who reports to you or what you know I mean kind of but not really we're very flat so organizationally so there's me and David so David's the CTO I'm the CEO we have someone who runs what we call core product which is like all the designers and developers for like the desktop version of Basecamp we have an iOS team which is three people we have an Android team which is three people we have a customer service team we have a technical operations team and only a few other people who are work independently these teams like for example the product feature team with three people we have like maybe four of those teams running at the same time they sort of self-report so in Basecamp the product there's a way with every at the end of every day Basecamp asks everybody automatically what you work on today people write up what they worked on today they also write up what they were what they plan on working on this week and then every six weeks the team lead writes kind of a summary of what's happened over this past six weeks so these these things are self reporting and we're all paying attention to the work itself as it's going so there's no moments when there's a big presentations there's no presentations it's like work is happening we're paying attention to the work itself everyone's writing up what they're working on every single day and people just know what's going on you just know what's going on this way when people go off for months at a time and do these big huge massive projects then they have to report back that's a whole different structure which we don't have and I don't think that's a right structure does that make any sense I feel like sometimes it's hard to explain these well it does but it begs this question right which is how much of this is a product of the type of work you do specifically and how applicable is it -

[01:46:38] I don't want to use my work as an example I want to go so deep on that that we don't even have time we'll save that for a dinner I'd love to figure out how to change my life to have eight hours a day to think but it seems hard to imagine most jobs being amenable to that yeah you'd have you I mean still theme Isis I think you get a lot of people asking you this that's

[01:47:01] Jason I read your book I love your book I mean oh my god it sounds like Ravana yeah how do I do it yeah well yes and we just word another book actually called shape up which is a web-based book so if you go to base camp comm slash shape up it's a very very detailed like this book here it doesn't be crazy work is more the big picture it's the framework dream work you know shape up is actually how we work day to day to build software but whatever you're building it has elements to it and if you can scope these things down into smaller elements I think you can work this way there's certainly some things that are going to like I'm not saying like you can build an airplane like people always go what about an airplane like we you're not building a airplane everyone thinks they're building them like most critical thing in the world are not like no one is there's some people building airplanes or ones like what about air traffic control systems it's like you're not building air traffic control system a lot of people I think think that their work is so Commission critical it's not like you can work this way you can slow things down a little bit you can break things into smaller bits and you can apply a few people and apply pressure to a problem with just a few people over a short period of time and solve that and then and then layer that in and keep doing that over a year you end up getting somewhere if you have multiple teams like on any given six weeks cycle we're doing four or five or six or eight different features just different teams are doing them and they all come together in the end cuz they don't they don't mesh they don't have to rely on each other that's why you can do this the big problem is when you've got six or four or whatever different teams working on their own things that all the puzzle pieces have to come together at the end and work together in some product worlds that's true but we've made the conscious choice that's not in our world and I think the key here is that it is a choice what's the price you pay for that because every choice comes with a cost and is the cost that you are less profitable over a given time horizon or less innovative or I mean making these things up cuz I don't know what the answer is everything has a trade-off so I look at more is a trade-off than a cost specifically but whatever yeah a good point yeah it's a trade-off which is like maybe some of our stuff is not as high fidelity perhaps as like it could be like maybe if there's a transition like you click a button and it'd be nice to have a smooth transition between these two screens maybe instead the screen just flashed like we just decided that that trade-off is worth it to get the feature out or maybe we have to cut some features like in our book we cut our book from forty thousand twenty thousand words certainly there were some words in there that we cut that we probably shouldn't have but that's okay to make this book readable in three hours because overall that the advantage is there so there's absolutely trade-offs and we're very conscious of them and we make them all day long and we actually talk about the trade-offs like this is something we have it we have a term internally called trading concessions I run that basically run the design team David runs a technical team

[01:49:41] I'll bring an idea to Dave and I'll say here's how I'd like to do this and he'll go we can do it that way it'll take probably maybe twelve days or something of worth of work this is an estimate although we don't really talk about estimates we talk more about appetites which is another thing we'll talk about a second but he'll say this will take a little maybe a couple weeks to do it was but there's a version of this I can do in three days and here's the difference the difference is it won't do this that and the other thing and then I'll go that's worth it let's save those 10 days or nine days or whatever and let's do that simpler version and get that done because now we can do three or four more things in the same amount of time so it's about trades you make trades with people and some things I'll go you know what no this is I believe I mean it's just a gasps what do I know it's like this is what I think I think this is worth actually going all-in on like this feature let's do the two week version of this and he'll go you care more about it than I do I'll do that and the next time maybe he'll get the win on that like it's like you pay for lunch I'll pay for lunch you just kind of all evens out in the end but you have to talk about the trade-offs and then you have to discuss them and go yeah that's worth it that's worth it I think the thing is is that especially in software a lot of people don't talk that way they just think that we have to build the best possible version of whatever it is that we're making no matter what it's like well why like why does it why is it have to be the best possible version and what is the marginal gain past a certain point you can put again we've done this in the past where we used to work on things for long periods of time and truthfully like let's say we work on something for three like as you said Parkinson's law work expands to fill the time available what we realized was that that project probably could have gotten done in half the time and probably been 95% as good and probably the stuff that we squeezed out was probably worth it it's just you can keep squeezing these things until you get down to the atomic level and then you can do more of them that's the other thing you can do more of them the other thing I would say getting back to culture is that there's nothing more demoralizing than working on something that you don't know when it's going to end and that you don't like no matter what you're doing you're gonna work on some things you don't like to do at base camp the worst thing that could possibly happen is you have six weeks of something you don't want to work on certainly other bad things can happen but like when you begin you can see the end six weeks max and we've thrown out work we've built built some in six weeks like we don't like it what's the cost six weeks versus what ends up happening is if you work on something for six weeks or twelve weeks and 24 weeks and you keep going you then have this huge momentum that makes it impossible for you to cut your losses because we put in months and months and months it's only gonna take at we're almost done another month another month another month it's never just one month it's always not a month after that before you know what you're nine months and ten months in and you're not gonna cut your losses at that point you've invested too much it's very hard to do that organizationally so you end up keep pushing and pushing and pushing and this thing keeps going and going going and by the end it's no good and you've wasted a year and that could kill morale and can destroy teams so at the very worst we have basically what we call circuit breaker which is after six weeks like if this isn't going anywhere if we're not where we need to be we can pull the circuit breaker and call it quits on that and like we lost six weeks but that's not the end of the world now how does one apply this to themselves you have the luxury of being the boss this is the culture as your companies what you've created it how does somebody who's listening to this who works at a company that functions the way a normal you know a normal quote/unquote high functioning company works how do they get to apply this to their lives when they don't control their calendar shy of quitting and working at a company like

[01:53:08] Basecamp and you get the sounds like what percentage of companies do you think function even let's just limit it to software what companies within software do you think function within sort of the neighborhood of the way you've described that it's a pretty small percentage currently we're out to change that but I would say most do not right now how does someone do it this is a kind of about like figuring out what you have control over on what you don't if you're new at a company you're it's probably unlikely you have any power to change any of these things the best way to do something like this is to take a small step in you're probably not gonna have the influence to change the way the company works but maybe on some project that's on the side that no one really cares about you can take that on and show people how you can do this perhaps in a shorter amount of time and they might have expected it was going to take three months and you do it in six weeks and I go what is that like how'd you do that and then you begin to build on some wins but I think that's even maybe too big of a leap I think around time which is really important here which is you may not have full control of your own time because you have a shared calendar system and people pull you in to meetings in your jr. and you have to say yes because you can't if you don't say yes you're not a team player and your honor there you can start to do some things with other people so you know there's that the famous I guess the

[01:54:20] Gandhi quote be the change you wish to see in the world basically so if you don't like being interrupted by other people all the time you can interrupt other people less or fewer times whatever you have in front of you that you can modify you can change begin to change that for yourself you're not gonna change the whole company but hopefully you can influence some other people and they might be willing to make some more changes and you can kind of bring that up the chain but it's I'm not under any illusion here that like someone's going to read this book or read some other book we've written in like the company's going to change where that change happens is from the top so a

[01:54:51] CEO reads it and goes like and I also will also also tell people like if the way you're working works like keep doing it but the way most people are working is not working and they know it but they don't know what to do about it they just like this is what you do we we pour in more hours projects go long we're running in circles like if you're at the point where you're struggling with that and going I can't do this anymore I don't want to do this anymore then it's time to change the only time people are going to change is if there's actually a struggle you're not gonna change because you've heard of something you're gonna change because you're struggling so bad with what you have that now you're open to a new wave of working so that's really I think ultimately the only way for these sorts of ideas to take hold is when there's a true struggle and you have the chance to implement some of those things but as far as like other ideas we have which about working as a team like there's a lot of individual things you can do certainly how do you think about it personally I was on the phone with a friend yesterday who's I said to him I said man I am so impressed by your ability to say no I was pitching an idea to him that I'm interested in and you know sort of putting a group of guys together to invest in something and I reached out to him saying look I realize you're probably not gonna do this not because you don't love it but because you have the strictest no policy of anyone I know and in the end it was I love this so much but like I can't it is irresponsible for me to take on one more single idea by the way I should be saying the same thing I should have salutely be saying no but I'm not but

[01:56:22] I've been investigating this within myself lately right why do I struggle to say no and I have this nasty nasty habit which creates so much tension in my life of agreeing to do things into the future and then Wendy day comes I take it out on everyone around me but I'm really just pissed at myself like agree to go do a talk next March in Germany and I'm like well you know there's nothing on my calendar

[01:56:54] March 14th next year and and then February 27th comes along and I'm like I'm so pissed and I do this awful thing I take it out on other people I'm like how could you let me do this and that's like you baby what do you you did it yourself you idiot but the fear that I'm examining is I have a fear of missing out like well you never know maybe that one talk you meet somebody really interesting and they're doing this really cool thing in research and you learn this one thing that's gonna change the way you do this or you know it's like I don't know I I don't know how I keep rationalizing doing things that in the end I I really believe I'd be better off doing less but I don't know how to do less I mean this is this is like now is this turned into a therapy session this is hard and I've realized that too which is why I've gotten better at saying no I often

[01:57:48] Rett saying yes I've realized two things far out in the future one of the reasons why is because yes is really easy to say yes requires no work like later like yeah I'll say yes to that trip to Germany because it takes note work to say yes to that trip to Germany and then you get to like it's like I'd rather be somewhere else right now that have to get on a plane fly internationally and

[01:58:07] I'm gonna be tired and the whole thing like I've just gotten better at looking at like trying to zoom to that point in time and going what I want to do that then it's not about do I want to do it now it's what I do I think I want to do it then and that helps me be able to say no to things but to me know is far more surgical and far more precise which I think will this will appeal to you when you say yes to something you're basically saying no to a thousand other things cuz you can't do I mean you go to

[01:58:34] Germany yeah you might meet someone interesting but look at all the things you can't do like at that same time you don't have the flexibility and the freedom to do things because you've already booked something far in advance and that thing is costly it's costly in your time and your health and all these things that you could do when you say no you just say no to one thing and now you have more more options available to you and that's how I've been thinking about no no is a very surgical very precise strike yes is a shotgun and for me I've discovered that I prefer this is again just for me I prefer flexibility and I like to have options which is also one of the reasons why we're an independent company and I will always remain an independent company because my freedom and flexibility is the most important thing to me the ability to do what we need to do the way we want to do it is way more important and the way for me to spend my time on the things I want to do is way more important than it's booking my calendar and the in the future and feeling regret when that moment comes but it's unfair to get to the venue for me to go and feel regret like I should be honored to speak but I like it's not the speaking moment it's the everything around it that I don't want to do yeah one hour talk is still 48 hours of your time right so I've gotten much much better at this I heard something I don't know if this is true I've heard this is sort of how Warren Buffett manages his time I don't if you've heard of this thing I think I've heard the story but please I don't know if it's true so like

[01:59:50] I kind of feel weird about talking about it but I've heard that basically he will not book things far in advance if you want to see Warren Buffett if you're a business associate or whatever you basically have to ask his secretary a day before and say like is Warren available tomorrow that he wants to keep his schedule open for anything that comes up and not be blocked for months and months and months because how do you know what you're gonna want to be doing in three months on Tuesday at four o'clock how would you ever know what that's gonna be like like you might in that moment feel like you want to read a new article or you want to go on a trip or you want to think about something else or something else comes up the day before that you want to work on we block our future with present obligations and then we never have time to do the things we want to do so when you realize that and it's hard still even if you realize that it's hard to do it but I've found it to be a lot easier once I realized that I was I don't want to be regretful and I don't know when I'm going to want to be doing that far in advance so I'll book something a few days in advance or a few weeks in advance or a few months in advance sometimes for people I know but like I turned down way more things tonight then I say yes to these days and

[02:00:53] I feel better about it do you have any tips for saying no the actual act of declining something that as you said is flattering to have been offered and you feel like an idiot for ya not being more grateful I think just being really honest about it like for example I was just invited to speak overseas and I said it's an honor to be to be invited I appreciate the invitation however I'm just not I don't feel comfortable flying internationally for talks anymore it's just too tiring for me it's hard on my family and I just I don't want to do that anymore so and now it's often say like if you want to do a virtual thing like I'm happy to call and via Skype or like provide some other option but I can't book travel around a business engagement anymore and I'll do even do that in the US where like if it's if I have to go to San Francisco like that's a four-hour flight for me from Chicago and that's a day minimum probably two days and it's like I'm just very careful about that now so I'll just be honest about it because otherwise if you like sprinkle powdered sugar on it and BS people it's like and everyone responds like I totally understand I appreciate that thanks for the consideration and you're just nice to people and they're nice to you back and you're honest and they're honest back and everyone understands nobody's mad ever yeah maybe they're like this I really would have liked how do you speak but they're they understand I agree with that by the way the times I muster up the foresight to sort of say know it I agree people I don't really recall a time when it's been so poorly received if I've just been very transparent the biggest challenge is examining the motivation theythey fear of not doing something that that for me is something

[02:02:22] I'm still really exploring well here's how you can look at that because I understand that just flip it like look at all the other things I can do instead of all the possible things you can do you can now do any of those possible things versus you're only able to do one thing look I've met wonderful people at events that I didn't want to go to and there's clearly the opportunities that

[02:02:42] I've missed because I haven't done some things obviously but I think that the power of know is that you have a lot more options it gives you a lot of options and you can experience something else that day and it might be something where where you kind of keep track of the things you've said notes like I've said no to seven things this year that I think would have been really interesting so like I have to do seven interesting things instead like you can make your own little trade-offs with yourself oh that's interesting I like that that thing that came up in March that I said no - the biggest reason I said no to it was actually the realization that it would basically kill any chance of going away with my family that month and there might be a window to go you know if spring breaks line up that would basically nuke a spring break opportunity which then you'd feel like an idiot right if you're like I can't believe I agreed to do this thing and it now means I'm not gonna do something with my family yeah

[02:03:34] I look it knows as yes as to other things that's kind of how I look at it do we even dare talk about watches at all how did you get into watches you and I both love watches we have a circle of friends who are equally I think if I can just be affectionate idiotic is it an aesthetic thing for you obviously you've expressed a huge interest in aesthetics yes an aesthetic thing my dad I don't think he does this anymore but he used to buy these old watches on eBay back when I was in high school so like old Elgin and Illinois these old tank watches from the 20s that aesthetic doesn't speak to me today well some of it does but I just remember these little cool objects that would come in the mail we'd open them up we look at them together and they were all different

[02:04:16] I've always sort of been interested in things that like look like there's only one way to do something but then there's like a thousand ways to do something so like watch design is a great example of that so you have a you have 12 hours or whatever you have you know it's um 24 hour dolls whatever it is and you're like there should be like one way to do this you know there's like two hands and this is but but really there's there's thousands of different designs and stuff I've always found that fascinating so I if followed my dad has probably hundreds of these little watches he's like 20 bucks a pop I don't know what they were I kind of got into it that way and my first watch actually was a then I remember getting was a

[02:04:48] Seiko Data mm which is a digital watch with a keyboard and being the bad student that I was I would cheat in school with it because you could put notes into it with a keyboard and would sink it and you'd have like that there's a screen with two buttons which you can scroll through like how would I say is amazing this is like an amazing thing so it had a keyboard like the size of an iPhone today and the back of the watch was this just metal and it would snap into this spot on this keyboard and there was like an induction thing going on it was like pretty interesting then it would go into this text mode where you can basically have like a text file and I could type stuff into it and then it would just save it and then you take the thing off and put on your wrist and then you can just kind of scroll through the notes and you know back then and whatever was the early nineties or whatever it was no one would ever suspect that you had like data on your walk right now like it you'd be cheating but I guess people can have notes today but anyway so I'll just kind of look through and tapped through and have some notes for math and some history notes because I was terrible with like names and dates and stuff so I just kind of put those in there and that didn't feel like cheating to me to be honest like what does it matter if you know someone's name or date exactly like was the difference really but anyway I would do that and that kind of got me into like the utility of watches now everyone talks about tool watches that was like a great tool for me truly and so I got into that and then I eventually got into mechanical watches because I was just like blown away by the fact that like something could run without a battery and can run perpetually forever just because you're moving that's really kind of a cool thought and then I got into the mechanics of them and then of course

[02:06:18] I got into these settings of them you know I definitely have this the sickness although I've been sort of trimming back lately which is kind of nice but it's probably just to kind of build back up again my tastes have changed too so I think like that's the other thing is kind of neat to see things that you bought that you thought you liked six years ago and you look at them now and you're like my tastes have change and I think it's kind of a neat thing to do because there's of course you can look at clothes and look at other things but

[02:06:41] I feel like I kind of dress the same way I always have like it t-shirt and jeans so that hasn't really changed much but the things that I like the objects that I like definitely have and since these objects are permanent objects you do keep them around unlike a phone like flip phones like you go you know way back when you don't have those anymore so you can't really look back on those things but watches you can look back and go that's what I was into then and that's kind of and this is how I've changed I kind of like that how did you get involved with her dinky I was just a fan and then Eric Wynn who used to work with them he reached out Terry has a great vintage watch dealer I've bought several watches from him

[02:07:15] Eric's a wonderful guy very knowledgeable he reached out to me via email cuz I had some stuff on Instagram back when I was doing Instagram I don't do it anymore but when I was doing that I had some watches and somehow he found me and he's like hey you seemed to be into watches a lot and I want to introduce myself I'm Eric from from hankie and I write this thing called bring a loop or whatever it was called back then I think was like the precursor to talking watches yeah yeah and this is like a thing every Friday they would show vintage watches that they found on the web I think he once said like can I show one of yours I think that's henna how was and I kind of got into that and then I eventually met Ben and met the crew I'm a big fan of what they're doing

[02:07:50] I'm also an investor so full disclosure so like I'm a fan and I'm I'm investor but I am on the board there so like just to get that out of the way so everybody knows where I'm coming from there but um I like what they've done and I think they've elevated this sort of weird geeky thing into a bit of a more refined collectors experience which i think is pretty cool and pretty hard to do in like niche circles it's a lot of like niche collector II things are often like really poorly done and bad taste not like offensive but just like there's no design involved well I think that's what's sort of cool about ho dinky and I don't talk much about watches on the podcast actually but I do think a number of people listening know how much I love watches and who dinky is really great I mean I think their writing is is very good and I find myself forwarding articles to my wife all the time you know one thing I had to do two years ago was take this stupid hoe dinky alert off my phone and computer because it was just really bad every day to get like two pings with a hoe dinky article and I was like you know talk about not being productive is just getting watch porn at you all day long I've eliminated pretty much all notifications on my phone except like things I need during the day

[02:09:03] I actually think phones are highly addictive I think they're basically cigarette modern-day cigarettes and they might be at least as bad for you I think they might be worse oh well probably out words like lung cancer is pretty damn bad right and cardiovascular I actually think phones Perdue have a bigger AUC of suffering than cigarettes and even though maybe for a while people didn't realize cigarettes were bad like people note that they're bad and they still do them I don't think people realize phones are bad so I think that's their manipulative in that way in a way that the cigarette is very direct it's like I smoke there's small it's the cigarette it's the cigarette of nineteen fifty right where no one really knew thought it was cool and whatever yeah doctors recommended them great way to lose weight all was good for you yes in fact this was the preferred brand during smoking I drink pregnancy rather is that right so I'm sure I think there was a mother's should smoke this one very in

[02:10:00] Lao you know at Hopkins in the old wing at the hospital which I don't think is in use anymore there are still ashtrays in the patient rooms and I remember still in the old Oh ours even seeing ashtrays that's interesting and they should keep that around just as a reminder how delusional we can all be but I think phones are kind of like that so I've kind of taken notifications off my phone I don't like if I want to know something I'll go find it versus I don't wanna be pulled to anything like I'll go look for it if I'm curious

[02:10:26] I think we've become slaves to phones telling us what to do and props telling us what to do and this actually calls all comes back to the kind of beginning this conversation which was that the business models surrounding many of these things on phones are all about engagement and engagement is an addictive behavior and so these companies basically are designed to addicted to their services and prompt you the right amounts of time per day and reward you for engagement and whatnot and they build these terrible addictive behaviors I'm aware of them but like I try to stay as far away from them as I possibly can but the business models are tied to this this is the other thing it's all about eyeballs number of people using it it's all about advertising dollars it's all about all these things and this is where the business model like you see things changing unless the business model changes there's a lots of talk about like companies need to be more responsible and designers need to be more responsible and programmers shouldn't be building software like this but like as long as the business model supports that and that's what keeps you in business and that's what the job is you're gonna keep doing it that's just human nature unfortunately I remember you you sort of opted out of Instagram a little less than a year ago if I work yeah this in 20 November you put up a black picture yeah it's a black square and I still look at it sometimes I find myself actually browsing and I feel sick don't want to do it but I still do it it's like I'm powerful why do I feel sick yes a couple of reasons first I feel like

[02:11:49] I'm going against what I said I would do so I have stopped posting completely but I was hoping that that meant I would stop using but I'm not so why haven't you uninstalled it on your phone it's mostly because of the watch thing so like I still use it to look at watch people that I know because I feel like I learned something from that but I don't think it's worth it because I probably still spend too much time browsing through things mindlessly looking at pictures of watches which like don't really matter to me really like really don't fundamentally matter if I see that picture of that person wearing on the wrist like I'm not really learning anything I've sort of convinced myself that I am it's kind of like I'm an addict convincing myself that it's okay

[02:12:31] I mean that's what it is now there's recreational enjoyment out of it and I do learn some things that I've met some people that way clearly but I don't again getting back to trade-offs the trade-offs are probably not worth it yet I'm still on the wrong side of that deal I'm using it less and less and less what I don't like looking at is I guess I don't like looking at vanity that because you still use

[02:12:51] Twitter I use Twitter so it's not a social media thing it's not social media although like I am strongly opposed to Facebook for a number of other reasons but I'm not opposed to Twitter because to me Twitter is something that I can I'm mostly broadcast I don't really read that much except I'll engage if someone writes me back typically but Twitter for me it's just different it feels very different one of the things that bugs me about Instagram is it a lot of people just show off it's not that there's not valuable stuff on there it's just that I don't like to see people showing off and that happens and I remember myself doing that I'd buy a new watch or something and the first thing I would do without like I want to share this with other people not because I want them to see it it's because I want them to know that I have it and that is not healthy behavior it just isn't so I cut myself off from that at least but then now I still see other people doing it and it just but then I it's hard to turn away to its this is the addiction a little bit so I use it a whole lot less than I did and

[02:13:50] I'm almost all the way off it now I should probably delete it in fact I will delete it after this conversation Wow yeah Wow done holy cow why not now like what am I gonna do well it's funny before we jumped on this podcast we were having another great discussion about a whole bunch of other really cool stuff with respect to exercise and meditation and you are very much a person who does what he says he's going to do I'm gonna do it right now we're gonna do it right now right now I mean you'll have to tell people that I'm really doing well I yeah they're here and of course I look I can always reinstall it yeah but I don't know about you that's gone oh and it's interesting to note that was your homescreen second oh no you're right yes I was your homescreen so you opened up some real estate on the most important screen um here's what's gonna happen it's not gonna matter that's the thing like you might go I might lose connection what's it like oh well like the fact that you can't do something because one thing goes away because of it like I don't want to be beholden to those kinds of things and also I'm just aware that like that made me feel weird for a second that's them making me feel weird like I shouldn't let them make me feel weird that's just they shouldn't have control over me that way that might be the most important moment of the podcast last last question

[02:15:04] I want to ask you which again purely stems from selfish desires though I do but I think there'll be enough people listening that this question will serve a broader purpose what is your relationship like with email which is I mean just to let my I've probably spoken about this more than people want to hear

[02:15:19] I really find email to be a troubling thing I find you take everything you feel about Instagram cube it raise it to the power of E and cube it again that's how bad I think email is I think email is an awful awful thing which is not to say there aren't valuable things that come from email but I think the net effect is toxic I agree with you one of the things that blows me away about email anybody with your email address can get in your face I don't mean like getting your face in a rude way but I mean getting your attention right they land in your inbox it's yours and they can put themselves there no matter what and to build on that they can add to your to-do list it's sort of like to do it's just to-do list that everybody gets to add to and it's an introduction list that everybody can just make but actually I don't think email is the biggest offender I think in organizations I think chat is a bigger offender now I don't know if you use chat tools in your organization but no but that's an worse yeah because it's even more instant it's real time and there's an expectation of immediate response and that makes it especially bad and also organizations organizations begin to think one line at a time it discourages this writing thing that you seem to place an emphasis on like write and present and like think something through and put it out there as a complete thought like if you've ever tried to be in a chat room in a company you're sort of typing some idea out and someone else jumps in and takes it and like ask the question like wait let me just finish and it's like it's just a mess it's like this this race to get your idea out because you're doing it one line at a time meanwhile if you write something in long form you get your whole idea together put it out there for people people can read it on their own schedule and they can get back to you tomorrow there's not this expectation of like immediate response because the medium is encouraging immediate response so well that's fine hey what's up I just can't stand what's up for that reason but imagine if you had a company of 200 people and everyone's on whatsapp and that's the primary way they communicate with each other this is what's happening inside many organizations these days and it's going in the wrong direction and people are beginning to realize it just like 15 years ago everyone thought open-floor office plans were a great idea people are realizing now they're not good ideas at all but at the time it was the best idea in the world so everyone switched to it there's other ideas while all the reasons why they did it's cheaper and it's easier it's more flexible I get all that too but they're very distracting people don't have any privacy it's hard to get in a zone and do some deep work when people are mulling around and there's noise around chat rooms are basically all-day meetings with an unknown set of participants and many many different topics all at once and they're basically virtual open offices and they're running 24/7 and they're terrible but that's sort of the current trend but I think it's gonna trend back towards more asynchronous long-form communication because it's I think it's better better method I hope so I mean I would just close by saying I think evolutionarily I don't think we evolved for the tempo of the electronic environment obviously we didn't evolve with electronics but it's less about the electronics I think and some times and more about the way it's changing our brain and the way we the chats are obviously a horrible example meaning a great example of how horrible it is but yeah I just I don't think our ancestors when they were working on a problem whether it was finding their next meal or building something like I I just don't think that we're great synaptically at doing that stuff tie to that too is like what's the rush so might hear me say that go oh you guys work in six weeks cycles instead of like three months like what's the rush well six six weeks aren't rushed but like why is everyone feel like they need to rush around I mean you can ask people what it's like at work today most people say like I'm super busy I'm like okay get back to these people like everyone all of a sudden is rushing all the time what is so important that we're rushing about and most of the stuff were rushing about and rushing to get to and rushing to do doesn't really matter anyway it's just there's this pace that I think has absorbed the business world specifically that is unhealthy an unsustainable and I don't think the outcomes are better why is it better to talk faster at work like why is that better why is it better to talk shorter at work why is it better to not be able to explain yourself clearly in one fell swoop why you know why are these things actually better I think they're more convenient and that's why they're happening but I don't think that they're better and I think that enlightened companies are going to begin to realize this and go convenience is one thing certainly but we're actually able to do better work when we're more deliberate about it when we slow down a little bit we get to communicate in complete sentences in incomplete form and when we also don't allow human nature to get in the way which is that specifically around projects that things should not last forever and go on and on and on and build up the such momentum that we can't pull the plug anymore and that morale goes down the tubes and all these sorts of things begin to happen so I think you know a small percentage of companies are gonna sort of see the light and are beginning to and it's not going to change everyone because convenience and speed is something that a lot of people value as well but I think that there's a lot of trade-offs that aren't being evaluated well Jason I will find this stuff so interesting because like I said if I were to sort of evaluate give myself a scorecard on how I'm doing with respect to my eating my sleeping my this my that my other thing I think this is definitely the area where I fall short and it's not even close like it's not it's it's not gonna contest this is really tough this will be a long commitment for me but but I'm very interested in figuring out ways to make this better because I think I come at it from a different framework which is honestly I've had the I don't know if privileges even the right word but I've certainly seen many people at the end of their life not so much today because of what I do today but back in my previous life where I really did get to see people who were at the end of life cliches are a cliché for a reason

[02:21:06] I really don't recall anybody at the end of life wishing they had worked a little longer a little harder which isn't to say that there isn't somebody out there who feels that way or there wasn't somebody who feels like they left something on the table and who knows maybe in his final days Steve Jobs did wish he had worked a little harder to get that next product just to that next level I don't know I mean I I so so I won't i won't blanket that statement as completely diffuse but most people so I have to assume I will be the same way when you're on the back end of that you start to think about the relationships that got neglected or the amount of just joy that got sort of missed by being busy which is for me busyness is a bit of an addiction busyness is the other thing we don't really talk much about but busyness is something I try to avoid at all costs because I feel like busyness is basically shifting between a bunch of different things at the same time and that's why you feel busy cuz just like I gotta run to this I gotta run to that again I'll come back to this and I'll have more time to do this later it's like if you can figure out ways to work in contiguous blocks of time you can cut back a lot of the busy feeling I think that's another really interesting area to improve on is is to to give yourself time to start and finish something in the same day versus within a contiguous block of time versus like I'll get this done later between lunch and after this call and whatever you'll do a better job and you'll you'll have a calmer day than trying to wedge things into empty spaces

[02:22:33] I think that's one of the big things I think people's days are pretty scrambled actually that's one of the one of the reasons they feel busy again it's not that there's more work to do I don't feel like there's more work to do and in fact shouldn't technology being like hasn't the promise been like less work and it's all these things are automated for us so where's all this more work coming from I don't think it's that I think it's our days or chunked into smaller bits it's hard to fit everything in that and you feel really busy and manic I think that's that's a great point Jason thank you so much for making the time I know you take time very seriously so you're here as little as you need to be so well thanks Peter it's great to be on you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at Peter Tiye MD com maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what
