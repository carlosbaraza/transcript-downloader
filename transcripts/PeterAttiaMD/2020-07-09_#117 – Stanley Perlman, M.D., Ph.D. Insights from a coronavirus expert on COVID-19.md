## Description

Original release date: 6/29/20

In this episode Stanley Perlman shares insights from his impressive career studying coronaviruses–both the common and more deadly ones, like MERS and SARS. In comparing preceding coronaviruses with SARS-CoV-2, Stanley discusses how other coronaviruses can aid our current understanding of, and be used to infer about, COVID-19. He also gives his thoughts on durable immunity, therapeutic strategies, and future outbreak preparedness.

[00:00:10] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast of my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode I guess this week is Stanley Pearlman Stanley is a professor of microbiology and immunology along with being a professor of pediatrics and the chair of biology at the University of Iowa Stanley has researched coronaviruses for nearly four decades and his lab is currently using mouse models for Tsarskoe v1 and

[00:01:11] Tsarskoe v2 to better understand the more severe diseases that affect humans I wanted to talk with family for a few months now understandably he has been incredibly busy we have been part of a collaboration that is working on a longer study trying to understand the durability of immune response and the impacts of that which we discussed very briefly at the end of this podcast so most of our contact has actually been through that but as we got a little bit of breathing room in and around our other projects inclusive of the one we're working on together we decided it made sense to finally sit down and have this discussion especially as a beautiful extension of the discussion that I already had with David Watkins so

[00:01:49] I do recommend that you would listen to these podcasts in that order the one with David Watkins of course goes over the immunology a little bit here we talk specifically about corona viruses including the sort of common cold corona viruses and of course more importantly the three versions that really have caused incredible damage to humans none more so than the one we're in today in this episode we talk about a whole bunch of things that again just you can probably imagine interest me to no end when we were talking specifically about SARS one and MERS what did they teach us about this coronavirus what does our knowledge of this coronavirus today versus what we knew say five months ago tell us about how this story ends and what do I mean by ending all of these are topics that we get into along with a very interesting discussion around the therapeutic side of things the vaccination side of things and ultimately what could happen again so without further delay I hope you enjoy my conversation with dr. Stanley [Music]

[00:02:51] Stanley thank you so much for making time to talk today I've wanted to speak with you for a couple of months now and I know it when we first connected it was just nuts and you said hey Peter thanks for reaching out can we talk when things calm down a little bit and I was so gracious that first of all that you even took the time to respond and then of course now we've been able to work together on a separate project that maybe we'll talk about down the line but I'll tell you the reason I reached out in the first place was really the result of something that my research team came to me and said which was look Peter if you want to understand coronaviruses you've got to speak to

[00:03:22] Stanley Perlman everybody is a armchair coronavirus expert now but you actually want to talk to the guy who was studying coronaviruses before they were sexy and that Stanley so before we get maybe into how you became obsessed with coronaviruses how did you get involved in medicine and immunology per se well I actually started taking the PhD many many years ago and in the areas actually of cell biology and developmental biology and biology so I did a whole potpourri of training at as a PhD student and then again during postdoc and then I went to medical school so there was a period there where I'd learned though I didn't do coronavirus research but I learned how to do research and so then when I went to medical school I became interested in pediatrics men and infectious diseases and I don't know what my plans were exactly when I started medical school but became really interested in how baby brains interacted with viruses which was not good so when babies are getting infected with viruses especially in utero it's often has devastating consequence

[00:04:27] I worked with somebody who was really good at thinking about those babies and I became just interesting research issues around how viruses interact with the brain so at that time point I became interested it turned out that coronaviruses and mice provided a model that could lead to potentially important information so I went from all the other things that I did and from being a pediatric infectious disease person part of my training I also started working with grown viruses now what was the decision point that had you leave sort of a pure academic track which you would have been on from your PhD on your postdoc to sort of take that I don't like to use the term backwards but I think you sort of get what I mean take that backwards step and go back to something remedial like Medical School in other words what really drove you to want to have a clinically active research focus well I think there are two things one I was interested in I felt I was getting compartmentalized in a small area of research I don't think I wanted to be in something that was quite so confined and didn't have too many relevance for general health issues and the second thing is ironic I started my

[00:05:35] PhD at an early age and it was almost like I was looking for a chance to take a little bit of a break a medical school and residency is more than a little bit of a break but it was pretty fast it was a total of starting medical school to finishing fellowship was only six years which is a long time but not compared to what those people do to this kind of training there's a combination of both those things of being wanting to really step back a bit and also wanted to find more relevance for human disease you're kind of a Doogie Howser because how is it you could do med school and Breakfast had a med schools for years pediatric residency is 3 and then pediatric infectious disease would add at least 2 to that right 3 it's actually you'd be talking about a 10-year training program that you did in 6 so I was lucky because when I did went to medical school there was a shortage of doctors and there was one or two programs that allowed people to truncate their medical school training I went to one in Miami that if you had a PhD you could basically do the whole thing in 22 months and what you did is you cut the first year down to six months the second year down to about three months did the entire third year and then you did the fourth year in eight weeks so at the end of it all we did everything and we could do it the people at pitch DS though I have to send it to pH DS and whether it be physics or physics to psychology to biology to chemistry so people have different amounts of training this training was good the classes were really full of people who are really creative and thinking about things so is it generally intense but a very good experience and you're well trained at the end so you did your residency at

[00:07:16] Boston Children's or a fellowship or both well yeah so at the time and probably still to this day Boston Children's Hospital remains easily in the top three in the world perhaps along with chopped and sick kids and maybe a few others so you're at the sort of premier pediatric hospital in the world you're training with I guess you're referring to Brazelton as your mentor there yeah yeah yeah so tell me more about childhood development I mean I don't know much about it obviously and it certainly rings a bell when you say that viruses can really wreak havoc one of the few things I remember from ob/gyn is the lengths you would go to to ensure that a mother wasn't infected actively during childbirth yeah so we don't understand everything about this but certainly viruses that invade the brain during the first trimester really of course devastating loss of neurological function and the way do you go in the pregnancy the more likely it is to cause less disease but even when you're infected during delivery babies infected with certain viruses will have hearing problems the visual problems and even cognitive problems so that babies just because they developing they're incredibly sensitive to anything that disrupts their development and when I think about it the direct relationship to what I later did with research was really not so strong but it was just the whole notion of could you do anything to prevent these viruses from spreading in the human brain and then also the way they do spread within the human brain could this be something that would be useful for understanding other functions if you did this in an experimentally infected animal so that's the the way and then coronaviruses turned out to have this interesting ability to cause demyelination or which was similar to what we see in multiple sclerosis so it sort of ended up going along roundabout way from my studying like this multiple sclerosis like disease for 20 years before SARS came about maybe this is probably just as good a time as any Stanley to really give people a bit of the lay of the land on what a coronavirus is because anybody listening to this when they hear coronavirus they're thinking of SARS Co v2 it might be helpful to put that in a much broader context which is what is a family of viruses actually mean when we say the

[00:09:29] Jones is in the Smiths we're talking about a family not Billy Smith necessarily so what does that look like so the corona viruses are like any other set of viruses their viruses are put into that category because of what they look like under the microscope what they look like under the electron microscope or how they make new viruses the kind of replication strategy we call it that they use to make more viruses in the old days you might have some serological testing that would tell you about relatedness I say in the old days we still use that of course but we have genetic ways now to really see how close viruses are so you put all those things together and particularly looking under the microscope we can say corona viruses have a certain pattern under the microscope and all viruses that are coronaviruses have those patterns doesn't mean that they all can infect people or they all can infect this dynamo or that animal they're really very very different and the ones that were known before SARS came about really were the experimental ones like the ones we used which infected mice and then also these other corona viruses that infect swine and cows and cats and dogs and even now they finding viruses that are not quite grown viruses but are very closely related that affect insects and snakes so these viruses infect across lots of species and bats of course we know because that's been very clear in the

[00:10:55] Kovach 19 outbreak because that's where this virus undoubtedly started at least distantly so is it safe to say that corona viruses as a family probably when compared to any other family of flaviviruses that produce pepsi that otherwise would have nothing in common about the only thing that's true of viruses is they need a host to replicate is that about where the similarities end across the broadest discrimination of viruses or are there other things that are uniquely I mean I guess they all have either DNA or RNA but typically not both right yeah they accept baby HIV seems to have both but generally they have one or the other depending on the amount of genetic information they have they can do more or less functions than other viruses this is gigantic viruses or these giant viruses are so called that seem to have almost all the material you need to almost be a cell man out of cell but they have a lot of their own material for making proteins and RNA most RNA viruses just have the genetic material for programming the functions needed to reproduce the virus and also make the proteins that cause the structure of the virus that form the structure of the virus so those are simpler viruses coronaviruses have the unusual characteristic of being huge so the genetic information of a corona virus is about four times that of the poliovirus and yet the virus doesn't seem to do that much more than poliovirus so a little uncertain exactly why it needs all that genetic information and when you say huge Stanley do you just mean the amount of RNA in it or do you mean the actual diameter under an electron microscope as well amount of RNA in it certainly the corona virus is bigger than the poliovirus but that's because there's all this genetic material stuffed into the middle can you put it in context for us if you take the genetic material contained within a typical corona virus how does it stack up against a human gene I mean the listener might not understand what base pairs look like or how many killer

[00:12:49] Dalton's we're talking about but just contextualize it in some way well let me see if it's big for a virus a gene if you took genes and laid them side-by-side it could be equivalent to 15 human genes right side by side in terms of planes but human genes have variable lengths so it was a longer human gene it could be fewer those for the viral genome this particular virus codes around probably about 25 or so different teens varying size a lot of them are pretty small so it's a lot of information but it's not compared to the human genome which has 20,000 genes it's a very tiny amount when you think about 25 and does it like human DNA contain coding and non-coding segments alike that are just as important no human DNA contains both non-coding sequences within genes and non-coding sequences outside and vast majority of the human genome is not for coding with a virus the vast majority is for coding there may be stretches here and there that are spacers as it were between genes but they're real and a minority so the strict engine to your question is yes there's parts that are non-coding but it's a tiny fraction compared to the amount that actually codes for genes just to go down the path of some speculation do we have a sense of what the evolutionary pressure was for a corona virus I've never really stopped to think about it but it always struck me as viruses unlike bacteria don't really serve a useful purpose I mean like it's true that maybe most of them don't directly harm us but if you eradicated this planet of bacteria we would all die pretty quickly we live in a very healthy symbiotic relationship despite a pathologic relationship with a small few of them but if I could conduct a thought experiment and remove every virus from this universe wouldn't the world just keep ticking along fine or is there something I'm missing about their function well I don't think you're right we have lots of great examples for example in the ocean there zillions of viruses interact with bacteria I would bet if you took that interaction away that there would be a problem and in the people talk about even in the human gut does all these viruses that people find some of them I think interact with those commensal bacteria and are useful whether they're absolutely necessary I don't think we know as much as we do about commensal bacteria which are really important for human life and animal life but I would bet if he took away all the viruses in the world assure you to eliminate some of the ones that are cause human disease or non-human but I think you might get away from others that are actually beneficial yeah so there might be some knockoff effect where they're helping something that second-order to us they're helping the bacteria that are helping us or helping some other distant organism that's way down the plankton sub chain that I haven't considered fully I think that that's a possibility and then bacteriophage on bacteria are going to be even different than the ones directly on human cells but the may even be will animal viruses that have roles that we don't understand very well that are important I know there's some animal viruses do they interact insects have relationship with each other and the animal viruses have an important part in maintaining some of the developmental patterns in those insects I can't tell you I know and some of them are lost I can't tell you more remember but there's definitely viruses that without which they would be problems so I'm sure you're tired of telling this but I think everyone should know this by now but if not why does it derive the name corona virus what is the corona referring to if you look under the electron microscope it has these projections from the surface of the virus that look like either the corona of the Sun or the corona of a crown so I think the first people certainly the electron microscope decided to name it based on that yet they have a little imagination but it's not so far off of course this is relevant when we start to talk about the immune response to it because the immune response is particularly strong when it comes to certain parts of the viral code and we'll probably come back and talk about spiked proteins and things like that so when did these corona viruses show up in terms of our understanding of common colds I think we identified the first one in the 1930s and 40s from chicken that's what I remember that the infectious bronchitis virus was found in chickens and then in the 1960s people identified viruses that cause the common cold that had the same kind of appearance as the infectious bronchitis virus and I think by then we knew something about some of the pig viruses as well so the human it was isolated from people with colds that had the same structure coronaviruses in chickens and pigs so that's how the news in the coronavirus family is it the exception or the rule Stanley that a virus that infects humans also has an animal host I think I would say it can go either way so much that it's hard to make a strong conclusion viruses like measles virus infects only people small pox only infects people that's why we can eliminate them from human populations in theory viruses or the corona viruses mostly seemed to be able to infect other animals as well but the virus that I worked with three years in the lab mouse hepatitis virus was a mouse virus and I don't think it affected anything but mice there were human viruses even now so we're seeing that SARS Coby to the cause of cope at nineteen can infect animals so humans can infect these other animals by spreading the virus

[00:18:46] Sarris Co V certainly infected other animals MERS Kavya a camel virus so by definition affects other animals the human common cold grown of viruses at least one of them can infect other animals and I don't know one of them probably came from bats but I don't know if they can infect that so I think corona viruses usually can go across species but I don't think ELISA and other viruses often think all across species but not always and that's really gonna play as I was saying into the ability to eliminate a virus from the human population so if you're keeping track of all the things that make a virus difficult for us as a species so if you're trying to build a super virus having the ability to go into an animal host is an important feature of that because you can basically quote-unquote hide outside of the humans for a while even well a large population of the humans are either vaccinated or requiring natural immunity or even approaching herd immunity and you can effectively lay dormant outside of the humans for a while maybe we think about different bites all certainly that's true for West Nile virus if we have the best vaccine in the world we still have

[00:19:56] West Nile virus floating around the birds and other animals of course West Nile virus really isn't a human virus it's virus and ended up in humans at the end but it wasn't really the intent is a one of the virus to infect humans others like measles to just find that having infecting everybody and having huge amounts of herd immunity and still every three years or less coming out and infecting human populations again is that because they are not of measles was just so high that it was like you just had one little crack in the dam and it was a disaster whereas for most things like influenza or even corona viruses they are not is an order of magnitude lower yeah I think that that certainly contributes to with measles you had five people out of a hundred not vaccinated or not resistant to the virus those people would get infected if you put them in a room with somebody who was positive for the measles virus same thing is true for smallpox to were it spread damn animal host others I don't know forever polio

[00:20:57] I don't think of polio is having much of another animal host I think that continues to be in human populations mostly because poor vaccination because we use a live attenuated vaccine that ended up in a water and even mutates or just a mutate but it's not gone and so where did those viruses come from if they never had an animal host where did they evolve well I think they did initially have an animal host so measles is thought to evolve from rinderpest and which affects animals in Africa see that's the other thing about the animal host is if you evolved from an animal host that the virus evolved from animal host but then changed so much to infect humans they may not be able to then cause an infection in the animal host so these like the SARS Coby - that causes scope at 19 we don't really know what do we do if he put it back in bats no one's going to try it but I don't know if that would be infected by because it may have changed enough even in a little bit of time it's been out of the bat so it can't infect the bat very well anymore wow that's really interesting so it ping-pong back and forth until it finds a more favorable host I mean this would suggest from an evolutionary fitness standpoint that if it starts in an animal comes to a human stays in a human it must find the human on some level a more desirable host

[00:22:12] I don't know but that's making the virus a little more anthropomorphic than it might be needed if it's in humans it may never see a bat again so it's not that it's more desirable host but that's a fair point yeah humans bats don't interact that much even though they interact more then may be desirable giving these viruses but it's not like the virus can look around to help those bad I think oh yeah let me go try that out again and see how it compares to this Oh last question on this topic tell me a little bit about HIV I'm just not a student of my immunology is HIV a virus that is now believed to have evolved I mean I know back I remember a million years ago people said oh it came from this monkey or that monkey do we have a very clear sense of the lineage of HIV I think it's beyond what I know well I think that we have a very strong sense that it came from non-human primates I think we may know more exactly but what

[00:23:03] I read periodically is some studies it seems like the virus was in human populations are identified late before its first obvious entry into people who became HIV infected so I think it's clearly from non-human primates but the exact details I don't know but I think some people do and some of these sources like some new primates have an HIV bike virus that's pretty close let's go into the it's a it's the late 90s so it's pre

[00:23:30] SARS you're working hard on corona viruses at that point in time is it am i doing the math right that there are basically sort of four endemic corona viruses that are not especially severe but just circulate through humans causing annoying respiratory infections a year after year is that directionally the lay of the land it's actually only to just because to them so bird Africa stars in 2004 or so Wow which were the two that came along and that we're there in the 90s to 290 and OC 43 okay and what do we know about people's immune response to them I mean did anybody ever say hey we should vaccinate against these or was it they're not that interesting they don't make people that sick who cares yeah it was more the latter appropriately so if you're gonna spend with huge amounts of money and we know that huge amounts of money are involved and make a vaccine why would you spend it on a cold virus people get colds it's annoying he the other thing is that really that may be relevant for things October 19 is that people got these cold viruses they could be reinfected so they could be reinfected a year later and that's what the papers we were talking about earlier really talked about is that the immune response may be if you have a mild infection you may have more transient immune response yeah there are three or four papers that I can't wait to dive into and we're gonna do it I just want to make sure the listener doesn't get too lost in what we're talking about but actually if you're listening to this now and you have not listened to the interview with David Watkins this would be a great time to hit pause go back and do that because in that discussion we really do the immunology tour-de-force and we explain the difference between the innate immune system the adaptive immune system and the two branches of the adaptive immune system the humoral system which relies on b-cells and their antibodies in the cellular system which relies on t-cells and I have a very strong suspicion that very soon Stan Lee and I are going to get into some of the weeds around the b-cells versus the t-cells and again I don't think you can educate yourself enough on this topic if you want to truly understand what's going on with these viruses bringing it back to the late 90s tell me what your interest was at that time so obviously you're a scholar you're doing incredible work did you think at that point in time gosh these corona viruses aren't that interesting they're not really a threat to humans they're not really a threat to my patients and the way other viruses are even RSV would be more of a threat to children whooping cough would be more of a threat to children what is it that kept you in this at the time relatively benign virus was it helped me understand was that kept you in a field that ultimately turned out to be a very productive decision at the time we were interested mostly in his mouth virus and the human disease multiple sclerosis so thinking about how does a virus go into the brain end up in the cells that make myelin which is the sheets in the brain that covered the axons and how does the virus or the house virus end up there and then once the host realizes that the virus is there how does it manage to destroy tissue while it's eliminating the virus how come the buyer the immune response can't figure out how to rid the cells of virus without also destroying the cells themselves and destroying the function of their cells so that's what I became interested that's when I was studying how does this occur what kind of immune responses were dallisa T by the virus what mattered the most what caused demyelination what caused remyelination which is the process of getting my land back and witches and people at multiple sclerosis is the pareve when they have the missions after relapsing and for missing or after relapsing have disease and they get better again for a bit of time for people who have some form where they get better to a large extent how does that occurring as well so we were using the virus to try to study that but to be clear was your personal interest at that time more in this is a virus that helps us understand a disease like MS where we can understand the demyelination remyelination process or was it more I think from a pediatric and a neurobiological development standpoint I want to make sure I understand what's happening in trimester one that is potentially injuring a child's brain like those two aren't necessarily mutually exclusive but where you bent more towards one than the other

[00:27:53] I think that by the mid 90s I was thinking much more about the first how does a virus infecting the brain how is it cleared why does clearance always involve tissue destruction why is that happening like that so you're basically now becoming a neurobiologist with a background in immunology virology and pediatrics well at that point that became a neurobiologist with their background in biology and cell biology I didn't really start doing immunology till the early 90s 1990 so then we were doing some of it yes the virus proceeded by doing immunology so tell me what's going on when SARS hits what is it the I can't even remember exactly was this Oh two of three the end of o2 became a big deal in 2003 and then was eliminated in July 2003 for all intents and purposes so tell us the story in some detail I think for many people it's I mean I remember it because there was a component that was in

[00:28:50] Toronto I grew up in Toronto I wasn't living there at the time but just that sort of perked my ears but at the same time I was in residency so I was so sleep-deprived I if I could drive home without crashing that was an accomplishment so it's not like I was really paying attention either but can you give us sort of a really detailed account of where this virus came from how it emerged and and what impact it had on you and how it may have shifted you were thinking yeah so the way it emerged we heard about this virus that was causing a respiratory disease in southern China and initially we all thought this was going to be a plant of flu virus because flu viruses we know initiate often start in southern China it's particularly the city of Guangzhou which is across the bay from Hong Kong so we heard about these viruses and then it became clear that they were a corona virus this was isolated by several laboratories but we learned in retrospect is that they actually came from a live animal market in Guangzhou and this was a place where animals were all put together for sale for food and other purposes and so they were bats along with other exotic live animals and we learned that the corona virus and

[00:30:00] SARS coronavirus was almost certainly a bat virus that spread to these other animals and the virus rapidly adapted to these other animals and sometimes infected human handlers of that market so people are actually handling the animals to sell them and many of those became sick many developed subclinical disease and we know that up to a third of the handlers were actually had antibodies to SARS Covey's so we know that this was going back and forth a lot then we know that some of the time it spread to a mainland China how many times that occurred we don't know whether it was exactly the same virus that we study in the lab I don't think we really know that well reason that this became really was brought to the world attention is that a single animal handler became ill enough to see a physician the physician actually became quite little didn't go home we had the one to a Hong Kong hotel and at that point it was really sick and spread the virus and the other people on the floor and they all went through their homes and that's how the virus ended up spreading around the world because of this one physician you ended up going to Hong Kong whether this would have occurred anyway is an open question of course the main set of events was single event and that's why the virus seemed to start from a single point source now help me understand something I think most people listening to this are now familiar with or not but we'll explain it again what was the are not of that SARS virus in retrospect ideas what do we believe it was how transmissible was it yeah so this is a good question because the official numbers are as an arm nod of about two to three which means that single person will infect two to three people so clearly as you can see with without even thinking about it very hard if the virus starts with one person then infects to and then each of those infects two more people you now have four infections may infect to you can eight so you can quickly get up to high numbers by this exponential growth then the will hit pause there for one sec just to put that in the context earlier for example you talked a lot about measles measles has an are not probably north of ten correct yeah around fifteen

[00:32:10] I mean that's about as high as they come I mean that's an explosive exponential multiplier at the other end of the spectrum today HIV czar not would be less than one yeah and I think HIV is a little different because it's not a respiratory spread yeah so let's use another respiratory example what would be a low are not well let's use the other coronaviruses if you take those other corner viruses there one to two at most right exactly so one person infects someone else on the average this is on the average of course so going back to now SARS sorry to interrupt you there but now you've got a two to three are not so this is quite a spreading virus this physician goes to the hotel he gets a bunch of people potentially sick and obviously now that can take the virus around the world because presumably people at hotels are gonna go back someplace right yeah so I think that the on out of two to three though may be misleading because there's no question that that they are not one the average was two to three but it consisted of spread within the hospital spread recurred much more readily SARS was a virus that really cause pneumonia not much more so the virus didn't readily spread from one person to another until that first person was pretty ill and then if that person went in the hospital and you now started as a were mucking up their lung fluids so that virus was now released into the air by a procedures either intubation or suctioning or whatever else needed to be done then we are not factoring to be much more than two or three and the community because this is a deep pneumonia it really isn't that a contagious so I think that if we split it up those 8,000 cases would be an average of two to three with quite a range depending on where the virus was acquired and I think the other lesson we have to take away from SARS is it gets widely quoted as having a 10% mortality rate but again how could we possibly say that when we don't know the total number of cases that might be the case fatality rate

[00:34:13] I mean case fatality rate is not that interesting it's the infection fatality rate that really matters and it's certainly possible isn't it that many more people had it even let's say there was five times the number of people who actually had the illness but didn't come down with a severe enough version that they warranted hospitalization or testing you would all of a sudden say technically the mortality of this is two percent which is still absolutely devastating virus but it's not the devastation of when you hear 10 percent mortality I mean that's literally like playing Russian roulette that's a way to think about it but it was very hard at the time finding patients who were asymptomatic and were infected so the thinking was that anybody who became infected actually became symptomatic what you say makes perfect sense but I'll tell you another story so the next coronavirus that came upon us was the MERS coronavirus the Middle East respiratory corona virus and this is a disease that's exactly the same not exactly but very similar to SARS and being able to

[00:35:14] Punk disease this disease the mortality is billed as 35% yeah so really terrible and it's different though so what you just talked about the 2002-2003 virus that started in a market in southern China who has the same name as the current virus we're talking about we refer to them as Sorrows one and sorrows two they're in the same beta family which we didn't really get into you want to take a minute to explain that because MERS is a slightly different subdivision of the family can you help people understand that new ones yeah so it's all very similar they're all in the same general group of coronaviruses and within the same subgroup of cloner viruses but they're slightly different in their genome organization and in some of their coding so they're put into a separate category so it's a corona virus before we knew so much about from sequence nobody better consider the same type of grown of ours but it's different enough so we classify it a little differently what that means it's a little more distant from the SARS coronavirus so there's lesson thinking that one could actually provide immune protection from the other though the fact there's some crust reactivity MERS coronavirus is recognized in part by SARS coronavirus sera from people who survive they're closed it's like your third cousin instead of your first cousin it's pretty close but not as close and this will obviously be interesting when we come back to this discussion of cross immunity and basically that's probably the biggest difference as opposed to a functional difference about the virulence or the potential for virulence correct right right okay so again let's now pick it back up it's what is it 2009 when MERS came along well Merson camels probably came along at least in 1983 but in people it was found in 2012 and that was cases there's a few mysteries about

[00:37:08] MERS coronavirus why is it only in the Arabian Peninsula so tell me about that did people and I say people I really mean scientists I'm sure the population wasn't wandering around thinking about this but did scientists appreciate that there was a corona virus in camels in the 80s from the early eighties was that something appreciated nope this was absolutely not appreciated because in camels these corona viruses cause the common cold okay so that's why nobody would care Tama gets a cold you don't even know he goes to camel Walgreen and you never hear about him again so what do we think account for the virus jumping quite literally from a camel to a human in call it 2012 ish we don't know the buyers have been in camels since probably earlier don't work earlier and we know it doesn't jump in Africa or other parts of Asia so this is real mystery in this virus why is it only in the Arabian Peninsula when you look at the MERS virus in the camels it's still the same in the Arabian

[00:38:15] Peninsula versus other camels hard to know it may be subtly different in parts of Africa where there's no MERS but we have a lot of trouble saying that those differences account for the fact that there's basically no cases in Africa and you have these cases in Saudi Arabia rising all the time yeah and when you say Africa do you include North Africa were there any cases that arose in Egypt or Algeria Libya Morocco yes they did not occur in those places yeah camels are affected their partner oh wow because a lot of people would sort of say look I mean if something happens in

[00:38:50] Saudi Arabia it could be just as likely to happen in Iran or Egypt I mean even though they're technically belonging to different continents they're very similar geographically but you're saying no there was a really hard line distinguishing that and we don't to this day have a sense of what allowed that jump yeah we don't know the fact is not only occurred in 2012 but it's occurring once or twice a week now because people are coming in they'll actually have no contact with camels and they're coming into the hospital with MERS they often have comorbidities that are older or they might have diabetes but otherwise they don't even have contact with camels do they have to get it from a camel but not clear how so wait a minute that was my next question do we know that it can or cannot spread human to human once a person gets it from its most likely source of transmission which is a camel can one person in fact another yeah so this is where they are not factor becomes important again because the official number for MERS is somewhere between zero and four I think outside of hospitals is probably near two point three five point five somewhere in that low range so it means it's not impossible but all you need is somebody to be infected and happened to infect someone else who's highly susceptible and that highly susceptible person will then appear at the hospital not having had any contact with the camel and that zero to four would such a broad range I have read that as the official range it's so broad is to be unhelpful that's really the camel are not that's the spread from camel to human and then as you said human to human transmission is probably going to occur in the hospital and so MERS becomes the scariest of them all just unmoor tality because the official numbers are basically it killed a third of the people that were infected it's about almost 900 deaths out of call it 2500 confirmed cases that's about as scary as any virus may be outside of Ebola but again the absolute numbers are so low the transmissibility human-to-human doesn't seem as high especially when you consider that the scariest viruses are ones that are transmitted from asymptomatic people right yeah so this one like SARS is mostly transmitted from people who have lung disease already have severe lung disease I don't think they are known is actually camel to camel I don't think it takes that at the consideration rather but what it takes to the consideration is the hospital spread there's like SARS and somewhat hospitals but that's been basically not stopped completely because it's my friends in Saudi Arabia say somebody comes in with this disease we think about it quickly but we may not think about it in every case quickly enough so there may be still some spread within the hospital so knows a comeall spread which you're referring to in hospital spread is a big problem because you just don't have it on the front of your mind that every person who shows up in respiratory distress could have this and therefore a potentially the health care workers themselves can be infected because it's not just the proximity but it's the type of procedures that are being done when you put a breathing tube in somebody you're really creating an effective portal for the virus to get to you and then obviously we know how infections like that can spread through intensive care units and such yeah that's exactly right that's exactly why it's a problem so why did this not turn into even an epidemic within the Arabian

[00:42:13] Peninsula I mean you did mention that we still see a few cases each year but 2500 confirmed cases directionally makes it not even a sort of an epidemic really let alone a pandemic why do you think this just wasn't something that spread despite its potential for devastation at the mortality level because I think that that are not 0.3 really makes it not possible or not likely there's plenty of cases with murders where people went back to relatively poor country after having been a worker in Saudi Arabia were found to be infected and infected nobody so that nobody became ill from that patient even though they weren't really looked at that's as opposed to

[00:42:53] Korea where there's that one patient who are infected 186 people so there was a really a confluence of lots of bad luck about to have occurred and then going back to Tsarskoe v1 what basically accounts for the eradication of that call it in 2003-2004 the combination of there being no reservoir so it's not like camels which could continue introduce him to human populations and the fact that because you weren't contagious till you were sick it was easy to look at somebody's how that person has SARS we're gonna stick them in a room by himself take care of him and make sure he infects nobody else then you would stop the disease it's a classic kind of quarantine an identification qualitative we talk about all the time with the cult of 19 but it's really feasible with SARS when you talk to me about a total of 8,000 cases around the world I mean Stan Lee to hear you tell the story this way it's just it's like a bad movie because you could be lulled into a false sense of confidence by the time MERS blows over you can say hey okay I got it we've got a few of these coronaviruses they cause a bunch of colds you get a runny nose in the summer but it's really nothing and yeah it's true two really bad actors showed up that on a virus to virus level can really hurt their hosts but they're nothing to really be afraid of in the case of SARS one it has two things that make it really friendly to humans one it can't bounce back and forth between humans and animals and - you don't really spread you're very unlikely to spread it if you're not symptomatic you don't have to shut the world down but not only that you get to isolate people when they're sick and treat them before they treat others so the virus really gave up two big potential superpowers in the case of

[00:44:43] MERS sure it lives in animals and it's never gonna leave those animals but it has such a poor ability to spread between humans almost under any circumstance unless you're probably sticking a breathing tube in them that it was just so easy to contain if the story stop there you'd say cabrona viruses are just not a threat to us yeah so I think some people in the field more than me said let's go look at a corona viruses in fact and so what they did is they found other corona viruses and it was actually for a scientific reason or different one than just searching for the viruses we were trying to figure out where did the SARS coronavirus really begin so people when looked at bat colonies are throughout China since that's where SARS began and asked can we find other bats that are the bat viruses that are more similar to SARS Kobe than the ones we know about like this minute because we could isolate the virus in the wet markets and Guangzhou but we didn't know where they came from exactly which kind of bats and it was just a trick finding in bats and so but while doing that people found other viruses that could in theory enter a human cell by using the same kind of mechanism that

[00:45:57] Tsarskoe v-- used to enter human cells so there was some people who were saying if there were a lot of people or some people to feel it was saying well we potentially have more of a problem because there may be other ways to infect people maybe other viruses that can infect people and so I think there was a concern that this could happen again and MERS is the same thing we haven't identified the exact precursor to MERS and bats with is clearly viruses that look like the MERS coronavirus and bats and so if they were able to use the human receptor and didn't take too much adaptation to infect humans and you can imagine the same thing occurring with

[00:46:35] MERS sometimes in future occurring again with SARS cofee like viruses so you write in fifteen we're thinking these viruses really close bad pneumonia but it's going to be like influenza h5n1 it's going to have very very little human-to-human spread and mostly animal to human spirit is there a necessary relationship that says the viruses like

[00:47:00] MERS that are incredibly deadly if you get them just luck is on our side and they don't have much transmissibility or is that simply luck so far and there's no reason to suggest teleologically that that has to be the case in other words you could imagine a scenario where you take something that has the transmissibility of Tsarskoe v2 which we'll get to and explain why it is much more of a headache than Tsarskoe v1 or

[00:47:28] MERS if you take the transmissibility of that which is both and primarily as a factor of the fact that it can spread before you're symptomatic coupled with the actual pathology of MERS which I want to contrast with these viruses I mean that's a double whammy you can really get into a dangerous situation not that this hasn't been a disaster but it could be a 5x disaster is there anything that tells us that's unlikely because of this feature of the biology of the virus I don't think there's anything that's unlikely I don't think there's anything about the feature of the virus I think about this at escabi to being a mixture of a common cold corona virus and then I mentioned plus either SARS or MERS coronavirus in the lungs so that's why you have the transmissibility and the severe disease because those both but when you think about other bad diseases I gave him in the epidemic flu in 1918 that really did about the same thing it was very very very transmissible and it killed about a few percent of the people are affected but if you infect everybody you kill 3% or 4% you're killing a lot of people so that's what this virus is doing also because it's transmissible so readily because behaves like a common cold corona verse that rate of lethality is not super high but the denominator is so huge that you have a lot of people dying from is there something about the pathology of this virus how does it differ I mean when you think about SARS one and MERS that let's just say directionally those numbers are right in terms of the denominator wasn't bigger than we think and you're killing basically one in ten or one in three people infected what did the virus actually do in the lungs that would render people so helpless yeah I think it's the same thing that SARS Govi to does in the lungs and those people who get severe disease I think we don't really understand what's going on we think that there's lots of virus in the lungs and we think there's a very strong and probably inappropriate immune response that's causing much of the damage that we see in lungs so it's a combination of those two features that's why people are from the beginning with

[00:49:37] SARS people are trying to figure out a way to both limit virus replication and also decrease the host immune response so that you don't have this extra the result of an exuberant immune response do the other two viruses SARS one and MERS do they also gain entry through the ACE to receptor or did they use a different receptor to enter the Numa site well SARS uses the same receptor MERS uses a different receptor one thing is really curious as SARS doesn't affect the upper airway to appreciable even though it uses a single scepter there's also one of the common cold corona viruses in o63 uses a stew only protects the upper airway and doesn't affect the longest any appreciable excellent and that could also account for the change in transmissibility because if you are only infecting the lower airway you're probably less transmissible than SARS Co v2 which can infect both exactly exactly that's why he stars was not so contagious because it only stayed in the deep lungs until you went to the hospital and had to put down for breathing or some other procedure done so do you think that SARS one and MERS were so much more lethal than SARS - because they elicited a greater immune response once they infected the lung or because they caused greater numa site damage when they infected the lung I think that it's actually because they all caused the same amount of damage are pretty similar but you have this huge denominator and SARS COBE - of people have mild as so I think that it's one way to look at these numbers and this is not a perfect calculation but if you have with SARS go be immersed appeared there were a hundred people infected they all get some variability some variation in pneumonia and you have a certain mortality rate ranging from 10% to 30%

[00:51:27] Casares kobe 2,000 people maybe 20 of them are going to get the lung disease the other 18 and going to be asymptomatic subclinical have a cold have something in the upper respiratory tract if you now take that 20% is you can on the nadir and divide that the six percent mortality that we're seeing the five percent mortality oh well I don't know what the number is exactly but I'd say five percent by twenty percent you have a twenty five percent mortality which is near the sellers and MERS so just let me make sure I understand that are you saying it's more the law of large numbers and we have such a big denominator with SARS Co v2 that you're gonna normalize more or are you comparing case fatality to case fatality whereas I'm thinking of it as the IFR as opposed to the CFR for SARS because I think the IFR of SARS Co v2 is very population dependent but I think it's much closer to one to two percent then the initial numbers that people feared of five to ten percent which would put it more in the ballpark of SARS - that's the way I used to think about it when this first started in january/february the mortality rate was 2.8 percent and now if you look at anything official it's near to five to six percent so what you say makes perfect sense it should be near to one to two percent but it's been hard to prove that by all the official numbers so what I was saying more is that if the mortality rate in stars and

[00:52:52] MERS out of everybody who was sick all had pneumonia and of those people some number died SARS Kobe - if only one out of five people or less i jus get pneumonia then the fraction that died deduced that same fraction who died over that 20% you basically multiplying a number by five so if your number is five percent then it goes up to 25 percent it's three percent goes up to fifteen percent so where we are exactly

[00:53:22] I don't know but they may be that the upper transmission is the readily transmissibility of the viruses what's really making the numbers so huge and that everything else it's doing is consistent with what's ours immersed in if you can find yourself though just looking at the lower respiratory tract disease now this is something that might be a little bit outside of what you've studied but I'll ask anyway one of the lingering questions there are so many that I have comes down to the survivors

[00:53:51] I mean obviously we think a lot about the mortality of this but if you take a person who gets infected and they're not asymptomatic so we know that a lot of people kind of don't even know they've got Tsarskoe v2 and the only reason you figure it out is that for the facts your logic analysis tells us that they did but there's a non-trivial amount of people who get sick as hell and they get what they would describe is the worst cold of their life I have at least two friends I can think of in this situation who three months later can barely run a 9-minute mile again and they're slowly getting back in shape when I did a quick check on this looking at the SARS MERS patient follow-up data I didn't find a heck of a lot that told me about long-term lung function do you know much about this and I would imagine that there's now more of an interest to go back and assess that then there was three months ago when I tried to look this up yeah when even before this all could I ask my friends in Saudi Arabia about follow up on the MERS patients and I could never get information as to what exactly was going on I suspect that they had problems whether they'd be forever or a few months is unclear especially since your friends were younger and fitter they've been MERS particularly murders if it's mostly older people people diabetes people with whom to have comorbidities they may take them longer to get back to baseline it's probably not going to be running miles I suspect it'll take a while to get back I don't know how much fibrosis was at the end of it all how much permanent damage there was I suspect that there was a better bit but you always have its in Arkansas as people always talk about neurological disease without actually ever finding the virus in the brain was attributed to being on ventilators and corticosteroids for long periods of time contributing to a cognitive dysfunction and occasionally the viruses in the brain so it's all a mix that's hard to really sort out what the major components are cause is several things that contribute to the outcomes well based on your knowledge of coronaviruses and your knowledge in particular their impact on the brain do you think that there are plausible mechanisms by which even for those who recover from SARS there could be lasting neurologic impact that is not the byproduct of hypoxia or vent head pump head any of the other more mechanical or other physiologic accounts in other words do you believe that there is a plausible scenario by which the virus could have residual neurologic values we can't find any evidence of the virus in the brain that it seems less likely that it's direct virus infection what about an immune response yeah that's I was gonna say if you take a disease like Kawasaki's and children we know that that's a disease that is mediated by some sort of immune response we don't know to all themes here like Ovid 19 is somehow provoking this response in this very very small subset of children that certainly leads to consequences in the heart the long-term consequences are again so you can certainly imagine scenarios like that well how often this occurs and what's going on exactly I don't think we narrow so between the resolution so to speak of MERS and where we were call it a year ago today Stanley where was your head at with respect to the big one were you in the camp that said yeah I've carved out a pretty nice niche here I'm gonna be studying coronaviruses forever or was there a part of you that said this is a threat to national security to the world there's a pandemic brewing here I mean how did you think this could unfold I certainly wasn't smart enough to predict that there was going to be a pandemic as I said some of my friends were worried about additional infections in humans I don't know that anyone would have predicted pandemic like this one I want to pause you there for a second why

[00:57:41] I mean not that I did but I want to push on that for a moment all the ingredients were there I was gonna say is the Department of Defense in 2010 or 11 put out a report about possible emerging viruses as being really the major threat coronaviruses were on that list and Bill Gates talked about this I mean it's become a very well-known TED talk that is it's painful to watch now because of how accurate it was so you have you have these two examples of viruses that have enormous potential to cause harm but fortunately for us at the time they just don't spread well a few tweaks ie infection of the upper respiratory tract and I'll slower onset to symptoms would easily double your are not but okay fair enough

[00:58:25] I'll stop coming down and I'm joking of course stop coming down on you guys for not thinking this could happen but so let's fast forward now to when did you first hear about the outbreak in China I mean I'm assuming it was early December late November no I don't think it started quite better I would say late

[00:58:42] December the first case is official cases were in December we think there may have been some in November but I think that the people in China scientists and doctors in China knew something was going on in December and then it was eventually reported in very early January so I think we knew a few weeks early but even then we didn't really know how much humans human transmission there was now I have to say that at the time given the number of cases we should have guessed that something unusual was going on but to the SARS epidemic we had these cases and lots of people infected and we didn't really know how the spread was occurring and at the time that by early January or mid-january we had 800 cases in the world so it didn't seem to be extraordinarily different from these other viruses maybe if we had had more information about what was going on in

[00:59:30] Wuhan we would realize the hot this is doing something it's different than what SARS immersed it but we didn't have that information when did it become clear to you personally that this was going to be a much bigger problem than SARS and MERS ever were funny you asked that because I remember in December when we really didn't know anything about human to human transmission I spoke to my friends in China and I got off the phone and told my wife this is a big deal so I'm not sure what I was facing that on because it wasn't so much evidence of human-to-human transmission it was pretty clear to me then that this was going to be a major problem at that time could you have predicted it would have been this big an issue I don't think so mostly because all the previous diseases had remained geographically confined so

[01:00:19] Sarris was really a disease in China with a little spread around the world myrrh is the brilliant disease in the Arabian Peninsula with that one case and spreading inductance several people in Korea but this one you know maybe the dynamics of everything are so different people spread travel from Wuhan much more frequently because people have more money so they fly more they take the train more so that helped the spread a lot then of course this is transmissible the other thing is that we had gone through some of this with h5n1 so in the late 1990s people are saying what we need to do is have this be transmittable and it'd be a disaster because we don't really have good immune responses to it and it never happened so yeah what happened in 2009 with h5n1 because the skeptics would say hey we don't need to worry about this Basara zko v2 the last time we cried that this guy was falling it didn't fall right so that was h1n1 in 2009 and that started off as a lethal disease was identified in Mexico seem to have a high lethality but it's more cases became clear identified it's clear that it didn't it just was lots of cases in very little mortality it was basically influenza it was influenza was just a variant of influenza it was an h5n1 which causes a severe pneumonia h5n1 is the 1919 no one is the one that's never made it to human populations to an appreciable extent pure swine yeah it's mostly pigs and birds but it kills birds and most food doesn't kill birds so the concern was that it would change to infect to be transmissible human to human but never did so the same thing with thinking about corona viruses they hadn't done this so far we certainly thought they could do it but this is an interesting question that's how do you prepare for a pandemic that you don't have because it's um

[01:02:13] I've been asked about and thought of that so you're sitting there in 2005 and SARS goes away how do you decide what kind of resources you want to put developing antivirals developing vaccines against ours the disease that doesn't exist anymore the way the American system is set up for this if you have a good idea and you propose to the NIH you have a good chance of getting funding but on the other hand if you're competing against other grants that make more compelling arguments for funding and deal with diseases that are actually present they're going to look better to a study section so you have to figure out a way to identify a disease that could be a problem without going overboard and using lots of resources for diseases and never will be a problem

[01:02:58] I mean it seems that you'd want to structure it in a way that says look there are some no regret moves here for any viral infection and then there are some things that are going to be very specific so for example not that this is an NIH question but what would a national stockpile of PPE need to look like what would an electronic infrastructure for contact tracing need to look like what would a national stash of reagents to develop serologic and PCR testing need to look like so we don't know what the gene sequence is but the moment we know that gene sequence wouldn't it be great if we could hit go and actually deliver a million tests a day and not talk about it for three months and not do it those strike me is just a no regret moves you don't need to know a single thing about what's coming other than it is infectious it's the little stuff it's the nasal swabs it's the reagents it's all the stuff I just said and about 20 other things I've been thinking about that kind of I really hope that when this has said and done this doesn't get forgotten because it's not a staggering investment when you consider what we spend on health care and defense which are disproportionate to any other country by a log order and oftentimes by 2 log orders per capita you put a few billion dollars into this type of resource and you consider it more vital than you would consider our national surplus of oil or other things for example most people I would assume know this but if not we keep an enormous supply of oil on hand if the world shut down and we couldn't get a drop of oil from anyone in the world we would at least have I don't know I don't remember these stats but probably a 60 to 90 day supply of complete independence on oil maybe more than that and that's just a National Defense imperative so this should easily be in that front the other thing on the therapeutic side I would say is don't we already have enough evidence to suggest that at least one avenue to treatment is immune modulating therapy so maybe not antiviral because that can be quite specific but all of these diseases have an enormous component of an overactive immune response which we'll discuss and therefore having a huge stockpile of immune modulating drugs to be appropriately dosed also strikes me as a no-brainer right yeah yeah no you could argue that I'm not sure that these diseases are all the same in terms of the cytokine storm type activity but they may be close enough so that your point is well-taken they are similar enough so that that would be a reasonable thing to do to have those on hand I think that's what Bill Gates was probably talking about more than specific drugs against specific viruses because you don't really know those so well think about it so the whole stuff with ventilators and all that that was really poorly done testing I think once we know you're right about nasopharyngeal swabs and mechanics of being able to the testing the actual identification of targets for like our team or are not that hard I mean that probably took four days to figure out but it took longer to scale up I mean I think that's the point right it's not no

[01:06:14] I mean the virus was sequenced no january eleventh or twelfth wasn't it yeah it's just scaling up the ability to do testing so anybody who says well come on they would be crazy to have three billion dollars invested in that on the off chance that the virus doesn't even make it out of China to which the answer would be did you look at what happened to the US economy it's called a hedge this is what sophisticated companies do sophisticated companies they're Beth's and if the answer is every time a really scary virus emerges in China we have to spend three billion dollars to be ready for it to land here but guess what we don't have to shut our economy down as a result we can instead mitigate 90% of that damage I mean it's the wisest investment that could ever be made but I'll get off the soapbox now because nobody wants to hear me rant about that stuff I want to get back to the kind of the interesting biology on this stuff so let's now go back and talk about these four viruses that cause us nothing more than nuisance when we get colds do they have any seasonal variability to them by the way or they winter viruses summer viruses or does it matter they tend to not be summer viruses and they can't anymore winter early spring viruses what determines that by the way is that simply a function of being close to each other in the winter and spreading it or is it actually a property of the virus yeah we used to think it was that but as we know more I don't know the answer to that I know the some of these respiratory viruses are more active in the late fall winter and others in the winter early spring and I don't know why there's a difference I don't think anyone else really knows either we know these viruses are usually happier when it's a little cooler and a little drier but that wouldn't explain why one virus did well in November another one did better in March interesting and then from an immune response why is it that these viruses haven't basically become irrelevant in the sense that we all eventually get them and we all develop immunity and we're sort of done that's where the question about all common cold viruses whether they be corona or otherwise so why do you actually get reinfected I don't think we understand it very well we know that there's an antibody response to these viruses it seems to wane it goes away we know that you need a specific kind of antibody the

[01:08:27] IgA response that seems to help we don't have that much information about IgA responses they seem to wane as well the t-cell response is the other part of the immune system that you mentioned earlier we don't know that much about two t-cell response and common cold corona viruses before all this began we didn't think that was a big deal because common colds usually go away in a few days before you actually have a t-cell response so we don't know why things will virus immunity wanes we know there's such huge differences in smallpox you can detect and people had smallpox in 1918 1995 they still had antibody responses that were measurable here we have these common cold corona viruses a year later they waned in a couple years later they're probably almost gone so we don't really understand that that's really a key question and if both impacts the ability to people to be reinfected by Tsarskoe v2 impacts the vaccine responses impacts general herd immunity as we try to get rid of this virus it's a really important but not known there probably hasn't been a case of a corona virus before where we've cared enough about herd immunity to talk about it but do you mind explaining to folks what you're talking about with herd immunity specifically with respect to Tsarskoe v2 and what it means well herd immunity is really the other side of what you were talking about the are not factor so if the herd immunity means if you have a virus that's extremely contagious for people who are susceptible to be protected from the infection you have to have most of the people around them be resistant to the virus so to put this in a different context if somebody who's infected with whether it be SARS Coby to measles or anything else comes into a room and they're spreading virus the virus is going to land in various places some of it will land on the floor some of them might land on somebody's hands and could in theory infect that person but if that person is immune to the virus that you doesn't matter the virus can win then that person's hands and then that person can touch his face but he won't get infected or he won't get disease anyway but if your person is susceptible then he will so then if that person is susceptible he could then spread it to other people in this prefer view of a large room but they all stay together for several days now if you take a situation where you have an extremely contagious virus so in that room of 100 people are saying before with measles as five of them are susceptible the virus might spread to twenty five thirty people from that one's acceptable person and then of that five percent maybe one or more of those people will become infected if you have a virus like SARS Kobe - which has a lower are not factor than it same hundred people there five are susceptible the odds are will not get to the point of infecting there one of those five people so herd immunity is that ratio the fraction of people who are immune to a disease for measles the number is said to be ninety five percent if you don't have that ninety five percent then see measles can infect people who are susceptible for most common viruses it's around sixty or seventy percent so that's the number that people are really looking at for in terms of immunization or infection with

[01:11:39] Tsarskoe b2 to protect the general population it's not the same as being immunized or having the previous infection you're still susceptible but it just means that it's much more likely the virus won't spread and if you get sick it's unlikely you'll spread it to that thirty percent of the population that has never seen the virus so that's why it matters yeah and there's a very non linear but monotonic inverse relationship between arnaud and herd immunity which I can't believe I actually just said all that it's basically math speak for the higher the are not the higher the need for herd immunity but the relationship gets there nonlinearly I don't have an on math way to say that but the example you gave is a good one which is and I said inverse it's actually not inverse it's direct the are not for measles is very high and the herd immunity threshold is very high ninety-five percent going down to an R naught of two to three you have a herd immunity threshold of sixty to seventy percent now do you believe that based on everything we know today and that includes potentially there being many more asymptomatic people who are infected and who have gotten over the infection than we previously believed do you believe that the threshold for herd immunity is still as high as 60 to 70 percent for SARS Co v2 or do you think that it could be as low as twenty to thirty percent well I think it's still gonna be 60 to 70 percent it's just that there's a higher percentage of people who have immunity already so in other words you're saying yeah it's becomes a bit of an academic or a moot point because it might be that of those 60 to 70 percent who have to be infected for herd immunity to three don't even know they were infected but they actually were from an immune okay fair point yeah so is there much genetic drift in these viruses the way like influenza I think most people know hey I got to get a flu shot every year but what they might not understand is the reason they're getting the flu shot is probably less because their immune system forgets what influenza looked like and more because influenza looks different every year how much do these coronavirus is genetically drift to use the lingo so far we haven't had evidence that this one drifts I think when you look at the other viruses one of them seems to vary quite a bit

[01:13:54] OC 43 seems like they're from variants a lot of the others don't seem to change that much SARS was adapting to human population so it changed but if it had stayed around I don't know that it would have changed much MERS is clear camel virus so any drift you see is what happens in camels nothing people again both for MERS in the human the other

[01:14:15] Crone viruses is not really well except for OC 43 I don't think there's huge effects on immunity this virus is really this certainly lots of talk about changes in the virus and becoming more Abril into more weaker more attenuated but there's really no evidence so far that says this virus has changed in a way that makes it unlikely a vaccine will work unlikely that a previous infection won't protect you from a second infection there may be reasons why it won't but it won't be because the virus is changing so far that's an important point I think we one are gonna reiterate that right which is the doomsday scenario would be a virus that retains its virulence but constantly drifts enough genetically that your immune system never recognizes it again but it retains all of its bad properties

[01:15:00] I mean that's a disaster if you had a new version of a deadly virus show up every year it could hurt you just as badly but somehow its genetic drifting created a different coat on it a different set of antigens and every year your immune system was caught off guard that would be very painful and what you're saying is hey we don't have evidence of either of those things happening that it's genetically becoming more or frankly less harmful of equal if not more importance that it's not becoming a different immune animal as time goes on at least in a very short window we've study but again is helpful to go back and look at these other coronaviruses that you've studied because they've given us a lot of insight right yeah exactly the immunity when you have a mild infection just do not develop great immunity so let's double click on that you've said already part of that I want to make sure

[01:15:49] I understood it so part of it is the innate system just for whatever reason doesn't seem to do much you've already talked about how a lot of times with at least the common coronaviruses they might not even stick around long enough to develop a t-cell response can you say a bit more about the adaptive humoral system what do we know about the IgM and

[01:16:12] IgG which again if you haven't listened to the interview and the discussion with David Watkins I think this would be a great time to go back and make sure you familiarize yourself with that so that we don't have to go into the details of what those things mean but six months after a person has a common corona virus do you still see evidence of at least the IgG yes and do you know how often it is basically binding non-binding do you have a sense of what the functionality of that IgG is is it neutralizing fully necessarily not necessarily I think the human volunteer studies are best answers for that for the common cold corona viruses and they show that the immunities there gets measured by neutralizing antibody and then it wanes with time and that a year later it's there and may not prevent shedding it's still I think it sounds remarkably like what I think we're gonna hear about with coded 19and immunity when people have mild infections or asymptomatic now we've talked about this paper that came out god think it's been maybe three weeks ago Alex Eddy was the senior author on it 2020 cell paper that looked at twenty patients who recovered from kovat 19 and I believe about two-thirds of them actually had a cd8 t-cell response and a cd4 response that kind of correlated with that the point being they looked to have been at least partially aided in their response to

[01:17:40] Tsarskoe v2 from t-cells that looked like they had been sensitized by other corona now this was a small study and this was based on in vitro assays can you explain that study a little bit or at least the idea behind it because it's a incredibly interesting idea and it has clinical relevance if this turns out to be true yeah so I think this is one of actually several studies this is the only published one I think that shows that people who have never seen the virus have some sort of t-cell response to

[01:18:11] Tsarskoe b2 now there are some caveats when I read this paper that make me pause and drawing to stronger conclusion one is that in most of these papers away t-cell responses or measures not by functionality but rather by being activated in a certain way and these activations to my mind are a surrogate for actual functionality and the functionality was not well demonstrated in any of these studies you may see a little functionality but it's not the major point second thing is the targets for these viruses for the t-cell response is not the usual response that you get in terms of targets and you see after than the wild-type infection the

[01:18:50] SARS go B to infection and because of this difference the mix are also a little unclear to me where this response is coming from so you can say okay that doesn't matter it's still from a common cold corona virus but then when people go back and look at the sequence of the common cold corona viruses for the same targets this actually very little homology with t-cell responses that are recognized in these patients who have never seen stars could be two so altogether one hand you could say well maybe this is something that's important maybe it contributes to protection pathogenicity on the other hand it's a little odd because it's mostly measured by activation not necessarily by function and that may matter and it's also targets are not totally clear how that's working so we it's something it's not completely clear yet so I'm a bit confused by that

[01:19:41] Stanly because if we were doing this on the b-cell side which is where we normally would you would do an in vitro assay and demonstrate the presence of neutralizing antibodies not just binding but neutralizing and that would give us great confidence that the b-cell response would translate from the in vitro finding to the in vivo finding is that correct I agree with you yes so we can do comparable T cell assays where we actually look at killing function and not just signaling functions and things like that right yeah and this isn't really signal this is protein what was measured with proteins that come up if a cell has been activated in at all so this is not killing assays not even making cytokines which are the my preferred way of doing this good this year yeah so that's what's gonna say usually when you look at typical studies that are looking at say response to flu vaccination they look at cytokine response on the T cell so do you know if studies are looking to do that because that just seems to be a very obvious thing to want to ask at this point well for the people who are naive who've never seen the virus and who have these assays done t-cell responses are done but they're they're very very low levels of activity so the amount of cytokine produced through extremely low or non-existent so you just wonder part of the issues we do some of these assays and you can do it very well but the level of the background is a work is approaching what we're seeing in some of these patients so I think juries just out on how important it is and what it means to me it's really interesting it kind of doesn't go with what we used to see what we've seen in MERS patients where we don't really see much of a background much of evidence of cross reactivity but we didn't actually do the surrogate assays these assays for activation and there may be a temporal component in other words it could be that let's assume that on average a person gets one year of quasi protection from a given corona virus until it can infect them again you now have a hundred people who are in various stages along a continuum of that recovery from pick your favorite endemic coronavirus and then they all at one day get infected with SARS Co v2 well presumably there's also a strength and a decline of immune response so even though they would all have some immune response lingering some memory of immune to the benign coronavirus they could technically mount very different responses to the much more feared

[01:22:19] Tsarskoe v2 simply as a function of how far they are out from their initial infection correct I think that's a different layer because it assumes that there's something there that's correct if there's something there yes absolutely this is a totally second layer do you think there are other viruses or other vaccines that could provide cross reactivity I don't think provide cross reactivity is of course these ideas that you should immunize everybody with attenuated polio virus because that'll activate the immune system and that'll give you some protection or you should do something like that BCG which we use for immunization against tuberculosis whether they have any effect people are suggesting this and I think they're in trials even but in terms of specificity of getting at the corona viruses I don't know so the BCG one's worth probably explaining a little bit to people because it got so much attention I think the other one that got quite a bit of attention was MMR there's a very famous graph that a friend of mine sent me that said hey the entire pandemic and the mortality profile which basically hockey sticks above 50 can be explained by exposure to MMR people below 50 uniformly had MMR vaccination people above 50 it's much more spotty and the further you get from 50 the less likely you were to have an MMR vaccine and that explains it now I can go on why I don't believe that's the case but I'd rather hear your views on whether that is or is not likely I think it's actually contrary to what one might think because those of us who are over 50 had you actually got the real virus three of those infections so I don't consider myself resistant in fact almost everybody my age had all three of those viruses everybody certainly had measles and mumps German measles may have been less frequent but from an immune illogic perspective Stanley is there any reason to believe that your memory t-cells and b-cells - measles mumps and or rubella would offer you some protection against this particular corona virus is there any evidence that they offer protection against other corona viruses

[01:24:25] I can say that no one's looked very very hard but there's no reason to think that it would if it was anything like that we would all have some pre-existing immunity to the virus that's way higher than what we're talking about I'll just tell you why I'm also quite skeptical of the BCG claim which is not to say that in certain cases maybe there's an anecdote that it works I mean obviously one of the first examples of cancer immunotherapy came out of an understanding of the Cooley's toxins that sort of came out of this idea of

[01:24:57] BCG but the reality of it is BCG has never shown enough specificity to be a viable immunotherapy against cancer and it's for that reason I guess even if that's overly simplistic that I really doubt the BCG could have a meaningful impact on a virus because it requires just as much in specificity as it does for the immune system to attack cancer yeah and you know for this other agent so we've worked with agents that turn on into firm and I think if you give in to burn at the wrong time in these infections you may make people worse so if you were exposed to : 19 you had a very good exposure right now and I gave you one of these agents that cannot interfere and that may well help you because before you really get an infection if we jazz up your immune system that may help you do better with the virus once it gets going then that probably isn't true there's all these issues that one could imagine that if you jazzed up the immune system of BCG that it could help you if you got to write the right day and then you were exposed to code with 19 but I wouldn't want to be inoculated BCG just for fun with the possibility then the next two days I get exposed to the virus you provided a much more elegant description of how you might possibly benefit from it in a Hail Mary pure luck standpoint but how mechanistically it just doesn't even make sense and you're right by the way I think the broader point I would take away from your comment is there's a really interesting way to think about this from a targeted therapeutic standpoint when you think about the sophistication with which we try to treat other diseases with multiple lines of defense this is a great example of one going back to everything I said before about when I was on my rant about how would you begin to prepare for the next time of pandemic comes back it's all that stuff on the therapeutic side I think it's being more thoughtful about what the strategies are the moment we identify those early cases and say boy this is a disease that typically like influenza is a little bit more of an immune paralysis disease at least at one point here you're seeing this hyper activated immune sense so early treatment is antiviral with immune amplifier late treatment is immune modulator antivirals long since gone and respiratory support starts to matter you can start to really be more sophisticated and how you think of these things and and I think that's probably something that people are starting to think about now and I suspect that a lot of the clinical trials now will focus on more partitioning so we don't just think of it as drug X good or bad drug Y good or bad we don't have this sort of nonsense binary thinking I agree with you completely because that's exactly the way I think about this diseases you need antiviral therapy early on and then maybe an immune modulator later and it becomes a mewn activator if you just catch it just at the right time maybe that would help

[01:27:43] I think it's that you're gonna be the same for severe flu like h5n1 I think the same scenario applies the other thing you point out is that with different patients in different disease courses one has to be ready to modulate therapy and this is one of the things that I'd love to have that we don't have which are biomarkers for different stages of disease well I think for so many diseases we know that something works well and then we do large studies we find that you know it didn't work as well as we think but if you go back you say within this population if we could have identified it first that would be the people who would have responded to this particular therapy that's one of the reasons that some therapies work that don't work that you might think would work because if 20% of people fall in a category of benefiting from that would you treat a hundred percent you dilute all the benefit exactly so that's such an interesting idea what do you think some of those biomarkers could look like there's some obvious ones when a patient's in cytokine storm you can measure the cytokines but if you could go deeper than that and you could look at the proteome and you could look at metabolomics or look at the gut or something like where do you think the answer could lie okay so there's two parts of the question first one is what would you sample because the ideal person to be sampled is that person who comes in like your friend who had trouble running who didn't feel well and

[01:29:07] I don't think he progressed to having disease enough to get him in the hospital nope yeah young healthy guy in his maybe early 40s and yet never hospitalized but sick as a dog for two weeks right so that's a person you'd like to do a test on and say okay is he gonna progress or not clearly in this case we'd want something to say he's sick but he's not gonna progress because he didn't progress so that's a person who you might not want to do anything for on the other hand he may look exactly like someone who has diabetes and 60 in terms of how poorly he felt and so what you'd wanted you need a market not only for severity but you wanted something that would distinguish between the two of them and that you could sample easily in the blood because your friend would not have wanted to undergo some sort of lung measurement because it would have been way more invasive than the sickness he felt so that's why you come back I think you can come back to things like cytokines and metabolic products the problem up till now has been that you can see an increase in cytokine X and people are going to be sick and not increased in people who are going to do better but when you put them all together it's not like you have populations that are very high versus very long you have ones that have a range of X to Y and the other one will have a range of 0.75 X to 1.5 X so you it seems to be a problem that is set up perfectly for some type of machine learning because everything you said is correct and then as you also alluded to there's another layer here which is we know quite a bit about the epidemiology all things equal a forty-year-old without a single pre-existing condition you're gonna weigh that input differently then a 60 year old with no pre-existing conditions or a 40 year old with type 2 diabetes versus a 60 or like they all have a very different physiologic age even if their chronologic ages are similar and so when you start to factor in that plus some of these signatures plus the temporal nature of the signature when am I getting this I think there is an amazing opportunity for information and data scientists to help prepare us for how we will think about this when it happens the next time yes and so what you need out of this is you need as we've talked about for some of the projects we've talked about what you'd ideally like to do is you'd like to take people sample them every couple of days see how what their numbers look like put them in this machine learning model that you're talking about and then if you had enough money so you can measure all these different cytokines you might say okay this person has this block marker says say he's doing its thing whether it be the 40 year old because you know the 40 year old can get sick or whether it be an older person and you put the other rate the other point you make about the epidemiology on top of that and maybe you would not even bother testing the forty year old because the odds of his getting sicker and meriting all the cost and use of resource is not worth it we're not there yet in terms of thinking about which markers are best and also how do you actually do this how do you actually do a study where you can help her person by getting serial testing and seeing which way he or she is going in terms of disease but that would be the ideal way because that person if you saw signs that things weren't badly maybe that's the person you used either recipe or hopefully a oral form of brims a severe stop the virus in its tracks maybe give him you an activator again unclear I think it could give him you not the baby or some people it'll be deleterious so it has to be done so carefully there are two last topics I want to get to one being how we would study the durability of immune response which is effectively the most jugular question out there today I mean if we're gonna think about this through the lens of vaccination and we're gonna think about this through the lens of herd immunity natural or otherwise we better figure out exactly what's gonna happen to these people who get infected and what superpowers they do or don't have in the future before I do that though I want to go back to one thing we kind of alluded to very briefly and then skipped ahead which was that paper that came out kind of recently Matt Ridley is the journalist who wrote about it I think in

[01:33:15] The Wall Street Journal but he refers to the paper buys on that came I think in April that argued basically the virus may not have come from the wet market the way we think it does it I know there we've been sending each other so many papers back and forth over the last few weeks did you have a chance to look at that paper I think so it's the one that says there's a bunch of these so I'm not sure I have the wrigley one in mind the one that says it was released accidentally from the Wu hen lab or the one that says it was no the one that said it was basically so genetically stable it was really it's mostly a person-to-person transmission so I think it basically said look this is mostly a person-to-person transmission and I think it said if it came out of animals it was so long ago that we don't know about it basically argues that the narrative that this came from an animal source to a human source in somewhere between October November

[01:34:09] December of last year is not correct had you seen this paper no I don't know that paper okay all right we won't dive into that too much the point is well-taken that is remarkably fit for humans I don't know about the first part of the conclusion you know that it came out earlier but in a remarkably fit yeah I mean I think they basically looked at the amount of genetic drift that occurred and said it's I read it I think four weeks ago so I'm a little rusty on it other than a few notes I took them or someone cryptic but I I think the argument was look this has probably been in humans longer than we think

[01:34:41] I'll refor worded to after just for the purpose of pure interest so how do we figure out how long people are gonna because it might not be that interesting how much immunity people have to regular common cold coronavirus but it's going to be pretty darn interesting to know how long people are gonna have immunity to this virus I mean we've already at a minimum seen close to 10 million people infected worldwide with this virus personally I think that's a gross underestimate of how many people have been affected I think it's probably closer to a hundred million people have been infected but regardless the durability of their immune response has to be one of the most important questions we understand how would we do that yeah so just doing the things we're doing people who are infected measuring their antibody responses if we can measuring the t-cell responses the

[01:35:32] Zarah that we're going to see waning immunity where people had mild disease that's were hearing over and over again and that's what's been true for the current of virus infections and what will the implication of that be will the implication then be that no matter how successful a vaccine is it's going to need to be an annual vaccine there's two goals one is to protect the individual who's vaccinated from getting severe pneumonia and that may actually occur already so that may be whether the immunity wanes or not that person may never get excipient pneumonia the other issue which is equally important is how much community do you need to prevent shedding to prevent transmissibility to other people and that's the one that I think is really unknown to me is more important not important to the individual but to society to me that's the jugular question that decides what do economies look like when we have subsequent waves of this because that is something on Instagram a few weeks ago where I did a kind of Q&A with my son who's five and he asked a very honest question which is when is this virus going to be gone and it was an interesting discussion to explain to him actually it's never gonna be gone this virus is never going away there is nothing about this virus that suggests it's ever going away and so now the question is how do we coexist with this virus so even putting aside future pandemics which could be much worse for example an increase in the lethality while preserving the transmissibility of SARS

[01:36:58] Co v2 would be devastating but just coping with this if another one never shows up we have to understand this question especially if the vaccines are somewhat risky one thing that doesn't get a lot of discussion is how much risk is going to be posed by vaccines there's a reason they never come up with RSV vaccines it's a lot harder from a safe perspective to make an RSV vaccine unlike an influenza vaccine so if everything is going to be a risk trade-off right and then we're going to decide you might not want to vaccinate everybody with a SARS Co v2 vaccine if the risk is slightly higher than we deem acceptable so then you have to do a cost-benefit analysis and and then to your point which i think is even more important is okay what is the secondary shedding look like what do these other factors look like it's hard for me to imagine a world that's fully functioning without these questions resolved right that's really the key question the other hand though if if he got to a point where there's enough herd immunity or that hundred million turns into six billion people have seen the infection so nobody gets in ammonia anymore it turns into a common cold then there may be a enough of a balance between the virus mutating

[01:38:13] Oertel to become a better common cold and no longer causing the pneumonia me but that's the point it requires a mutation doesn't it Stanley wait we don't have the memory like we do with measles and polio and smallpox to truly generate herd immunity in fact we've never generated herd immunity to influenza commonly in that case of course it's because of the genetic drift and so isn't it a bit of a misnomer to suggest that we could ever have herd immunity to Tsarskoe v2 let's just say if we knew that the immune response was gone after a year the question is what is immune response being gone yeah a sufficient immune response I mean it becomes a sliding scale of efficacy correct yeah yeah yeah that's right but if you have enough immune response to protect you from pneumonia and the question is how much shedding do you have sheep could be actually see when you talk about studies

[01:39:04] I was thinking about this a little while ago the simplest study would be to take some human volunteers give them a common cold coronavirus and then a year later come back and do the exact experience that was done in the 80s measure do they get a cold if you reinfect them in your lady you get a cold and how much shedding do they have no they shed but if you are a naive person the code 1030 wait and now you shed ten to the third and it doesn't matter yeah then it doesn't matter yeah well and of course here so again I completely agree with you that that's the single most important question but the other thing is I don't have my fingers crossed that this is perfect because of that upper respiratory part of this so you said well what if you don't get the severe pneumonia before well it turns out the severe pneumonia that came with SARS one and MERS isn't really what was the problem I mean that was the problem for the individual but that was not the problem versus the problem for society was the upper-respiratory part that's what we're seeing in SARS or the lack thereof and that might be what's making Tsarskoe v2 such a problem yeah anyway Stanley as you can tell who you talk about this for days but I want to honor our commitment to get you out of here in a certain time so I look forward to talking with you again very soon as we continue to work on the project we're working on with David and a group of other really amazing people but thank you for your time in your generosity of insight anything else any last thoughts you have on either this particular pandemic or just coronaviruses in general no I think the key thing we talked about is how do you prevent this in the future we're gonna muddle our way through this one we're going to do we'll get two points I think we will have any virals I hope vaccines with even with the caveats that we talked about that shouldn't work along though work I don't know whether people actually agreed to be vaccinated is another issue we didn't really talk about and then for safety I mean all these things are we're going to know very quickly because we have to do it quickly well that means we're gonna have to talk again okay hey thanks Danny okay thanks people thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription cut and membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally kick-ass comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic pay per person thing we discuss on each episode the word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these monthly AMA episodes are asking me anything episodes hearing these episodes completely access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to squeals like this the qualies which are a super short podcast typically less than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through
