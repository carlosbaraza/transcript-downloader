## Description

Original release date: 10/18/2018

In this five-part series, Thomas Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA, a world-renowned expert in lipidology, and one of Peter’s most important clinical mentors, shares his wealth of knowledge on the subject of lipids. In Part IV, Peter and Tom review the history and current use of drugs to prevent cardiovascular disease. They also discuss why some drugs appear to be more effective than others, an in-depth conversation about niacin, cholesterol and brain health, and the futility of using CKs (creatinine kinase) and liver function tests to identify adverse effects in statins, to name a few topics in this episode.

We discuss:
-Bile acid sequestrants and statins [2:00];
-Ezetimibe (Zetia) [15:00];
-PCSK9 inhibitors [27:30];
-Fibrates [41:00];
-Fish oil, DHA, and EPA [1:01:00];
-Niacin [1:05:15];
-PCSK9 inhibitors [1:23:45];
-Cholesterol, statins, and the brain [1:30:00];
-Elevated creatine kinase (CK) and liver function tests (LFTs) on statins [1:50:30]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Tom Dayspring:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on various lipid-lowering medications and their mechanisms of action. Dr. Dayspring and Dr. Attia discuss statins, ezetimibe (Zetia), PCSK9 inhibitors, fibrates, and niacin. They explore the evolution of lipid-lowering therapy, clinical trials, and the importance of understanding both the benefits and potential risks of these medications. A significant portion focuses on the relationship between statins, cholesterol synthesis, and brain health.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Statins work primarily by enhancing LDL receptor expression and clearance [00:13:08]
- Ezetimibe has dual mechanisms: blocking intestinal cholesterol absorption and preventing hepatic cholesterol reabsorption from bile [00:16:38]
- PCSK9 inhibitors work by prolonging LDL receptor life and enhancing clearance [01:28:31]
- Desmos sterol levels can be used as a biomarker for brain cholesterol synthesis [01:39:35]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider combination therapy with lower-dose statins plus ezetimibe rather than maximum statin doses [01:42:19]
- Monitor desmos sterol levels when using statins [01:43:10]

Risk/Benefit Considerations:
- Cognitive effects of statins may be more pronounced in certain individuals [01:45:49]
- CK elevation alone should not dictate statin therapy decisions [01:51:50]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications discussed:
- Statins (Lipitor, Crestor, Pravastatin) [01:33:05]
- Ezetimibe (Zetia) [00:16:38]
- PCSK9 inhibitors (Repatha, Praluent) [01:23:59]
- Fibrates [00:41:36]
- Niacin [01:06:22]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Desmos sterol as a marker of brain cholesterol synthesis [01:39:35]
- ApoB and LDL particle count as better markers than LDL-C [01:53:37]
- CK and liver function tests not reliable for statin monitoring [01:51:50]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"If you tell me you are a doctor who has prescribed a lot of statins... and you've never seen cognitive impairment in a patient, you're a liar or you're a fool" [01:47:49]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What is the optimal way to monitor statin therapy beyond traditional lipid panels?
- How can we better identify patients at risk for statin-related cognitive effects?
- What role will PCSK9 inhibitors play as they become more affordable and accessible?

This analysis captures the main points of discussion but there was significant additional technical detail in the conversation that would require medical background to fully appreciate.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com

[00:00:40] hi everyone welcome to episode 4 of the week of Dayspring in this episode we cover a lot of drugs we talk about statins we talk about cholesterol regulation we talk about ezetimibe also known as zetia and we talk about the most recent class of drugs introduced to this field a drug a class known as the pcsk9 inhibitors there are two such drugs on the market today we talk about fibrates and we also talk about the use of fish oil niacin or niacinamide side we talked about the role of cholesterol statins and brain health and another thing that I learned was about the futility of using CK's and l.f.t.s to address statin response or ill response so again another great example of how

[00:01:43] I'm doing these shows but I'm learning along the way and so I'm confident that any physician listening at this it's going to learn something and that hopefully this becomes kind of a part of your ongoing medical education so sit back and get ready for episode four so while we're on that topic let's go back and talk about the drug so we just finished with kind of one very niche story but when it became pretty clear that there was an association a strong association frankly between cholesterol and heart disease you now had another target because as you said if you know if we went back in time 50 60 years if you were astute enough you would have your patient stopped smoking you would manage their blood pressure what was the first drug that was specifically brought to market to target cholesterol well niacin has been used that infinitum forever without a lot of data but they knew it changed certain metrics that you were measuring total cholesterol HDL cholesterol and the only form of niacin available back then was immediate release a pretty much intolerable drug for most people but you could find some people who could take the massive doses needed for that so that was around believe it or not when I was coming up and total cholesterol was the only measurable thing and they knew did it if it was 400 or something you are probably in trouble they gave me a mice into those people you might say the antibiotic which interrupted the pedal biliary circulation of cholesterol and it lowered cholesterol anywhere no outcome evidence with it but along came the bile acid sequestrants which we hinted on will make you excrete bile acids which therefore you have to use up your endogenous cholesterol to make new bile acids so you will lower your cholesterol metrics that you're looking at in a man crazy long outcome trial it did seem to work they budged a lot of statistics I think in retrospect on and didn't have the type of sister yell our

[00:03:45] C's yes so there was a little proof that not only what Framingham said is true cholesterol is a risk marker a risk factor depending on how you want to label it by lowering it rule does reduce clinical events to me the tragedy of that is for the next 20 to 30 years the only thing that the pharmacological industry focused on was calash as their metric of that's all we got to do we got to find stuff that lowers cholesterol metrics or improves cholesterol metrics and one or the other direction and biases he questions do raise HDL cholesterol a milligram or two milligrams percent which turns out to have some statistical significance so essentially without any physiologic significance correct and it's a miniscule thing so who knows so that led to just investigation of everything else and all of a sudden this guy discovers a fungus that it's got a property that lowers really potently cholesterol and that was the statin group akiro endo a mycologist over there in Japan who unbelievably has not gotten a Nobel

[00:04:57] Prize yet and there'd be no statins would him bringing it to the table and stuff we found that statins lower LDL cholesterol dramatically pretty low doses they seem to be safe only after lrc the FDA need it was if you got a product it didn't harm anybody and it's lowering LDL cholesterol welcome aboard so several statins got approved starting in 1987 with lovastatin mevacor being the Ferris and came out on the market guys like me who were well into believing yes lowering LDL cholesterol though the only metric we have now and that's good people seem to do better became very aggressive statin people and that story told early where we used to see em eyes like crazy in our heyday we stop seeing them anymore so we had at least anecdotal belief that these things were working and lo and behold farming knew ultimately they're gonna have to do serious outcome trials and the first group of people they studied who were Swedish guys who survived in MI and had an LDL cholesterol of 190 so these patients had ever retrospect their FH patients you know who's got an LDL cholesterol once definition one of the definitions of that page and giving them a dose of simvastatin got your 25 so percent reduction in clinical events so outcome data bingo great drug and right behind them was bristol-myers

[00:06:29] Squibb who had the much weaker statin pravastatin sold originally as the brands of pratical let's study irish men who have not had a clinical event but also their LDL cholesterol is 180-190 some more FH Irish means that you're going from secondary prevention FH basically to primary benefit and lo and behold reduce virtually every effort from do you remember what the n NT was for that group and whether you know something that had to do with the base on butter's down into 20s you know it's very good for both of them they're just a little higher in 4s because they were sicker people I'm surprised the n NT could be that low in primary prevention no it was probably 40 to 50 and west of

[00:07:12] Scotland nobody know is good but these are nightmare primary prevention these were how long were these trials five years six years yeah there were five years some of them went a little longer some a little less but five-year trials you know and so and significant p-values correlated with the LDL cholesterol levels in retrospect ad you know in sub cohorts they did measure April B which shows that this is an important point to make and this is kind of I've learned a lot from you I've learned a lot from Ron

[00:07:39] I've learned a lot from Al and I've learned a lot from everybody in this space but if there's one person who really got me to understand the limitations of clinical trials it's Alan with his long view of this disease you know I've told this story before but Alan's the guy who bought me my very first copy of stories pathology textbook and you know is really the guy that got me looking at these autopsy pictures of kids and realizing hey buddy this disease starts when you're born so the thing that I think most people misunderstand when it comes to lipid-lowering trials is there always handicapped very much there behind a loaded gun which it's pointing directly at them which says we're only going to give you five years to impact the course of a disease that has been going on for 50 years until now you start you take a bunch of 50 year olds and you put them in a trial where you're gonna study them until they're 55 you have five years to try to move the direction of a ship that's been setting its course for 50 years nowadays because of course they would never give you five years to prove anything works you'd have to prove it a lot so that's right I have a miracle drug so that's and we'll talk about the miracle drug which is a pcsk9 inhibitor which there's a few things I enjoy debating with it last but not least that's why you don't put mortality in this equation it takes a long time to die for to improve mortality we're never powered to study mortality I mean it's just meaningless what a lipid modulating drug does to mortality meaningless unless you got a randomized find a 30-year trial then I might say what's wrong yeah yeah I agree completely so i guess i'm sort of humbled by blind luck sometimes which is we look back with the benefit of knowledge so it's not to disparage those that came before us but they didn't have a clue what was going on they didn't have a clue about the complexity and if you think about it so let's go back and talk about statins so statins inhibit hmg-coa reductase that is an enzyme that is prior to the bifurcation of the cholesterol synthetic pathway it's still a flat lipid molecule that's right you inhibit that and we're going to talk about a whole bunch of great things but there was a drug you taught me about a few years ago an esoteric drug that inhibited delta 24 desaturates that drug lowered cholesterol was naming that drug again try paranal try Paran also try Paran all come on since that 24 carbon and it didn't allow you to saturate it did not allow you to turn this master all into cholesterol and so now that's at the very bottom of this pathway and ultimately an ultimate molecule into the ultimate step and all of a sudden you inhibited that with this drug cholesterol levels went down FDA you really go up does master all astral and there was at least a congenital disease called desmos Colossus maybe that I don't know if they even know about that though back then we know about it now that maybe would have been a flag that when you look at so if I recall correctly about three or four years after this drug was approved because this is an era when you could approve a drug just by showing it lowered cholesterol the drug was pulled off the market and atherosclerosis was occurring cataracts were occurring red blood I think and it turns out des mas role turns out to have other roles in divides a potent cell membrane signaling molecule involved with inflammatory pathway so god knows what else you're doing by perturbing des master all levels in cells and stuff you know so you live and learn so there's one endpoint that's getting better another endpoint that you didn't know anything about our biomarker is getting worse and it's probably doing some bad things and therein lies the sort of humility of drug development right which is you've got this synthetic pathway you have at first glance you have two things that are similar a statin which inhibits one enzyme in the pathway this other drug that inhibits another enzyme in the pathway and yet one seems to be okay and one seems to know there's several other cholesterol sync squalling synthesis inhibitors that have failed for one reason or another so it is a mega investment and dismisses are probably far worse where if I say 999 out of a thousand drugs don't come anywhere close to a commercial success it's probably were smaller than that so it seems to me that there's a couple things that the statin had going for it which maybe at the time were and realized the first is it's higher in the food chain meaning it's higher on the synthetic pathway so if you are backing things up that's cover e together less like cholesterol of they'll be more acetyl co a more Osito Osito Co way or whatever the other thing and I don't know if this is true although I've heard it speculated on but truthfully I've never seen the data with my own eyes do statins have selectivity for the liver sure because that would be another unintended benefit right if you deprive the least it's been theorized because the pharmacokinetics of a statin let's face it the real place you want to inhibit cholesterol synthesis is not per se in cells but in the liver because that's this tissue that can up regulate the most LDL receptors to get rid of your LD particles so I'm not really interested in stopping cholesterol synthesis and other tissues in your body because they can get rid of it too in fact in an ideal world you wouldn't want to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in a single tissue outside the liver I mean what if I knew that so is producing other cholesterol even if it was that cell can get rid of it through those other pathways and it would ultimately make its way back to the liver so as long as I can enhance

[00:13:08] LDL receptors by the way which is pretty and primarily the only pathway that's ever worked with drugs to reduce clinical events safely is expressing in one way or another more LDL receptors statins ezetimibe all S&C questions pcsk9 inhibitors it's a very important point to make what you're basically saying is the only drugs that have ever shown to both reduce cholesterol but more importantly reduce events have either been in isolation or in compounds or in combination where they are enhancing clearance pretty much I mean some of them do affect production of the april-b particles a bit but it's mostly enhancing clearance that works so if you can do that safely and only a clinical trial can prove you're not hurting anybody as we shown some trials haven't worked out and I'll make a case for it the niacin trials also and niacin does nothing to an LDL receptor that we know about so if myosins work in a lower a PO

[00:14:02] B which it does it's true other mechanisms not proven to reduce clinical events when they first put statins out there it was known that they were inhibiting cholesterol synthesis did they also understand the effect they were having on the LDL receptors sure and did they understand that that was the primary I I think the even me why they went into that area was the gold steamie Nobel Prize winning publication of the discovery of the brown and

[00:14:29] Goldstein the LDL receptor they nude Wow there's a pathway that if we can enhance its cause over expression and LDL receptor it's probably going to be good so there are hypothesis generating their genetic studies even on the LDL receptor led to and they knew the by elasticity questions refers that's how bile acid sequestrants work they up regulated LDL receptors to bring more cholesterol to the liver so the liver can make more bile salts so let's better LDL receptor expression drugs and statin fella right into that pathway without seemingly disrupting anything else of course pcsk9 works on how does that abide through a less potent pathway but still expresses LDL receptors then do the statins and so they work though is that amides main mechanism of action is in the gut how are you with you on that cuz where I talked about these fentanyl Peter Peter talked about the niemann-pick see one like protein which enhances the absorption of star walls including cholesterol in the guy and that's is that amides main area of action inhibiting that from so you do reduce entry of cholesterol into the entry site but remember cholesterol gets into your liver too and we think how does cholesterol get into your liver because the liver de novo synthesized it or you got all these particles bringing cholesterol back to the liver through the direct and indirect cholesterol transport pathways there's another pathway led which the liver requires cholesterol the liver has an interface with the biliary system and we have always known of course that's how the liver pumps bile salts into the bile that's how the liver is creats free cholesterol it pumps it into the bile which brings it down to your gut but if the liver needs cholesterol in a pinch what is a supersaturated body fluid full of cholesterol in your body your bile super cholesterol rich the liver can pull cholesterol back II flux it so to speak from the bile back into the liver why because what is also expressed to a

[00:16:38] Patou biliary surface the niemann-pick see one like protein so as the other map has two areas where it acts it blocks the intestine from internalizing cholesterol but it prevents the liver from internalizing cholesterol from a biliary source put them both together you're depleting the liver of more cholesterol and the liver needs cholesterol there's a sterile sensor the sterile regulatory element binding protein a lot nuclear transcription fact that it turns on your genes that make they'll reset theirs and so this is interesting top I mean the beauty of doing these podcasts is I'm also learning as we're doing them right so and this is an enormous insight to me that I I now remember you once telling me about this but it was just one of those things where I was like drinking from a firehose and clearly this detail left me my I'm generally not a huge zetia femme zetia or is that a mine I just generally think it's kind of too impotent for real curiosity and sort of reserved it for situations where patients can't really tolerate statins much and can't afford pcsk9 inhibitors and all these things historically the way I've decided on who's a great zetia candidate or not is looking at phytosterols or looking at other proxies or of absorption and I've argued by the way that the trials that suggested zetia were not that valuable in mono therapy it's never been shown to reduce you know they never did a mono therapy clinical trial work if you picked the right person well that was always my argument which was it might have been a mistake in patient selection you didn't select hyper absorbers but what you're saying would suggest that that would dilute my argument right because if it only worked at the niemann-pick see one like one transporter the argument would be target your hyper absorbers but if it also works at biliary cholesterol and it shouldn't matter that much should know but ya know that's part of hyper absorption because remember if you're pulling it back into the liver you're depleting the cholesterol of a pool of cholesterol so that's but is the liver also then going to be a dominant source of where we'll see site Oscar all competitor all etc the final body preservation way god forbid phytosterols make it into your column microns or your

[00:18:52] HDL s and I can make the case that if they ever get into a Cell they're gonna injure that cell but most of the column microns are going to deliver to the liver first before it goes out in a vo the L so the liver will look if you're over absorbing phytosterols a lot of them do make their ways back to the liver and the liver recognize them instantly is using your analogy that stupid bouncer in the intestine let you in that Nieman Peck

[00:19:22] ABC let you win we're getting ready were the backup police no you're the VIP lounge Mel's yeah right so boom out you go again now I realize those dopes may let you in again but you're gonna come right back here and I'm gonna Dan you know the great analogy for the VIP bouncer yeah so who's to say Zetas moms taking out or reducing the functioning of the Niemen and I think it's in both areas Merck knows this Merck didn't want to that's too much education to give let's just tell me blocks cholesterol absorption the gut would make sense to most people most people including lipid ologist don't even know the livers involved in the process so it was like live ants lipid study and stuff we don't have to confuse people with that I've written a number of articles on is that impaired Toth and I think did oral class articles on the mechanisms of it in style yeah what year was that we've got to make sure we later I'm bad with my years but probably 2010 something like 2008 but it's really with great diagrams of course showing you and explaining where niemann-pick is and everything and that's Toth tota certainly mentors in my life and of course Peter and my David

[00:20:41] Sousa had me write the chapter in the book therapeutical apology on phytosterols David says at Northwestern he said University Chicago yeah and look very early on probably because I was just such a good educator on lipids lipoproteins and statin mechanization I was in rarely in mercs investigation of cholesterol absorption and became a very effective educator on that too and and therefore had great contact with a lot of the Merck scientists the Swedes who all invented all these absorption markers and stuff and really became specialties in the pathology and sterols is one of them you know why do you think that the zetia combination simvastatin trials so the main trial with zetia was with and without simvastatin correct No the reason why you said eeeh is that am

[00:21:37] I mistaken so many damn heads is mercs poor thinking of the type of trials that let's bring to market to show that this is a great drug and instead of just doing the damn outcome daddy even doing a select outcome trial in the right person primary prevention as well as of course through your secondary prevention trials even do that first if you want to and if that fails you're not gonna do anything with it but let's they wanted to just get so much to market what's the easiest thing to do

[00:22:05] IMT so let's take people with a lot of carotid intimate Rochelle measurement of the thickness of your carotid artery which has some correlation with subclinical atherosclerosis and clinical events and that's unarguable and therefore they're at risk they have lipid abnormalities let's give them as you know they're on a statin because we have to give them statins if their LDL is that a metric is out of whack let's give them one half of the group is that a mime and the other half placebo is that amide and let's follow their eye empties we only have to do that for a year or two and we'll see I am the progression in one arm and no IMT progression in the other only did that virtually every lipid parameter including April B got better every hand flama Tory Marcus got better any IMT didn't change whatsoever meaning simvastatin have the same IMT as simvastatin in a short time and well of course we now know that what happens to

[00:23:08] IMT with any drug has virtually no relationship the clinical outcomes so that's not a tool you should be using to follow up and saying look at all it's like the coronary calcium score you and it's not the tool you should be using to demonstrate the Africa they should have looked at but look at this April B reduction beyond what's in the statin can do look at the triglyceride reduction look at the CRP reduction beyond what's in the statin or ox ldiot at least say that doesn't mean anything but they had already polluted the mindset IMT was the best words obviously nothing Trump's a heart outcome if you can reduce mase that's the way to go sorry major adverse finish but they picked the wrong shortcut is basically what it comes to man there are better shortcuts you can't who did that turn off big time the images of the world the cardiologist who instantly dismissed the Zetas might as the world's most useless drug most cardiologists don't even know what a poby is and never mind that hey look at this as a potent thing I hinted to us I was very much involved with the raloxifene the first

[00:24:10] CERN that came to the market up as good in April be lowering drug as that am i biz which might have pretended great cardiovascular benefits to the sural oxen which I believe it still has in fact we have some they did a big cardiovascular outcome trial where was no didn't hurt anybody but it didn't reduce events but if you looked at the primary prevention people in their trial it did lower events now post hoc hypothesis generating data but an eight percent a five percent lowering of April

[00:24:41] B mattered and I think the right trial done what is that a might been outcomes it would matter but we're never gonna know and this gets to a really interesting point when it comes to Pharma's challenge of studying atherosclerosis today the industry is now going to always be a victim of the success of statins it is unethical to take high-risk patients and take them off statins despite what the internet wants to tell you that statins are evil and all that nonsense which I don't want to get into but if you actually have any modest understanding of how these drugs work they absolutely save lives especially when directed at the right patients at the right times what that means is you want to study another drug you're adding it to a statin you are not doing it in mono you know that you don't get to do the study of zetia versus placebo it's not ethical no if you've picked the right page do you think of a reason it would be ethical to do such a trial yes you take a bunch of highly highly statin intolerance so that would be one which they're never gonna do for a variety of reasons but here's another in Merck did two big outcome trials where they could use you didn't necessarily have to give a patient a statin they took people with significant a or text enosis and well the belief because haters calcium and his cholesterol in those aortic valves that if we could lower cholesterol in people with aortic stenosis Reed reproduce morbidity related to that and we don't have to give him a statin cuz statins failed to reduce outcomes in people with aortic Stowe's trials were already done so they took the C's trial he ordered stenosis ezetimibe and lowered it and guess wha did nothing to end points related cuz they're enrolling people that kind of stuff just it breaks my heart it doesn't anger me it breaks but if you're in post hoc analysis they did reduce ischemic events in that trial what is that am I so M eyes went down and Jonah went down but that's post hoc got lucky in power for that no they may or may not be legit correct so you'd have to do another whole trial to do that again so but they were hoping to speak by without doing and the next thing they did was statins had failed to reduce current events and people with chronic renal failure statins didn't work so let's give him a statin plus ezetimibe so you had the

[00:27:09] Sharpe trial renal they had pretty bad GF ours so everybody two groups got a statin but the one group got a statin in his that amide and the statins out of my group reduced events wasn't so there were but at statin ezetimibe works yep so and then of course they really had a wait for the acute coronary syndrome tylium pro-v trial to really convince the cardiologists that yes a little bit of extra be lowering at least in that type of horrendously risky people matters and we now have had that replicated with the pcsk9 in him and a great point you made up lately

[00:27:46] I mean customer God knows how long the money to do that improve at trial and they really had extended a couple of extra years to reach the testicle significance which turns somebody's loudmouths on the internet dismiss it because of that now but it's a miracle and people that are aggressively treated with statin yet you've reduced their LDL see to way way down that just by lowering it a little bit more you can get extra event reduction and I would never downplay that I think it's miraculous that it worked and I think it's why it's miraculous pcsk9 inhibitors work in trials where they're enrolling you where your LDL see a 70 for God's sakes cuz you're on a statin or statin so that to me is one of the single most impressive things and again we don't know if this is going to be true in ten years again all facts have a half-life but from the moment we are sitting here today having this discussion the fact that the fourier trial could take patients who had an average ldlc of 92 milligrams per deciliter on statins that means they are at the 10th percentile of the Framingham population on a statin you are gonna add either a placebo or a pcsk9 inhibitor in that case it was repatha you're gonna study them for less than two and a half years and you're gonna even have the nerve to suggest that might reduce an event and oh it did and if it doesn't you've just wasted billions of dollars of our money what bean-counter allowed that trial to proceed is I was I mean I had been following this story even before I became interested in lipids just out of interest in the sort of the novelty of you see a natural experiment which is pcsk9 hyper functionings pcsk9 hypo functionings mr drug it just became a beautiful elegant model and then I remember in real life takes decades to the stress itself and this all took a decade and I remember thinking especially once I got interested in lipids on the one hand being excited and the other in thinking there's no goddamn way this trial can work you could not reduce events in 2.2 years and they did and of course this is how naive I am and this is why whenever people ask me for advice friends will say hey should I invest in this company or that company my advice to them is don't listen to a single thing I say because you're asking a question will the market value something which I have no input on I can provide you plenty of you know input on whether it makes scientific sense but you have to talk to somebody with a different skill set to understand if that's an investable thesis and so I remember Amgen kind of got hammered when the trial came out because people thought that wasn't enough of an improvement at which I thought it's amazing and an in reality in fairness to the market I think what the market was basically saying is if you did the math based on that trial under those circumstances it would be you know a million dollars or more to save a life well that's a fair question for the market to assess but if you look at it from a scientific standpoint that you could take that patient population and achieve that outcome I think it's one of the most remarkable things in cardiovascular medicine and to your point it doesn't even speak to the patients that I have on pcsk9 inhibitors my patients who take pcsk9 inhibitors are patients whom prior to this drug we were flailing with what may be some niacin maybe some mono therapy zetia may be the smallest dose of livello that a human could tolerate and getting woefully inadequate coverage as you know you're doing that off FDA label because they would want to know who can now afford it but it's certainly the genetic model tells them you're doing smart there and what other option is to and I would say as you know there are certain nutritional therapies that can send your LDL particle count off the roof and people are dismissing that as a meaningless biomarker now because if you do this diet biomarkers XY and Z and maybe even your waistline looks better but april-b olio P doesn't matter in them every single thing that's ever been done genetically or properly done clinical trial shows it does matter and an individual can I say yes it matters in you it does not no but if I want to follow the bulk of the data it matters over time so maybe if I send your LDL P off the chart for two years it doesn't matter but do I want to do this for the next 15 years if you're a young person on a type of nutritional program that sends that through the roof is that wise how are you gonna be mad at me in 20 years or 15 years because I put you in the CCU

[00:32:23] I don't know yeah how many Nobel Prizes have been awarded within the field of lipid science at least three right well certainly you got the LDL receptor and you got two for cholesterol and I'm guarantee on other lipid things or might be I'm not a noble historian no but it's interesting right I mean I think this is one of the things that I guess there are a handful of discussions

[00:32:47] I have with patients that I find frustrating some of them are frustrating because I have the same discussion over and over again and I've written about the topic and the patient just won't read what I've at least written or at least take the time to read or listen to a lecture to then come back and ask a question so that's that's sort of frustrating for a different reason but few things frustrate me more than having to discuss things where the patient's baseline of knowledge is the internet which obviously you have all the signal can be found there but the noise of course is so great that you know you just don't know but it's these discussions around cholesterol and statins that I find most disturbing because in some ways it's partly the fault of the pharma industry I think they have to take some responsibility for this which is in an effort to get these drugs into the majority of people who need them there's been a need to simplify the message and when you simplify things especially things as complicated as this field you will undoubtedly make mistakes you will undoubtedly create confusion and so now we have a system where most physicians don't understand enough to actually explain to their patients why they are putting them on statins and which patients may or may not even be good statin candidates something I want to come back to because you brought it up and I think it's it's worthy of its own sort of thread that us that will go down which is this whole brain issue that's totally separate issue but it's this idea of failing to educate patients and physicians has allowed basically a I don't know call it a militia of Internet noise that is just completely ungrounded in science I mean it's just completely ungrate it's completely disconnected and you already mentioned one example in several others where a drug has come to market and then some harm and develop it so therefore you castigate every drug whatever and invented as AHA even though even though we just illustrated right you can take two drugs that inhibit two enzymes and get completely different results shame results aisle marker bit different outcomes and so I always try to tell patients hello I don't that probably falls on deaf ears but you got to think of every drug like you think of a tool alright you you if you had a general contractor and he had a hammer a screwdriver a drill a level a nail a screw et cetera you would want to have the most tools in the tool belt that's the first condition and the second condition is you'd want to know when to use each tool and what its limitation was and in that sense the one of you which is statins should be in the drinking water and then the other view which is statins cause everything from diabetes Alzheimer's disease to global warming both of those views are so idiotic that I just it's very difficult for me to process that and I've basically stopped engaging on Twitter with any of that discussion you can't even either extreme you got to get rid of those people very quickly or you just get annoyed all day long and this is why it Altima comes down turn it's the way you practice so you gotta individualize everything so anybody who says statins belong in the drinking water that's no public health solution to anything or nobody should ever take that's absurd statins have tongues appropriate you got to pick and choose your patients properly and this is why in the latter part of my career I've developed so much more into biomarkers and other risk assessment tools because the better we can define an individual's risk to any disease that he might be prone to we can attack that disease through many mechanisms part of an athlete others you got to attack april-b if you don't good luck but the more you understand that's where biomarkers and really not understanding the only on the soudanese pathways you need token a lot more clinical chemistry the average clinician has no clue how a laboratory reports a given concentration of anything to them I'd like to go into triglycerides because everybody's thinks the whole world people have no clue how laboratories assay triglycerides and maybe later we can one of the things

[00:36:58] I've been pleased with is once I got back into medicine I realized I didn't know that stuff and I have been really fortunate every lab I have reached out to to come and actually come to the lab and see how it works including THD they've all opened the doors and said come on in Peter oh no happy and they overdo it I love it they literally will walk me from every station to every this is where the specimen arrives so you can see where the FedEx box dumps off the specimen this is how we take it out this is how it's handled this is boom boom all the way to here the magnets where we're doing the NMR and I've and I've got precision analytics has also been great I went up and spent two days with them a few years ago and I agree I mean again not every physician I think has the luxury of time because they're clinically so much busier than I am so I don't I certainly don't fault physicians for not doing that but I do wish there is a way to make that sort of experience more available to physicians because the more you understand how these tests are done the more you understand what your blind spots can be yeah and I was doing that for a while when I had more of a net presence with full lectures which I don't do anymore or they're not available on the net anymore but just one other thing like I told most people are clueless that labs don't measure triglycerides they measure glycerol in your blood nice calculate that into triglycerides but when you get an LDL cholesterol or total let's talk about

[00:38:20] LDL cholesterol the assay that's analyzing the stirol' in that particle has no difference does it know whether it's site Austral camp Estoril des Mastro cholesterol no all it knows is it's a sterile so just understand when you get a LDL Clint it's even may don't measure a Stan all to but they would likely be a small part of it so LDL cholesterol is really LDL cholesterol plus LDL site Australis any other forty eight and a little bit of whatever stanols got to may have made their way into your body too so they don't know that so in a person would phytosterols me a large part of that LDL cholesterol value is a here's the fight up there yeah so but they don't realize so they don't even know could and Zetas might have a bit if phytosterols are injurious and I can make that case I would if I did on one hour electrically using proper slides you would be pretty convinced I want phytosterols not in my body as Etta my biz the only way to keep them out there and wherever you're going next up my final word on is etem I'd would be if you're a big believer in this reverse cholesterol transport process which I've certainly expanded on now what is the number one pharmacologic agent that increases the amount of cholesterol it's winding up in your toilet bowl because it's in your stool at best reverse cholesterol transport because the final common pathway to reverse cholesterol transport is it's out of the body acetamide by far so I can make the case that if I wanted a lipid lowering drug in the drinking water his first line it would be as etem i'm not a statin you know so very interesting and very controversial and the fda would put me in a lunatic asylum and so with these so-called evidence-based guys but if you're analyzing this from cholesterol homeostatic pathways it's a great drug yeah well we'll come back to all drugs

[00:40:23] I guess the necklace and we do have to lower April be a lot more than is that amide could ever do by itself so the one that we've left out before we get I want to come back to niacin from a trials perspective but let's take a break right now and then we'll come back and we'll pick it up with well I want to talk about the fibrates and then obviously want to talk about niacin through a clinical trial standpoint and then we'll get into the pcsk9 so we'll take a break right now and we will come back okay guys so we are now back we're going to slice this beginning into where we finished off so we had sort of more or less finished talking about ezetimibe also known as zetia so we use this an opportunity to go into the next drug so alright so Tom that was pretty pretty insightful stuff on zetia also known as ezetimibe let's move to another class of drugs that doesn't get a lot of use I can probably count on two hands the number of times I've prescribed it which is Fenna fibrate or more broadly its classify braids what the heck are these drugs how do they work and when should we use them well if you practice in the

[00:41:36] United States you do have two choices you have Fino fibrate and you have gem fib rizal and they're both out there they're both can be attained generically nowadays so probably phenyl fiber it still comes in brand-new forms don't have to that's one of them there are other branded forms available out there

[00:41:55] Jim free Brazil is a prodrug it has to be converted into the active fabric acid whereas phenyl fibrate is the active form right away so sevilla are more bioavailable than it it's kind of interesting for the purists of the world Jim fib Rizal has a mono therapy outcome trial given to veterans with coronary artery disease who had low HDL cholesterol high triglycerides and it reduced events as much as a statin did in any trial so there's outcome evidence is independent of triglyceride level yeah it was independent although they enrolled people but there's some many of the men do triglyceride levels were certainly not at super super high levels or so but it was mostly low HDL cholesterol and virtually all of those people have some degree of triglyceride elevation but they tried to recruit people with what at the time was considered a normal LDL cholesterol so this trial was this is called the

[00:42:53] Veterans Affairs high density lipoprotein trophy yeah yeah and that was Jim febris all I remember Jim Thurber has already had outcome data from the Helsinki heart trial too so this would be the second trial now phenol fibrate did come along with a couple of big trials but it missed the primary outcome but hits some secondary outcomes for a whole lot of reasons and rolling wrong people heavy concomitant use of statins nobody in any gym febrile trial was ever polluted by people sneaking in statins with it at the same time and clearly whatever fibrates do they do it differently than statins and the question is can it contribute to a statin but those trials weren't designed to do that but they were so polluted by statin use and I just want to clarify what you mean I know what you mean but I want the listener to understand when you say polluted by what we're talking about is statins are so potent that when you include them in trials you are making it much harder for a new drug or compound that's being investigated to show its effect because you've effectively raised the bar much higher for what needs to be done sure you've taken out one path you're trying to prove with a certain class of drug that via these mechanisms very divin it works and then all of a sudden you're getting rid of all the apob particles via the statins yeah given in a randomized fashion here somebody takes it somebody don't some boxes you take this don't take it yeah so that's the bigger problem scientifically of course the counter-argument is look ethically we don't want someone getting randomized to no medication and then the second issue is if the statin is the standard of care and therefore in the community quote unquote that's the way these drugs are going to be used is with or without statins that's the way they should be tested so it's all these are fair points but when you ask a true efficacy question versus an effectiveness question the cleaner you can ask that question the better and there's no cleaner way to ask it than to not have another drug involved sure and by the way when those trials were done it was not standard of care that you had to be on a statin oh yes so they were legitimate trials that were ethical whereas with the pcsk9 trials it was net here you wouldn't have a no statin arm in those right that being said these are all factors that go into the postdoc at least interpretation of some of these trials but anyway so Jim femoris all worked and it's kind of interesting you couldn't explain the benefit of Jim free

[00:45:19] Brazil in the VA hit trial but even though it did raise HDL cholesterol is like a milligram and a half increase and it lower triglycerides but not to a significant extent so why did it work were there other growth effects of fibrates or doing something that we weren't measuring with any biomarker so and I mean some of that is probably true but then they didn't at least in a cohort of it they did a post hoc analysis using NMR and this was Jim out folks who did this and he found out that the benefit of the Jim febris all in the vieja trial could be easily explained by what it did to LDL particle count which fibrates do lower in certain patients depending on the cause etre and it raised the HDL particles which had a statistically significant tie-in to the clinical endpoint and that was the first trial showing anything that raising an

[00:46:19] HDL metric in a clinical trial maybe if you want to do an HDL metric hits HDL particle count so can we make sense of that in light of what we spoke about I don't know 20 30 minutes ago which was raising HDL cholesterol without paying any attention to particle number of particle size is so noisy and at least as likely to be counterproductive as it is productive here you had two pieces of information of the three at least which is you had more particles you didn't change the cholesterol content in total so you could make some inference again it's not necessarily correct but you could at least have a better guess that you could make about the clearance of cholesterol through HDL but of course then you have to make an assumption about the size of the particle correct yeah but very interesting in an NMR analysis whereas HDL particle went up it was almost all small HDL particles and for years people have been running around saying the small age heels are bad eh deals are good there was serious evidence at boy what BS that is so fibrates helped eliminate HDL particles so if you're any ol school a hey you're increasing reverse cholesterol transport because the fibrates up regulate the scavenger receptor be one which we clip and hit your HDL so of course your HCL's would become smaller and then a small HD else could theoretically go back traverse into the arterial wall pull cholesterol out of your sterile Leyden foam cells the histopathologic mark or the plaque a thorough genesis and by the way and aside further and when we talked about the complexities of the reverse cholesterol transport process one pathway I didn't mention it's a sub sub pathway Sutton called Dan radar coined this term years ago macrophage reverse cholesterol transport and he used to make the case the only aspect of the RCT that matters as far as a thorough attic clinical outcomes is deliberating the phone cells in your artery wall of cholesterol and that's really the job of an HDL that can get into the artery wall very there's another ABC that facilitates there's a couple of them there's ABC a1 which will lipid 8 small lipid poor HDL particles but there's ABC g1 which will lipid a big mature HDL particles so you have to ABC sterile e flux transporters in the surface of macrophages that can pull cholesterol a flux cholesterol out of the macrophage into a big or a small HDL which can then return to the plasma and the small one is sterilized it becomes a mature one and gives it to LDL which returns it to the liver so macrophage RCT which is certainly an incredibly functional aspect of what HDL does has absolutely no relationships to the serum HDL cholesterol level so again how do I know

[00:49:15] I can't use hdl-c as a metric to tell me I'm deliberating plaque in your artery walls ivory that's one of the things I'm doing if you do have plaque in your artery walls and you know now so why do you think the fibrates work best in patients with a higher triglyceride level because their main mechanism of that looked so they modulate HDL particles but triglycerides and has a lot to do with HDL remodelling too but fibrates mostly stop the synthesis of the LDL particles triglyceride rich LDL particles in the liver by depleting triglyceride pools in the liver remember what determines the lipid ation of april-b in your liver all humans make 2 tons more of a poby than they ever have a prayer of lipid aiding and changing into an April B particle the vast majority of your April begets catabolized because it's unused so people are so what producers increase

[00:50:16] April be nothing you your liver makes way more April beat in any human can ever use why do we think that is I don't know people just assume hey if you're making too much a Sutton you got to be increasing the components one component we make too much of and never use is April B yeah I just I wonder why that teleologically would be the case that we would make orders of magnitude more apoB than we could ever want to export a beta lipoprotein e Mia's death so you have to make both the particles they transport energy they transport phospholipids they transport fat soluble vitamins the big particles so you can't not have april-b particles so I think it's just a margin of safety that is so big it's not even oh yeah they just make far more than we ever use so it's very easily catabolized so you have a lot of it but what determines the creation of the Veolia particle in the liver it's the lipid pools how much lipid is available to attach to April B and create a circular spherical particle it's going to be ejected by the liver and that comes down to the cholesterol pool and the triglyceride pool that's in that triglyceride is the stored energy in your liver and cholesterol esters the stored cholesterol in your liver cholesterol I think I mentioned before binds to the cholesterol ester binds to the or free cholesterol binds to the a poby first some of the cholesterol will be esterified even in the circulation some in the liver via that a cat enzyme and soda and once you get the little primordial spherical VLDL then triglycerides are transferred in using em TTP microsomal truck let's write transfer protein and now you got a real

[00:52:05] VLDL ready to be shipped out other as it passes through something called the space of dis which is a little space between hepatocyte s-- and the plasma of other april proteins join there but believe it or not many of them as soon as that nascent VLDL or whatever you want to call it enters plasma a ton of the april proteins just leave your HDL particles one of the functions of eight shells remember I told you transport proteins they transport a ton of these proteins that are involved with lipoprotein catabolism so c2 jumps off of HDL z jumps off of HDL and goes right on to the surface of a VLDL if it was not put there as it passed through the space of dis so and they all determine the catabolic feted ad v LDL particle so vibrates through several mechanisms one you get is an enzyme involved with the synthesis of triglycerides you know it's adding fatty acids to glycerol fibrates are a potent inhibitor of that so you use you just stop triglyceride production with fibrates omega-3 fatty acids work in a similar way so they deplete the hepatic pool of triglycerides and you're gonna make less

[00:53:19] VOD l particles I remember a fiber he's not gonna blow away your LDL P like a statin does but it's gonna blob a 10-15 percent reduction in part depending on the triglyceride richness not the serum triglyceride level but the Tri goes from the richness of the core so that's one of the now where's the backup of free fatty acids because at some point if you're not synthesizing as much triglyceride but you still have you still have enough fatty I said you're absorbing fatty acid you're adipocytes

[00:53:51] Thor I'm you know but is there a hepatic backup of fatty acids well do novo synthesis so in other words this would not decrease novel D if you had a patient because because at first blush you'd think well if fibrates should be able to reduce fatty acid Oh to reduce that it's thought that for years but it's just never been proven in a trial that that alone would do it whereas ezetimibe has more data on reducing fatty liver than a fibrates though and most people all blame fatty liver on triglycerides it's a sterols that really caused a large part of the lippo toxicity that results in injury to the cells in your liver and there's a lot of animal that on acetamide eradicating fatty liver because they deplete the cholesterol pool in the liver so it's not all fatty acids and triglycerides that are causing fatty liver sounds like it is but if that's a toxic disease tool it's a Lippo toxic disease and it's not all fatty acids although the fatty acids must play a significant role when you look at I shouldn't say must but would suggest it because when you look at some of the preliminary data now that's coming out with fructose elimination meaning without restricting any other macro or micro you know not it doesn't matter about seems that glucose is not that relevant even fatty acid composition not that relevant if you completely restrict fructose Oh frog dose is a major stimulus for synthesis of a triglyceride but not not to my knowledge I don't know where it would fit into the cholesterol synthetic pathway right but look it's a lippo toxic disease but one of the major lipids that's causing hepatocellular toxicity is cholesterol it's just not all fatty acids I'm not implying there no role of fatty acids or fatty acid synthesis triglyceride synthesis related to fructose yeah but it's not all just somehow ignore cholesterol and you're going to get rid of fatty liver and you can't even separate the two because if you have a lot of triglyceride you're gonna have a lot of april-b particles that are the cause that's probably the bigger issue is very difficult to disaggregate them once triglycerides are elevated so really the ideal candidate for FINA fibrate is going to be with an elevated apob and an elevated triglyceride if you take the two positive gym flippers all trials and the failure of phenol fibrate in a couple of trials easily explained if you look at things but if you do look in me and basically they enroll people who didn't have in so resistance your triglyceride rich lipoproteins and gave him a fiber e said he designed a clinical trial where nobody in their right mind would ever give that person if I break for a bunch of reasons hey but they were diabetic but and that was they were diabetic yeah field trial is on two percent diabetics and so they figure it's a no brainer fibrates because of so many things that they do will improve outcomes and then maybe they would have but the field trial was so polluted by statin unauthorized use of statins inappropriate use of statins remember you're in a clinical trial you got the trial is watching you but you're going to your own private doctor he can and they were nervous at the time because the statin data was coming in and it was almost it was getting to the point where you're a bad doctor if you don't give a statin to somebody with a lipid disorder so they said I know you're in a trial we don't know what you're getting but I'm sorry I'm I'm not happy with your LDL cholesterol take a statin so it can

[00:57:25] Tammany you know we can always guess if we could have kept it as a pure trial of fiber but it worked in diabetics but you know that's just opinion didn't work but it did work in everybody who had an increase in triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol it worked in that's where the outcome reduction was very interesting which no little if the drug has ever done it reduced several microvascular endpoints in those trials to retinopathy amputations peripheral neuropathy renal disease even though you know fiber can raise creatinine a little bit GFR improved and renal outcomes improved so what other drug you got you can give a person at the real essence this chance of a diabetic retinopathy if he's a diabetic nothing now it's post hoc its secondary well that wasn't it was secondary outcomes the trials weren't designed to prove that so they were a hypothesis you'd have to fear it I couldn't go back and do that before the FDA would ever get approval by kind of interesting data so

[00:58:33] I was made the case what fibrates reduce amputations neuropathic ulcers improve renal disease save your eyes why the hell are you not on a vibrator if you're a diabetic you know so again using that type of data and people use drugs for far less data than that these are big huge trials and all of those endpoints have published their analysis of those secondary endpoints and have one of the main side effects of you know fiber not a heck of a lot you know it's a pretty well tolerated drug anybody can get any number of any side effects with it herself people used to be afraid of the increasing creatinine until in the field trial there and a large number of patients were doing creatinine Claire and Senedd didn't go so there was a muscular build up with cracking had nothing to do with it

[00:59:24] CFR or renal clearance of it yeah nothing much there are some drug drug interactions afina fiber is that am i I mean they're both very well tolerated certainly more tolerated than statins they really are and you can make the cases at least in a diabetic which is probably going to be especially with what we know now the patient was gonna wind up on a farm now most Leppa dollars wouldn't use it into you statin I somebody or statin eyes them as etem eyes them got their April be as good as you can yet it's still not there or triglycerides which is what they're looking at too bad in my mom but they look at that it's still high that is the persons that were helped as at least in post hoc analysis of every single fiber a trial including a VA hit there and all the pheno fiber II trials so that's pretty much where it's reserved to people with these identifiable hypertriglyceridemia patients or so and we're not talking about people with triglycerides of 400 or 4,000 where pancreatitis comes into play we don't probably all use a fiber aid a lot of other stuff there like omega-3 is there on hopefulness that it would reduce the incidence of pancreatitis and proving yep you would attack that degree of hypertriglyceridemia but the real world is people with triglycerides between 130 and 300 that insulin-resistant world which we've already clearly defined as an April B disorder so that's why you statin ezetimibe is your first line drugs there but if you didn't normalize that with your status that new Zetas my Boren D triglycerides were still high so you're presuming there's still our triglyceride rich lipoproteins whatever they may be they might be remnants they could be LDL zero triglyceride rich especially in the lipid ology community who are way more familiar with fibrates although it's sadly a disappearing drug that even younger lipid ologist come on board have never been taught anything about mentos

[01:01:26] Quebec and Rudy so it's the older guys so I'm a who grew up through all those trials have lectured on have written on him really have a better understanding of it and a younger lipid ologist and that's unfortunate because we're gonna have a potentially effective drug for a certain amount of people is just not gonna be used anymore they're apt to use a fish oil instead which because it lowers triglycerides and it's so easy to tell somebody to take a fish oil they're not gonna go home and read potentially scary stuff on the internet where they might what a vibrator so they're gonna still read it yeah I guess on everything you're gonna read some crazy stuff on the internet so tragically to me because

[01:02:05] I don't believe there and when you say fish oil is it more the EPA that's having the effect on triglyceride API would have more effect on April B but DHA is the triglyceride use of some recent brand new data publish on that because the DHA is just more potent on c3 than is EPA so I personally think you ought to give both if the primary reason you're gonna throw a fish oil a prescription fish oil product that somebody is I need extra April be lowering yeah then I would give high-dose EPA but I monitor omega-3 levels in every body so not everybody can convert epa to DHA DHA is just as crucial for a lot of reasons your brain sure once it so I will measure oh my god I'm giving you a lot of EPA but you're one of the people who can't convert it to DHA so then I would be some DHA yeah or you take the high strength EPA and you throw in a lesser strength epa DHA combo table which is how you get a choice I know there's no

[01:03:06] DHA only tablet where is EPA only tablets certainly in the prescription realm so you know fine if you want to lower April B you can stick with your equally but I don't have where's my evidence that if I used whatever fish oil therapy want to use I'm happy I'm improving micro vascular disease I have pretty serious evidence that I'm doing that at least with phyno vibrate and the other thing although they're both available generically sometimes these old truck comes to force Jim fib Rizal on you the real reason when you ask me are there any side effects about vibrates and I did say the word drug interactions phenyl vibrate has a serious drug interaction with coumadin so you have to lessen the cumin in dose there we're using a lot less these days so that's becoming less of a big worry but God forbid somebody's on cumin and you didn't know that you through big dose phenyl vibrator be corn you know put a lot of bruises because you know you potentiate the anticoagulant gem fib

[01:04:08] Rizzo low has her raises statin levels through the roof so there's much more incidents of Myositis and rhabdomyolysis when you use gym fib Rizal with a statin and there's none of it with phenyl fibrate so if you want to use a vibrator I strongly encourage it because it is generic nowadays to to use phenyl fibrate because you're gonna be using it with a statin in the vast majority cases so you don't have that worry the muscular worry or so so those are two big things you better know about fibrates you don't and so most of the lipid I'll just release we're somewhat schooled on fibrates are gonna use it in people where the triglyceride parameter is still high because they're assuming I think if we had better metrics of triglyceride rich lipoproteins maybe VLDL remnants or people who have high LDL tried

[01:05:02] Cerreta levels and they would likely be people who have a possi 3 on their LDLs we have some other evidence that I want to fibrate on board you or so so that's where that's gonna get used but that's not your average person who walks into and if he walks into the average doctor Doc's gonna be chasing LDL cholesterol their non HDL cholesterol if they're a little more astute and they're gonna stop there I want to come back to I made a note here to come back to VLDL remnants so I went to I got a another question on that but I do want to finish our tour of drugs so the next drug to then get into we've already kind of talked about a little bit but I want to come back to it because I know you have a strong point of view on it and I gotta be honest I'm a little bit ambivalent I don't know the last time I prescribed this drug but just from an intellectual standpoint I'm always interested in these drugs for people who can't go down a mainstream route and that drug of course is nice and so I don't think there's anybody out there that says hey nice and his first line I don't think anybody would argue that I think the question is you take a statin intolerant patient who's got normal triglycerides who maybe doesn't respond particularly well to mono therapy zetia who can't afford a pcsk9 inhibitor and doesn't meet the regs for approval are these patients who should be uh nice and so

[01:06:22] I'll go back to where we were earlier nice and exist an immediate release in an any time release form two types of time release form so I didn't even realize that intermediate release and sustained zone is spam the Abbott version of the media in Jerusalem that's a prescription only product which you're not going to get covered by it no no I learned that the hard way because I had a patient that was on it a few years ago and he got a bill for like they wanted $3,000 if you want to you somehow believe in nice I don't want to give it a trial immediate release and you got over three four times a day at massive doses you'll flush your brains out most people you're gonna make because you're not flushing nice and isn't working in you okay so let's talk about what the sustained-release is cheap you can get sustained-release but the biggest problem was in clinical trials niacin being a toxic it is there's way more hepatotoxicity with sustained-release myosin than there is with the short release or the extended release where there's no toxicity so first of all niacin became interesting as you talked about because it's known it's been known for a long period of time it lowers cholesterol lowered LDL cholesterol yeah and better yet raised HDL cholesterol that's what everybody always focus on everybody since low HDL cholesterol is a risk factor who we now know april-b related but whatever therefore if low HDL cholesterol is bad raising HL cholesterol has to be good and niacin is the best product you had at the time and then so trials were done with knives in and it's kind of funny because I listened to the podcast you and Ron

[01:07:59] Krause did and it was kind of cool because you made the case a little bit for nice and Ron did but at the end as you just said you're ambivalent to it in riemann Ron says I don't use it much anymore and then you maybe wind-ups okay it's a fourth line drug if everything else has failed all right I'm not gonna smack you around too much if you say that can't prescribe a pcsk9 inhibitor cuz of course all right but I think at the end of your go back and listen to you boast admitting you don't use the darn drug anymore I think the difference is and this is where I'd love to hear your take I think Ron's point of view was the niacin trials may have failed for the same reason that we would see the discussions we talked about earlier which was overly statin eyes patients now you kind of had a different point of view on that right no because there was never they weren't statin ice in any it certainly the big nice and has one trial designed to use niacin as a mono therapy it was that big coronary drug project which was a multi-pronged therapeutic trial where they randomized people to a bunch of drugs one group was given solely thyroid hormone thyroid hormone lowers LDL cholesterol and all they did was killed people by with coronary disease you give them thyroid hormone they're not not exactly good if you have coronary or so that drug failed they used a primitive phi break low vibrate and there was some question of immortality adversity there so that was hit number one on the whole foot nobody and

[01:09:29] Arcas uses coal fibrate anymore it's probably still available in Europe I don't think anybody uses it so vibrate ARMA that trial failed and they used estrogen given to men because hey women don't get heart disease because they have high estrogen levels if we just gave estrogen to men they wouldn't get heart attacks and they had immediately stopped the trial about precipitating heart attacks in men by prescribing estrogen so the only thing that would make that funnier was please tell me they gave it orally they did not the only form they had anyway so yes and then they had a niacin immediate-release niacin arm and now you know in a clinical trial world if you go down to the FDA and you just put a drug through a clinical trial you better be empowered or better not have been much toxicity and you better come in and have hit your primary endpoint because what will the

[01:10:27] FDA never ever allow you to discuss a secondary endpoint if you fail the primary endpoint you have failed drug all you've done by improving some secondary endpoint is generated in new hypothesis let's go back and do a trial on those people so what was the primary endpoint in the coronary drug project the favorite endpoint that people today love mortality and guess what nice and get the mortality it worsened it not statistically but it you could say it was no but it was certainly going in the wrong direction so did I care when they did the secondary analysis that but wait a minute myocardial infarctions were down there's like me telling you in that aortic stenosis trial but hey zhenya reduce by Carl infarctions but it didn't reduce the order that's but in fairness was the trial powered for mortality or was it powered from look this doesn't know who's powered mortality was the end the only endpoint and all the arms that are straddles that's what they were looking back at then all cause mortality or coronary more now it's not cause mortality I don't know it's kind of amazing because I mean that's very I'm talking about a trial in the 1960s you know the early trophy you know what how they picked endpoints and stuff but nice so don't come and preach to me that it hit secondary endpoint wait a second wait a second why is it that niacin failed this trial in the 60s and it was only three or four years ago that the basically the payer said we're no longer paying for it I'll be because we've had a lot of other trial data that's come down since then where other types of niacin and probably better designed trials also failed to reduce any endpoints so the evidence became overwhelming show me a damn trial where it works and then maybe we'll give you will pay for it at least the FDA would never give it an indication without primary endpoint that or so then the other thing they did with that coronary drug project is they published like 1012 years later the most ridiculous post hoc analysis done on question e or sent to people who they could round up who they discovered you you were in the original trial small number and lo and behold mortality was improved in that group of people coronary mortality so there we have evidence that niacin improves coronary mortality this election by it's the worst it wouldn't even be published today it would be laughed at if you ever submitted it to a journal the coroner a drug project might I don't think a drug company would even send the carnage or project to a journal nowadays

[01:13:02] I mean they almost have to nowadays no trials they tries to hide them in the end but you know it get publish and thank God it did so we learned a lot about a lot of drugs in that trial so there was no evidence in a trial designed to prove nice and reduce coronary heart disease at least the level one evidence then of course guy said well angiography got introduced and they could start doing regular angiograms on called quantitative angiogram where you're basically looking at the lumen of an artery and seeing how much plaque may be extruding into the lumen you're doing nothing to what plaque may be this thing in the coronary artery walls and in that trial using quantitative angiography they did see a statistically significant improvement in the lumen of arteries in people with coronary artery disease who took nice and that's the hats it's a small well under a hundred people giving niacin no statins or anything and they come to this inclusion was a 90 percent event reduction not only did we see a fraction of a millimeter increase in the lumen and by the way at that rate it would have taken you 200 years to open up the artery seriously to hemodynamic blood flow but in mr. moko heart and a trial absolutely not empowered to look at clinical outcomes there were less coronary events in this trial and that got extrapolated through a lot of disingenuous marketing of people saying oh oh look at this nothing ever gives you that type of outcome reduction in nice and ninety percent event reduction in or a bunch of I'm sorry just make sure I understand that but I I'm actually not even familiar with the hatch trial so this had a hundred subjects in it yeah 50 in each arms a one to one randomization note I think they just did angiograms of people and they put him on niacin and he did a really people with a crossover basically you you're your own control yeah your baseline arteriogram was and your follow-up right so the prime mean I don't want to get into a lecture on shitty science but I can't help myself to be clear there's no placebo group here right in other words you've completely Geographic changes from a drug no I understood but there's a performance bias here every patient in that trial knows that they are being given a compound that is supposed to make them better yeah give another advise to but the point is you have no idea of knowing if they've changed any other behavior that may or may not contribute to an improvement notwithstanding the bigger issue I would have with that trial which is that the millimeter change of an angiogram doesn't actually tell us any we now know it's my mouse yeah the vulnerability of plaque comes from true events no and you know and you certainly can use that type of numbers of people to generate outcome that they did it was disingenuous for them to do it it's absurd for anybody to ever talk about it but they did it and because we're in our infancy on these drugs we didn't you know we're learning as we go along we it's easy for us to say that now and everything and there were three or four they're nice and angiographic trials that sort of indicate by the images look better when we follow up on these people and HDL cholesterol is going up so what else could it be and that HDL but hats trial was so impressive to people that they said the only way we really can prove this is to do a giant randomized perspective blinded trial where we give nice and add it to whatever else get this HDL raising on top of we're already given drugs that lower LDL cholesterol is the same high so aim high was the first so there'd been no aim high if there wasn't this hats I angiographic trial first that was the whole premise to let's spend money on the aim high trial because now we are in the statin or where you do have to give everybody a statin so we'll make everybody's LDL cholesterol perfect and by the way if a statin doesn't do it well that is that it might to it also so we will get ldl-c perfect but hdl-c is still going to be low so we're now gonna add nice I think is Ron's real point which is when you look at that trial which was really then using niacin to increase HDL C and an already optimized

[01:17:25] LDL patient you missed an opportunity to actually cuz here's what happened in that trial niacin made the april-b go lower than statin and ezetimibe did by themselves so you got additional serious april-b lowering and will outcome reduction so how much how much lower than 15% so here is a drug that is drastically further lowering april-b atherogenic particles it's raising it as

[01:17:54] I now call it stupid metric HDL cholesterol but it's not working well I just told you relax VIN I believe works cuz it lowers april-b why didn't I sin because it's got to be doing something bad that's aggravating your arteries and you give me a drug that causes a can thoses nigricans and human beings pet frog mnemonic of insulin resistance why would I ever give that drug to a human being so niacin causes worsens and the only person who you're probably gonna wind up giving niacin to it's probably insulin resistant identified by triglycerides

[01:18:28] HDL abnormalities you're giving nice and immense the worse I could read or 15 other well-known side effects with nice and even though it lowered a poby beyond what is right and I guess the only if I could wave a magic wand the only other question I'd have which is purely intellectual again I don't really think nice and has a place anymore is could the wash on mortality despite the reduction in a poby be explained by the worsening of insulin resistance explained by something yeah no but I'm saying like that would actually be an interesting thing to try to quantify it could be explained by GI bleeding above an occult or no acute nice and well-known to do that it could be explained by all sorts of hematologic parameters disruption platelet reactivity with nice and well-known and a bunch of other things that niacin has been implicated in so to me every time you use the drug you're using trial data benefits versus risk and I I see some benefits to niacin I don't think the HCL is a benefit but lowering april-b I'm gonna always consider that a good benefit but if it's nothing is happening there's something adverse going on which

[01:19:39] I don't understand look they took that extended release product off the market in Europe based on this trial in the United States still here but you just made it unaffordable so they don't want you using it immediate release not as soon as you're basically describing a vitamin at a mega dose one other little aside cuz I noticed people who ho take nice and remember these trials were done with massive pharmacological doses of niacin they didn't tell take a multivitamin with niacin in it which has there's nothing to lipids or lipoproteins so if you want to be a nice and player will you put in the coronary drug project committee release a niacin was four grams a day try that sustained-release knives wait so those patients took one gram four times a day yeah don't look their way up to it yeah you know so cuz many just hey if this is what you can take that's what you but they got on pretty high doses I will say Aniston's kudos to the docs and those trials in her extramural operations for tolerating yeah listen if you get not only flushing but massive pruritus can occur when you use immediately it's a scary phenomenon to a layman who experiences that who hasn't been warned I remember a call I got early in my practice like at 2:00 in the morning the guy thought he was gonna die he had dialed 9-1-1 because he just had an extensive pyretic reaction and he felt his whole body was on fire if he'd had a swimming pool he would have jumped into it but he co cuz he just thought his body was burning up and I just said you're gonna think I'm crazy shew two aspirins and just call me back in an hour it'll be gone I forget whether he did wound up in the ER nah now that's an extreme reaction but it occurs so and look I've took a nice in a couple years of myself on some of the beliefs before we knew a lot of this that cuz I could not tolerate a stat and her statin ezetimibe and I had an April

[01:21:35] B issue and I hadn't learned about intermittent fasting or follow the low carb diet at that time so and unfortunately niacin didn't even lower the April B and me did nothing but I tolerated it for whatever reason but did nothing and who knows what it did to my insulin resistance you know for me nice and sort of grew out of favor with patients even before the final trial I think just the exacerbation of insulin resistance became sort of problematic and by the way the last trial they did another trial because it was a branded product they took that extended-release niacin but they combined it with an anti itch compound and aha so everybody's can tolerate nice and now and they added it to a statin it was the heart protection study thrive and it was basically a duplication of the aim high trial nice increase in HDL cholesterol further reduction in zero outcome change and a lot of toxicity include much of the toxicity is glucose excavations you can have a glucose even so the Europe decided that said so they took that combo pill off the market I'm sure you can still get immediately

[01:22:46] I see in Europe if you want it you know it's an item and for God's sakes I megadose so I just don't like people out there who want to extol nicing fine but don't start telling nice and has a lot of data it's got zero Dedham and these are the same people who bash fibrates who do have two large randomized prospective trials Helsinki and VA head with fibrates and yet they never consider a fibrate they always ho Yool nice since the better drug and at least into the field trial nice or phenol fibrate had all these microvascular there's no prayer nice and reduces diabetic and retinopathy amputations kidney disease but yet there was that battle people bashed fibrates hold them through the high standard of you gotta hit your primary endpoint and ain't never held nice and and to be honest where you're the same that's what Ron Krause didn't that study so I understand what he's talking about there is some dad if you want to extol it but it's not the type of data you and I using so we'll go from the the stepchild to the poster child which we've already kind of alluded to which are repatha and prolly whant these two pcsk9 inhibitors and I'll just give a little bit of background obviously what's the name of the fellow up in

[01:23:59] Toronto who actually discovered this oh I thought it was in Texas Hobbs Helen Hobbs was the first person who discovered the I mean the actual family of pcs ACS family yes yes look there's at least 10 members in discovered I think because I grew up in Toronto I have a fondness for remembering anything that anyone from

[01:24:26] Toronto did but we'll figure it out in the show notes I could be making all this up but I do think there was there's a guy in Toronto who actually discovered this family of proteins but you're right then the genetic evaluation Attucks gain-of-function loss of function explains and the Kachina functions were discovered first correct yeah so I'll explain this really quickly and briefly you can expand upon it pcsk9 degrades

[01:24:53] LDL receptors so if you have a gain of function you are more rapidly degrading LDL receptors on the liver you're going to have a decrease in your clearance of LDL you will have a higher LDL these patients had very high events in fact these patients are make up what five to ten percent of what we want that's usually referred to as familial hypercholesterolemia FH could be a thousand years as a phenotype dominant summer heterozygous disorders of various genes but the phenotype is an LDL cholesterol above 190 and then you fast forward to about 2004 2005 maybe it was 2006 but even I remember this and again this is before I became kind of a lipid wannabe but I would still read the New

[01:25:42] England Journal of Medicine just because it's sort of interesting and there was the discovery of the hypo functioning pcsk9 folks and I really do remember this and I'm surprised I remember in African Americans first on a Jackson trial that's exactly right yeah and these were folks that were walking around with an LDL cholesterol between 10 and 30 milligrams per deciliter and they were completely event free and of course the first a hundred percent but your significant reduction and their reductions I believe we actually went back and did a calculation to see if their reductions how congruent they were with some of the more recent Mendelian randomization and they're very similar and it's not surprising because that's effectively how you would model a reduction a lifetime exposure reduction the thing that interested me cuz I remember at the time like many people unsure I sort of had this concern which is well that if cholesterol levels I mean I'm now realize I was being naive but my concern was God if if your LDL is low that must mean you can't make hormones it must mean that you're gonna get some other awful disease and so the interesting thing to me was those people didn't have any of these other phenotypes they didn't seem to have deficiencies or deficits as a result of that and of course I think that trial is what was the catalyst for Amgen Sanofi and these other companies to start working on these drugs yes and by the way they since studied in these people where they've blown away LDL cholesterol to 10 and 50 there's been zero effect on reproductive hormones or adrenal cortical hormones goes back to what I just told you those glands synthesize all the cholesterol they need they get it from HDL so none of them are waiting for an LDL to show up with cholesterol to keep them functioning so it's all the nonsense you get when you go to a health food store or a gym where the guy tells you you gotta raise your HDL cholesterol or something because you know you're helping your testosterone level in the blood has nothing to do it or if you deplete testosterone because god forbid you actually taking a stat and you're screwing up your testicular function you're not having nothing to do yeah yeah that doesn't seem to be any evidence of that so that put into perspective yes but so the genetic model is if you got an LDL cholesterol of 10 and 20 nothing's gonna be wrong with you and you're certainly gonna have far less coronary heart disease and when we use talk about loss of function that means your LDL receptor half-life is much longer we didn't get into it before we told you to liver makes LDL receptors theoretically any cell could if your liver expresses an LDL receptor how long does it stay there for two three days and it grabs your April B particle it brings it into an endosome but then the

[01:28:31] LDL receptor travels back to the surface grabs another one I used to those of you old enough to used to watch The Addams Family on TV it's like things hand coming out of the box that's the LDL reset there grab something pulls it in but things aren't comes right back out again but if in some people that LDL receptor might be catabolized in the lysosome endosome then it can't go back to the surface and pcsk9 is a major determinant of how quickly you recycle your LDL receptor you do not recycle it so by putzing with the expression of that enzyme we can give you much further expression of your LDL receptor and as you said enhance clearance of your april-b particles including not only your LDL which are ninety to ninety-five percent while you're clearing remnants also so for those who believe all remnants are the bad guys that's not a reason not to use a pcsk9

[01:29:27] I'll get rid of them all so now we're gonna come back to this because I want to talk a little bit about the brain and you alluded to it earlier but I don't want to derail us now so I'm saying this just as much to remind me is to remind you you can come up with multiple ways to lower LDL and I say LDL I'm talking the actual number you can inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol which in turn also activates the clearance or you can just go directly after the clear and so the former would be how a statin works the latter would be how a pcsk9 can also make the evidence that if you're depleting the cholesterol pool and liver you'll make a few less eater LDL particles or VLDL precursors which would contribute to a lowering of april billion that is a small part of both ezetimibe zin a statins in fact most of it is clearance but you are producing less particles too so but this is an area where I do probably have a slightly different view from the mainstream lipid world which is that certainly there's a there's a favourable hypothesis that's the zero LDL hypothesis this idea that okay I think I think let me rephrase that what they're basically arguing is the lower you drive LDL the better and I do take a little bit of issue with that because I think it depends how you lower it and it also defends depends on what you define is better or worse if you're talking about lowering LDL reduces the risk of atherosclerosis I think that's pretty clear but at some point my concern has always been if you lower LDL through cholesterol synthesis inhibition a lot do you impact other organs namely the brain well you don't know remember when you're measuring whatever LDL metric it's what since floating around your plasma the only place I'll make it irrelevant you know you're not measuring cellular cholesterol based on in LDL cholesterol so you tell me what your LDL cholesterol level is I have really no clue are your cells synthesize and are not synthesizing exporting II fluxing or whatever to particles that carry cholesterol but as I think we indicated earlier on talk today look at his integral sales do have to make cholesterol so you certainly wouldn't want to stop cholesterol synthesis and probably any cell on your body because the cell membranes if nothing else requires it and we talked about the brain certainly the only way has cholesterol as it makes it so if we didn't know we were inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the brain would you be really that comfortable with that and if you were is there certain limits where oh I wouldn't mind reducing a little bit but how much cuz that brain really needs it and the brain has no other source of cholesterol now nowadays with the exception of patients who have been on a statin for a long long period of time when it comes to patients that are relatively new to statins they're really only a handful we're really looking at today right Lipitor and

[01:32:35] Crestor are doing the lion's share of the work whether you know for some patients who are very sensitive will use live aloe or will use pravastatin but we're not really doing much in a way a simvastatin or any of these older drugs correct no no if you're following guidelines what you're doing is prescribing high potency statins or at least moderate intensity statins so if you want to follow the guidelines you owe the only choices you have are Razoo is statin or a tour of a statin lipitor

[01:33:05] Crestor at a 40 milligram or above those for a torva or a 21 mm above those reserva if you're stuck you they would allow you to sneaks in the 40 milligrams into there but that's at best a moderate dose tend 80 milligrams of Simba's been taken off the market actually quite high was well because of a variety of Pharma kinetic reasons has a ton of drug drug interactions and we're in a polypharmacy world whereas there's far less with a torva and infinitely less with resumed statin and the Potala stat and you mentioned live a lower so but I would make the case that if you want the statin has the most data that you're going to do good it would be have a statin in provost and very cheap it's almost free if you go to a drugstore for it it's just not that potent right leaving an 80 milligram you know but if you use the outcome trials they got the exact same 25 percent reduction as any a tour of a-- or reservatrol ever did so again Bristol used to explain that the magical mystery pleiotropic effects of perhaps then but

[01:34:13] I would make the case that all right if April B allele so are you though patients are sicker today I think patients are more metabolically ill today than they were meaning I think the Crestor trials have a higher bar to cross than the previs trials but then that's just my [ __ ] speculation oh I think the lipid level enrollments with the West of Scotland where twice as horrific as any residual statin gia they were but they had FH so these are patients who weren't necessarily metabolically ill yeah I understand what you're saying so - but the end of this discussion comes where I got a lower a probate yeah so yeah you'll in unless somebody's incredibly statin sensitive and their ways of predicting statin the responsiveness or hypo responsiveness if you want to just routinely pick for reserve a statin and go down that path

[01:34:57] I'm all free yet so what do we know about CNS penetration of these today and look I jumped on resume statin bandwagon co2 being a giant pravastatin guy cuz it's one of the Oh what I would call hepato selective statins it's hydrophilic it goes right into the liver it doesn't need transporters so you don't need much of a drug to get in the liver and hit the cholesterol synthesis and up regulate LDL receptors so reserves that in five milligrams there's a lot of people need you don't need 40 they want you just 40 because in a trial that's dose they use where they got heart attack reduction but since it all comes back to PO be reduction use whatever it takes to get your april-b down in my mind yeah you know that's not how the guidelines exactly figure out how to do it they like to keep given level 1 and star rated evidence or so minds be a lesser degree of evidence so you pick so they get in the other drugs are not as hydrophilic so the only way they get into liver is various receptors pulling and there's a whole variety of transporters that pull molecules into the liver but they're subject to interference what a ton of other drugs that may be in your system or other molecules so you don't have the clean pharmacokinetics like you do with pravastatin or Razoo the statin that being said we you're talking you want to introduce the brain into the discussion now all statins can get into the brain 810 cross the blood-brain barrier but the statins that cross it much easily are the lipophilic statins because they have to pass a lipid membrane the blood-brain barrier so a tour of a statin simvastatin get into the brain more easily than do lovastatin simvastatin and they tour the statin wait say that again the feel like statins easier to probably be the worst whereas Prevost at and it'd be would be far less ad would we resist and have that flu the statins sort of a water soluble statin is probably more in the class of resuming and what our live alone would be the same you say yeah non lipophilic statin so if you're worried about statins getting into the brain you might want to choose the hydrophilic ones or so but the only concern I might have is well if those statins are getting into the brain it's great to read this cholesterol synthesis and a liver I'm gonna up regulate LDL receptors I don't know that I want to do it every cell in the body but I'm probably not I know I'm not what any of them totally inhibiting cellular synthesis cholesterol but the brain it's way more dependent on cholesterol and then we have studies of people with

[01:37:38] Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive their brains need to be depleted of cholesterol to variable degrees now Tom I'm just gonna stop you right here because if I had a dollar for every time I had a brutal argument with a cardiologist about this point because up until this point in the discussion if you're a card-carrying lipid ologist or a cardiologist who really understands lipids you're kind of on board you're in the camp that's lower LDL but I do get patients from time to time who are more than at their LDL goal meaning their LDL cholesterol is 40 milligrams per deciliter their LDL particle numbers 500 animal per liter these are people in primer prevention but you know let's assume they have a calcium score of 800 or something I mean they're very high-risk but I look at that and I say well gosh they're des Master all levels unmeasurable well you're advancing your discussion here so let me continue down this pathway so if cholesterol synthesis is so crucial for the brain man I need a biomarker of brain cholesterol synthesis now very interesting we talked about two pathways of cholesterol synthesis who wants the desmos roll a blocked pathway and the other is the la fossa rolek and

[01:38:49] Dutch Russell pathway well it turns out the block pathway predominates in the brain so would but I should i do spinal taps and measure CSF there's master role in these people I'm gonna go with no be a tufsa oh by the way don't leave I'm gonna come back to trial where that was what you're trying to prove and enrolling people into that you know so ain't gonna happen but so people know we can measure this must roll in the blood and there's lots of articles correlating that with cholesterol synthesis sets as there is with Austral and you can make the case in peripheral cells maybe even with

[01:39:35] Austral is a more dominant pathway they're probably both hit play but also the DES Mastro pathway is much more important in younger newborns and youth rather than all their people so yeah so maybe that's a critical patient if you for whatever reason want to give a statin to a really young fh or homozygous it might as master all be mine so here's what we know so when people with these cognitive and mild cognitive impairment or various dimensions have low cholesterol when you wind the bullet up see in their brains they do have low des nostril than their cerebral spinal fluid suggesting that they do part of their impairment or cholesterol depletion in the brain is there their brains are in synthesizing as much cholesterol nice trial where they done this they car they did do spinal taps on the people in the trial measured CSF des maestro and they measured serum des monstro what was the correlation identical the are they is very high in their so now all of a sudden a serum des monstro level becomes a biomarker of brains of race synthesis of cholesterol and there are what is by far it's not even close the biggest reason that a brain has suppressed des master all cholesterol synthesis it stands yeah so I would make the case I don't want to pause here because I know what you're gonna say and I agree but

[01:41:11] I'm gonna give you the counterpoint before you even start so you can color your commentary the heterogeneous population based data say statins reduce Alzheimer's disease nothing serious suggests that yeah I mean yeah you want to start looking at crazy which is not to say that the trials are using that as an outcome it's just that we're not seeing an increase in Alzheimer's disease in this case a multifactorial disease a lot of things that contribute to dementia so so in general duce the vast majority of people take statins wind-up the mint and no absolutely not there's not any evidence that is shown at at least from the cumulative statin trials or so but are there certain individuals where that is and by the way in these trials where they measure low both serum and CSF des master all guess what there was a significantly increase incidence of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment so yes this is all at the hypothesis level it's looking at a biomarker not clinical endpoint trials but that's enough evidence to me to say if I'm gonna give you a stat and

[01:42:19] I'm gonna push it to I would provide a reason much rather give you a baby stem plus ezetimibe and buy away baby statin plus Suzette amide gives you the exact same april-b reduction as does the gorilla statin the mega dose of it but I think with a lot of other additional benefits is that in my brings and certainly less potential side

[01:42:40] Faxon certainly less cholesterol synthesis suppression including the brain so if I were giving you massive doses of your favorite korilla statin per guidelines and I simply measured serum des must roll on your next visit and it was low that tells me I've over I've stopped the synthesis of cholesterol too much Tom you you are the only other person in this space who will entertain this discussion with me I mean

[01:43:10] I just can't tell you how many times I get into debates with other lipid folks who say that is complete and utter nonsense and they point to the absence of a huge upsurge in Alzheimer's disease in the statin trials now to which I say the following one I am sympathetic to what you are saying because I realize that all of the anti statin rhetoric out there is so illogical and they throw everything in the sink right like but you know oh my god it causes you know diabetes does it well yeah and a small small subset of the population we're gonna see a slight uptick in the risk of diabetes especially with atorvastatin does that mean statins cause diabetes and it needs to be avoided as a result of that no does it you know do a subset of patients end up getting you know muscular pain of course it's probably five to ten percent it might be even a bit higher depending on the nature of the trial but what I think is really going on here this is this is my hypothesis Alzheimer's disease as you said a second ago is multiple diseases it is not a disease right but even if you talk about Alzheimer's disease even if there is a final common pathway or a set of pathognomonic features that define the disease I think there are several ways to get there there is a metabolic way that people get there that is probably explained by the increase incidence we see in cognitive impairment and and Alzheimer's disease in patients with diabetes and insulin resistance but there's also a vascular component that I don't think gets nearly enough attention there's a guy named Jack de Latour who I you know it's funny I reached out to him recently to interview him for my book and he's on a research sabbatical in

[01:44:44] Spain for two years so I'll probably interview him by telephone but I would like to eventually have him on the podcast but he's done some of the most impressive work on looking at this sort of vascular hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease my hypothesis is this on average you take a group of patients with terrible dis lipedema you give them a statin you improve their vascular complications which include atherosclerosis and you're probably actually reducing Alzheimer's disease in those patients in other words all things coming sure are you better at being at the 90th percentile or the 10th percentile of a poby with respect to

[01:45:18] Alzheimer's disease you're better off being at the 10th percentile however I think to your point there's gonna be a subset of patients in which you go too far these are patients who don't synthesize a boatload of cholesterol they're probably hypo synthesisers to begin with and you statin i's the hell out of them and you are increasing their susceptibility now again that's a part of the problem with everything I just said is it takes more than a tweet and for anybody who throws it in your face there's no evidence of that and any statin trial say oh my god I've read the

[01:45:49] FDA package in sort of every single statin it's on the market and cognitive impairment is listed as a potential side effect of every single stat did the FDA just make that up no it's been seen FDA make this link because I you know that now I'm talking about paper there are actually papers that show and we will absolutely link to this because I think this is one of the better papers it's about six years old but it looks at desmos trawl as a continuous variable so in the same way that you might look at PSA as a continuous variable it can be anything and try to decide the question at what cutoff does having a high PSA suggest that you have a high enough risk of prostate cancer but using desmos trawl as a continuous variable and using a statistical technique called receiver operating characteristic curve production they showed that once desmos trawl fell below 0.5 the AUC the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic was somewhere between 0.8 and 0.87 depending on the study and depending on gender and again maybe it's more detail than people want but the higher that number which varies basically between 0.5 and 1 what one is a perfect study there's no such thing as a diagnostic test with a 1/5 is a coin toss when you get into the point 8 territory that's a very powerful predictor right so I'm think it's careless to dismiss that as a potential player we've given you a lot of the poseability nerds even more if you tell me you are a doctor who has prescribed a lot of statins and like I was in practice 37 years 20 of which is write as much statins as anybody if you tell me you've never seen cognitive impairment in a patient you start on a stat and you're a liar or you're a fool or you're not questioning your patients when they come back cuz it does occur I don't know what a lot of reasons it could have car hoon and look who doesn't have a day where you wake up thinking

[01:47:49] I'm a little foggy today for son and it's nothing to do but it happens so we've now got a plausible explanation why it happens if the real reason you're prescribing a statin is a poby reductions I got a lot of ways to get your April betta goal without maximizing a statin so in my mind if des must roll is below a certain population percentile cut point I've inhibited cholesterol synthesis probably I probably get no bang for the buck on further LDL or a particle lowering April be lowering by having you continue to take that I can clear a April be furthers by stopping cholesterol absorption back into the liver any intestine with ezetimibe that does nothing to cholesterol synthesis a pcsk9 inhibitor so with and most people baby statin and as etem I will give you the exact same april-b reduction of your gorillas stat and we have outcome evidence and knee improve at trial that is that um I've been statin for the guy so I gotta see outcome data you got it so therefore I use it as a tool to monitor statin therapy most people and they also these people would argue you I will bet my as much money as I have in my bank account days never they couldn't even tell you what desmos role is they've never read anything about the cholesterol synthetic pathway and they don't know what they're talking about yeah I mean look in the end I think this is such a contentious topic because we're gay so nuanced on something now and the world has lost its appetite for nuance people want to know statins are good or statins are bad and everything we've just said says it depends right it depends on how you use them you can give too much of these things that doesn't mean they're bad because what we've also done I realized and I've been very deliberate about this because I think it's important to show both sides of this we've also given the statin deniers in the statin you know the statin conspiracy theorists a great ammo which is aha if de spring and Atia are sitting there bashing statins and talking about mild cognitive impairment and they take that discussion out of context they're gonna say well statins should be outlawed yeah any reasonable doctor if a patient came in complaining of statin or a cognitive impairment they did pretty much stop all drugs because that's the first explanation the drug is causing it so it's not like I'd continue to force you to take a statin if you were cognitively

[01:50:12] I mean if the listener is is sort of saying what the hell is the takeaway from this I think it's a couple things one is statins are not bad statins are still the mainstay backbone of anti lipid therapy be thoughtful about which ones you use you know Tom I have I have moved more to crest or over lipitor though I still use lipitor quite a bit and in many ways I'm sort of slowly migrating patients who seem to have no difficulty from lipitor Crestor - I'm actually going back and using pravastatin much more than I used to I'm surprised at how much I find myself reaching for pravastatin in a patient who doesn't tolerate who has a slight CK bump even if they're not complaining of pain if they're getting a CK bump that you know their CK goes from a baseline of 50 to 300 even if they're asymptomatic I don't like it so I'm gonna switch that away I would chip in its CK elevation has nothing to do with statin toxicity or stand so this silly biomarker totally first of all before you ever do that make sure you have a baseline just because a lot of people just working organs not even working out they just have high CK that's african-american so so but I don't realize that and you know when you should stop a statin want to see one is like a 10,000 fold elevation of CK and you might start to worry so seek and there's any number of guidelines you shouldn't say it's not a biomarker those of any use to you and all you do by doing CK is when somebody goes from 50 to 300 they get the bejesus scared out of them and they stop their statin when there's no reason the reason you should stop a statin is if they're having Maya

[01:51:50] Pathak symptoms aches or weakness then I don't care what they're seeking I'll get some info to you on ways of monitoring CK and if they come in and tell you hey Peter I'm feeling pain or you somehow are doing some muscular strength testing or they tell you I don't get out of the chair as much proximal muscle weakness stop the dawn stat yeah well those are those are the easy cases but don't you see case to dictate your statin therapy

[01:52:19] I think the bit of the point here is I can't imagine giving any lipid-lowering therapy without being able to measure phytosterols stanols amigas monstrous I'm with you there most lipid dollish would not be but they just have not studied the data like they should and even if what we're just talking about is pure hypothesis what harm would you be doing by lessening to those of a statin and substituting a little ezetimibe or if they could afford you can make the case if it was free as pravastatin let's just use pcsk9 inhibitors for God's sakes cuz he you know whatever other minor side effects of statins may be I don't think we've seen much with pcsk9 no I mean of course get more time the gun I'm just about to say that the skeptic will counter that

[01:53:03] Tom and say but we only have three and a half years of data with these drugs we're not gonna use that except for people who can afford it or our nightmare patients we're a third party will finally pay for it or so so it's not like Doc's are gonna run out tomorrow and start injecting everybody with a pcsk9 inhibitor they're not because there's handcuffs on them but there's no handcuffs on you using generic is that a--maybe to a baby statin is you have to buy on to ldl-c is not your best surrogate of atherogenic lipoproteins april-b or LDL particle count is and if that's your

[01:53:37] Goler therapy then you got a lot of options available to you now the one thing I used to use the combo lowest dose statin possible coupled with ezetimibe if there was some evidence of even mild elevation of phytosterol against an all one thing I've noticed and I again I've just been a little delinquent I don't think I've gone back and looked at the trials did the trials show an increase in transaminases with that combo no and I think the only trial it would sure you'd have to look back at sees where I'm sure use the simba statin and ezetimibe improve it yeah and there was nothing more than I just I don't know what it is I don't know what it is

[01:54:17] I keep seeing him again I will tell you there's not a package insert in the world that tells you you should even be following a minase to judge statin or anything going on in a liver as a result of a statin there's no correlation whatsoever so I'm repeating them and all the time because maybe as a biomarker of fatty liver or something else but not a statin toxicity it's not you know so don't ever let a patient stop because they've doubled their ast whatever amination measuring level on statin not related to anything you got great medically little safety because that's what the guidelines are telling you to do there's not a statin in the world that they're all out of the package insert that you should be following liver function tests yeah again I think part of the problem is like you I'm gonna follow a liver function test regardless I have a very different view of how these things should be I mean their use I don't know who's not gonna do it's part of your chemistry profile you're probably doing on every patient every time so you're gonna see them but you don't necessary have but be prepared when the patient calls you up in a panic that's not in your differential diagnosis of ydm and aces are changing yeah I don't know Tom

[01:55:27] I extensive entire documents they've analyzed all the data in the world on amination statin therapy it's inconsequential but I mean I'll give you a silly example which is I have seen the following at least four times you take a patient you make they're on a statin there's no other change and the only thing you do is you add zetia and then their next blood test their transaminases have doubled and then the only thing you do is stop the zetia and it returns to baseline alright so something is happy but as a doubling of a transaminase of that etiology of any concern to you so fine if you want to stop it and see go ahead and if that's gonna occasionally limit how much is that a mob you're gonna use in a patient ok figure out how else to lower it OB so fine I understand are things that will come into play in an individual patient we're making an individual decision that's my point that's my point you've got to be able to make an individual decision yeah yeah which is what we're saying with the with the dis master although again I think most patients again if someone's listening to this and they're freaking out because they're like what the hell are these guys talking about we are not saying that statins are causing dementia what we're saying is at least what I'm saying I'll let Tom clarify for himself there are going to be a subset of patients whose risk of dementia does go up with a statin and it's our job if we're prescribing those drugs to know exactly who those patients are and to the best of my reading of the literature

[01:56:53] Plus understanding the nature of the biology it's probably the patients in whom we overly suppress synthesis for whom they don't make that much even with suppressed cellular synthesis which has nothing to do with the amount of cholesterol you measure in the blood great point has not the cholesterol synthesis is not effective per se by pcsk9 inhibitors as that a--maybe is interesting if you go what is that am i mono therapy I actually get a little reflux increase in cholesterol synthesis and vice-versa hyper absorb Stan so there's a little bit of physiologic homeostasis going on this is like it's not changing level cities talks no no but and that believe it or not has become one of the times when I like using zetia is if I've got a patient who really needs a statin because when you just look at their numbers you get the sense that this is an LDL clearance deficiency but you want to boost their synthesis a little bit you do it concomitant with the zetia and you'll sometimes get that reflux and I argue with clinicians to who they are doing sterile testing so today i otama identify my hyper absorbers and i surely make sure is that amides on board my april-b lowering in a patient but I will make the case for you even if you do those markers and you're a normal absorber of cholesterol but you have an April B problem even by taking a normal absorber of cholesterol and making them a hypo absorber the genetic model is they live longer if they have genetic loss of function of niemann-pick c1 in a protein so even in a patient who's not hyper absorbing cholesterol you do get additionally poby lowering maybe not of the same magnitude but you get it and you're changing him in today genetic model of longevity maybe you're certainly keeping phytosterols out of them you can find all of this information and more at
