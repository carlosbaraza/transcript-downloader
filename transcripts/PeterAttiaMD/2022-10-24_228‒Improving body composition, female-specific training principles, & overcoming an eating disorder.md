Holly Baxter is an accredited practicing dietician (APD), competitive bodybuilder, fitness and nutrition educator, and coach. In this episode, Holly discusses her experience as an athlete and competitive bodybuilder. She also opens up about her struggles with mental health, her long battle with an eating disorder, and the important steps she’s taken in her road to recovery. From there, she explains how she would design a nutrition and training program for a hypothetical female client wanting to improve her physique through the addition of lean muscle and loss of body fat. She explains reasonable expectations for gaining muscle and the value of a “reverse diet” for maintaining weight loss, and she shares her favorite exercises. She also talks through some female-specific training considerations such as programming, reps, volume, hormone replacement therapy, and more.

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA Holly thanks so much for making time to sit down today look forward to talking about a lot of things my wife has already peppered me with a hundred questions for you today I'm really excited to be here thank you so much for having you on the show um so tell us a little bit about yourself I know you grew up in Australia and I know that you

[00:00:24] I think you ran track growing up yes I did so yeah grew up in uh Tas Australia so for those that may not be uh geographically aware of thatw that is uh it's the little island that sits just south um of the Mainland so um it's a pretty small place and I think part of the evolution of me now being where I am in Florida um was just having such a big open mind and I I didn't want to stay there so uh I moved away uh to do college so uh I moved over to Melbourne uh Deacon University uh where I did an under graduate in nutrition science food science Nutrition and then a master's in dietetics so and how how I know Tasmania by landmass looks pretty big but what's is it a tiny population it's tiny I think at the moment it's probably like 500,000 um where I grew up specifically when I was living there the population of Liston um was about 990,000 so pretty small so in high school you ran track or in college uh all the way through so I started track um at about age eight uh and I went right through till age 18 so

[00:01:29] I finished by the time I got to like second or third year of University um I guess at that point that was when I could either go for a sporting career or choose academics so I ended up choosing academics because unfortunately in Australia for females there just isn't a whole lot of opportunity to um you know have a successful career in sport uh for males it's a little bit different we have Aussie Rules Football which is incredibly popular and absolutely can make a killing and I think perhaps now that social media has grown to to be where it is maybe um some Fe females have an opportunity to to have a good career in sport but uh yeah academics was kind of the only option really for me at that time what did you run and track so I was a sprinter 100 MERS long jump triple jump and if someone dare ask me to do a relay or 400 I might do that so lots of you know fast twitch anything explosive and powerful and short and did you lift weights in high school where was that your exposure to it so not in school I actually only started lifting weights um probably in year 11 so we call that college at home um so grade 11

[00:02:39] I started um or introduced uh lifting weights and that was with uh that was when I was part of the uh the Tasmanian Institute of Sports so uh my coach at the time uh Peter Fortune was also Olympic uh 400 meter Runner uh Cathy Freeman so she um won the gold medal in the 2000 Olympics and everybody loved her so uh I worked with him um and uh yeah that's where I kind of had a lot of my um I guess experience in track sprinting so why did you choose nutrition in college good question so uh

[00:03:13] I think most people would probably say oh you know I'm really passionate about Sport and da d da but um my reasoning um was probably not a good one I I got into the sport purely because of my uh I guess desire for control of my nutrition and it probably begs the question you know where what's that all about so I have only very recently overcome uh 15 year long uh eating disorder uh I struggled with um anorexia for a short period of time and that went on to become uh binge eating disorder in bmia so uh before I even thought about going off to college um I was already in the depths um of that disorder um I was also struggling a lot with depression um at age I had already attempted suicide twice and I was hospitalized for a good part of my year 11 schooling which looking back at that now like it's it's really sad actually and uh I just didn't have the supports um I didn't have the uh mentors or people in my life that really um helped me to feel what I needed to feel and I think experience uh as a child and it kind of escalated into my adulthood and really very recently have I only started to work on uh my mental health um and I think that's where a lot of my advances have come um especially as it relates to like feeling like I have a sense of purpose in life um and really ultimately finding my happiness so um so are you the you have one sibling yes older or younger younger sibling a sister yes so um when when did the eating disorder start and did that sort of uh uh precede the what you described as depression or you think the two are kind of hand inand and Inter intertwined they uh kind of came on simultaneously I think um for multiple reasons so um I don't want to you know say negative things about my family or my parents or how they raised me because gosh my mother was just an incredible woman she basically raised us as a single mom uh I did have a father in my life but uh he was a very hard worker uh very disciplined and so career focused that you know we were kind of invisible to him so my mom I think she had grown up in a similar situation where her mother um was completely absent she was a single mom so I think her life experiences where she didn't have somebody that even cared about her that take her to do anything do Sports you know she had to do it all herself she'd catch the bus to after school training she'd take herself you know to Athletics on the weekends so um my mother was a wonderful woman but she she did what she did based on her own personal experiences so it probably wasn't the best thing looking back at it but you know we all have our flaws but our relationship was really strained um I think she wanted to control me um to protect me I think um you know and that kind of put a lot of friction between us so I felt like I had no control in my life uh I think up until like year 10 I wasn't even allowed to have like a sleepover at a friends without there being like serious like arguments and there's just a lot of hostility and confrontation growing up so so you're 10 is about 15 yes and so give me a little bit more of an understanding of that so was the focus before that age was it sort of a heavy emphasis on your academics and on your sports and that was it absolutely yes so we were doing uh dancing like tap jazzz ballet uh piano music guitar like drums um then we were in basketball and uh Athletics so we did a lot of um you know activities um and I think the only kind of praise and recognition or like you felt like you were cared for or loved was when you excelled at something so you know if I came home and I did really well in my grades at school that was about the only time that I would get you know oh wow you know we really love you or well done um and I know my mom loves me like it's it's just how people communicate is so important um so yeah I really kind of grew up with this idea that unless I was the best at something or did everything and I excelled at everything I didn't really have value as a human so that's kind of one aspect um

[00:07:35] I think of where all that depression and the eating disort of started um but sadly I also um experienced some sexual trauma uh around that age and I think the there were two instances and it happened with people that I really respected that I trusted um and that coupled with this toxic you know home environment where you can't really even go to your parents because there's this you know uh fear of being judged you know from the community um you know everything was about keeping up with appearances so it wouldn't be you know are you okay talk to me let's let's have a discussion about this it was well what what what did you do to deserve that or what were you wearing how are you dressed what what kind of makeup did you have on like you're asking for this you know so yeah you didn't you didn't disclose any of this to your parents uh

[00:08:26] I spoke to my mother about it um but that was kind of the feedback that that I got um she didn't know how to to support me and she did granted you know try to look for therapy um at the time but uh I think at that point I was so far down like the rabbit hole of depression um and just feeling like I was a lost cause that like it nothing even nothing worked certainly the behavioral therapy that I did um at that time was uneffective and the medication that I had actually um made it worse significantly worse um for a period so I consequently came off that and so um help me understand a little bit more about how one um sort of because I I I think that

[00:09:11] Eating Disorders are probably a lot more common than we are led to believe um I don't actually this is not something I know a lot of the statistics about we've actually been trying to find an expert on eating disorders for the podcast because I think it is a very important topic so I don't know if you are familiar with these statistics but I'm not uh but do you have a sense of of um how often they afflict young women versus young men so the prevalence is a lot greater in females than men but it's actually increasing over the last 10 years uh in young boys as well um I hope

[00:09:41] I don't butcher the statistics I did actually there's a couple of studies that I'd like to reference but I don't have them with me um but I believe 60% of um high school students in us um females have reported to struggle with um low confidence uh negative um sense of self and body image um prevalence of Eating Disorders uh I I guess it's a little bit lower but I I wouldn't know the exact statistics but it is scarily high and we can also then look into some of the the younger studies in children um and it is higher than it should be absolutely and so when you think back to how this started in you I think you mentioned that it started first with anorexia before binging and purging um did you gain a sense of control by limiting what you were eating did it did it in the short term satisfy something that was inside you you know what it did but I think because I was so athletic I was so heavily involved in sport that you know my energy demands like I think back to the amount of training that I was doing you know you've got your in school sports and then after school and it was hours of practice and six days a week for the most part maybe training on

[00:10:49] Sunday um I I couldn't sustain the Restriction I my like I was so um famished and hungry and like that frustrated me it really did like I didn't connect the dots like you know why can't I control you know what I put in my body like you know but little that I know anything about you know your appetite regulating hormones at that point and the requirements for energy for this sport that I was doing so um I would I guess do I would act out these behaviors of binge eating um and then purging and it was just constant it became a point where it was probably every day of the week for I would say 5 years which is terrifying to think about considering the risks so that means from high school all the way into University yep um it definitely slowed down when I got to

[00:11:43] University and I think it was just because of the requirements for study and like I had to work three jobs and um you know to make everything work so there was just less opportunity for me to do that if I wanted to excel in my studies so um yeah it was horrific I just remember feeling like I wanted to be able to control things but at the same token I had no control because my body was doing what it's meant to do which is to you know protect you from starvation essentially now some of the complications that people experience with bulimia of course you know the constant flow of acidity up and down the esophagus did you have any of the issues with your teeth the electrolyte abnormalities as so interestingly no um

[00:12:26] I can't speak to the electrolyte abnormalities because I never had um you know routine blood work back then it was that was definitely not something I was going to to prioritize as a young uh naive student but um I can say now thankfully um you know I never had any of the esophagal erosion from that acidic acid I think um that you know plays a strong risk in developing cancers of the throat in the old factory so I do wonder about that um because of the frequency of purging um and what that says for me in the future because now that I have you know made got that under control um it's a scary thought because I mean you know cancer is a it's a scary thing so how how did this progress So you you're in University you're doing an undergraduate degree then you do a master's degree right after um what's happening does anybody in your life kind of recognize that this is going on be it your sister your mom or friends no so I think one of the the challenges and it's I think been exacerbated by moving away um was my family weren't in the same state um and they didn't travel uh to see me very often and it's kind of been been that way since I've moved away um so I didn't have the the Family Support uh I've never had a close relationship with my sister though I would love to it's just we've just gone in different directions

[00:13:48] I think with life um and yeah I don't didn't have any kind of relationship with my father so um I didn't have anyone to go to for guidance um so I was kind of in and out of you know dating when you were at school and college and uh you know but none of your boyfriends knew that this was happening no I may have communicated it to one and I think part of that was out of shame I think think about the the stigma that's associated with mental health issues depression for one um but then to have an eating disorder and me being the perfectionist High achiever um you know driven woman that I was there was no way

[00:14:27] I wanted to share this weakness uh and especially given that I was you know educated I've done a bachelor's in food science and now I've got a master's degree in nutrition I should be able to control this you know again there that word control so I I was terrified to tell anybody um so I was suffering in silence and it probably went that way for 10 years and during that 10 years this pattern of behavior we still continuing mhm um we're going to talk a lot about training we're going to talk a lot about you know bodybuilding and stuff that that you've done more recently but kind of help me understand like what did you physically look like at the time did you look as fit as you look today uh did you did you have more of a a sort of slender build were you more muscular I mean I it

[00:15:14] I think there's a I think part of the issue and I know this isn't true but I think it's part of The Stereotype is when we think of somebody with an eating disorder we picture an individual probably in different extremes you know I think when we think of someone with anorexia we think of someone that's incredibly thin and and un you know they appear unhealthy and how thin they look conversely I think when we picture somebody with bulimia we usually think of somebody that's a little overweight um were you sort of somewhere on that

[00:15:42] Spectrum I was right in the middle um I think again because of the amount of activity that I was doing um that prevented me from being in this state or a mental state of uh anorexia so I never got to the point where I was dangerously uh low body weight um but I I was a healthy body weight and I was still you know sprinting track training uh I would say I was above average muscularity I was that was kind of when I just started getting into uh you know do you remember the Les meals um like classes that they would have at the gyms where there's um like combat class or uh kickboxing or uh body pump so I was doing you know some light resistance training um my actual like interest in bodybuilding didn't start until uh much later after college so yeah I was I was healthy body weight but

[00:16:33] I think like if we look at you know the research for people that do suffer with binging disorder and bulimia they tend to be normal weight too you know above above normal weight so yeah I was right in the normal no one would have known and you mentioned also I think that you had a suicide attempt when you were six was it 16 yes and was that I mean I don't want to ask the obvious question how was that not a wakeup call to your parents it was um one of the things that was really disappointing and I think it just enhanced the sadness I get a little bit upset than emotional thinking about it but um again just to kind of outline just how incapable like my father was of communicating and it's not that he's a bad person it's just his backstory is incredible like lost his mom at age 13 through breast cancer was raised by an alcoholic father Four Brothers like beaten you know it really really sat he didn't know how to communicate and I remember at that point um my mom was very upset when that happened and I think my dad came into my room and was like you're a [ __ ] idiot and he walked out you know so to have that from like somebody that you're like wow I thought like you loved and cared about me it was he was never somebody that would have had a clue where to start um my mother on the other hand was like overbearing and that was the problem like she didn't

[00:17:59] I knew that she was trying to help but part of the reason that I'd got into this uh space anyway you in combination with the sexual assaults uh and then some of the things that my coach had said about um my training which led to the Ed disorder as well um was that she was just way too controlling wanted to just do everything for me whether it was live vicariously through our Sports which I understand and I've forgiven my mother for that and you know she's just doing what she knew but um yeah she tried to get me in touch with the right health professionals um but I think just lack of you know knowledge resources um not having good connections herself um and she worked in the Med medical industry um as like

[00:18:43] Administration for years before she became a stay-at-home mom so even not like even through her networks she just didn't have the tools and it was right about the time where I was ready to bounce and go to college and I had to fly and move away uh essentially so the ability for her to kind of control and manage um you know what I did with my health and now I'm kind of becoming an adult um it was a lot harder so I think in some ways I'm really grateful that I stepped away from Tasmania and you know took on other opportunities that didn't require her support because I think you know if you get um I guess babied for your you know young teenage years uh and in enabled I I would never have had the life skills to you know be the person that I am today to know what it's like to step out and take risks and you know fear I don't have any fear of failure um and I think part of that was developed from me just moving away and stepping out from that control I want to kind of go back to still the understanding the eating disorder a little bit more um did you did your um self-image of your body seem sort of um inaccurate with what you now look back at as reality in other words does does everyone with an eating disorder necessarily also have a skewed view of their body image or can can that be uncoupled and the eating disorder is simply a control tool that can be unrelated to um a a misbelief a misguided belief about body image I don't if that question dysfunctional thoughts yeah so I think it really depends on the individual um I don't I couldn't recall all of the exact criteria um or like characteristics behaviors that um you know clinically

[00:20:36] Define um anorexia or bitting disorder or the like because they are all slightly different in their own way um but for me at least I can say that initially it wasn't um my body image that I was concerned about it was control um and I think that's kind of then developed into like obsessive compulsive for some things it was like anytime I felt stressed uh anxious drop in whatever emotion um As I Grew that um control the desire to control came back and i' kind of crafted this little environment where when I lived on my own at school uh and then um post School past postmasters when I went off and started my career um my environment was built in such a way that I basically shielded myself from stresses potential like triggers whether it was food environmental social um so that I could live in control and that gave me Comfort so reality check when you become an adult and you have to be flexible and

[00:21:41] Nimble and pivot and you know learn to adapt under stress which my goodness I feel like my life was extremely stressful for a lot of different reasons but I just had no coping skills so I didn't it didn't start as a negative body image it was simply um the desire for control however as I kind of found myself you know more and more involved in sport and as my physique did change um and as I started to connect the dots with my train uh athletic performance with Superior physique low body fat more muscle uh and then the praise that I would get externally from people that then became the obsession it was you know it's how I look and that was where I found myself work that was where I uh felt valued and appreciated and you know people respect me and for a good part of my life I think it became my identity and it was impossible to break and that just fueled the disorder yeah so I can only imagine which then leads to the inevitable question of how how do you break that cycle um oh through a lot of hard work and this is one of the practices I guess that I've Incorporated only very recently into my own nutrition coaching um and with our team as well and that is really um working in collaboration with

[00:23:04] Allied Health um particularly mental health experts so for me until I actually uh started having regular therapy and I'm not talking like once every six weeks for a review which is kind of the expectation I guess in the clinical world I know for me as a dietitian um we would see our patients um you know maybe you do a four four four-week review or a six we review um so it was really frequent but that's kind of how I had been exposed to it with my parents when Mom had got imune to therapy when was that that was when I was about 16 when I was living in right after the suicide attempt they put you into kind of an infrequent therapy yeah so I would have to travel to Hobart I saw a specialist down there um who you know worked with females predominantly any women's health issues but eating disorders and uh nutrition so um it was infrequent but I Remember Loving those little trips because it was like like the one time that I was like oh my mom cares wow we get to go and stay in

[00:24:02] Hobart and we get to go and spend time together and she cares about me and it was just like it's a sick relationship to think like that was so exciting for me but that was what was fuel it was almost like that attention was good attention because I never felt like anyone cared like about me outside of like your credentials and that kind of thing now as you think about sort of the post col life mhm um did you think that you had things under control or did you think that this is a dirty little secret that is totally out of control I think it kind of came in waves um and I think like any kind of condition you know it's

[00:24:42] Works along a spectrum so I definitely had periods where I felt like um I was managing the symptoms um and the feelings the emotions that kind of came along with that disorder are okay um but as soon as things got a little bit stressed full or I had you know extra assignments due or if I needed to like from a financial perspective you know I need to do two full weekends of work back to back and that's the only way that you're going to be able to have groceries next week or put gas in your car um you know when anything extra kind of came into my life I just lost it it was um like extreme um you know binging purging secret eating um was really something that I struggled with um you know I would go out for dinner with friends and I would try to like enjoy myself and like partake in the food but because I would restrict so aggressively um you know anytime that I did get uh outside my four walls of like

[00:25:40] Comfort foods and things that were on my list of you know these are okay to eat um I was terrified no one would know it on the outside but like I'd go out for dinner and it was just this uncontrolled like it was like I had no control to slow down my eating so I ate so extremely fast um and so many of my friends as adults like have said to me yeah you really eat fast but I've noticed a massive change you know for the last few years this is certainly for like longer term friends but you know that habit stuck around so I'd eat extremely quickly and I would almost binge and then I would usually order something else and take it home with the idea that I was going to have it you know tomorrow um and I'll you know portion it out appropriately um but again because of that extreme restrictive Behavior it just meant I'd go home and then binge eat more and it was absolutely spiral out of control and I think again my stress response at that time the only way I knew how to manage stress was to eat and it completely um countered like the goals that I had for my Sport and my training so yeah it was hard so H how were you um able well actually there let me start with a different question what was the wakeup call what was the um event or set of events that led you to think I have to do something different and it's sounds like I'm going to have to take therapy very seriously yeah absolutely so it wasn't until I got to probably about age 25 at that point I had moved from um States I finished my schooling in uh Melbourne moved to G

[00:27:19] Coast where I opened my own business so actually I already had my business uh in Melbourne but you know I basically was starting from scratch so a new clinical practice um and then also uh working I guess 50% of my work week was also inperson training um because at that point I discovered like the love for resistance training and I wanted to be able to incorporate those two things together so um my business was going crazy like busy busy busy busy um I just had some success in the bodybuilding space and I got to the point where my anxiety was so hot and I I I didn't even know what anxiety was like I'd never had I didn't wasn't able to identify or put a word with the feeling that I had just like it it sounds so silly to think about it now because of course it was anxiety but like I couldn't even open my laptop um because I was so stressed at the amount of work that I knew I had to do so I actually got to a point in business where I was experiencing some burnout and I took myself to a therapist at that point um so that kind of started it and then I ended up having to uh admit myself to like a rehab so I traveled to back to Melbourne to a very well-known like Rehabilitation therapy uh location in like country

[00:28:36] Victoria and it was um I guess Incorporated um I guess counseling uh Yoga practices different relaxation um type techniques and then um one of the owners I guess would kind of come and work through just different nutrition things with you and it was and this was specifically for people with eating disorders yes and how long did you commit to go to this place so I I was there for seven days um so it was pretty short but it was very intense like you had a schedule mapped out from the minute you woke up to the moment you went to bed so and how how difficult was that for you to make the decision to shut down work for seven days terrifying um I I remember calling my mom actually and just balling and I I we rarely spoke um not because you know we didn't have a better relationship as adults but I think we just kind of grew apart so calling her and uh I guess she knows like if I'm going to ring my mom there's probably something wrong um yeah I was just mortified because I was so stressed about like losing hours work because I was so passionate about you know but my clients but you know D I just couldn't bring myself to do it but you know she said look financially you're going to be okay like just take just take a week you know it doesn't have to be exorbitant the therapy was quite expensive but um it was very well worth it I'm going through this you know I haven't really resolved my eating disorder I'm at business burnout stress so it was just to me it was like overwhelming and I think at that point again was the second time in my life where I felt um some of those Suicidal Thoughts I don't think that um I kind of talked with my therapist and she'd said well do we need to bakera you and I was like no no I think I'll work through this but it's the first time that I felt this um like hopeless so how much of an impact did that 7-Day um in rehab have on you not as much as I would have hoped um

[00:30:34] I think to think that any anything you know that that's that's that short in duration is going to cure you is you're very foolish but it opened my eyes to the benefits of um you know relaxation meditation um and the value of communication and being transparent and open and that was not a behavior that I was good at um for that 10e period prior

[00:30:59] I was very closed off very reserved didn't share very many things at all I was very private um so I think I saw the value in you know what it's like to kind of work through issues rather than suppress them um and once I finally moved to America uh I got myself straight into weekly therapy so I have had therapy sessions every week since 2016 I've probably missed I don't know maybe 20 weeks just through travel and business so it it got me on the right path and then what were sort of the breakthroughs that occurred with that type of much more consistent therapy so I think number one it made me accountable and it made me speak made me talk um and helped me kind of reflect back on you know my past which i' I'd never done I had never given two thoughts about my upbringing um I feel like now it's all I talk about and all I think about but so much of what I experienced was bottled up in you know the past traumas and uh those those different styles of communication so I think gaining an appreciation and understanding for why I felt the way that I did was incredibly valuable it was like H I've now got some data it at least it made sense to me and then I I think we started kind of discussing you know where are the dysfunctions in these beliefs let's start picking up these um you know different sets of thoughts that you have um and let's deconstruct them and how might these look different for a healthy mind and through so much self-development reading also finding myself spiritually which is another major part of this piece uh the story um it really helped me to understand that I

[00:32:57] I was enough as a human despite my um accolades and sporting accomplishments and that like I'm loved and I don't need to keep proving myself to you know all the people in my life and it was like this huge weight had lifted off my shoulders and part of that was um one of our staff um invited me to go to church one day and I'd only been to church once when I was young uh with a boyfriend his family were a Christian so my experience with like religion was not negative I'd say I grew up like um agnostic so I don't think my parents were anti you know religion but they certainly didn't hold any beliefs of their own and it was not something we discussed so going to church and this was a non-denominational church very Progressive the pastor was just like incredible and every message every week I kept going back um and I was like wow this is so relatable there's so many things out of the Bible that like it's just so good it's like such good information it was like this is what I've been missing my whole life because I F felt for a long time that I didn't have purpose and part of my decision to keep moving and traveling was to feel like what's missing maybe it'll be here or maybe if I go to this country you know the people will be different and I'll resonate with them better um but it was something in here that was missing and yeah going to church and reading it just that was probably the one thing that changed my life um and since then I have never been happier sorry so I I think there's sort of two things that are interesting in the story that I think are are important and illustrative for for anybody struggling with anything and one is that the improvements didn't happen quickly and that it's kind of nonlinear so you know you I I'm actually struck by the fact that you know you said look I did this 7-Day intensive thing and it helped but it didn't help as much as maybe I wanted it to um but I think the encouraging point is here uh you kept sort of at it right you know it was you know it would be years before you would find yourself in Daily or weekly therapy um I guess the other thing is uh when I think of my uh addictions and struggles I I think like any addict um let's just take alcohol cuz it's an easy one for people to identify with externally you know they say that an alcoholic is always an alcoholic it's just a question of if you're in recovery or not but if if if an alcoholic commits to no longer drinking um they still need to be mindful of their behaviors and and still need to be cognizant of the fact that they can slip back into drinking yes and that doesn't mean they can't be around people who are drinking but they have to understand themselves and understand those limits um that's certainly going to be true for me for the rest of my life I know what my addictions are and I and I I know how they need to be managed Y and they're always there so do you feel that way as well absolutely so I think there is this idea that you can completely recover and

[00:36:13] I don't think that anybody truly recovers like you said once an addict always an addict yeah you're in recovery you're not recovered yes now I think with something like that you know there's the physiological you know symptoms that you need to manage as you come out of that you know you've got a chemical attendance but for something that is psychological um you know there's obviously chemical imbalances in some um in some of these conditions but

[00:36:37] I think there's also a strong need for your desire to to change and to improve so I think it wasn't until like I had kind of committed to myself and said you are never going to purge again and I remember and I actually have started writing a book about this actually uh which will be hopefully very helpful for a lot of people that are going through the same kind of thing but yeah I remember being sitting on my bathroom floor one day um balling just like emotionally exhausted physically exhausted and it was during a contest prep um you know the the most difficult thing that one could probably ever attempt to do um which is get extremely lean and try and control your body which wants to control you essentially um and I remember just saying like you're not going to do this anymore and I think as soon as I really believed that like I didn't want to purge anymore I was exhausted um that's when things started to change and I think the more I talked about that with my therapist um where I no longer had a compensatory mechanism I wasn't going to let my do myself do that and I also wasn't going to try and overcompensate with activity because that was something else that I would do if I didn't Purge I would feel so restless and anxious and guilty if I didn't go and do a you know a 10 km run cuz I would work out okay well I probably ate this many calories in that

[00:37:58] Purge and then really I've got no idea cuz I threw some of it up and like it was just this horrible like sickening feeling um it's hard to talk about really it's kind of gross but you know once once I kind of didn't have these Outlets anymore it forced me to get real with my intention for eating it forced me to become mindful it forced me to slow down and you know become present with my meals and to really like listen listen to what my body was saying and that was really hard because you know of course if you've restrained from you know a certain food alcohol drugs for a long period of time all you do is think about that thing right so for me like

[00:38:42] I'd restricted like I would allow myself a little bit of ice cream um until I learned about flexible dieting of course and then that that changed a lot of things but that's another story but like you know I'd restricted cookies and you know just nice fun cereals like normal Foods and I just couldn't control myself around them anymore so that was so difficult because I just felt like I was going crazy I'm like what is wrong with me I remember saying to my therapists like a couple this is years into therapy why do I still want to eat the entire tub of ice cream I I feel like I can't just make myself one serving I want to eat the whole thing and she's like well

[00:39:17] Holly like you've restricted this for 10 years like why what makes you think that you're going to cure this um desire overnight when it's been something that you've built a habit that's ingrained over you know your lifetime with this disorder so I think once I started having a little bit more compassion for myself and you know forgiveness and reducing the amount of judgment that I had for myself as a human like you're you're a screw up you're what's wrong with you you know once I started to be kind of to myself that was when I started to make a little bit more progress and I hated the out calm at that initial like going through that initial trans um transformation because it meant I gained so much weight so much weight and at this point I hadn't really tackled the underlying cause either like or the why which was I felt like my body need that was the thing that would give me value so I'm trying to do this just to stop the binging and the purging so for me to see my body weight you know exceed like 70 kg like right now I sit at about 63 kilos um so to get to like 75 kilos at the peak of my recovery was the most uncomfortable I think I've ever been and I think anybody that's struggled with body weight um you know weight gain uh can appreciate that feeling and I just had to do it um so meaning like was the was the therapeutic instruction like you need to sit in the discomfort of this weight gain yep um that was one of the first strategies that I had to work through for my anxiety at this point i' also developed a social anxiety it was it was just like this the lid had been taken off and all these things were like you know immersing themselves uh in front of me and I I had no idea how to manage them so yeah learning to sit with that discomfort um and be okay with that so now like part of that process was discussing the feelings and that was really when we started to identify okay what are the feelings that you have now that you've gained weight and it of course led to oh I feel horrible I'm disgusting this is so unhealthy um you know I hate myself like just such horrible words um to describe myself and you know I think one of the things that at the time the therapist had said was what would you say to a client because at this time like I'm practicing dietitian I've been a dietician for like 10 plus years so you know I really had to go okay what would

[00:41:59] I say to my clients if they said that so I had to start treating myself like I would my clients and yeah there was a big shift then in you know just that like I said compassion um that I had for myself so yeah I think so how did that work I I I I I think that's a wonderful test I I call it the Rick elas test he he's a friend of mine who describes it uh even one step further which is what would you say to your best friend if they were saying these things if they were in this situation and it's amazing how much it totally changes and softens the tone it really does yeah I think um you know the first thing that Springs to mind was um but what about your physical appearance um or what does our friendship have to do with your physical appearance if it was a friend and nothing it it was like I don't have any like logical reasoning for believing this to be true um and so many people like clients would say oh you know I've got this holiday um catching up with some friends that I haven't seen in a long time we've got this you know it's always a wedding or some kind of you know special event where they feel the need to look a certain way and I said do you think you would have been invited if you were um you know 10 kilos heavier and like people are like yeah of course like those relationships aren't buil built on your aesthetic it is built on your you know your character there's obviously something admirable that people like about you that has nothing to do with your you know appearance uh it's a common interest you know the ability to connect over things and uh maybe your sense of humor like you know insert whatever characteristic it is and

[00:43:45] I think when I started kind of talking to myself in that way I was like oh yeah I actually still can have fun on the weekends um and it has nothing to do with my the weight on the scale or my body fat percentage so part of what is so interesting about your story makes it so hard to reconcile which is um everything we just talked about which then coexists with one of your passions which is bodybuilding which you know seems to me to be this single activity that would most raise the risk of the one thing you're trying to prevent right I mean I guess if you were a jockey uh or a gymnast that might be close on the list as well but but even those entities wear more clothing than a bikini right so so you've you've chosen to have this hobby outside of your job but it's really related to your job right I mean it's in many ways it's the

[00:44:45] Pinnacle of exercise and nutrition as it pertains to Aesthetics and you've also chosen to do it in the drug-free category so you you don't get to rely on any additional biochemistry you have to do this just through training and nutrition um there's an I don't know if irony is the word but but but there's something in there that's worth exploring and I I imagine this has come up repeatedly with your therapist absolutely so yeah it's um it's been a really long journey and there was a point just a few years ago where I really questioned my uh decisions to remain a coach and to be in the you know nutrition and uh exercise space um because of the hypocrisy that I felt with you know what

[00:45:37] I was you know coaching on so again I think I can say that for the first 10 years of my practice I had no desire to change my beliefs I believed truly um from the bottom of my heart that in order for me to be successful in business to um you know support others the best that I possibly could and to be taken seriously in an industry that is largely you know dominated by males um I needed to not only talk the talk but walk the walk so I never addressed that belief I believe that I needed to be lean so I never did anything about it I felt uncomfortable that whole time like the psychological stress that I had can you by the way give me some examples on this for I mean I what body fat are you at when you're on stage um it depends so

[00:46:32] I compete in or I have competed in figure for ifbb which is um a non drug tested Federation um and I have since moved away from that um but for those girls you're probably looking at just on 10% body fat they're extremely lean um and now the the division that I compete in which is the fitness category and it's for a different Federation it's a slightly um smaller body um but still very um muscular and very lean um I probably get down to about you know 10 or 11% body fat and just to make sure I understand at 10 to 11% body fat does your menstrual cycle still continue so for majority of my competition history and competing life yes it would completely stop uh in fact for about 5 years I did not have a period uh and that was even with the return of you know calories back to a normal amount even with the return of body fat you know back to you know normal healthy levels um I think it was just the years of uh you know binging and purging me think about just from an evolutionary standpoint what that's telling you that is telling you that again Evolution has one purpose for you and it's saying you are not even fit enough to do this yep yeah and I mean a lot of people will ask like is it a heal healthy Sport and is it you know dangerous to get that that lean and I would say Well it kind of depends because you know I know there are a lot of females that particularly in that you know line of work if you're you know going to call yourself a professional in the bodybuilding space they don't have the desire for you know families so fertility isn't even an issue yeah no and and I'm making no judgment about that I'm just thinking about it from an evolutionary standpoint it's basically saying the one thing you were put on this Earth to do evolution is putting the braks on because it's basically saying you don't have enough excess energy to care for another life to to carry another life to term absolutely um it's it's really scary so you you there's there's no no doubts about it um it's not a great thing for our you know for females to be that lean we're not meant to be that lean um and I think unfortunately you know it's just something that has um grown with you know the changes in times Society shift

[00:48:53] I think there's been a lot of segue uh and improvements with you know the ideals for females I think it used to be extremely slim you know you think about the really tall models you know runway models that used to be like the the look that everyone wanted to go for and I'm actually really happy that I think we're seeing a shift just with the general population to um you know empowering females with resistance training and strength training um because to me that is far more beneficial than you know starving and you know being a bean bean pole so I think there's that's promising but for whatever reason we seem to kind of find ourselves back at this extremism um you know ideal and you know extra extremely lean women are simply not healthy now do all women lose their menstrual cycle when they compete um no

[00:49:48] I've had probably a 50/50 um with the competitors that I've worked with that still have normal um menstrual cycle or it may not stop but it becomes you know irregular it's um all over the place in fact my last uh competition I was um actually getting a cycle like every two weeks for about eight no probably 16 weeks of a contest prep which was really bizarre um but that was after also not having had a period so it took me a few years to recover my period um through you know the um the process of reverse dieting the recovery diet um and allowing myself to gain some body fat and have a have offseason where I you know got an adequate amount of calories and was able to fuel my body to a point where you know my hormones are working and functioning as they should um but yeah then the other 50% of people do completely lose it so how do you how do you now think about this right if you if you could go back in time and talk to yourself uh when you were 18 years old would you would you say to Holly then you know just stay away from the Fitness industry stay away from bodybuilding uh get your degree in you know economics or business you know something like that like do do you think that even though where you've ended up now seems like you're on a path to recovery do you feel that you were just flying too close to the Sun all of this time yeah so I have asked myself this question a lot um and people will say you know what would you do differently I think that if you spend an equal amount of time working on your mental health and that is you know coupled with you know diet and exercise I believe because I'm in this place right now where wherever I am uh along the spectrum of body fat um wherever I am you know in my competition on season offseason um I could truly say that I am good like with myself wherever I am the things that will limit me from you know getting to the point of like obesity or like an unhealthy body weight um would probably be like again extreme habits like taking anything to the um to the limits where you know you're just completely careless with your food and careless with exercise and you just don't have any interest so I don't think

[00:52:17] I would ever like allow myself to get to that place because it just wouldn't feel good anymore like I try to really uh be conscious of okay what what leads to you you know number one feeling happy um and then also what's good for your body how do you feel best where do you perform best um how do I think and function best so you know outside of that I just I feel like you can be in this space but I know a lot of people are not doing the work that is required to um shift there why because I think that's really important for people that are moving into the bodybuilding space so I want to just kind of walk through let's say your most recent contest you just had a contest a couple of weeks ago right yeah um so I want to walk through the training and the nutrition for the entire prep so let's just say six months leading up to the contest so kind of a bulking building phase and then a cutting phase and then a post phase or a recovery Diet phase y um and even though in your case the stakes are really high it's a professional bodybuilding competition at the highest level right it's a World Federation but for someone listening to this it could be like their wedding right it's like you know a woman who wants to look her best at her wedding um and might acknowledge that like she it's going to not be the most sustainable she can be but wants to do it in a way that's not harmful so um go let's go back as far as we need to 6 months 9 months a year yeah what does that look like yeah what is the training how do you periodize it what are the principles of nutrition um and and everything I want to understand what the cutting phase looks like and I want to know what this this because my wife was telling me because you guys were talking about this the the recovery phase is also very important how you come out of the competition without doing what would be natural given that you're starving just to go you know go wild so let's go back to the beginning uh it's time to start adding muscle Y and uh and bulking up yeah so I think well first and foremost I'd say majority of the people that you know our team work with are just gen pop you know they're not not quite as uh extreme or high up in like the professional athletes that status that I am um but the wonderful thing is that the processes are honestly no different the only true difference between somebody that is you know a professional athlete um versus is your you know stay-at-home mom who wants to you know look good for you know they've got a girls trip coming up or something you know next year or a wedding like you said um would be the extreme or the the degree to which we take these processes so for most people when we first start um I kind of want to have an idea about like what's their goal uh what do you like ideally want to look like or sometimes there Health you know Health um goals as as well but I will say the majority of people that come to us are also looking to or primarily wanting to change their physique so we need to get a good understanding of what what that looks like because a lot of a lot of women will say Hey you know I'm down for this resistance training that you're talking about but I'm terrified of getting you know too bulky um and that is going like how we approach this whole thing comes down to the individual's definition of like what's bulky look like to you yeah what percentage of clients that you guys have look at you and say I don't want to look like you that's too much muscle so I would say that uh most of my clients 90% of my clients um like this ideal I think most people would say yeah I am not too bulky yeah Holly you look great I have had some people like NOP your quads are way too big nope I want to fit in my jeans or you know something like that but for the most part um like my physique like that Fitness looking fitness model physique is something that most women um

[00:56:30] I might be generalizing um but aspire to but again it depends you know if I'm talking to an endurance athlete versus somebody that um you know has come from a a sporty background and they're trying to do something that's very you know anerobic might be a different um uh physique ideal because that would not be beneficial for their sport but um we want to we want to identify that first so we go through you know it's very unlikely that women will get to the point where they look like a a female bodybuilder like these things don't happen naturally like that those bodybuilders like that that physique that look um is not obtained without performance-enhancing drugs um my physique and great genetics I mean it's extreme training personality and perfect nutrition we call it the myth of accidental muscle it's just not going to happen and I still you still have to admire those people despite them being it's not easy like it's still not easy but you know they've got some support So for me like if someone was looking to make change their physique to um you know this level of muscularity um that's still taken me like seven years of very consistent nutrition and training um where you know I've I have probably missed less than you know 10 weeks a year of training like and I have been like that for 10 years so you're not going to accidentally grow muscle like this even without you know some serious consistency and how do you help them identify the actual goals I think this is an important stage so when a when a when a client and I just want I'm going to use a female example here and and focus that so so if if she comes in and says look I'm getting married next summer and I want to look my best is that not specific enough right you want to say well right now you weigh this much and your body fat is this a year from now do you want to weigh this much and have your body body if F be this I mean what degree of granularity do you need to set the goal to to to set the path absolutely so I am pretty granular um compared to some of even our other coaches I think all of our processes are slightly different I guess the principles at the end of the day the same um but I'll often say like is there somebody that you follow on social media or that you've seen in magazines that you like really like their physique just to help me get a better understanding um because it does really vary and sometimes I've been very shocked I'm like oh okay all right I actually don't really need to do a whole lot of you know building for this individual um you know based on where they currently are so that building phase may not even you know be part of the equation so uh that we also have a look at their scale weight and their current body fat percentages which will um preferentially have them send us through dexa we take a look at all their biomarkers that type of thing um and then from there I kind of plot a bit of a trajectory so if they do need to gain you know a significant amount of muscle in that 12 months time um I will basically map out um you know week for week using some equations like okay this is basically how many weeks of building we would need to do as a natural like drug-free person and tell me what you believe the limits are for women so uh it's going to be a little bit lower than males and part of that is just you know due to their ability to you know build more muscle mass and um I guess sex differences and that type of thing but we can still do a lot of like like a lot of positive uh work in an offseason so in an 8-week period I was actually looking at a study very recently um for natural athletes we're able to acquire somewhere just under the amount of 1 kilogram of fat-free Mass so fat-free Mass isn't just scal tissue we've got to take into consideration you know the increases in um you know water mass increases in all of these other things so that that's my record by the way in the one year I dedicated to the most Improvement was 13 PBS in 12 months of fat free mess y so it's about a kilo per 8 weeks yep that sounds that sounds dead on and you're saying that's true for men and women yeah well again it depends on you know the individual how how much time are they willing to invest in this goal where is it on their priority list you know it really comes down to their training volumes how well are you going to adhere to your diet how are you going to adhere to these other variables that all Impact you know your rates of muscle gain so know what the largest amount of lean mass you've put on in a year has been so I haven't done it over 12 months um but I do know that between two competitions one at the beginning of the year uh one towards the end or last quarter uh I put on about 6 kilog so that's more that's like 14 pounds of lean tissue so it was a lot and that was me going into the

[01:01:17] University of South Florida we were doing my um BMR testing I did muscle thickness testing so this was all you know fairly um accurate methods of determining like hypertrophy so that was that blew my mind but again I would say I've put on muscle very easily like um which you know maybe there's a genetic component to that but I'm also very like regimented with my training and the period of time when that happened I was very very fluffy I was very fluffy I allowed myself to put on a lot of body fat um oh yes so I want to ask you about that so in the with the 6 kilos of lean tissue how much fat tissue came with it um six kilos of like for me in that in that particular episode for you oh goodness um it was probably about uh 30% on top of so yeah if I had six PB so 2 pound two kilos two kilos of fat exactly okay yep so basically your body fat probably went up a little bit as you put on a lot more lean M yeah I I I'd say I probably went up by about 30% so if I started this build um at you know 12% after a show I got up to 19% so actually it's more than that I remember being 19% body fat at the end of that build so yeah but that's that's kind of amazing

[01:02:40] Holly that that to me if a guy made that change that would be considered impressive drug-free so that a woman could do that um and again let's just POS it that you have great genetics yeah but it gives it gives us it gives us a range that there are women with lesser genetics who might be able to do half of that in a year they might be able to put on three kilos in a year which is still seven pounds basically and I think I also have to be very you know transparent about this so I was in a position too where my ability to kind of step back from my other obligations and priorities um has been like fair I'm not going to say easily facilitated but but you're you're doing this as your job yes right so you know I remember and recall through that training block I had programmed you know progressively overloading like my first week of a a

[01:03:31] Mis cycle might have been three working sets of everything on my list and I might have had six or seven exercises by that sixth week of training I would be pushing like five working hard sets High training intensity you know rpes eight and nines of like my first three exercises and then four of everything else like the volume I was getting up to was insane so talk to me about hour in gym per day in the beginning of the build phase versus the end of the build phase I hit it hard pretty pretty quick pretty early um I also had a bit more of a reactive style to D loads normally I would plan intentional D loads the whole purpose of that build was to get as much muscle on me as I could in a very short time frame so um the volume probably went up by about 50% within the first you know 12 weeks um and then it just just continued to grow so uh the time that it would take me varied from maybe 90 minutes in like the early part of that uh build phase um all the way up to two two and a half hours daily and I was doing five sessions a week at that point so it was a big commitment and then were you doing any cardio at that time minimal I would just hit a daily step

[01:04:46] Target um of about 10,000 steps and cardio was not even part of the equation got it so averaging two up to 2 and a half hours a day the gym 5 days a week so again we're talking about good genetics coupled with 15 hours a lot of training um some of the people listening to this podcast I'm guessing will be more women than men uh won't be as familiar with rpe do you mind explaining to people what that is because it's going to be an important concept as we talk about resistance training yeah absolutely so rpe uh is or stands for a rate of perceived exertion so it's a measure of training intensity and training intensity is one of the principles that need to be uh increased over your um training lifespan in order to facilitate hypertrophy so uh I guess

[01:05:36] I can reflect back on my early training days and I didn't even have a training RP there was no training intensity um you know there's I guess another one that we can refer to which we use on our workout Builder programs is the r which is repetitions in reserve so you're basically an i r i of three would mean that you've got three repetitions in reserve all the way up to an i of zero you're hitting failure so whatever weight or load you select for your lift you are going to your drop essentially so my training when I first started lifting um incorrectly um was so low like I never challenged myself uh and again I know that we wanted to talk today about uh bodybuilding versus powerlifting and how they may be beneficial for you know females um I am so grateful for the time that I spent powerlifting because that style of training um kind of threw me into understanding training intensity and what my true strength was so there was a lot of carryover to you know how quickly

[01:06:42] I was able to um you know select weights for my bodybuilding style of workouts um and that advanced me so quickly so just to make sure I understand you're saying when you were younger and you were doing Fitness training and even training for track and field you were never pushing yourself in the weight room your your your RP was below five your R was above five yep absolutely yeah we and we were never even given a training intensity it was just do three sets of 12 yeah so right now when you say in these in this building phase yes when you say rp8 meaning you stopped and you had two in the tank um you could have potentially squeezed out two more Y and you said so if you're doing RP 8 to 9 these are near failure sets all the way through yep absolutely focus on uh how would you split those five days was it a leg day a push pole day how how are you splitting those days yeah so look I think um if we look at how I kind of set up a training program there are so many ways that you can go about this um and but they all do need to follow you know the principles of hypertrophy and I guess number one is you know exercise specificity we need to be making sure that we're training in such a way or a modality that is going to have the desired outcome so obviously building muscle and then choosing muscle groups that you want to build during that time frame so for me that looked like uh gr glute hypertrophy um that's kind of the main area that most women or at least those that I'm experienced in working with uh really want to improve um because that has a lot of benefits for many things from normal day-to-day activities bending down squatting um through to you know improve strength across all sports jumping da da D you know there's so many benefits so um glute hypertrophy took up a big part of my training volume um shoulder hypertrophy was another one that I really uh focused a lot of my training volume on to kind of create the um you know the cat shoulders and the illusion of a narrower waist um so thinking back to that build most of the training that I was doing was lower body so I actually did four low lower body sessions Believe It or Not per week and then one upper body session so it sounds crazy wow it does sound crazy and those four lower body sessions were you still dividing the legs up or were you hitting the same muscles of the legs four days so uh I think my programs uh varied and again I would kind of triage um to kind of give my body the recovery that it needed and again it was very reactive style of de lo so I would start by um I guess Monday might be spread out by doing a quad hamstring glute cve um quad hamstring and then that might be that workout I may have a second day which looks like uh glute hamstring quad or I would prioritize again the muscle groups that I knew I wanted to build so uh then I would have a rest day because back toback two days of leg day is pretty intense um and then I would probably incorporate an upper body session to again a second day of complete rest from my legs and then I would finish out the week by doing like a Thursday session lower body 2 days off come back in train on a Sunday another lower body session so there was a lot of training volume and I just want to say that I would never do that for somebody that was brand new to training um that volume would be radically reduced okay so what would it look like for a person who has some exercise background like they they go to you know Orange Theory Fitness twice a week and they you know they're they're a relatively active person but they don't have any powerlifting experience and they've they don't know the difference between rp9 and rp5 right so they're not they're not there how would you but they still have this ambition of of building they want to put on five pounds of muscle in the next year and lose three pounds of fat like that's the physique goal yeah so first and foremost I would say like again if this is like literal lit literal practical takeaways I would say number one find somebody that's evidence-based first and foremost IDE dearly uh find somebody that can also that's evidence-based uh be with you in a gym setting they do one-on-one training because there is so much value and knowledge to be learned just oneon-one spending time with someone that's got more knowledge than you in that space um developing optimal training techniques developing the right movement Pathways and boy I have seen some doozies um you know clients are being trained in the gym by someone that has no idea how to squat or deadlift right so another little plus if you can find somebody that does powerlifting or has done bodybuilding and powerlifting um I think that is like a little golden egg they there's not a lot of these people out there but um incorporating that evidence-based approach with um experience with women and powerlifting and bodybuilding that's like the perfect ideal and experience with women because of what difference specifically is it anatomic differences in movements or is it just the assumption that women are coming in with a lower training volume no I think look there's plenty of men out there that can do that as well but I think you've got to connect with the person that you're working with and

[01:12:14] I think now if you've got a male that's extremely experienced um you know in all of those things then of course a a male can be great but I think um have having gone through different body image issues having that understanding and appreciation for maybe body dysmorphia uh having an appreciation for menstrual cycle you know I think men that are in the fitness industry and I don't want to generalize because I know there's a lot of really intelligent guys out there but there isn't a lot of work like just the general personal trainer um and the amount of time that they spend you know learning about the reproductive system and how that can impact strength and you know sub subject performance and um you know the implications that that can have on your mood your psychological State and just the plethora of like what being a woman encompasses I just think that women tend to do better with female trainers but again it's it's harder to come by so that's what I mean by that so what would you design for a client in that situation so and let's just make that

[01:13:21] I'm just going to make that even harder this is a woman who wants to gain 5 pounds of muscle and lose 5 pounds of fat in a year in other words they want to weigh they're they're fine weighing the same amount next year but the change in body composition is going to be dramatic yeah absolutely okay so first and foremost I would be looking at okay what realistically can we gain in you know an eight Monon time frame so because that's the period of time you want to build up yes absolutely so first off from a program design standpoint um we would want to start with a fairly low training volume if this is somebody that has not um you know done a whole lot of resistance training so we would start by selecting the muscle groups and the exercises that Target the areas they want to build um and we would progressively overload that um training so it might start with you know one working set for every exercise in week one that little yep that little so uh typically I would start with a program that is like 40 minutes maximum 30 or 40 minutes maximum how many warm-up sets to get to that working set typically probably one or two um and that part of that would also be just helping with the demonstration of technique and kind of getting that movement pattern and what would be the RP of the one working set starting off like an RP 6 or seven in a we one a set of 10 but weighted to an rpe of six or seven yep exactly which again just for the person listening means you're going to do 10 reps of this thing but if if your life depended on it you could get 13 or 14 exactly yep and just one set yep so you might start with three days a week it's and again we've got to incorporate the uh person person's uh ability to you know sacrifice time for their training so and so the other thing I'm taking away from this Holly because I wouldn't have thought of this so I'm glad I'm asking this question it's better that she does one set of leg extension one set of leg curl one set of single leg RDL one set of leg press instead of just five sets of leg press yep yeah and I think part of that as well um it's teaching her enough it's giving her the education on this so that you can now build on that yeah absolutely well you're learning what muscles uh what exercises Target certain muscle groups and you're also minim the minimizing the risk of them uh getting injured or ending up with extreme you know delayed onset muscle onus um the last thing that you want to do is put together a program that is too difficult and the next day they can't even walk like how how well is somebody going to um or likely to comply with that program you know thereafter they've had that level of pain um from a session it's going to be really low so we want to have good adherence from the GetGo so and it's also I guess more interesting like it's sort of the diversity of the program excise diversity and I think women um definitely well men and women as well but I think males are probably happy to do a lot more repetitive type training um you know to get to the end result females we like a little bit of diversity so how many days a week are you doing this and are you mixing upper and lower body on the same day at the beginning it doesn't really matter again the primary driver of what um or how I would put together that workout would really be like training volumes so whether or not you do you know lower body and an upper body or whether you do a full body training session it doesn't really matter um I would probably be deferring to what's your history like what's your experience what do you like doing because on paper it probably doesn't really matter that much what's more important is that I can get you to stick to this so okay so how many weeks are you in that phase yep so typically I will write a mesocycle for somewhere between four and six weeks so again my decision for four weeks versus six weeks is the person's ability to adhere to the same program for that amount of time I know for me when I first started I if I had to do the same program for more than two or three weeks I was like this is so boring like as if it's even working let's change it up so again there's a lot of personal preference you know when it comes to putting those programs together so I personally write my programs for six weeks I can handle anything for six weeks it's repetitive but you've got you know maybe three or four maybe five programs again depending on the levels of the individual's experience levels so you've got quite a bit of exercise diversity you know within a 7-Day period so tell me some of the lower body exercises you would have uh uh a a relative newbie but not a total novice du would cycle through what for lower body um I think my favorites uh for compound LS are always going to be your typical powerlifting movement so

[01:17:49] I always try to incorporate some kind of squat or hinging variation um or dead lift so the degree of flexibility just with those two exercises alone is enormous like you can do heels elevated squats Smith machine squats box squats paw squats Anderson squats like there's so many variations but what do you in so if you have a woman who's never done anything Basics and that's what you're going to started with like a goblet squat or a back squat to a box or yep absolutely body weight squat would be actually the first thing so I'm just looking at movement pattern to begin with um and then we start to add loads and and I typically start with barbell and my preference is low bar sorting I like to teach B actually it depends on the person's uh anatomical makeup because High bar squatting might be better suited to uh an individual that's got very short femur compared to somebody that has extremely long femur like I do low bar squatting and I'm basically leaning over looking at the ground when I squat just to clear my hips or to yeah to clear my hips so um keeping it basic and when you say low high you mean the position on the track position of on on the on the back yeah absolutely so uh there are advantages I guess of having a low bar squat in that it um if you think about like the moment arm if you hold a weight plate um right in front of you that's 20 lb you can probably do it for a long period of time if we extend our arms out how long do you think you're going to hold that 20 lb weight too long not very long so similar um hypotheses is that when we put the squat bar Lower to our center of gravity um we tend to have a little bit more strength and power and that was a big difference for me as somebody that had crazy long long levers um I was a terrible High bar squatter um my strength went up like 50% um by shifting to that low bar position so again you asked about this but is that only because your femurs are so long correct okay yes and there's other reasons as well I think spine length as well I have a long spine very long torso so again I want to bring that um barbell back into closer to my center of gravity so I'm very low on the back um and I realize

[01:19:49] I'm totally deviating from what you asked me but keeping it simple with the squats are there women that you look at and you just say you know what it's not worth you're never going to be a powerlifter it's not worth the risk I don't want you squatting MH um I would say uh anybody that's got um some serious like injuries like a history of um hip injury knee injuries um but again my area of expertise um isn't in like

[01:20:14] Rehabilitation so I'm normally working in conjunction with you know a physical therapist or chiropractor or something like that are are women do you find women who have never done this kind of intimidated by the idea of that big 45 PB Olympic Bar going on their back heck yes absolutely it is intimidating I can't imag I mean it's I I think if you've not done that before it looks really scary terrifying and I think people's like fear is that the bar is going to come down on on top of them it's going to turn them into a pancake yeah absolutely so first off when you're first starting you're not going to be loading the bar that heavy but I think um I work with like the catch bars on so um a technique that I would do and incorporate into a new person's program if I was training one-onone would be the

[01:20:52] Anderson squat so you b basically start with the bar on the catches so you position them at you start in the low position yeah yeah so you're finding the U client's um I guess horizontal position at the bottom of the squat and that's where you start so the the thighs areall to the ground y you start in that position and the rep is up down up yeah absolutely so that's a really um empowering exercise that I think helps build confidence so I'll do that in conjunction with other squat variations um because it is you know it's such a big movement you're using it's like you know multi multi-joint big muscle group so it's also going to help contribute positively to energy expenditure compared to just doing you know isolation exercises like triceps and biceps in fact I rarely program arms for women anymore because at the point where and again it depends on their goals you know if they're a kayaker or something they need arm strength I'm going to probably do that but for aesthetic reasons alone most women once we get rid of the body fat they've got great arms because just by way of the you know muscle engagement during these big compound lifts um you're using those muscles anyway okay what's your preferred deadlift if you had to choose or how do you think about navigating trap bar versus traditional versus Sumo anatomical like structure of an individual um so people that have uh exceptionally long arms are extremely good deadlifters typically um because they basically don't have to lean forwards very far to have the bar in their hands um my arms are like T-Rex arms like they are disproportionately shorter than everything else but also is great creates the illusion that I have massive arms when I don't really so for me um like I am not any way shape or form like built to be a good deadlifter so so you might be more of a trap bar deadlifter whereas he's more of a sumo deadlifter but when I do dead I for that reason I do Sumo because by widening my stance I can now get lower to the bar and then I don't have to be so horizontal to get down traditional would be very painful for you oh it is my spine and I've also extremely long spine so for my my my um my deadlift is so ugly it's very te like it's technically it looks disgusting but I'm doing all the right things like we know that a little bit of spinal curvature in a deadlift is okay if you are activating you know your your core and you're keeping tight um so yeah I have a hunchback of notr arm looking um conventional deadlift which is feet together um but Sumo deadlift is my preference because it enables me to get closer to the bar and I just feel like

[01:23:40] I'm in a better position to you know execute so interesting right out of the gate we're going to take uh a you know a woman who's never done these things before and we're going to program in some some getting to know know the squat getting to know the deadlift um you're going to also include isolation exercises and I assume they follow in the workout so you'll start with the prime movers and the combined hip hinges and then you'll move to leg extensions leg curls um what about uh where do where do split squatting and lunging FL in fit in yeah so typically I will uh incorporate you know at Max you know two large compound multi-joint uh exercises typically they are the first you know six to eight sets are your best sets they are like working sets and then what we tend to see is that any volume that's accured you know after those eight first working sets tend to you start to have like diminishing returns so big movers first isolation accessory exercises seconds so again the way that I would structure in something like lunges or leg extensions or hamstring curls or Cal raisers it depends on what that person is wanting to build truly that's that's all it is so again if we look at the um

[01:24:56] I guess minimum uh dose for hypertrophy when we look at like total set number we want to be shooting for somewhere around you know probably the 10 to 15 range per muscle group um there are a lot of when you say per muscle group you're counting quads distinct from hamstrings distinct from glutes distinct from cabs the trouble is and I guess a lot of people have a difficulty um you know trying to write their own program is that certain movements are multiple both so so I will often just give a you know yep that counts as this exercise and that muscle grip and a deadlift is going to Triple everything it's hitting everything but when you do the leg extension it only counts for quads leg curl only counts for hamstring exactly okay so you're going to you're saying we want by the end of this workout we want to have 10 to 15 boxes checked for each of those muscle groups y so let's just go through some of them so your your favorites for glutes obviously a squat and a deadlift y absolutely single leg

[01:25:54] DL uh interestingly I actually was looking at a systematic review uh on glute hypertrophy recently um and I guess they were using um muscle activation as opposed to True muscle fitness testing or some of those other more accurate me um methods of hypertrophy um but step-ups were actually as good as uh glute activation as some of your you know hip thrusts and you know squats um particularly some of the horizontal style step-ups or lunges where you're coming across the body so like a crossbench step up where you're taking the foot down one side and then coming back up um where there's a lot of stretch uh and lengthening taking place in the in the glute so yeah for for for for glute hypertrophy uh there's always you know a hip thrust a hinge of some sort or a bridge um usually some kind of abduction um an Abdu uction is basically uh taking your uh knees out um as opposed to adduction which is bringing them together so I'll find um different machines that uh enable that uh you can also do those on the cables as well with like an ankle attachment um so they're the the primary ones that I would use for for glutes those are great okay so deadlifts squats hip thrusters step ups and abduction y that's a lot so you got a lot to choose from there to just you got to get 10 so you don't have to be doing all of them every time yep and to be honest like as as that individual progresses um over uh I guess a 7-Day uh training block like we may be working up to um you know 30 sets on um you know each individual muscle group if they're able to to execute that um over a 7-Day period because of their training frequency obviously you know beginner we're probably going to be looking you know over 7-Day period they may get you know 10 to 15 sets um with their three or four training sessions but someone that's more advanced really may be pushing like up to 30 sets uh maybe even more but again there's a point where we have like diminishing returns where uh the inflammatory response to that training um just makes it impossible to continue making progress in which case we have the DLo okay so then for quads obviously a lot of what you mentioned is going to hit quads certainly the squat to some extent the deadlift depending on how they do it M the Step Up certainly uh RDL won uh abduction won't so then you add some dedicated stuff like leg extensions yep so leg extensions are a really simple one obviously minimal uh setup straight on the machine but I also like uh different leg press variations uh and different squat variations that get our knee into a position where there's far more forward knee travel I know there's a lot of uh contradictions

[01:28:51] I used to hear that all the time it's like don't put your knee over your toe you know it's dangerous for your knee now if someone's had a history of knee injuries that's something that you would want to take very slowly and um very progressively um but anything where we can get the knee traveling past the toes so by elevating your heels in something like a barbell squat my preferences honestly on a Smith machine because it really controls the movement pattern um and you only go forward so and so people know the Smith machine is the squat bar that has the hooks on it that's in tracks right so the part the path is vertical and it's controll it's completely fixed so uh I love that that exercise I think targeting my quads that's been a huge help uh and then also foot positioning on the leg press so again you're looking uh to have at the bottom of the movement um where your uh quads are in a uh lengthened position um you want to have lots of forward knee travel and I won't be specific in where you should put your feet because feet placement honestly depends on the machine that you've got access to because I've had some I've had to put my feet up quite High because of the movement plane of yeah so it's less where the feet go and it's more where the knees and toes are in relation to each other in the in the bottom position yes exactly yeah so that's kind of the so are you saying to the to the to the client um we want you to work to your level of comfort in getting knees over your toes in the leg press and that's going to maximize quad development and obviously you're going to work the back of the leg in the opposite position yep exactly so and then also there's a lot of benefits to doing like single leg work too um so many of us and I was honestly disgusted at my own uh imbalances when I tested it the other day I was doing some single leg squats um you know from a just a sitting to a box then uh standing on the box to going to the floor only um and it's very easy you know with lots of repeat training and lots of repeating the same movements um where we have a bit of a discrepancy so I really like to incorporate at least one single leg exercise um for every session if we start to add too many single arm or leg movements your program end up you know it's extremely long so that's that's a real consideration you know not everybody has three hours to train so we want to be concise uh to the point okay what are some of your favorite hamstring hits M so um my favorite is a seated uh hamstring curl and the reason for that is um it is better able to isolate your hamstrings than say a prone hamstring curl where you're in the uh you're laying on your stomach and you're kind of curling the machine in towards your hamstrings and part of that is just because of the position of the movement um when you're in a seated hamstring machine you've already got tension on the hamstrings cuz we're sitting in this kind of you know upright position um so it's a lot more tension on the hamstrings than if you're in a prone position where your hips are far more open um we we don't get the same kind of um shortening of the hamstring so my preference is to do a lot more volume on a seated machine uh and then I'm not saying you don't do any you know prone work um but I'll do less of that exercise the other exercise that

[01:32:08] I really love for hamstrings and glutes particularly the hamstring TI which I think a lot of women you know you'll see the bikini competitors specifically have these incredibly like tight um you know hamstring attachments um to their glutes um a lot of that is conditioning which basically just means getting rid of all the body fat you will see that um but uh adels and banded uh rdls so tell tell folks what an RDL is so uh remadi and deadlift uh I guess you are it's a hinging exercise and you're shifting your hips back to lengthen the hamstrings so you're loading the hamstrings in that exercise you can and we'll we'll link to videos of all these things so people can see what they cool so um you can do that with dumbbells you can do it with barbell uh you can do it with kettle bells if you don't have access to those and do you prefer to do these single leg so I'll do both yeah um again I for a compound movement if I'm trying to hammer my hamstrings I probably will start with an RDL because it's a big movement you know we're talking multi- joint and when you do it two legs you're loading on your back no in front of me so the barbell hangs in front all the dumbbells so you know for for me when I first started it's crazy how quickly you can Progressive you work at it I remember picking up 20 25b dumbbells to do my first set of RLS for sets of you know 12 and now I'm all the way up at 90 PB dumbbells for a set of 12 ardl which you you're holding two 90 in each hand yeah so I would never have thought that I could do that and again credit to my time in powerlifting to help me identify what I was really capable of yeah so what impresses me is not your hamstring strength to do that but your grip strength to do that mm um most men cannot hold two 90 lb dumbbells really absolutely look I got to be honest I get a little bit of help so again there's benefits to oh are you using a grip are you using a wrap grips absolutely so and again I people will say oh that's cheating like I don't want to use something that cheats like use your raw grip strength if the point of the exercise the point exercise is to hit your hamstrings to hit your hamstrings what's going to be the limiting

[01:34:24] Factor so so grips are like a no-brainer for me now when you do single leg M do you do contralateral weight or ipsilateral weight in other words if your left leg is on the ground are you going to hold the weight left hand or right hand so again for a beginner I would do opposing um because you're going to have greater stability as you become more advanced then same leg same arm absolutely um I think it just challenges you a different ways calls upon different muscle groups to help with stabilizing so for the client that we were discussing before that's you know kind of has some experience once to gain muscle I'd probably over the course of that six week Mesa cycle sorry over the the course of maybe their second or third training mesocycles I might incorporate you know the more advanced variation of a single leg RDL uh it might start you know opposing arm to leg and then as they advance I would move it to a single leg over you know that that 18 week 24 we period yeah uh okay so and then calves what are you doing for calves um combination of both I originally wasn't doing any Cal work because from an aesthetic perspective it's not something that you see a whole lot of I guess but um probably you know six sets per week I'd probably start again for someone that's brand new like three sets and then maybe in week two what standing tow presses seated seated seated or standing um I believe uh based on the research um seated tends to be a little bit better for hypertrophy outcomes I don't ask me the mechanics this is not my area of expertise but a study that I did a post on very recently was looking at the different feet positions and um I used to be the first to put my hand up and throw myself under the bus do the toes in like pigeon toe style car phrase pointless doesn't really yield um you know any meaningful results uh neutral stance and Toes facing out tend to be uh better for optimizing hypertrophy of you know I guess different aspects of your cough on their upper body day how do you focus now I know you I mean I'm still surprised to hear that you're not doing a lot of upper body for for a woman and what you're saying is the most important thing is taking the fat off to let the muscles show yeah um but in that one day what are they going to do for for chest for back for shoulders and arms yes I think one of the main things again that does differ between men and women's training programs is chest volume so men typically want to have jacked biceps

[01:37:01] Jack triceps big chest um there's less of an emphasis on that so the so the women in even in the fitness categories seem to be judged a lot on glutes hams shoulders quads back is so like it's less important they want to see a conditioned back but it's not really where a lot of the judging and time is spent unlike like you know traditional bodybuilders where like you look at your

[01:37:26] Kai greens where it's just got lat on lat on lat yeah so I will incorporate um I guess different back exercises um more predominantly in a program that I would for chest I defer back to the client do you want to do chess training I love bench press like again I've done powerlifting so to me like that's so empowering like trying to hit a one rip

[01:37:48] Max on a bench I love that but I'm not everybody so again I defer the person the person that I'm working with and let's assume that she has no interest in her strength on a bench it's really coming down to how she's going to look in the dress aesthetic some people really need um you know a lot of chest training or conversely they need a lot of back training due to their posture so that's a big consideration but um so a lot if a woman is sort of hunched forward yeah they're really kyotic they've got that rounding um they probably have extremely tight pectorals and um weak back musculature so in that case I would do a lot more volume on back and I probably wouldn't spend any time on any chest work so you know for that final one training session I might be looking to hit you know 15 sets of back and no chest at all and what types of exercises would you do so I would

[01:38:39] Target um the wide back midback so we're looking at our our lats um to get the lat the width of the back and that can help um I guess from an aesthetic perspective to create the illusion of a really small waste so a wide group pull Downs wide grip pullups assisted Pull-Ups for somebody that's just beginning and then progressing to body weight pull-ups and then weighted pull-up so again through you know the course of somebody training consistently over you know nine months say there's a very good chance they could go from doing no um body weight pull-ups to weighted pull-ups now most women can't do a single pull-up unassisted correct

[01:39:18] I'd say that probably 90% of females would not be able to do a single body we pull up and how many can you do I think my last am wrap was like 20 20 yeah okay so you you're at the point where you would use you weight iight yeah I add some weight but not a not a whole lot but um you know Beth Lewis who you met briefly the other day you know

[01:39:40] Beth is convinced that you can get any human being to do a body weight pull-up absolutely absolutely there'd have to be something you know like like from a neurological standpoint that would inhibit someone from being able to it was a lot of work I used to I was that person I could never do a pull-up I remember like when I first like got into lifting I started with bands um like the thickest green band possible with my feet in to help me and I could do about five reps with that um so yeah the thing that really uh facilitated um my strength in pull-ups I program those every single program for years every program and it was always the most intimidating exercise I hated it but I'd always put it first so I'd always been nervous going to training um if I knew I had an upper body day because I had to do like pull-ups but yeah I went from not being able to do like any body weight to being able to do 20 body weight over the span of like five years but I can tell you now there was probably maybe three or four programs over that entire time frame that I did not program specifically put ups and was the progression using l and less and less resistance on the bands but always sort of targeting a certain rep number yeah so I would pick you know somewhere in the hypertrophy rep range so that's typically anywhere from 8 to 12 um and yeah once I could do you know 12 um reps with a certain band I would progress to the next like lighter resistance and I just kept going once I got to 12 body weight pull-ups I was like o okay now we add like the weight belt with a little you know two 2 and A2 lb KY kettle ball or something and you know progress that way how much are you varying your hand position for both yourself and then obviously for the client in the situation so for me I again and this was primarily because of the aesthetic goal which was to widen my lats I would do a lot more um like prone grip um I guess I kind of targeted my ROM boids a little bit more um which would be a close grip pull-up um but I I don't know why I I didn't really do a whole lot of those sometimes I would um change up my Vari so if I had three sets programmed to failure say um my first set to failure I would do wide because that was the um muscle group that I wanted to work the most then I would switch to a neutral grip and then I might switch to an underhand grip and how much time do you need between sets to failure on pull-ups a long time you do not want to rush that um sometimes that would take five minutes between sets and I think that's where a lot of people find themselves um not being able to make progress and not just with pull-ups but for training in general they go way too fast and then the consequences they're not recovered when they start their next working set um and because they're still fatigued they're not able to execute the next working set with um to the same number of reps because they're not recovered so they may have to drop those weights and pick up something lighter um I used to do that and as a trainer I'd be on the floor you know you'd have 60 minutes with a client and you want to rush but the reality is if you can slow down your workouts and take as much time as you need and my rule of thumb is when your heart rate is back below 100 beats per minute uh for me probably is a little bit lower for men I think males tend to have slightly lower heart rate than females um so once my heart rate is back under 100 that's when I know I'm like okay I can probably think about doing my next set sorry okay interesting I'm glad you mentioned that I was going to ask about your rest phase um okay so anything you want to say about arms before we move on to the next metaphase if you like arms do arms if you don't like arms don't worry about it w this is this is so paradoxical I would guess looking at you that it's like I haven't done a bicep cool or tricep extension in 12 months so those arms that you have are simply the result of all of the stuff you carry yes the heavy things you're lifting with your hands like deadlifts and rdls coupled with obviously getting rid of you know fat absolutely I think especially for something like pull-ups you do actually get better at pull-ups uh the less body fat you have and the lighter you get um there's a you know there's a point where it crosses if you lose too much muscle but um this again this is a very interesting point right which is you can we can joke and say look biceps and triceps are not the most functional muscles in the world but being able to do a pull-up being able to do a deadlift that confers great benefit to life skills oh absolutely yes so so in some ways your bodybuilding training much more mirrors functional training what I would have expected yeah absolutely but

[01:44:26] I mean I think now let me just play devil's advocate for a moment how much of that is your genetics do you just genetically think you have big muscles in your arms and and that's why you can get away with this look I think if I was to look at my parents like my dad is freakishly muscular for somebody that doesn't do anything in the gym he like grew up I guess being in very like laborous type jobs so like he's always been extremely lean uh and I think he has short um humorous like I do so I guess it kind of creates this illusion of more muscle it's easier to grow it looks you know if you think about a long muscle it's a lot more muscle you've got to grow to make it look big so um I think just my the way that I'm put together probably has assisted in some ways but that's not to say that it's not possible for other people as well um do you do some deltoid stuff lots of training for shoulders yeah so what are your what are your sort of hits on deltoid mhm um my favorites are probably scrape the rack shoulder press I don't know if you've ever done those but essentially you're up against a squat rack um with a barbell on you can do it kneeling uh or standing I like kneeling because it eliminates um the ability to cheat when you're standing you can use a bit of momentum to keep pushing so kneeling scrape the r press and you basically driving that barbell into the the rack and what angle what's the humoral angle at the top um well you're pretty basically extended pretty vertically yeah so you have to have good range of motion and Mobility for your shoulders um one that I don't do with everybody but I do because I do have a lot of Mobility with my shoulders behind the neck shoulder pressing wow on a a

[01:46:08] Smith machine though I only do it in on the Smith machine because it keeps me in a very safe uh fixed plane like it's not allow I'm not using dumbbells where I'm swerving everywhere or a free barbell so I really like that because it's I had some shoulder injuries what about for somebody who can't put who can't really press overhead due to shoulder injuries or impingements and things like that yeah so again I would my area of expertise isn't specifically on like

[01:46:35] Rehabilitation but I would be working with a a specialist with that but lateral raises is probably another thing that people can do um to improve their um like medial shoulder uh and also then reults um so you can do like a reverse Peck fly where you're kind of pushing away if you've got access to cables you can do a cable crossover um to hit your re dels and um what else just face pools those types of exercises okay so let's say we've progressed the intensity of all of this

[01:47:09] U which means we've we've overloaded so we've added sets we've added reps we've added intensity we're eight months in and let's assume we've hit our hypertrophy goals uh you do another dexa and remember the initial goal was gain five pounds of muscle lose five pounds of fat if she has met her hypertrophy goal and gain five pounds of muscle how much fat do you think has changed at that point you think she's up neutral absolutely uh it depends on their dietary intake to be honest so um I think we can go through a you know a period of progressive overload with an intentional building phase um and do all the right things when it comes to the resistance training but the other key piece to the success of that build is diet so how much was the client able to adhere to their dietary requirements during that time um you know it's probably like 50% of the the outcomes so

[01:48:10] I think so going back to the beginning if um I'm going to just create a stereotype which is she was sort of reasonable in total energy intake but protein deficient mhm relative to your goals so what would be your protein goals for her yeah so it's uh honestly exactly the same as it is um males to females um the only difference is going to be the absolute total Target that we have for a female because our body lean body mass is a little bit lower so the required um or the the protein reference ranges to optimize um hypertrophy are anywhere from say 1.8 g of protein per kilogram of lean body mass uh all the way up to three gram of protein per kilogram of lean body mass so um based on the individual's dietary preferences um and what foods they like some people love protein I've had clients that can't stand it and it's a real struggle for them to which blows my mind because I would probably live on meat if I had to pick one food group that I'd have to survive on for the rest of time but um I would pick something that is realistic for them within that range so you know for but you ate that whole 16o steak

[01:49:22] Yesterday by I sure did I was hoping you were going to I was hoping there's going to be a little piece left over for me I told you I do enjoy protein so but yeah I think it it really comes down to um their preferences and there isn't one number that's better than another um but consistency is important so we don't want to be chopping and changing your protein and it you know bouncing all over the place um for a couple of reasons and that is that you can potentially um reduce or limit your potential um but it also impacts your energy balance because protein um has a far higher thermogenic effect of food than you know carbohydrate and or fat so if that's bouncing around you're effectively moving and shifting your energy balance so you know that that would not be favorable for somebody that is trying to gain muscle and you know 90% of their Pro their dietary calories are now coming from protein um you know it's actually might be shifting their energy balance in a negative Direction and if she was starting out let's just

[01:50:24] I'm making math up but she's 140 lb and she's okay being 140 lb at the end but that 10 PB swap in body comp is important um do you ex do you basically and let's assume she's weight stable coming into this exercise do you um basically keep her calorie stable and just switch the macros around to increase protein yeah initially absolutely I would have a look at what her current dietary intake would be and um if it was below the recommended reference range I'd pick a number that you know aligned with her lean body mass and her ability to nail that number consistently then progressively throughout that building phase we would want to be you know slowly adding in calories um if we look at the um overfeeding studies um which unfortunately there's not as much um information available to us is there are like weight loss studies but of those that we do have if we were to compare um somebody being in a like a surplus of say 20% above their maintenance calories versus 40% versus 60% um what we tend to see is that the best results and I should quantify what I mean by best um the most amount of muscle mass that would be gained during a given time frame would be optimal at about that 20%

[01:51:42] Mark if we go up to 40 or up to 60 what we just end up seeing is excess 40 fat gain it doesn't like continue to get better the more you eat so do let's just again let's making this up she's at 2 ,000 KCAL coming in does that mean you're actually going to put her at a surplus even though you're you don't want her to gain weight you just want her to gain lean mass well I think to begin with just for that initial week I

[01:52:06] I like to if someone can tell me that they're eating a certain number of calories I want to see the data let's assume that you did that let's assume you did a food log and she comes in at 2,000 weight stable yep so if that's her maintenance calories um that's not optimal we want to go to a small take 2400 yeah well it might be yeah it might be a 10 to 20% % Surplus and again part of that decision is also based on the individual's comfort with adding body fat and for females that is the hardest group of people that I work with to encourage to gain body fat so usually I'm working within a far more restrictive calorie

[01:52:39] Surplus than I would if I'm working with a male client they're a lot more open to gaining some body fat to facilitate their gains so if I'm being real optimal would be 20% most women will not adhere to that so I'm probably going to prescribe something that's more likely going to reflect the reality and that is like a 10% increase above their M how would this change if she said she's 140

[01:53:03] PBS she wants to weigh 130 next year so she she wants to lose 10 PBS but wants it to all be fat loss so this will also improve body composition because she's going to just lose 10 pounds of fat but wants to lose no muscle which still functionally means putting on some muscle to offset the the fat loss would you then not put her in a calorie

[01:53:25] Surplus during the building phase no I still would because her ability to acquire that new tissue is going to be um it's energetically demanding yeah you you need it seress energy to come from somewhere now if somebody is starting with a higher body fat percentage now we've got somebody that has you know they have an energy reserve and we can petition that stored body fat and that's the whole concept behind you know body recomposition so for some individuals if they do have body fat I may not need to put them in a Major Surplus so it's so client dependent you know I have to look at them and the complete picture so um it might not be a massive Surplus at all if they were you know 20% body fat it might just be let's nail these calories for the next six months and over time we will see some positive changes because you've got enough body fat available to help with the building and the foundations of that new sceletal tissue okay so now it's 8 months in yep we're 2third of the way to our goal

[01:54:25] She's On Target for lean mass she's also of course added a little bit of fat Mass you now have four months to get that fat off and keep the lean tissue on what changes in nutrition and then what changes in the gym yeah so changes in the gym initially are negligible I think there's a Mis U misconception that suddenly everything changes when you start dieting the goal for dieting is truly to be able to keep you on as higher calories as possible with as little increase in activity as possible whilst still achieving a targeted rate of weekly weight loss so to begin with their training may say exactly the same it might make we might make a couple of tweaks because they're bored and they need need to change up but the concept the principles of that training program and structure does not change unless suddenly they decided that they no longer want those giant glutes and we put back in you know chest training but you know the principles St the same from a diet perspective um that is again we kind of look at okay now that we've acquired a little bit of body fat uh we want to get all of that off you know in time through this um this the wedding or whatever the event is um I basically do a back calculation um so and I I pick a targeted weekly rate of weight loss that does not exceed more than 1.5% of their body weight so per what unit week per week okay yeah if we again if you look at the that still sounds like a lot it it is it can be a lot and some people may not have the that could be 2 pounds a week that's huge again but it would be relative to the individual so you know 200b male that's a lot um but even this 140b woman yeah 1.4b that's 1% so we're looking at close to 2 pound so um again we've got to be realistic with how much can be achieved in a 7-Day period for that person so um choosing that percentage rate of loss is important why it's important is because we when we see extreme dietory interventions carried out um continuous diet uh interventions that push weight loss Beyond those numbers we are increasing the risk of metabolic adaptation so now we're starting to look at um you know more um I guess adaptive mechanisms a greater uh response to um dieting or our self-defense system really really you know ramps up um we become far more efficient so we want to keep the rate at that that level and that will help to keep your BMR your basil metabolic rate nice and high and it's protective of your muscle mass beyond that 1 and a half percent that's when we really start to see people actually losing a greater percent of muscle muscle mass uh and lean tissues as opposed to Fat Loss so you know I think a lot of people will argue with me in the first few weeks when we you put together a program for them and they're like that just doesn't seem like enough weight loss I'm used to seeing you know two kilos a week and I'd say to you so if you're worried about the number on the scale if that's all you're worried about what have I said to you that that 2 kilos you lost not a single bit of fat it was mostly lean tissue is that still okay and they're like oh okay so you know we've got to be realistic with what you can do in a week and how it might impact muscle loss um and then determining What calorie deficit that actually require so um we have a really wonderful uh I guess calculation in one of our books the complete contest bre card and I believe it's also in Fat Loss forever um and that outlines what amount of calories is required to lose a certain amount of body weight in grams so it's a really neat little equation um and we can calculate very accurately for the average person that doesn't have crazy you know a really fast metabolism or really slow metabolism what the deficit is that they need to lose that 1 and a half% or whatever number it might be so it's it's really neat I can pretty much forecast exactly what someone how does a person do this practically so there's on the one hand there's there's the calculation which let's just say it comes out and says okay we're going to reduce your intake from what was 2400 now down to you know 18875 calories um but then there's the application of that right which is you know if this person doesn't have a chef that can prepare every meal that they're going to eat with a scale how do they go about doing that I mean this can be really difficult stuff to go weighing everything and I don't see how you could reach that level of precision without a scale yes so it is really tough and I think one of the things that I will say to people that I've worked with um is there is so much value in giving or I guess dedicating a set amount of time to to weigh your food to get familiar to calibrate and learn you know what what a 4 ooun piece of chicken looks like what you know um X food weighs on the scale I think having that knowledge and an understanding of what it represents from a caloric perspective and from its macronutrient um like the constituents of that food knowledge is power and I I really struggle with people that like don't want to invest that time because that is a lifelong skill skill that once you know how to do it and it might take you 6 months to get the hang of it but like for me now I can and I've been doing this for over 12 years um is I can estimate anything and Eyeball it so you get really good so there is a lot of uh

[02:00:07] I guess um accountability coaching homework tasks um I think getting them like uh practical uh tools and resources to learn how to do that um which is kind of what's involved in that whole you know weekly check-in and that coaching process so as she gets closer and closer to you know this this event again let's just use it as this wedding example so she's four weeks out and you know do you have a sense of where she would need to be a month out on those goals to hit the target yeah absolutely I think when we get to probably within three to 5% of their their gold body fat percentage like that's when I can start to tell so uh there's a lot of um I guess photo exchange so we have so much data that we collect for a client and that can be super helpful to make um you know accurate analysis but there's so many benefits to also having that supplemented with you know an actual physical picture and if we're not always looking at somebody's dexa scan you know every six weeks as they're going which is not always feasible for every client depends on the clientele that you're working with but um we don't always have that data available so it really does come down to looking at their you know macr tracking watching their weight

[02:01:26] Trends uh and then coupling that with their pictures to be able to see you know body fat losses actually happening and the situation I described 130 or 140 PB woman who's going to be the same weight a year later but have a 5B switch how visibly different is that probably not as much as you would think okay so maybe that goal wasn't ambitious enough no but if if that was and again I you have to look at what is required for somebody to you know develop the muscularity of like a an Elite Fitness professional um that's like a 10year process for some people so

[02:02:02] I think again that that5 PS is realistic for somebody to add but how notable is that going to be you know probably depends on what they're starting with too it really does it really does and I think how lean they get at the end too and sometimes the first attempt at Fat Loss it doesn't get you to the goal and it takes multiple attempts of coming out of this diet process through recovery diets uh and then fat loss again and then another recovery diet um before we really start to kind of achieve the ideal that that client is wanting so let's talk about that so she hits her goal yep which is five and five and she's pleased in that she hit her goal yep she looks better in her wedding dress than she would have a year sooner but to your point she's like I have greater ambition here I would like to be even leaner a year from now um and I like this process but I don't feel like being as restrictive right now so I'm about to go on my honeymoon to Italy um sounds amazing yeah how do I recover from this without doing without undoing all the good I did in the last year yeah and I think you know again looking at the the research that we have and you know some of these longitudinal studies um that show us what happened with fat loss and you know the success um the SE the success rates of fat loss you know over a dietary intervention people don't necessarily have a difficult time losing the weight it is this um inability to keep it off um and a lot of that is actually um I guess the reasons that it occurs is because typically outside you know good governance of a good coach um people do things in such extremes so they've done everything wrong during their Diet phase and the consequence is they've lost a lot of muscle mass during that fat loss that negatively impacts their basil metabolic rat and now their metabolism um is you know their body's requirements are a lot less um they're coming up against hormonal changes that impact their appetite regulating hormones so most people you know post-diet experience some some form of hyper phasia which um for people that don't know what that is it's just like that excess extreme desire to eat uh more than what is physiologically required um by their bodies so if they aren't conscious of that happening and they're not aware that there are these hormonal changes the natural inclination post diet is to go back to what you were doing before especially if you haven't chosen a dietary approach that works for your food preferences and this is where we see a lot of people struggling with

[02:04:48] I've tried this diet um it didn't work tried this when it didn't work and then they end up going back to what they like so if you can slowly reintroduce your calories post diet um and unfortunately that means that that whole process still feels like the diet and I can say like as somebody that has you know just a few weeks ago finished my competition I didn't get as lean so the hunger response was not as severe as it's been in the past but it's still there it is really hard to continue to regulate when the goal is now out of sight or at least the the goal that you were getting close to is leaving because doing a reverse diet they you're not getting that positive visual response this is intrinsic and you can't see your metabolism improving the only data or evidence that you have when you're reversing is seeing the small little increases in calories like oh cool I get to eat 100 more calories this week you know so it takes a good number of weeks to be able to get your calories back up to a point where it's like oh it's mean it's made a meaningful difference to my life you know I can have you know a couple of glasses of wine now with you know my friends and I've been able to incorporate my dessert again so it's a really difficult um process and a lot of how many weeks does that last it depends and again um for a lot of folks you're trying to get them initially rule number one for setting a reverse diet after you've finished being in a deficit is just finding your new maintenance calories um and you can assess that by looking at how much weight you have lost over you know the weeks the final couple of weeks in your um fat loss phase so we can go back and predict what they are for our so for this woman technically if her maintenance was 2,000 coming in it's probably going to be a lot it's probably going to be oh I was going to say a little bit higher because even though her weight is the same she has more muscle she may have more muscle mass but it depends how lean she wants to get because oh yeah yeah but this is saying um you're you're saying if she wants to continue to get leaner not I'm saying if she's happy to stay at that 140 for another six months before she begins her next cycle she might actually come in at 2100 or 2200 calories before you then say okay now the time is we're going to take off another five pounds of fat so I a completely understand what you're saying however the problem is even if she has added 5 pounds of muscle mass which we know them in theory you know muscle is very energetically demanding tissue it requires more calories so you would expect there to be a shift a positive shift in their

[02:07:32] BMR yes when she did that at the end of the build yes but that fat loss phase that someone did to get the weight back down again depending how long it took how extreme we had to go um and how uh equipped they were to execute the deficit we needed and what I mean by that is did we need to do a whole L more cardio to create the deficit what was the intensity of that cardio like she could have lost some of that muscle during the fat loss phase and evidently you will lose muscle anyway like it's you will always lose muscle mass when you attempt a fat loss phase um but how the leaner you get the greater the risk of that muscle loss is because you no longer have that caloric cushioning to um support that so um her metabolism even when we go back to her new maintenance calories after she's added more muscle so physically she's going to look better she still may be lower at the start of that reverse diet which is really interesting to think so there may be some work that's needed to be done reversing just to get her back to maybe that 2,000 calories that she was on she may not be able to go straight back to that it takes weeks so the way that you do that is slow and incremental increases week by week um and You observe the the weight gain and then you adjust respond accordingly so I guess before we wrap um are there any other specific differences in sort of male and female training that we could shed light on yeah so I think you know outside like the specificity of like putting together an actual program and targeting certain muscles muscle groups rather um people may have actually heard um somewhere along their fitness journey that women tend to do better with higher rep ranges and males do better with uh lower rep ranges and traditionally I think there's there's a reason why we tend to see that that style of programming um you know more prominent you know in the gym scene and part of that is due to I guess some of the differences in sex hormones um and that kind of has an impact on our muscle fiber type so females actually have a greater percentage of type one muscle fibers than do males um and the positive consequence of that um difference there for females is that it means that we're better able to transport nutrients uh into the tissues and also clear um different metabolites um you know during activi so the benefit there is that women tend to be less fatigable um when it comes to training and another thing that kind of coincides really nicely with that is that women um again in in both the fed and the fasted State tend to do better at utilizing um fatty acids so again it means that we're less

[02:10:28] Reliant upon some of those glycolytic um you know Pathways or Anor robic processes so um we do better um in when it comes to recovery from um different types of training so when it comes to building out that training program again I'm being pretty meticulous here but men I would often opt for a little bit more strength specific training um and I guess if you look at the definitions of strength training it's the rep rang is between 1 to six um then you've got your moderate rep ranges or we call that the hypertrophy rep range um I'll have more of that with females and then the which is about 8 to 12 8 to 12 8 to 15 and then we've got our endurance strength training which is you know your 15 to 20 reps so some like women will um say that they are enjoy that type of training and they're able to tolerate it better um more so than some of the strength-based training but I would I would still argue that females when you're you know put in the right hands with a good qualified coach um that they could equally enjoy that style of training too but again that's thinking about like the actual differences you know that muscle fiber type and part of that's due to I believe it's estrogen um you know women having a higher level of estrogen we've got more estrogen receptors I believe on our sceletal tissues and that's one of the benefits um for you know that nutrient transport so now that's interesting wouldn't that also suggest that women would have an easier time training without ingestion of glucose right um at least in theory and yet I feel like maybe it's just looking at my wife she does not like to train on an empty stomach she she needs something to you know she needs to be drinking or eating something beforehand yeah I think but I think you mentioned you like to train an empty stomach I'm the opposite so again

[02:12:23] I think it's really subjective um we can the science can always say certain things but we've also then got to take into the into account I think the individual's you know perception and often it's you know it is very subjective so for me as somebody that has struggled with like irritable bow syndrome for you know the last 10 years of life I can't think of anything worse than trying to train with anything in my stomach I might have a couple of coffees in the morning um but I'm keeping you know pretty low gut irritant type foods because the minute I feel some kind of you know distension or you know pain in my stomach I cannot train I would rather train hungry with a rumbling stomach than try to have to execute with a full stomach so but again endurance training very different to you know more anerobic training like the resistance training that I do is probably more um you know anerobic so it might be just due to the differences in um you know exercise type any other differences that we should be aware of as far as female and male uh either through respon to response to nutrient or load um I think again we speaking to sex hormones I think the menstrual cycle is probably the only other thing that kind of Springs to mind and um there's been a lot more um information becoming available on um that topic as it relates to um hypertrophy outcomes and strength training and again there's probably four studies um that are you know high quality at the moment that I can think of that um again tend to be kind of on the fence um half of them show that um you know during the second phase the ludal phase of your menstrual cycle um when progesterone is high and pro estrogen is low that subjectively uh strength decreases for females during training um and then during the earlier parts of training when gestion is low um you know people report to feel a lot better with their training the performance is better the strength is improved but again it's like it's a 50/50 for clients so when it comes to female programming I as a default and if it's it doesn't seem to impact them that's great but I will default to setting D loads um on or around their menstrual cycle so you might go two weeks on two weeks like you could upload two weeks download two weeks mhm yep wow yeah it might be in the middle of a m cycle but again it it depends on how serious they are about their progression but I'm guessing that's something a lot of male trainers don't think about no probably not at all absolutely and like just ability to be adherent and like your energy mood sleep you know all of those things can be impacted around your cycle um constipation like is another prevalent symptom of um you know men menes so you know that that Absol absolutely impacts people's energy levels and like motivation to train so yeah how many times have you found yourself training clients post pregnancy and in menopause do you do you have a high number of clients in those two categories yeah actually uh more recently my clientele has shifted more to Middle AG I'd say majority of my clients now are probably 35 to 65 um and yeah I think that transition going from you know High high levels or higher levels normal levels of testosterone for females to low level uh during menopause and the changes in estrogen it's really hard on females um and a funny story my mom did not even know um that there was like symptoms that came along with um you know menopause she was like oh I just I knew women couldn't you know have children anymore but she's not you know super scientific in anyways she didn't know she was going to have hot flashes no she had idea about any of these symptoms and you know for her she was so upset and like just frustrated that she didn't have any energy or she didn't want to go for a walks anymore or go to a Pilates classes whatever she was doing and um yeah I said to like there's so much benefit to number one like going and getting those levels tested um I believe you're a big advocate of hormone replacement therapy yeah yeah um just the just putting somebody back into those normal reference ranges in the benefit that that has not just on like seeing a number move on you know their biomarkers but what that does for their you know quality of life and how much more motivated people might then be to be active you know as we age and stay you know involved in sport it's it's crazy and so do you see this difference then in clients where you have menopausal women who are not on hormone replacement therapy versus those who are and do you see a fundamental difference both in body composition and work and work tolerance absolutely and I would say unfortunately for the women that aren't proactive and aren't on some kind of um hormone replacement therapy we tend to see those women coming in with extremely low calorie intakes and extreme exercise output so it's like they're burning the candle at both ends and they're feeling frustrated because they're like I already eat nothing you know I'm training multiple times a day

[02:17:41] I'm doing all this cardio and I just I can't lose fat or and I've only gotten fatter you know during this process which is likely to happen because if you've been dealing with those negative symptoms for a long period of time like naturally if you're not motivated and you don't feel good you're not going to train so you know people's quality of exercise goes down now they're losing lean body mass and they're probably as

[02:18:04] I've experienced aging tends to lend more towards the Finer Things in life and you know you're gravitating towards you know more indulgent type foods and a different lifestyle that keeps you less active unless you're very proactive about it so people gain a lot of weight during that time frame so um um yeah we obviously defer out to The Experts for the the hormonal replacement therapy and then integrate with our um I guess interventions the reverse diet um to get their calories back up to something that feels manageable and now they're enjoying you know all their favorite foods again they they have a social life again and they just feel so much better with that extra energy and then the hormones returning to to normal and then what about women after having kids you know it's a lot of women will say it's just not the same uh speaking about their body right so and and body composition so is there anything that you've noticed in clients where you think we have to do something a little bit different you know there there's there's the 40-year-old woman who's never had kids and then there's the 40-year old woman who's had three kids and both of them are still premenopausal but um do you notice anything different between them yeah I think the first one that Springs to mind is just the available time that they have for their goals that is such a huge like consideration for all of this um I can think very distinctly of a couple of clients that I have that did not or they've either had children and they've now grown up and moved out so they have you know all the Time in the

[02:19:41] World to um you know do what they want to do with their their hobbies and their their physique goals or health goals but for people that have children it is really really hard and again I think it comes back to managing expectations um I am the coach that will turn people away if they you know here's the goal that I want to achieve Holly um you know 50s I've got to do it but they've also got three kids um you know they only have a very limited amount of time that they can apply to you know meal preparation maybe they have a limited income and they can't have a chef you know like we do that comes in and helps out during you know those really busy times they don't have Nanny fulltime to come and support them so um there are major differences in what can be achieved realistically and I think you know kind of looking at someone's lifestyle um it is so important and I think women don't give themselves enough um credit for the amount of time that they are taking in these other obligations but from the standpoint of that woman who's say 40 mom of three who's got 10 pounds she simply cannot shed can you guess whether most of that is going to come from dietary restriction versus increase activity versus what combination um do do you have a sense just hormonally which one is Ping her because I you know one of the things in our practice that really we don't put emphasis on due to the sheer ignorance around it is you know body composition right I mean we we'll say to that woman look we're we're interested in making you as metabolically healthy as possible that won't necessarily come with the

[02:21:19] Improvement in body composition you had it won't necessarily take you to your pre pregancy weight um but as you said a lot of people are coming to you and that's their primary thing right they're like yes I'd like to be healthier but you know quite frankly I want to be able to fit into the clothes that I was wearing two years ago yeah that's that's a tough one um I have said multiple times to women you need to get a you need to get a new wardrobe like as simple as that like it's the easiest thing or easiest way to instantly feel better about yourself now you've got a pair of clothes that are more flattering for your now physique it's going to improve your mental health first and foremost but it's not constantly like you're not pulling and tugging on the clothing that like it makes you think about your body and if you're already in an unhappy place like that's a bad place to begin with but is it realistic for somebody to get back to their pre-pregnancy body weight maybe but for a lot of women if you have partaken in some kind of exercise um you know it's

[02:22:16] Pro whether it's running or swimming or cycling if there's anything that's applying some kind of like load and resistance you've probably added a lot of muscle since you were pregnant you know however many years ago too so to expect that you're going to see the same number on the scale often that's not realistic because they've built so much muscle over the course of their life that they would never be that weight again they'd have to lose all this muscle and some to to get back to that so I really wish that I could give you a better answer here do I see any differences like even from a hormonal perspective no not really I think that with um proper nutrition intervention and that is like optimizing somebody's metabolism through um the process of reverse dieting so we want to sit right on the edge of like every week we're trying to positively adapt and get their metabolism to to move up and that can be done without any changes in lean body mass like there is an true an adaptation that takes place um so yeah we're trying to optimize their dietary interventions and get them you know doing what we know to be adequate from a training standpoint like that is what will help that person get to this end goal and it just means it's going to take a lot longer for a mom of three just because they don't have the ability to do it where where do you think this this goes from here for you do you plan to continue bodybuilding I don't know I think that part of me feels really compelled to stay in the industry and keep keep showing up maybe on a yearly basis to to be an advocate for the people that are still suffering in silence I think that there's so many people that have difficulties you know sharing their struggles um you know reaching out for help gaining getting support and I've seen a massive shift in the type of work that I'm doing and the education that

[02:24:10] I'm sharing now because um it's a really hard life to live and it's it can be very unrewarding it can feel like what's the point if if you can't keep you know making progress and or if you never really if you never really work on the psychological dysfunction that might be happening like what's the why so I feel a little bit conflicted coming back and staying because I don't have the same I guess the same feeling towards competing anymore I don't I no longer desire the leanness I really don't I don't I I can do the process now and I was really worried about my last competition because I thought now that I don't have this eating disorder am I going to have what it takes to execute like or was that previously just driven by a psychological condition so that it was nerve-wracking but I was able to do it but I'm I'm no longer attached to the body so I want to be somebody that can be an advocate to help people realize that if you do the work you can do do these together they don't they don't exist you know exclusive of each other I think you can do a bodybuilding show and not have some kind of eating disorder but also recognize that it's it's an extreme sport it's an extreme sport and it requires a lot of sacrifice and personally right now I'm so passionate about mental health and the idea of potentially stepping back from everything that I do in the fitness industry and going back and doing a PhD in the area of neuropsych ology or mental health and Ed disorders that um it may not be something that I have in my foreseeable future I I just don't know but I want to I want to help people

[02:25:59] I know that there is so many women that would benefit from learning that hey I struggled with all of these feelings and you know low self-confidence and low self-esteem um and that there's another way aside from calorie restriction and dietary restriction that can lead me to the same positive you know outcomes and value as a human so how do you think about aging yourself I mean how do you think about being 50 being 60 not looking like you do today given the the journey you've been on and the struggle you've been through and how closely those have been intertwined my Approach is all about longevity I think um if you had have asked me that two years ago I would still be I'm still going to look amazing but I think my perception or my ideals about what my life should be um in order to truly you know be happy um it doesn't look like me slaving away in the gym anymore it doesn't look like me being a lifelong competitor that doesn't mean that I want to let myself go and you know not have any interest in exercise at all but I think I would like to remain and I hate using this word like functionally fit but I want my body to be able to move like I want to be able to if someone says to me hey let's go for a 5K run like I want to be able to do that if I you know need to be fast and agile for something so I think my training is probably going to gravitate a little bit more away from the gym um and incorporate just some more hobbies and things that keep me active and functioning well um but I will always lift because I know the benefits um that resistance training can have on your body but you're okay with the changes that are going to come which is you know you're not going to be 12% body fed yeah absolutely I and I think even in like six weeks I will no longer even look like I do now like I'm very content with the idea that um I can still be healthy at a much higher body fat percentage um and as long as I have the muscle mass underneath that body fat I know that that is protective in so many ways you know I'm thinking about you know reducing my risk of like bone degenerative conditions like osteoporosis when I get old like resistance training anything that applies you know tension and stress on the bone you know those little bone creating cells you know they ramp up and now I've got greater bone density like I think about that my dad struggles severely with osteoporosis and arthritis your dad yeah very much so he's he needs a double shoulder Rec construction and won't do it but yeah I I you know I think that's that's kind of the message we we give to our patients both men and women but I think it's more important for women to hear because I think um

[02:28:45] Sometimes women are a little bit more governed by the scale than by what's what's underneath and again that's stereotype but I see it but it's real it's real and what we say is I'm much more concerned with how much muscle mass we can put on you and how much we can increase the density of your bones as you age and even if we never take an ounce of fat off you um which by the way would mean you'd potentially even gain weight a little bit as you age but if that weight is predominantly lean tissue and we're maintaining the Integrity of your skeletal structure you're going to live a better life you are and I think the first thing that women have to do and again I don't want to stereotype but ladies this is just the reality of how we are wired uh in today's day and age but letting go of some of that um identity um and this belief that we need to look a certain way um there's one thing to being you know feeling comfortable and confident um but let's focus on the important things of life and I think you know to me after having gone through all of this and recovered um or actively and always will be a recovering uh person with an eating disorder but you know there's so many other things now to me that are so much more important and you know my long-term health is important um I do want to make sure that I've got good bone health I don't want to have you know bone diseases I want to be able to live my life to the best and um you know I think mentally as well I'm I'm probably going to stay active because of all the benefits that we know for mental health like anxiety um me uh depression depressive like symptoms um I want to optimize like my health and staying so fixated on the scale and body fat and bit of cellulite ah it's like the least of my concerns right now which is a really weird thing for me to say as someone that like used to feel like unless I was stage lean year round I was not a worthy human so yeah I think there needs to be a big shift in what we're delivering to our like to our patients and to our clients because if we look at social media it's really easy to get you know engrossed in you know social media's thin ideals and filters and I think the best step that I ever took was just unfollow like all the accounts that are only focused on the aesthetic I just nope I don't look at them anymore I don't like I read about the things that

[02:31:20] I want to learn more about if I want to feel happy gosh I've got like a hundred books that I've read that are all on you know how to change your mind how to be happy what is life's purpose um how to break habits like that's where I spend my time now I'm looking to optimize myself as a human and yeah it means that there's less need for for all that aesthetic stuff well Holly thank you so much for for sharing all both the insights and also obviously the the really deeply personal stuff that actually I think we probably resonate uh with many people both men and women thank you very much thank you for having me it's been awesome [Music]
