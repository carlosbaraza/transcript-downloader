[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and their feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating or something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription I guess this week is Jocko and like Madonna sting or Cher he's one of those rare individuals that only needs to go by one name for those not familiar with Jocko he spent 20 years in the SEAL Teams where he was a commander of SEAL team threes task bruiser I believe which led the Battle of Ramadi becoming one of them are decorated Special Operations units of the Iraq war shocker returned from the Iraq war served as an officer in charge of training seals on the west coast and ultimately when he stepped down from that role he co-founded Ashland front a leadership consulting company along the way he's become a New York Times bestselling author on leadership and has also written a number of frankly fantastic kids books which my kids adore he hosts the jackal podcast which is an amazing podcast and of all the podcasts

[00:04:57] I've ever been on that episode that I did with Jocko is certainly one of my favorites he's a black belt in jujitsu and the co-founder of victory MMA in San Diego I'm at Jocko maybe four years ago through another mutual friend Kirk parsley himself a seal this podcast was a ton of fun I also took a while we sort of lost track of time and before you knew it I realized this was going to have to be released over two weeks and not just one in this episode Jocko and I cover objectives strategy tactics both in concept but also using specific examples from his experience we talked about training versus actual combat when you should be humble and when you shouldn't being wrong as a person and as a leader dealing with loss and the prospect of death the importance of having protocols in place what is worth putting energy into and what is not what SEAL training was actually like transitioning from deployments and post military life into civilian life obeying orders and then we actually had this total tangent where we talked about US history with respect to various wars from World War one all the way forward at the end of this episode we talk a little about decisions in hindsight so without further delay please enjoy the first part of my conversation with chocolate dude it's so nice to have you here thanks for having me and I have to tell you right up front when my daughter left this morning she said you have to stall as long as possible because I want him to be there when I get home from school what time does she get home we'll make it happen you're sort of like snuffleupagus to her like she knows so much about snuffleupagus she sees videos of snuffleupagus she listens to snuffleupagus talk she reads his books but she doesn't know if he exists he exists but I don't want to disappoint her maybe we should keep the mystery there and I should get out of here I'll be like Oh Olivia I'm so sorry you just missed yeah and you gotta say he wanted to stay but he had to go and save the world so he couldn't stick around there was a crisis big bird was in trouble and he just had to go there you go when we had dinner was that about two three months ago something like they have which means when I watched you have dinner oh yeah that's right because you were fasting that was the best looking hummus I'd ever seen oh I'm sure it was

[00:07:11] I'm sure was you were four days in three days in I was on day five oh yeah which actually is easier by day five you're over the hump got it your energy is incredible you're smoking down the ketones so if that dinner were day to be hard it would have been more unpleasant but we got talking about something that we had been talking about for a year which was there may be a few people who can speak to a concept that's near and dear to my heart better than you can which is this notion of differentiating between an objective strategy and tactics and I think this came up it literally came up through something in social media where I had made a point I don't even recall what the point was but so I'll use a different example but your response was epic it was sort of like in 140 characters you just completely embodied what I was trying to say poorly in like a treatise right so I'll tell sort of my story about it quickly so that I want you to be able to sort of expand on this so I met this guy once named Dennis Calabrese and he really changed the way I thought about this because he has this sort of framework for solving hard problems which is you have to start with defining your objective and you have to do that really clearly most people actually even miss that step you then have to actually put a strategy in place and strategies are frameworks are scaffoldings upon which you will hang tactics and he said most people if they're lucky enough to form the objective correctly which they usually aren't immediately go to tactics without this strategic piece in the middle so when you think about that I mean you lived that right I mean that's sort of anyone doing something senior in the military is intimately familiar with that is that something that you learned along the way was it something that was specifically taught or modeled I think I learned it from a leadership perspective realizing at some point in my leadership career in the military that if the frontline troops didn't understand things at a little bit higher level than the tactical level then they couldn't make decisions on their own and then decentralized command doesn't work and now we've got a real problem so one of the things that can happen is and this is something that I would try and teach the young seals when I ended up in that role is that a mistake that you make on a tactical level can have a strategic negative impact so the classic examples of this are one classic example I would say just from the Iraq war is the Abu

[00:09:33] Ghraib prison scandal so you take a bunch of young soldiers and they're literally 18 19 20 years old you put them in charge of detainee treatment at a holding facility in Abu Ghraib they're guarding people that they believe to be terrorists or bad guys and so what do they do with them they treat them bad and then you can kind of decipher what that really means you know were they torturing anyone maybe not really were they out of the bounds of how a prisoner should be treated by Americans yes they were and what is torture and we could try and discuss that I think you actually can come up with a decent answer but they were doing things that they shouldn't have been doing with these prisoners and some of it if it leaned up against some kind of torture okay I looked at it as more like things that it was basically hazing that's amazing by the way to think how long ago that was like it's such a coincidence so you met Josh earlier today yeah so josh was working on me yesterday and I remembered while I was in the table and he was grinding on me that the Iraq invasion took place on my 30th birthday mmm because it was March 19th 2003

[00:10:43] I remember having dinner that night nothing special right he was just having dinner on my birthday but I just remember it was my birthday and that was the night of the invasion and I was like how is it possible that was 16 years ago like I've remembered that day so clearly and not just that day the days that followed and when I think about how tangentially and irrelevant I am to any of these things and to think like how much more would you remember that right how much more can you think back to what happened when the pictures and the videos came out from Abu Ghraib I mean it's interesting to think of how everybody's psyche can be sort of seared and scarred by these events it can and certainly those events that took place in Abu Ghraib where I was going with this is these young kids did these stupid things with these detainees it was bad even worse they took pictures of them and then what happened was those pictures got into the hands of al Qaeda and al Jazeera and they put them up and said hey Americans are evil and the pictures looked horrible and there you go so it had a huge negative strategic impact and did a lot to fuel the insurgency and make a lot of people that would have otherwise said oh you know the Americans are trying to do their best here and then they see pictures of

[00:11:49] Americans torturing these Iraqi citizens because that's what the propaganda is coming out as so this is a massive strategic negative impact because these frontline soldiers didn't fully understand the strategic situation that they were in so if they understood that if they understood hey we're trying to make sure that the Iraqi people think that we're good guys and if we do anything that presents us in a different light it's gonna really have a negative impact so don't do dumb things if they had understood that then perhaps they would have fought a little bit more about what they're doing so there's a classic example of troops on the front line not understanding the strategy at all and therefore their tactics are totally off base their tactics were beyond off-base just because of their tactics they were doing some dumb stuff but it's the same thing it's like you're doing dumb things dumb tactical decisions on the front lines because you don't understand what the strategy is so that's a classic example nowadays that I still talk about with young seals and young military people Hey you've got to make sure that your troops understand what it is you're trying to accomplish because if they don't understand what they're trying to accomplish its strategically their tactical decisions can be bad based on that fact of what they're missing and the other point you made even prior to that strikes me as even more ubiquitous which is if you don't understand the strategy and all of a sudden you get separated from Central Command and you have to call an audible you have to pivot tactically you're lost that's why decentralized command works and that's also why centralized command fails because oftentimes you are separated you don't even have to be separated if you're one of my snipers and you're looking down a street in an overwatch position and you see something you didn't have time to call me and say hey jockle this is what i'm seeing what do you think I should do no you have to understand what your mission is what the rules of engagement are what our overall strategic mission is what risk were willing to take against that strategic mission and then you can make a decision by the way in a half a second whether you're gonna kill someone or not and so yeah you absolutely have to understand the impact of what you're doing you have to understand the strategic mission not just because you're gonna be separated but you have decisive moments where you're gonna have to figure for me to go one way or the other way and that's based on your understanding of the strategy not just the tactics yeah the way I've always thought about it is through a much less crucial lens in the moment because it's a longer lens but it's through health right it's through longevity people want to talk about tactical things all the time Peter should I eat this much or should I eat this much or should I fast like this or should I fast like that it is a keto diet better than a Mediterranean edible and one I just don't like talking about that stuff all that much I guess I'm just bored but more importantly I try to discourage that kind of discussion because it's very tactical and if you ask tactical questions or tech questions that demand tactical answers you'll never get the bigger picture and therefore when the information changes which it will as sure as God made little green apples sure as Tuesday follows

[00:14:45] Monday what we know about nutrition today is going to be far less accurate than what we're gonna know about it in ten years so instead of pegging yourself to what's the right thing to eat today peg yourself to the principle of nutritional biochemistry and then you can sort of evolve over time so again that's not a minute-by-minute decision the way you're describing it but in many ways what you're describing is the pinnacle of that thinking because it's going to require split-second decision-making which means it almost has to become autonomic you have to be that wed to the objective and the strategy anytime that you miss out on that again what you're talking about like health and nutrition everybody wants to hear the tactical answer because it makes life easy it takes the decision out of their hand so if I'm a sniper and I'm waiting to shoot and guess what I'm not sure if I should shoot or not the easiest thing in the world is just to have chocolate say hey if this is exactly what you see then you take the shot or if this is what you see you don't take the shot hey cool you're free and clear you don't have to think you don't accept any blame you're just doing what you were told and so people want that right it makes life very easy if I go hey Peter I want to lose weight what should I eat today what show you for my next meal that's really easy rikes they don't have to think about it but as you just said in the long run guess what you're in an airport guess what you're at a hotel they don't have the food that Peter told you to eat so now what are you gonna do well if you have the strategy if you understand the strategy then you can make a good decision and that's gonna get you through whereas if you're sitting there waiting for the little tactical moment it doesn't exist because how many situations can I describe for that sniper can I describe thirty things that he can see sure can I describe fifty things that he can see sure can I describe a hundred things that he can see now we're starting to get to the reality and even if you could is he gonna have like a Tom Brady armband that's got every play I mean it's impossible yeah and the other thing is combat things are gonna happen that no one no one thought was going to happen no one could have predicted this in a million years that this individual is gonna do what they did one time I was watching ISR so the overhead coverage and I got my troops are out in the field and I'm watching some of this is our and we see a vehicle pull up and then the guys get out and they're kind of looking around and all of a sudden the trunk goes open and okay so now we're focusing our eyes on this thing and tell me in that moment what is the range of possibilities you are entertaining when that trunk opens what is the best scenario you can imagine and what is the worst scenario you can imagine what I assume is happening is is a the beginning of some kind of an attack right these people have pulled up and there's an RPG in the trunk there's an RPG in the trunk more likely I was thinking more girl cuz it was pretty typical these guys would pre stage a spot where they knew the range that they had to fire a mortar if you know anything about firing mortars it's a trick I know nothing about yeah it's a tricky thing you've got the angle and elevation it's indirect fire it's gonna go a thousand feet up in the air and that's gonna drop down so you've got to know the range you've got to calculate the angle that you're gonna set the mortar out you're gonna calculate how much explosive you're gonna put on the mortar so that it projects as far as you want so it's a complicated thing so what these guys would do is kind of pre measure everything and know the hey when we pull up a car to this spot we know how many meters it is we got our charges ready we got the angle of the mortar set so we can do it in 30 seconds boom we're out we sent up the mortar we drop three rounds and put the mortar back and we leave so that's kind of what I was thinking so you are planning for the worst is there anything that's crossing your mind that says these dudes are literally on a meditation retreat I mean using this to be facetious but like they're just here to get their smoke on well you definitely have to think about that because in Ramadi for instance there was four hundred thousand civilians living there and there was probably anywhere between a thousand and five thousand insurgents here yeah it may been less than that may have been more than that at certain times but and they blend well they blend very well so my mind isn't thinking oh they're open their trunk that's definitely an attack and actually I'll go over another situation where the same thing happened to me before so this was something I'm kind of used to so I'm watching this happen and the guys they're kind of mulling around the car they're looking and you're thinking okay here they are they're getting ready to set it up and sure enough the guy pulls something out of the car and you can't make it me another thing that's really hard about by the way what distance are you n I'm in a tactical operation center I'm two miles away and this is one thing that makes it hard in the city when people talk about ISR and you've got coverage overhead well just imagine you got buildings and as the angle changes all of a sudden the person disappears behind the building right you just can't see him until the orbit of the platform gets back to where you can see so there's a little bit of that going on and by the time the orbit comes back on boom here are the guys they're pulling something out of the truck Oh what is it and it's hard to tell what things are and to make a long story short they were getting a jack out of their car to jack up the car they had a flat tire and they pulled off their time they changed fire no left a meanwhile my guys got attacked from another position that

[00:19:34] I wasn't paying attention to right why wasn't I paying attention to it now is there a chance that these guys were a decoy actually a pretty high probability most of the people running around in the city doing things like this were generally bad and when fire fights were going on or when there's big movements in the city most of the civilians knew okay the Iraqi soldiers and the Americans are sweeping through this area guess what we're gonna do we're gonna go in our house and we're gonna stay there that's what we're gonna do we're gonna try not to bother in order to stay in our house so when you see someone doing something you are definitely more suspect than in a situation where there's people going all over the place anyways the streets would clear when we would go out or when the enemy was going to attack the streets would clear and that was the way it was so to see someone out there doing this you're definitely suspect and there's a probably a pretty good chance that these guys were doing that specifically to draw attention away from this other element that was attacking they're good they know what they're doing so those are situations that you can't predict and if people don't understand what the strategic vision is then they can't make decisions out there another example that I've experienced that is soda compared to both the stakes and the risks of what you're describing is bowhunting so I just came back from my first bow hunting trip and game-changing experience for me I mean when I bought my first PO two years ago

[00:20:56] I didn't think I would ever hunt I specifically went in there to say look I just want to shoot targets all day long and they said well you sure you don't to hunt nope don't want to hunt just want to shoot targets fast forward a couple of years and now I want to go and hunt and what a learning experience right so when you're sitting there shooting targets all day long you're putting all of your emphasis on precision perfect fire perfect shot over over over again how far can you be and make that perfect shot boom boom boom boom boom then you get in the field and we were fortunate to be going after one of the hardest pieces of game in North America the access deer in there terrain incredibly mountainous so they're places where you can hunt them flat but we were in a place that was staggeringly mountainous all of a sudden two things occurred to me within 48 hours one it's happening way faster than I've ever prepared for meaning when a deer is anywhere within shooting distance and our guide is like knock now put the error like nock the arrow you it's like but I don't have good footing like I can't see where I am like I don't know how far the animal is I haven't got my rangefinder it's like everything's going wrong secondly the noise that you make the fumbling around to get in position the deers gone the deers gone these things can hear see and smell at a level that makes us seem like single-cell amoebas that are pointless like so now of course by the end of the trip six days into this we're figuring this out

[00:22:19] I'm getting so much better at anticipating what's happening but it actually made me think in my tracks how frightening is it for a soldier to train which again your training is better than my training meaning the way that a soldier is training for combat is much more comparable to the event than the way I'm training to shoot but it's like that saying right everybody has a plan until I get punched in the face I can't imagine what it's like the first time the patrol is out there and a roadside bomb goes off and someone gets their leg blown off right like so now you're seeing this and to me that's another example of how when stuff goes really really really bad one you have to understand have you been trained enough to automatically do the right thing and to do you start making a whole bunch of tactical errors because that wasn't a planned reality I mean how in the hell do you train someone for that well thankfully the training evolved so much even while I was in so when I first came in the SEAL Teams we used blank fire for land warfare and we used live fire for

[00:23:23] CQC close quarters combat so that means you're going into a building and you're using live fire which means you and I are gonna be a foot away from each other we're shooting rounds really in close proximity at targets why would you be using blanks at long range versus well okay so we do the same thing we do live fire in the desert as well and in the jungle we do live fire primarily we would occasionally use blanks but we used blanks in land warfare with this old system that the army used called miles gear which was basically a laser tag system right but it's not that great that was the problem it wasn't that great and so a lot of times I was like oh you know what this is really isn't that great and so we just said you know what the most intense thing we can do is train with live fire so I should have completed that statement which was we tried using blanks and this miles gear there's two factors I shouldn't just blame the miles gear as seals we weren't that good at it we got old equipment we'd get it from the army it wouldn't be that good we didn't really know how to cite it incorrectly and so guess what we end up with something that's not all that great so we just kind of focused on live fire and live fire let's face it that's like hey we're gonna live fire that's just the intensity is higher that's what we do we're seals we train live fire and you go in the kill house and you're trained in live fire and you're shooting at targets and it's intense because you know if you screw up in the kill house you can easily shoot one of your buddies so it's intense the problem with it is you're going against paper targets and there's two things that the enemy will do that will have a massive negative impact on your brain and on the situation and that is the enemy will shoot back at you and they'll maneuver those are the two things that the enemy has that's what the enemy does well there's two things that a paper target can't do shoot back or maneuver and so guess what we used to just crush these paper targets I never got beat by a paper target in my life and I spent many years in the SEAL Teams where we just kicked the [ __ ] out of paper targets and we felt really good about it right in the late 90s we started using something called simunition which is you use your real gun but there's a different barrel that you put on the gun and the barrel that you put on the gun allows the gun to fire paint rounds even though you're loading with a magazine you still have 25 so it's 7 to wank that's being fired that's pushing out a paintball yes basically it's a paintball gun you still have to do magazine changes you're still getting the same weight the same kind of sight picture so it's very similar I should say and that had just a huge impact on us tactically because all of a sudden these tactics that we were using where the enemy never maneuvered had never shot back at us awesome they didn't work a classic example is we used to stack in a hallway to move through a building we would all just stack in the hallway and then we'd go down the hallway put people in the rooms you take this room on the left next to guys take the room on the right next to you guys take the room I'm left so there you go you got

[00:26:09] Tony guys in the hallway and then you move down the hallway and you clear the rooms as you go down the hallway well what we didn't realize because those paper targets never popped out of the door and shot back at us as soon as we started using simunition you are all stacked up in the hallway so you got 20 guys in the hallway and somebody way down at the end of the hallway sticks their simunition gun around the corner they don't even expose themselves at all and they spray off a magazine around 25 rounds comes down the hallway and guess what eight guys are hit and there's this push back against that there was actually some push back against that which was that's not realistic that guy didn't even take a sight picture that guy didn't expose himself so it's not realistic and my thought was wait a second it just happened and believe me an ak-47 would have been even worse than a simulation that's what's gonna ask you I mean is the paintball under or overestimating the potential spray of the round underestimate oh so then you're right right yes and there were some guys that would say it's not realistic and there were some guys that would say actually what's messed up is our up tactics and so that was kind of the beginning of us putting pressure on each other with more we call it force on force training we eventually got a system for our land warfare cuz the problem with simunition is it's accurate to like 20 meters 10 meters not very accurate whereas land warfare our guys can shoot you at 800 yards 700 yards pretty easily this isn't like a big challenge even me

[00:27:34] I'm not a sniper but with my weapon and a scope on there I'm gonna knock you out you know what 500 600 700 yards it's gonna happen so the paint doesn't simulate that eventually ended up getting a very good laser tag system for external movement for land warfare and had little speakers on the system little speakers next to your shoulders so as you were getting shot at if it wasn't hitting you but it was close to you it would make noises like there was rounds going over your head on these little speakers it was so good when I was running the training the punishment for getting shot was your buddies had to carry you for two kilometres three kilometres in the desert at night on night vision you and all your gear and let's put that in perspective your gear weighs because you're in body armor so what's the total poundage of gear armor everything PAC probably 60 to 100 pounds depending on the position that guy has in a platoon so you're easily carrying 280 to 325 pounds easily and carrying bodies is much much harder than it seems and it's much much harder than it looks in the movies that's right it doesn't seem or look at all easy when I what I see I mean again not to keep coming back to this hunting thing but it's just so fresh in my mind like even when we would shoot an 80 pound animal and you would feel dress it and then carry it out I'm like this isn't that heavy but why is this so awkward yeah and then imagine that that deer isn't dead but it's wounded it's a lot harder than people think it's gonna be and realistically oftentimes carrying one person can take four people if you lay out a litter and this guy weighs 200 pounds and you got his gear on there and now it's 280 pounds and you're going through the desert by the way everyone's already carrying 70 80 pounds anyways so it's very very problematic so as we got more and more engaged in the force-on-force training we got better and better and better and more prepared for what combat was really going to be like now there are still are discrepancies because one thing that you can't train but what I was gonna say about the realism I would see guys out in the desert because the punishment was you would get carried and it's not punishment for you actually there's punishment for you because guess what you feel horrible that your boys are getting not only that they're not gonna do an effective job they're gonna drop you you're gonna fall you're gonna lose gear it's a cup getting a beat-down for two or three hours in the desert so the punishment was really hard and so when you'd see like a guy starting to get shot at and rounds were getting close to him and he was hearing those snaps on his little speakers on his gear you would see them dive for cover as if they were really getting shot at it was kind of crazy to watch that sometimes that being said they still knew that they weren't gonna die they weren't gonna literally die so you would still see guys take risks that you think yourself would you really take that risk if that building was getting hit with ak-47 rounds who were impacting right outside the door you probably wouldn't do the Medal of Honor run you hesitate you go okay what can we do to mitigate this so there were some times where that becomes a little bit unrealistic on both sides both the opposing force that the guys would be going against versus the good guys the quote-unquote good guys cuz they're all seals do you remember the first time you were in combat and you had that moment of hesitation which was this is live rounds this is all the marbles here I guess what I'm getting at is was there a moment that you recall when if it were training and you couldn't die he would have done something but in the situation you were in your instinct was actually to do something more conservative the first time I was in a situation where and I got very very lucky the reason that I got lucky was almost as if it was planned my career in combat slowly escalated it slowly escalated it wasn't like all of a sudden I mean my whole first deployment to Iraq was six months long but the amount of we did a bunch of operations and we generally had the upper hand almost all the time so it was a really good confidence builder the few times we got ambushed or whatever we responded really well felt really good and so I got to kind of experience that and kind of get it out of my system but

[00:31:51] I was gonna say the first time I had a guy we were doing a convoy we were going to a location in Baghdad I had a guy get on our way to where we were going we started taking rounds and I actually didn't know it because I didn't know what it was like and you're in a Humvee and you can't hear and what I saw was and it's a day or night it's nighttime and what I saw was it looked like somebody was throwing cigarettes out of one of the Humvees ahead of me because

[00:32:16] I'm a number two Humvees I think to myself who's smoking right now we're on patrol what is I see a couple sparks fly and then I see more sparks and I'm thinking wait a second now we got multiple smokers in the lead Humvee what's going on here and then it occurred to me I was like oh it'd ii 'it you're getting shot at right now and then sure enough we had a guy that took around in the head and actually was okay again the miracle of what bullets do and

[00:32:37] I actually hit and it was probably a ricochet and it went underneath his skin and then kind of wrapped around the outside of his skull so it didn't penetrate his skull so it was clearly it was a ricochet or something like that but that's such an interesting example right like here someone like me listening to this you look at a Navy SEAL and you think man you guys must know everything that's happening in every moment like you're like cartoon characters right but yet in that moment there's a vulnerability which is you literally didn't even realize you were being shot for a few minutes like you had to go through the processing of oh my god this is real now this is actually happening and there was a lot of that steep learning curve and these kids that are coming in now I call them kids I don't mean disrespect by that because the young guys that came in the SEAL Teams in 2005 and 2003 I mean I came in in 1991 okay the first Gulf War was about to go down and I was excited about it but it was over really quickly so there's a whole time period where people were coming in the SEAL Teams and they didn't really have I didn't realize that

[00:33:30] I know we have talked about this years and years ago I think I had forgotten that you were in the early 90s I don't know why I thought it was like mid 90s so I mean ten years before 9/11 I didn't shoot my weapon at a bad guy for 13 years of just training and trying to be ready and I guess to your point your question was we had trained so much at this point that we all felt pretty good about what was going on now let's talk about the difference between an enlisted guy who's coming in in 2003 into the army I mean he can't have a fraction of the training that you've just described right that is true that is true and that was one thing that was a real disparity is like for instance we got to Ramadi the guys that were on the ground in

[00:34:13] Ramadi when we got there they were a National Guard unit and so these guys were part-time soldiers and they had been on the ground fighting in Ramadi for 14 months and they had done an unbelievable job and they took some very hard lessons but it just shows you the professionalism of the military and the dedication of these soldiers we were in all these guys when we got there every one of these National Guard units every one of these guys in these National

[00:34:39] Guard units had more combat experience than anyone in my whole task unit that's a humbling experience I totally imagine what you're thinking when you roll into that I'm home about it I'm thinking myself what can we learn from these guys and we did that's what we did we said hey you guys are the professionals here what do you think about this mission what do you think about this area what do you think about this tactic this technique and they would tell us what they thought and what was kind of cool was oh how the young soldiers they would look at us and go you guys are SEALs you guys are Navy SEALs and so they kind of had a little bit of respect for us just because whatever kind of stories they'd heard or whatever the legendary seals and for us to go in and say hey how do you think we should do this what do you think about this tactic these young Marines these young soldiers they were just awesome guys and it is very humbling what took 14 months is this a resource issue I mean why were national guardsmen sitting there for 14 months in one of the most violent parts of the world without a greater support system that's the way it is I mean this is something that the recruiters not going to tell the people that join the

[00:35:39] National Guard or join the reserves it's in the fine print that if we're at war and we need you you're gonna get called up and you're gonna go and so that's what happened that's awesome these guys were teachers and electricians and plumbers and lawyers and doctors and one day they get told hey you're gonna go to

[00:35:57] Iraq and you know what they do they get their gear on and they go to Iraq and they do a hell of a job over there and make just incredible incredible sacrifices for the mission and so yes we held those guys in the highest regard and still do think about the guys that were there when we got there who definitely had less training than us but man they were hardened combat warriors by the time we showed up and they definitely helped us and kept a lot of us alive because they were able to share with us the way that they operated and to the credit of my guys all the guys in my task unit asking a bruiser we were listening we were all ears we were humble and wanted to learn from these guys who had been fighting for so long there is that a lesson specifically that you talk about cuz so much of the work you do today is working with people who have never held the gun and are never gonna hold the gun right there in a boardroom they're wearing a suit do you see that parallel lesson show up in the business world I always say that humility is the most important attribute or characteristic for a leader to happen it really applies to everyone remind me to talk about the counter to this because are situations where humility is not something I need to stress with someone but yes in the business world in any leadership position when you're in that position and you don't have humility or you think you know I already know everything think about this if my task unit if we showed up in Ramadi and thought we knew everything these guys were learning lessons these guys were fighting so hard they were learning so many lessons we were all ears because we are humble enough to think to ourselves hey guess what these guys have been fighting for 14 straight months these guys have been out in this this road that we're gonna go on patrol tonight this army private he's gone down that road a hundred times literally a hundred times and we're all fired up because we're go on this mission and down this road and we go to this guy hey what should we watch out for oh here's a couple things guess what the enemy likes to set up in these buildings over here thank you we'll hold extra security on them guess what if you do get in a firefight here's where they're gonna try and push you towards be careful cuz they'll choke this point like these are just common things and so on the business world that happens to you get someone that's been in the industry you hear this all the time right I've been in this industry for 22 years I've been in this industry for 27 years no one's gonna tell me what's gonna happen with the market no one's gonna tell me a new methodology of doing something no one's gonna tell me how to run my company okay cool we'll see how that works out for you it generally doesn't work out good now I'm not saying that in 22 years you don't have some good knowledge or in 27 years you don't learn some good stuff you absolutely do do you know everything are there any times when you should maybe listen to what somebody else has to say or look at the way someone else is running something and maybe think yourself well that seems like a good idea I mean they're classic examples that I talk about a lot is blackberry right blackberry was their market share 80% lose 90% it was it that high it was crazy someone just told me what the share price on rim is today and how I mean they completely different company obviously it doesn't exist in the format that it once did but yes that was at the height of that mark I mean that must've been $140 a share company and no 7 yeah and who could ever teach them anything who could ever explain to someone that you know what what you're doing right now might not be the same in a year same thing with blockbuster right we're gonna do videos you're gonna come and you're gonna rent videos a store I have to explain that to my kids my kids are they can't even comprehend that what do you mean you would go somewhere and get a movie from somewhere else was that mean and yet there's arrogance there right I mean it mean tell me blockbuster didn't have the capital to start streaming movies during that time they could have easily said oh that seems like a pretty decent idea let's get in on that game right now instead it was denial and again I'm kind of assuming this book just looking at the outcome I don't know the people that ran blockbuster but there was had to be some level of denial that some oh what are you gonna do you're gonna stream movies my internet barely works I can barely stream a one-minute video how are you gonna Street it doesn't make any sense we're gonna keep doing what we're doing people will keep coming to our stores come on a Friday night you see how crowded by stores where all those people gonna go they love coming to our store and buying some popcorn and getting a video so there's arrogance there and so that's why you have to be humble as a leader so that your mind is open so you can listen to what other people are saying and you can make an honest assessment of whether it's right or not you can constantly look at yourself and say you know what am I really right am I really right I'm constantly asking myself that am I really yes okay I feel pretty good about it but I'm not a hundred percent there's a great book on this called I'm gonna screw this up so the show notes will definitely correct me I think it's called being wrong and I believe the author is Katherine Schultz so I could have gotten both of those wrong that's the beauty of reading this book is you it teaches you something that I really needed to be taught so I have a pretty good memory I would say my memory is better than average at least when I'm paying attention so I actually have a bad memory with names and things at a party because I'm generally not paying attention I don't have like sort of that

[00:40:49] Bill Clinton like memory of everybody's name but for little details and things that I deem important a pretty accurate memory this book goes into how often we are wrong and wrong in times when we are convinced we are right so I read this book and it's riveting it's sort of on the list of sort of 15-20 books I've read that I can't frickin stop reading once I'm into it like I'm on my bike in the garage this is pre audible or at least I didn't use all the time I'm literally sweating over this book flipping the pages right for me that's a to interrupt the workout to do that as a big deal but it leaves me with this vulnerability which is what if Katherine Schultz is right what if my memory is not as good as I think it is and I started just putting a tiny bit of humility into statements I was making and I remember having an arguments too strong a word but it's spirited debate with a friend of mine about something that occurred in the past and could be verified and so we go into this discussion and I've got my point of view which is Peter the Great is right because I freaking remember everything and by the way the friend that I'm debating is notoriously moronic and remembering stuff so like the pretest probability is so high that I'm correct and I'm like yeah you know no it's exactly like this like this is exactly what happened did but then I remember I'm like you know what remember that book you just read and I go through all like the sort of thought process that she brings to it and why we get tripped up and why we are so arrogant and boa and afterwards I'm like I'm like actually go check if I was right and sure enough I was back asked I mean I couldn't have been more wrong jaakko I was a hundred percent wrong I mean on the one hand it humbled me on another hand it scared me it made me think how many times have you been so sure of yourself in the last 40 years only to realize you were probably wrong yeah when this really occurred to me is when

[00:42:50] I started telling people this statement it's kind of the opposite statement I would tell guys that I was teaching I would say listen I don't know everything but let me tell you something if I tell you something that I know and I tell you it's a hundred percent I'm gonna guarantee that it's a hundred percent right like you're gonna hear me say it's so seldomly but like I'd have somebody that I was teaching something and they maybe would say well you know they'd have their opinion about something and 95% of time 99% of time I'd say you know what yeah let's give that a try let's see if that tactic worked let's see if that functions and then occasionally I'd say listen if I'm telling you that I know something a hundred percent you should listen to me because I don't play around with that statement and I don't you will very seldomly hear me say I know something a hundred percent because it's so rare that it actually happens and my mind is open because what

[00:43:42] I think is just what I think right now and there's definitely other ways to come so I definitely don't ever box myself into a corner of saying I'm right and you're wrong or what I'm saying is 100% right unless there are some principles in the world or some tactical things that I know or some leadership things that I know where I say again very few but I'll say this is the truth right here and there's very few of them let's hear a couple of them even a specific example that might be contextually sort of limited well one of the fundamental truths of combat is cover and move it's the number one law of combat that I wrote about an extreme ownership and I talk about all the time but it's just the way it is meaning if you're taking fire cover and move well what it really means is you and I have to work together one of us has to put down cover fire and the other one has to move if we decide guess what you and I are just gonna go for it together at the same time and there's no cover fire that's wrong it's just wrong and what's gonna happen is we're both gonna die so what we should do is if you want to get across the street I'm gonna get in a good position on the lay down cover fire and then you're gonna move while I'm sure you get the bad guys and they can't shoot back or you're gonna put down cover fire now I'm gonna move but if someone says to me well what we're gonna do is we're just gonna run for it now are there situations where it's like okay if you said to me hey you know what we're both gonna go we're both gonna shoot at the same time I'd be like so you're gonna cover for yourselves kind of fits in there okay we can try it there's situations where you may have to do that but that's not the rule we want to follow it's different when you say just because you get away with something doesn't mean it was the right thing to do that's true too which is an example right so you almost would assert that that's almost an axiom right like we reserved that term for something that on first principles is immutable or dogmatic right so you know in biology there aren't many things that we are so confident in that we say that about but one of them is that DNA codes for RNA codes for protein that has just become an axiom of biology there aren't really ways around that and of course on the margins you sort of talk about like is a prion sort of an exception to that and maybe buh-buh-buh but yeah this is as close to axiomatic as you can get in biology or in your case now was that something that came naturally to you to have that humility because it doesn't come naturally to me like I think arrogance and grandiosity are my natural default states so I have to work staggeringly hard to pause in my tracks and consider the world through another person's lens yeah so you go into combat and you'll get humbled by it I mean now this doesn't always work because there's some times where like my first deployment to Iraq I felt pretty good about it felt like kind of badass like hey we can handle this second deployment to Iraq to

[00:46:18] Ramadi very humbling because there's gonna be situations where as good as you might think you are you're not gonna be able to control it and things gonna go wrong and it's gonna be a nightmare and you're gonna behold it's like trying to hold on the water right you're trying to hold on to the situation and it's gonna Humble you but I still think that says just as much about you as it does the situation because I think there are a lot of people in that situation Jaco that are gonna blame their surroundings they're not gonna be humbled by that when everything goes wrong they're gonna say it's because of this it's because of that it's because of him it's because of her it's because of the insurgents so I still think you're pre wired and preconditioned to be able to fail and say okay that's humbling

[00:46:56] I think that's an admirable trait I I'm trying to understand if it came did you come out of the womb with that I think I saw great examples of that along the way and realized how if you want to do well then that's the attitude that's gonna happen I had a boss that I worked for who was the most experienced guy that I'd ever worked for he was the most tactically savvy guy had ever worked for he was the most experienced guy I had ever worked for and he was the most humble guy I ever worked for and all of us in the platoon he was our platoon commander all of us in the platoon we wanted nothing more nothing more than to make that guy look good to not let him down and now I felt that I was a young CEO I was 21 or 22 years old and here's this guy who has all this experience combat experience in the 90s which not many people had and we me the rest of the guys we just wanted to make this guy look good and we didn't want to let him down and was because he was so humble that was like the initial opening for my life of thinking to myself why do I want to follow and it was a very interesting situation because we had a mutiny against the previous platoon commander so there was a mutiny us young enlisted guys went before our commanding officer and said we don't want to work for this guy how many times does that work it doesn't I mean that's a mutiny you know what the punishment for mutiny is death its death that's treason basically right so we had a mutiny in a sealed platoon in 1990 whatever and the guy that we were mutinous against he was not humble and I got to see this this incredible contrast between these two guys one who was extremely arrogant and inexperienced an arrogant which is a horrible combination the other guy who is extremely experienced and super humble and the contrast between those two guys painted a very clear picture in my mind as a young guy okay what was the difference between these two guys why did we all hate this other guy and why do we all love this one well here's the big difference this guy thought he knew everything and acted like it and this guy knew everything and acted like a humble guy that wanted to listen to us and left the biggest imprint on my mind and that's why humility has always been so important now I told you remind me about when it's humility not important I talked about this now and there is there's a dichotomy and all these things that's why I wrote the dichotomy leadership is because there's a dichotomy and can people be too humble yes absolutely they can and I went and talked to some underprivileged kids up in LA a pretty unique group of underprivileged kids who kind of had let's say some kind of potential they were smart kids that had and they were young too between the ages of I'd say eight and thirteen something like that and they've been kind of selected as kids that had some potential even though they were needs underprivileged situations the reason I say that is because when I went into this room and was gonna talk to them about what I've learned and one of the big things I was gonna tell him is that you got to be humble and I'm looking around this room and every one of these kids in this room just about every one of them was shoulders folded forward eyes towards the ground heads hung low they were already broken they were already broken you know they were beat because you know you can go to the city you can go to the inner city and you can be kids that are not humble at all they're arrogant they're super hyper confident they're overconfident that's why I had to make this distinction these weren't those kids so this was another example by we're tying it back you made a tactical decision on the front line in real time you went in there with a plan yep but you understood the strategy yeah what are you trying to do you're not here to give a talk that's a tactic yeah and the immediate change was I talked him about confidence I can talk to him about humility I said hey you put your shoulders back a little bit sit up look at me what you want to ask me a question stand up and then the question comes like well sir no hey talk to me louder that's what you got to do right you got it instill that confidence in these kids so there's a balance with all these dichotomies and can you be too humble yes you absolutely can can be too humble as a leader yes you absolutely can you can be too humble where Peter you come in and you're barking about something and I go well Peters probably right and

[00:50:57] I'm just gonna go with it well no if I disagree with you I need to say hey Peter can you explain to me why you want to do it that way cuz I'm not really seeing it that's not me being arrogant yeah that's not confrontational it's very confident in your opposition exactly and so there are times where people are too humble again that's why we wrote the dichotomy leadership because every trait that a human being can have can be negative and positive you can take something too far any of them what's the most positive quality you can think of a leader to have poise okay poise can you be a person that gets so poised and is so elevated above the situation that people are looking at you going hey wait a second this guy's not even absolutely isn't connected to what dude is a robot we're down here gritting it out and

[00:51:38] Peters up there no sweat on his face and he looks like he doesn't even even just a more extreme example is not showing emotion is generally a good thing but sometimes it's people need to know that you heard that the leader is also devastated by this finding when you even look at presidents I mean some of the most powerful moments are when presidents show their emotions which again notwithstanding the current one it's generally quite rare to see a president's emotions yeah no it is and when you do think about george w bush standing at the base of the twin towers think about barack obama after i think it was the one of those school shootings i mean these are very powerful moments and it doesn't matter if you agree with the politics by the way it doesn't matter if you agree with what's going on and what the implications are always this about gun control no no it's not about that in the moment it's that person's a human yeah that's a another great example we talk this in the dichotomy a leadership it's like yeah if you have no emotions you're a robot and people don't follow robots you won't have any connection with them so having control over your emotions is one thing but not having any emotions at all is not going to make you into a good leader it's just not the story you told a second ago I think it's almost gonna have to become the litmus test for great leadership because to hear you tell it made me think about the person that I most thought of in that way which actually I spoke about I spoke about this guy on your podcast like four years ago his name's Chris Anand a he was the best senior resident I ever had when I was in surgery and it's exactly that thing which is when you have a senior resident that you are in service of all you wanted to do is make sure one you never let them down like you never wanted them to ask you a question and you didn't know the answer or you hadn't done what they asked you to do but it goes beyond that and that's the point that you made there the interface between the person the attending the higher up and all you wanted everything you did was through the lens of will this make Chris look better will this make Chris shine more in the eyes of the attending and that's a rare rare benchmark but it's interesting it's exactly what you described I'm sure you also work for guys that were arrogant jerks that thought they knew everything and you most people were in between but there were more extremes at the other end you take the extremes at the other ending now you're actually hoping that they fail you're hoping that things fall apart on you're praying for it which is a disaster when you think about it it's the worst morale imaginable it's a total disaster and this is why I always answer that question with humility being the most important characteristic for a leader to have because in most situations the reason that the leader ended up in the position is because they have some level of confidence already so it's not normal for a leader to end up in leadership position but they lack confidence and they're overly humble that's not normal it does happen occasionally but it's not normal the normal case is you've got someone that's an alpha you've got someone that's fought their way to get up through the ranks you've got someone that was confident enough to be like hey

[00:54:27] I'll take control this hey I'll run this people elevate to that position because they're confident and that's why it tends to be the greater percentage of the time there's a problem with humility it's because they lack humility not because they have too much unity occasionally you get a tech company with a start-up where you had some really humble guy that figured something out and he started a little company and all of a sudden he's the CEO and he totally lacks confidence in me he's overly humble he doesn't think you can make any decisions that's a different situation that's a more rare situation the more common situation is

[00:54:54] I'm at the top because I deserve to be I made it here and that's why everyone should listen to me and that's why I'm not gonna listen anyone else and the minute you're in that situation you're going in the wrong direction it needs to get balanced out so let's back up for a minute you finished high school in 1991 89 89 what did you do right after high school we're in the Navy you went straight in yeah and talk me about that decision it's 89 right so the Cold War is over this is like the most peaceful time in the world people are thinking most peaceful time in the world except for what happened in Panama so there was the invasion in Panama four seals were killed on Pattaya airfield oh I thought that was 1990 no and it was like December of 1989 ah and I saw that and I couldn't believe that a war happened in my mind that was just a war that a war happened and I wasn't in it and went and talked to the

[00:55:46] Navy recruiter and rock and roll did you talk to your parents about it I told them afterwards what did they say my dad said you're not gonna like the Navy because you don't like listen to other people and you hate Authority so my dad said what'd your mom say she was happy I had some kind of a job prospect you wrestled in high school no what sports did you play in high school soccer and basketball when you were in junior year were you thinking college like what what was going through your mind my mom sent me something ten years ago that was like sixth grade something like that what do you want to do when you grow up and I put Marine

[00:56:20] Corps yeah I think em you tell me once you weighed like a buck 60 in high school right yeah probably maybe you were not a walking wall no when I checked into SEAL training I 174 pounds and then I gained 10 pounds in SEAL training 11 pounds cuz I graduated at 185 you had already gone to the recruiter before you finished high school or yeah okay so then you come out of high school and now it's what ninety and they ship you off where you come to

[00:56:47] San Diego no into Orlando Florida okay and tell me what you do what's the first week like away from home went to boot camp and the coolest thing about going to Navy boot camp for me was it was a clean slate nothing else mattered they don't care what your high school they don't care where your grades were they don't care what sport you played they didn't care what how good you were at any sports they didn't care about anything what they did care about it's could you do what we're telling you to do and did you pick the Navy because of the seals in 89 yes yeah yeah I liked the water and I wanted to get out of New England I look back now and I love New England and I got my company up in Maine and it's awesome to go back up there but as a kid the small-town thing wasn't for me I wanted to get out of there I wanted to literally see the world as they say and so the SEAL Teams are Virginia Beach and

[00:57:35] San Diego and I grew up surfing in Maine and so I knew that San Diego and Southern California had an epic surfing and I said to myself well if I'm gonna go in to be a commando let's work in the water and get stationed in San Diego California that to me it's hard to comprehend this I guess but it'd be like right now saying hey I'm gonna go and live on Mars that's how foreign it was to me to think them to myself that I had a pathway where I could actually go out and live in California I was amazed that that opportunity was there and so that was definitely a big reason a big reason to pick the SEAL Teams and I heard that the

[00:58:15] SEAL Teams had the hardest training and I won the hardest training I also heard that seals had a 50% casualty rate which is probably drawn from the fact that in the d-day invasion the NCD used the Navy combat demolition units they did have a if this was the precursor the seals have been around since like 1917 63 yeah well 62 63 so those guys did suffer 50% casualty but you know whenever pre-internet knowledge I had heard through the rumor mill was hey if you're in the SEAL Teams you got a 50% chance that you're gonna die so why did that appeal to you when you were 18 who wanted to fight want to fight or wanted to die one fight wonder if I worse yeah didn't want to die no but I wondered if

[00:59:03] I were and plus when you're young you don't think it's gonna be you you're not the one that's gonna die see so it was this is the highest stakes yes yes bring it bring it and you're fired up for that and again you know it's always important to remember that you don't think it's gonna happen to you you think that you're I think you and I have talked about so for like I think if

[00:59:20] I'm on an airplane on a civilian aircraft to commercial aircraft then it blows up in the sky I think that I'm gonna be the guy that you might be able to do a somersault no I think I'm gonna live I'm gonna come down I'm gonna get in a freefall position I'm gonna track to a pool and I'm gonna land in a pool and I'm gonna break my leg and it's gonna be cool that's what my mentality is so that's ignorant and stupid and fine but you could also argue that that's necessary yeah I guess so but here's the reality when you're a kid you think that it's not really gonna happen to you and I guess if you did think it was gonna happen to you and you were afraid of it well then that would be a problem right but you have to at some point you're like okay you know what if I die then I'm dead and this is what I'm gonna do with my life and you're over it I'm not afraid of that I'm still not afraid of it

[01:00:03] I could die okay in the Battle of Ramadi the guys were facing and it's like if you go out there's a good chance you're gonna die there's at least a decent chance maybe it's not a good chance there's a chance you're gonna die we're going to memorial services almost all the time for the soldiers and Marines that were out there fighting and so that's what reality is guess what you can die and you can't in my opinion if you're afraid of that you're gonna have a real hard time you can have a real hard time doing your job do you think that changes once you have kids I know it changes once you have kids and it doesn't change in the way that you think it might when I had kids I was like okay cool well at least now if I die got kids

[01:00:42] I wasn't like oh now I want to stay alive more I thought to myself okay I have kids they'll carry on my genetic pool and that's cool and do I wish I could see him yes but they'll know that I did my job and did what I was supposed to do and did what I wanted to do I loved my job best job in the world best job in the world when did you meet your wife in this process I want to come back and go through this story in some detail but I met my wife in 1994 and did that because you could argue well your wife is not your lineage right she's your partner did that change anything in your mind about the willingness to survive like I wanted to survive more yeah did that chain I mean not that you didn't want to survive prior to that but did it introduce an element of not wanting to die more no not really going back to something you said a second ago did you ever see the movie taking chance do you know though I'm talking about with Kevin Bacon in it no it's a very interesting movie it's a very touching story and I believe it's a true story and if not it's based on a true story it's an entire movie about what is involved to bring a marine home after he died so the name of the marine in this movie I believe was his last name was chance last time a chance now I do remember I remember hearing about it but I haven't seen it I saw it many years ago like when it came out which is oh six oh seven oh eight or something like that and then I saw it again recently a year ago and it was just as moving and I can't imagine what it would be like for you to see that having seen my guess is you've seen each piece of it in along the way yeah it's a very powerful movie it's slow it's not like this is not high drama right this is just the drama is the silence the drama are the pauses the drama is the humble realization of how many times that happened yeah I was gonna say if it came out in 2002 2006 2007 2008 I mean there was that was just incredible amount of guys were getting killed and and you're right and every single one of those guys is an absolute tragedy every one of those guys has a family has a wife has a mom has a dad has brothers and sisters has dreams has goals in their life has things that they want to do has inherent ideas and knowledge and thoughts and wisdom that is completely and utterly unique to them and we never get to see that we never get to see what would have manifested from these kids and it's it's awful what was the hardest loss you ever saw there personally meaning the person that died he you knew them and you couldn't distance yourself from it emotionally well my guys any one of your guys yeah yeah so how do you do that I don't understand that for most of us in civilian life when we do encounter that you lose a parent you lose a child I mean you think of the worst things that you can imagine you get to if you choose to completely retreat like you don't have to go out and do something in that next moment whereas that's quite different from what you're doing you don't have that luxury of saying I'm gonna spend the next three months in therapy dealing with this No as a matter of fact you're saying hey in 48 hours we're gonna go back and put our gear on and lock and load and go do what we're supposed to do that's what you're saying and lately I've been talking a bit about the fact that as Americans we've taken all these different cultures and we've kind of compiled them all together and in doing that we've lost normal protocols that other cultures have right and one of the protocols that we've kind of lost and mixed up or mismatched is what's the protocol for death right in other religions or specific religions or in other cultures it's like okay this person died okay here's the ceremony that we do now here's the next thing we do down the line after that we're gonna have this party then we're gonna get together then we're gonna say these things that we're going to use these words I'm going to make these motions then we're gonna do the final thing and then everyone's gonna go back to you know everyone's gonna move on because that's what we know that's how it works and in America we've put so many of these things together and we've combined them and separated and lost pieces that there's no real immediate hey here's the protocol because when bad things happen you need to follow a protocol right you need to have a protocol in place you should have a protocol in place right when your house burns down your kids have a protocol of where they're gonna go you have a protocol of what you're gonna do and boom that's what happens if there's an accident right we work with all kinds of different businesses but we work with businesses or companies that are run a fairly high risk of having something bad happen you go in a big construction site people get hurt you can have a protocol for that this is what we're gonna do not just what we're gonna do on the job site but what we're gonna do with the family how we're gonna follow that stuff up so you've gotta have protocols in place and for us we don't really have these both psychological spiritual protocols now again there's some religions that people follow in America it's like oh yeah this is the protocol but even those people

[01:05:42] Ben I don't want to use the word polluted but your protocols been polluted if you're a Catholic or a Protestant or you're a Muslim your ideas have been mixed in with some other ideas along the way and maybe it's been taking that protocol a little bit out of your what it was and now it's not 100 percent you're not a hundred percent about it and you don't really know how to follow it you've never followed it before and no one else you know has so what are we gonna do what are we gonna do so that's a big problem so when we went to Ramadi we didn't have any protocol we didn't really even think about the fact like what do you do from a operational perspective you get 16 guys in the platoon and one of them gets killed that's 1/16 that's one specialty inside of a platoon what do you mean you didn't have a protocol meaning outside of the immediate tactics of a person's deceased and the body has to go here and then there's a whole team that takes over you're saying you didn't have a plan for how you would all deal with that yes to the point of you had never discussed it no no the 16 of you are going into the most dangerous yeah and actually so we're talking to seal platoon so we got 40 guys did we talk about it sure just so you know the military has what's called a Keiko procedure that you followed there's a book you open up and we had a book that we opened up with this Keiko mean or stand for casualty care offs or something like that okay and so there's a book that you follow as a manual so yeah the protocol did exist the protocol the outward protocol if like hey this is what you're gonna do this is how the whole SEAL team of whatever 200 guys and plus the support people that's 800 guys this is what's gonna happen okay cool everyone follows that protocol a little bit what happens in the platoon and what happens with your head what happens with the guy that just lost his best friend what's the protocol for that the answer is we don't have one and so then what do you do and

[01:07:25] I'll tell you what I did I tried to create one I said okay guys this is what we're gonna do and my basic protocol was was to do what I knew how to do and this may be wrong I may be wrong my protocol is to do what I know how to do is I know how to work that's what I know how to do and I know that letting your mind be idle letting your mind sit there and think about what just happened to me that's not a good protocol the protocol is here's what we're gonna do we're not gonna do anything tonight we're gonna do a service tomorrow and the day after that we're gonna say goodbye and then guess what we're gonna do we're gonna get on our gear we're a lock and load and weapons and we're gonna go back to work because that's what our brothers would want us to do in this situation so you know Mark Lee was the first seal killed in Iraq the first seal killed in Iraq Mikey Munsell was the second seal killed in Iraq when you're surprised that we hadn't talked about that who's gonna kill us we've been fighting here for three years we're good it's like maybe not so we ended up losing Ryan job as well but each time it's like okay here's what we need to figure out and you know I've been discussing now on my podcast writing a book about protocols because here's another protocol that people don't have is you just got dumped you're 21 years old you're 18 years old you're 23 years old you've been with the same girl or with the same guy for six years three years two years they're the love of your life they dumped you and guys don't have a protocol for that what do you do so guess what if you have a protocol to follow you open up the book you figure out what the protocol isn't you execute the protocol there's all kinds of things sick diseased what's your protocol when you get fired if you don't have a protocol what do you do what do you do and the answer is you follow the protocol so I will likely be writing a book of protocols so that people know what to do when things happen by the way that you need a protocol for good things too right what's the protocol for you just got married that's a great thing right that could be a great thing it can also be a disaster if you don't have a good protocol to follow once you're married you bought a new house what's your protocol what's your protocol what do we do now we got this house what do we do how do we handle that going forward so there's all kinds of things that we need protocols for and we don't have them and it's not like it's that complex it's not like I would need to do a year worth of research to figure out what the protocol is when you're girlfriend of two years dumps you this is not a hard problem to figure out but when you have no idea what to do it's a real problem and I think I heard this recently then you could probably confirm this but when people kill themselves they kill themselves because they got dumped one of the biggest reasons is they lost their significant other and I talked about this on my podcast as well I was going through buds going through basic skill training and I talked to my mom and my best friend who is my best friend from like first grade through seventh grade he ended up going down the wrong path and he ended up killing himself and my mom said hey this kid Jeff he killed himself and why did he do it in a relationship and he's young and he doesn't have a protocol to follow you don't have a protocol to follow what do you do

[01:10:39] I think the point on suicide that's really tragic so I don't want to quote stats because I just don't know them but directionally oftentimes when someone kills themselves it's due to an acute issue oh for sure in other words oh I get you yeah when you reflect on that for a moment it's very upsetting because yeah the example could be I just lost my job and the shame of not being able to do X Y & Z or I just got dumped or I'm in an acute phase of depression very acute this isn't like I've been sitting in my room for three years with a razor blade just grazing over my wrist and then I finally work up the nerve to do it no that's far less likely and far less often the scenario and so actually what you're saying makes a ton of sense because I would argue that where protocols are most important are in acute moments and that's why you want a protocol yes right so you don't have to think about what to do because another thing that's good is when you have problems when you're caught up in something psychologically one of the best things you can do is do something right take some kind of action that moves you forward what you don't want to do is stay stagnant and dwell on what's happening you want to say okay this horrible thing happened let me get out the book and follow the protocol because that's gonna move me in some direction and it's gonna start to get me to the point where I can move past this whereas staying here stagnant it's not a good protocol there's gonna be a long book my friend and you are prolific I mean your discipline maybe a couple times ago when we were playing patty-cakes I was just blown away at the discipline with your writing because writing is hard there's just no way to put it like I can't say this in any easy it's the hardest thing I've ever tried to do and I'm constantly amazed at the quality of stuff that you can put out whilst doing so many other things so it's hard enough to write if you're a writer if your job is writing all your videos right yeah that's hard don't be a luxury it's a luxury but it's still hard yeah but if writing is your night weekend job which that's what it is for you that's what it is for many people that we know that's what it's sort of becoming for me it's really difficult this will be a long book there's a lot here there is but I'm actually looking at it right now as a pretty keeping it pretty narrow keeping it on the big thing like ten scenarios kind of thing maybe twenty also this is interesting there's protocols for what to do when you don't know what to do right there's protocol xanthine protocol the reason that I know this is because again when I was running seal training I couldn't put a guy in every scenario that there were gonna be and just like we already talked about I couldn't put you in every scenario that you're gonna see there's gonna be some scenarios that you can't predict and I can't predict this is the strategy protocol the protocol for what to do when you don't know what to do it's come back to the strategy and the objective it is so tactically what do you do if you don't know what to do part of it is definitely going back to the strategy but tactically what does that mean what do you do okay so we're getting shot at we're in this situation what do I need to do here's the protocol that you follow and there is a protocol you can follow there like take a step back look around make sure you assess everything that's happening think about what your possibilities are what decisions could you make right now and what would the general outcomes of those decisions be if you can follow that and then say okay take an iterative step towards what you think is the best decision not a giant step because you don't even know what's going on yeah maybe even a reversible step yeah I guess that's what I mean by an iterative a smaller iterative step that's not a full commitment because you're not ready to commit because you don't even know what's happening but we think it's this direction so that's what I'm gonna do it's a very simple protocol I'm gonna take a step back I'm gonna assess everything that I see I'm gonna think about what my possible maneuvers that I can make are I'm gonna think about the outcomes then I'm gonna take a small what you call it a hesitant step but they're just a non committed ya a non committed step that I can somewhat move in right direction that right there if you know that's the protocol and you don't know what's happening that's a great protocol that's a fantastic protocol and that's gonna cover a lot of bases because guess what even though we write to cover 20 scenarios or 20 protocols of bad things that can happen good things can happen it's not gonna cover them all there's gonna be things that you don't expect there's sort of a parallel here between what you're describing and what

[01:14:55] Jordan Peterson has written about in 12 rules and I don't know Jordan but I know you know him pretty well have you guys talked about this cuz just listening to this I see it as this significant parallel we haven't talked about this specific thing because I've only truly started talking about it in the last six months you know it came up on my podcast and it actually came up on the podcast I had discussed it before in terms of people dying right I've discussed that before and then basically there's two podcasts that I did where I covered two protocols one of them was someone died a father had written in and said my wife and I lost our kid I don't know what to do and when someone asks you that question the sad thing is is I actually do know what to do because I've dealt with it a lot and I I know what I've done I know what I've figured out to do I didn't know it at first but I figured out over time like this is what you actually do here's the protocol that I'm recommending to you do these things do these things and that's gonna get you and the other thing I gave them was an understanding of what you're gonna feel because what's gonna happen is you're gonna get hit with a tidal wave that you are gonna think is gonna consume you forever that's what it's gonna feel like and what you don't realize especially when you first get hit with a tidal wave is that tidal wave that's going to eventually subside a little bit a little bit and what happens is people feel guilty about that because they say all of a sudden oh wait for a split second I wasn't thinking about this person that I lost I'm a bad person it's like no that's actually you're not a bad person you're starting to move right and that's okay and eventually these waves of pain the period of these waves is going to separate more and more and the strength of the waves is going to subside the other thing that's scary about it is when we lose someone and you have that kind of heavy sorrow sometimes for the first time in your life you can't control your sorrow like you'll be sitting there and you'll look at something in to remind you of someone and you'll start crying you'll break down and you can't control it which is scary for people it's very scary to have that happen and they think this is the way it's gonna be from now on and what I try to explain to people is like no that's not what it's gonna be like from now on this is what it's like right now but those waves of sorrow are gonna diminish over time and that's not bad that's not bad it's good actually it's good and you should look when the sorrow diminishes when the wave is a little bit weaker you should get okay cool I'm starting to process this I'm starting to get through it I'm starting to accept the situation I'm in and in the final thing that I told this particular individual was like okay when you get to a point then what you do is you're gonna write a letter to your child you're gonna explain to them how much they meant to you how much you love them how much you cherish the time you were together and how you are going to move forward and you're gonna live a beautiful life and you're never gonna stop thinking about them but you're gonna move you're gonna do incredible things with your life to honor them and then you're gonna take that to where they're buried and you're gonna give it to him you're gonna read it to them and then you're gonna walk away you're gonna move on because you have to because otherwise what are you doing you're burdening you're burdening this soul with your own sorrow you're ruining your life on account of them they don't want that they don't want that they want you to move on they wanted me to be happy so go and move on and be happy so that was one protocol and the other protocol is like okay when you break up with someone what are you gonna do and if you have a good protocol to follow and you have a good way to think about that then it's gonna be very positive for you I think the big connection I made there is explaining to people that when someone dumps you the main thing you have to consider to get through that is when you get dumped you have to recognize that the person that dumped you is not the person that you thought they were so if my girlfriend dumps me

[01:18:59] I have her in this elevated position she's a freaking angel right she's an angel but she dumped me she's not an angel the person that dumped me the person that I miss the person that I thought I was gonna spend that person doesn't exist it's not that person for sure because that person wouldn't a dumped you so you have to get through that part and there's a bunch of other things to do from a protocol perspective when you get dumped but I think that's the key fact the key fact you have to recognize that the person that you thought was your everything doesn't exist that's a hard reality to face but it's a better reality than the person that I was my forever person doesn't want me forever that's a worse reality to face and it's also not the reality and there's probably even another side to that going back to what you said earlier which is we could also take the view of I'm probably not completely without fault here there's almost inevitably something

[01:19:48] I can learn about this that I can do better next time yeah for sure there's no doubt about it and I think that's something to consider more when you're in the relationship when you're in the relationship and things are not going the way you want them to most likely you're doing something wrong now I can tell you right now a good relationship will have challenges right so if all you're doing is submitting constantly to your partner that's not engaging for them so that attitude of like well I've done something wrong what can I fix I've done something wrong what can I fix I've done something wrong what can I fix the reality is okay it's not hey I've done something wrong it's hey the ownership that I'm taking is I have feelings for this person that I shouldn't actually have they're actually unrealistic feelings so I'm not necessarily gonna be looking at hey there's a problem in relationship it's my fault and I need to change the way I am to strengthen this relationship mmm if I'm going out with a girl and things aren't right I take ownership by saying hey you know what maybe I've done a bad job selecting this situation now once you're married and you have kids guess what you could take ownership of some problems because you're in there you're in there you want to make it work and something as stupid as what I'd say in the other days doing some kind of a Q&A and an event or something and it's like hey if your wife makes bad sandwiches or no I'm saying if you're if your wife didn't wake up and time to make sandwiches for the kids and you could say like hey you didn't make sandwiches for the kids your immediate reaction that is not gonna be good from her you know I've been up all night I was this I was that energy why don't you make the sandwiches and you're already in a bad situation whereas if you wake up and say hey I noticed you didn't get make sandwiches is there anything I can do to help maybe it'd be better if I made the sandwiches in the morning and like that's gonna move your relationship in the right direction for sure so get some my two cents on relationship advice and I wish

[01:21:34] I kept it but in high school college medical school I actually physically had these pieces of paper that I kept with me that were to lists so each time you went through a relationship and it could be a really meaningful one or it could be one that turned out not to be very meaningful but I always felt like there were two things I learned from these relationships and they fed to these two lists the first list was things that I now believe are absolutely essential in the person I'm going to spend the rest of my life with and then the second list was things that I under no circumstance am ever willing to tolerate in a person and every relationship should be able to add at least one thing to those lists and by the way the best relationships will add to both of those lists so and it's hard in the moment to think about that like sometimes you can only think about that in the months that follow or beyond I wish I still had those things because I remember some of them protocol checklist for relationships yeah good I wish I still had it and I don't know it luckily my kids I say luckily my kids are still young enough that we haven't had to have those discussions yep these will be things that we talk about at some point in I don't know that's a whole other world frankly that I don't to think about which is it's one thing when your hearts broken it's another thing when you imagine four parents listening to this it must be much worse when your child's heart is broken I got a lot of experiences in this and the

[01:22:53] SEAL Teams because you're always had guys that were in a relationship one of your friends when your Bros and platoon is in a relationship with a train wreck legitimately a train wreck and it's so clear it's so obvious you're looking at them and there's not one single way in any possible situation any possible thing that you can say that's gonna get them out of this scenario they're going in if it's awful so this is what you see with your kids right you see your kids and then the other thing that happens with kids and happens a lot is everything is so important thing is that you know from your 47 year old self or your 27 year old self you're like oh this is literally no factor at all ever in the world and you are broken about it this is also a good little sanity check to put on yourself you know and like how often are you upset or your this is something that I don't know when I figured out but bad things happen to me

[01:23:52] I'm like okay this is just no factor I'm not gonna waste a one a little bit of energy about what's going on right now because this is gonna be fine and this doesn't matter but believe me I've had conversations with especially my older daughters because I think well for me my daughters are a little bit more they will care more like my son oh really whatever what move past stuff just no factor just that mentality and although in each of my daughters is particularly in their own way they can move past some things other things maybe not but you're looking at them going this will have no bearing I remember telling my my daughter

[01:24:32] I remember saying hey the girls that I went out with in high school can't even remember them they don't even exist and of course when I was 15 years old and I had the girlfriend she was the whole world she was the whole world have anything thought about her then thought about her 30 years it's no is zero factor and that's where you're at right now I know that this situation seems like it's the whole world whether it's school whether it's great whether it's some boy and you think it's a big deal it literally means nothing but here's the deal I could say that over and over and over again just like I could say it to a young seal that's going out with a girl that is a disaster and they're not gonna listen to you because they can't they get trapped in that heart-shaped box and it's you can't use logic it doesn't work very seldom just hearing you say that

[01:25:23] I'm reflecting on all of these things that anyone listening to this can imagine right which is all of these things that we thought mattered so much and then of course they don't one of my favorite Ted arguably still my favorite TED talk it was maybe 2010-2011 Rick Elias Ric will link to it al is very short talk seven or eight minutes and he was one of the passengers on the US air flight that landed in the Hudson actually just ten years ago I was January of 2009 was that flight and his TED talk and and Rick has now become a good friend and I actually can't wait to have him on the podcast at some point his TED talk is so much for me like the David Foster Wallace commencement speech this as water which are just things I listen to so often because there's such stark reminders and one of the things that he talks about is having this gift of knowing you're gonna die in a minute and I've had the luxury of not only getting to know Rick closely to be able to speak about that in much more detail than he can talk about in a seven-minute TED talk but I also went on to meet another guy who I've since introduced Rick and this other guy who was in a very similar situation he was in a helicopter crash and it turned out he had about a minute until impact he survived one other person survived everybody else was torn into pieces like I mean he was trapped under shrapnel and metal looking at dead people all around him that all died in the helicopter crash and independently they both described at the exact same way which is one time slows down to a degree you can't imagine taking a detour for a moment people who have survived the jump off the Golden Gate Bridge all say the same thing that's about a 2.9 to 3.1 second fall 220 feet until you hit what will turn out to be concrete when you hit the water the Golden Gate below the bridge every one of those survivor accounts that I've read says the same thing it's the longest three seconds of your life

[01:27:20] I mean feels like minutes right and so similarly both Rick and Dan this other guys are talking about that minute that you're just waiting to die it's like takes forever second thing they both said independently not scary because Dan hadn't even didn't even know who Rick was until I introduced them even though Rick had already given this talk now for me that's hard to imagine I think for you that's not hard to imagine

[01:27:45] I feel like you understand what that would mean for me I don't know I think that would be really scary but I think the part that they also both talked about really resonates with me which is how sad it is like you just don't want it to end that you're sort of like I'm not ready for this to be the last moment there's something else I want to do there's one more hug I want to give there's one more person I want to see or you know these things but both of these guys have this incredible gift which I think to some extent you've also captured through seeing things that our sanitized world doesn't show us which is you very quickly start to realise what's worth putting energy into and what's not and that's one of these things that Rick talks about is when you basically die and then miraculously don't and you get a gift which is you get a do-over in life you really start to think about he describes it very eloquently which is just like all the time I wasted on all the things that don't matter and yeah this just fits into that category right it's negative energy at sad energy it's all of these things and I still I do it every day Jocko I mean just a week ago someone said something on Twitter which why I'm even looking at Twitter and reading comments like I need a smack in the head for that but I don't often but sometimes I do and sure enough it's

[01:29:02] Twitter right like it's literally the world's worst neighborhood it easily stayed within me for like three hours just thinking about why would somebody say that like you know like and it's again it's not like pure negative energy it's not like I want to kill that person no no it's just like why would they say that like how can they not understand this what do they think bubble then you look back and you're like you wasted three hours yeah you were doing something else but you weren't doing it to the level you could have been doing it right you were distracted you pride yourself in never having a phone at the dinner table okay great give yourself a pat on the back but how many times you sitting at the dinner table in your mind is somewhere else at some email that some patients sent you that was snippy and they were rude and blah blah blah it's like did you're wasting time so I mean can you come up with a protocol for that because to me that is the problem of civilization is like we have lost track what problems really are well I can tell you one protocol is go overseas and have your friends and see a bunch of guys sacrifice their lives and come home and then realize that you talk about these guys how they realize they were given this gift but that's how I feel every single day I can only imagine and I think many of the guys that serve in the military and women that serve in the military that went overseas and spent that time over there like I said hey maybe it's not a good chance you're gonna get killed but you got to face the fact that yeah it's gonna take some luck to get through this and you realize life is a gift without question without question that's a gift I think also something that I talk about a lot and I suppose there's some big philosophical kind of realm behind it because I hear people talk about it but just having the ability to detach from what's going on and look at things from the outside and this is something that I specifically know for a fact that I started doing when I was in the SEAL Teams I know why

[01:31:07] I started doing it I understood the benefit that it gave me but I started applying that to basically everything that happens to me is oftentimes I just am detached from what's going on so I can see that all this doesn't matter this thing right here it doesn't matter it doesn't matter to me these things are not important and from a leadership perspective I talk about the same thing because good leaders they realize what's important what's not and a bad leader gets wound up about something that doesn't matter it just doesn't matter and it's really hard to watch because just like your teenage daughter doesn't realize that this thing doesn't matter you get someone that's the leader and they're mad they're mad about this guy disobeyed me and he didn't do the thing that I told him to do and you're thinking yourself this does not matter and so you tell him this doesn't matter you know what they say but but it no but you don't see no it's like no I'm telling you this doesn't matter I talked about that my podcast when you get good at jujitsu you realize that there's some things that don't matter like it doesn't matter someone's grabbing your hand armed here that doesn't matter what matters is what you're doing over here with your hips that's what matters and so the more advanced you get jiu-jitsu the more you realize what's important in what matters and what doesn't matter and so it's the same thing with life the better you get at life the more you're able to detach from inside your own just storm emotion fill the ego filled crazy brain the more you can get out of that thing and you can take a step back and look at what's actually occurring the better decisions you're gonna be able to make again I'm not saying you should be devoid of emotions in and I'm certainly not devoid of emotions but I know that if I'm gonna make a decision I want to take a step back from those emotions I want to take a step back from that chaos and ma'am because so you can actually see what's important what's not because you're a hundred percent right when you're going out on an operation and you're going into an area where there's been there's been 20 guys killed in the last two months from big IEDs that blew up by the way you've no control over that like you okay you do your best you study the Intel you do mine clearance that you try and take the routes that have been cleared you do all those things great that's fine it doesn't matter you can still get blown up and you can still die that's the way it is so you said yourself okay you accept that and now when you come home after you do that for an extended period of time you come home and you're like I'm actually this little thing over here doesn't really matter I'm gonna be all right I mean the IEDs are I can't imagine that because I don't know why it just strikes me as by far the thing I would be most afraid of if I were in the situation of those soldiers because as you said I don't know what the hell you do about it like you could do everything right not that you can always do everything right but but it's different from saying well no like if I'm in a theater of combat I can be more defensive I can take this posture I can take less risk bowl-like ie D and especially as you said in areas where they seemed completely endemic I mean they were as ubiquitous as sand yeah what do you do then well the thing that's interesting that you're saying is that would worry you the most yeah paradoxically the thing I have the least control over I would spend the most time wasting time thinking about and you wouldn't well hopefully I would have been working for you and you would have beat that out of me we'd been like okay there's nothing we can do about that well actually there is there's some things we can do there's some things we can do to mitigate the risk and we're gonna do those things and once we've mitigated the risks to the best of our ability now we're gonna worry about the things we can't control and we're gonna focus on the things we can control and that's what we're gonna do to get through this because you do not want to get stuck like that no and my guess is you saw people who couldn't get out of that way

[01:34:48] I mean there must have been guys that were paralyzed by that fear there definitely are that's one thing that I I don't want to say this as a rule but it makes me nervous when people are nervous right when you're nervous you're gonna hesitate when you're nervous you're thinking about the wrong things so it made me nervous when guys were nervous I didn't like it I liked when guys were confident they weren't scared that's the guy that's gonna do something aggressive that's gonna keep it from alive cuz oh we're getting shot at I'm gonna go attack that person as opposed to oh we're getting shot at I'm gonna hide because when you're hiding and you're not shooting guess what the enemy's doing they're maneuvering on your they're gonna kill you so I think about that to this day some situations happening to me I don't hide from it I'm gonna go after it I'm gonna get aggressive like I'm gonna default aggressive that's gonna be my mode cuz to sit back and allow and wait things to happen to you the more you do that the more defensive you are the more defensive your mindset is the worst things are gonna turn out let's go back to training because I've never really heard the full story of how you make this progression so when you show up as an enlisted kid in the Navy it's like you and a billion other kids right how many of you are actually thinking I'm gonna go to buds is that the next step like after you do some basic period of time in the Navy I have no idea what the number of people that join the Navy to be in the SEAL Teams is but you end up with a bunch of people that go to basic SEAL training and a bunch of them don't make it so how long were you in

[01:36:17] Orlando before you came out to San Diego eight-week navy boot camp Navy boot camp is pretty straightforward what you're learning in the Navy you're in some kind of an industrial job right that's what you're doing that's what the regular Navy does they're they're running engines they're May painting weapons they're working on the ship that's what you're doing you're doing some kind of a mechanical generally that's what the Navy is right it's a bunch of ships the ships are big machines with engines oh you might be working on aircraft guess what or you're flying an aircraft or you're navigating the ship right so that everything is is a technical and so you have pilots in the Navy that are distinct from Marines which also have pilots yes the Navy has pilots the Air Force have pilots the

[01:37:01] Marine Corps has pilots in the army everyone has pilots I think I want to say the Navy has more aircraft than the Air Force does I might be wrong about that but it's very similar and the army might have probably has more aircraft than both because they have helicopters and they have a 10 so there's every service kind of has their own thing and just like the Army has boats right the

[01:37:20] Army has boats the Marine Corps has some kind of boats as well so yeah everyone's got a little bit of everything but what I'm saying is the Navy is pretty technical yeah there's less hand-to-hand combat in the Navy than the others presumably oh no doubt about that and that's one thing that's a disadvantage for the SEAL Teams the disadvantage for the SEAL Teams is you don't have the basic infantry because you go through army or Marine

[01:37:41] Corps boot camp you're getting basic infantry skills whereas the Navy doesn't give you basic impression skills now are there guys that go from being in the Marines to the seals there are you have to get out you have to transfer you have to go into the Navy but that's it happens oh so when you enlist as a

[01:37:56] Marine you're not enlisting in the Navy first you're in the marine you're directly in the marine corps yeah okay so eight weeks in eight weeks out you now go straight to buds yeah and then you go to buds well and this is one of those things where it's what they do right now as you go from boot camp you go to I think it's it's like a prep course where you go for two months in Chicago and you basically run swim and get in good shape to go to buds okay now you were already in pretty good shape showing up I'm guessing did you know what you were gonna have to do and did you train to do that back when you were in New England we had no idea so for instance if I thought well I know we can do a lot of pull-ups so I'm gonna do a lot of pull-ups what was a lot of pull-ups to me when I was 18 years old a lot of folks was like five sets of 12 right that's what you're gonna do that seemed like a good workout now I mean I do hundreds and hundreds of pull-ups when I do pull-ups now hundreds 500 pull-ups right that's a normal workout but I didn't know that so you go to buds and you don't know it just same thing with push-ups like you're gonna do so many push-ups so no I wasn't ready you weren't ready for buds the kids now are much more prepared because they know more about what's gonna happen there's training programs you can watch the whole damn you can watch all of buds I didn't know anything about buds so buds is basic underwater demolition SEAL training yeah okay and how many weeks isn't the basic part is 26 weeks so it's six months and what is the process or what is the attrition rate over that 26 weeks is it mostly in the beginning yeah it's mostly in the beginning yeah 70 or 80 percent attrition rate and is the hell week very early and that actually changes around when I went through was like the fifth week I think and it's somewhere around there maybe it's the fourth week maybe it's a six week but it's somewhere around there they give you a month or so to get ready and then you go through hell week and and hell week is that the greatest period of attrition it is the biggest period of attrition yeah so let's talk about what hell week is you do once you're working out for five days and the conditions are pretty tough I mean you're in San Diego the water ain't warm yeah the water is cold you don't sleep and you work out a bunch the thing is man people make SEAL training into this mythical thing and and it's really not but you've told me stories I remember you telling me about a guy who was in your class who was like the top water polo player coming out of

[01:40:11] UCLA like you couldn't create a better aquatic machine a better specimen er than someone who can keep their hands out of water yeah yeah maneuver and propel themselves like I am as good a swimmer as the average shmell out there I can't do that very well so how does this guy not pass putts you didn't want to be there apparently so that's the part I'm interested in right it's like the mental fortitude that is required to suffer yeah but there's knuckleheads that make it through I'm telling you I mean I've had a couple of my buddies reach out to me and say you said buds is easy it's not and they're right it's not it's not easy and I had a sort of time moves anymore I made it through one class which means I didn't get rolled back but what does that mean when I went through if you failed there's three phases that you'd go through and you know what don't quote me on this stuff it's like kind of what I remember but in first phase so basically there's two things going on one they're waiting for you to quit yes - there's metrics you must hit during the workouts yes so run swim obstacle course and then they have these other kind of evolutions that are just gonna crush you so like underwater not tying you go down to 15 feet they've got a little cord down there you tie a knot on it they give you a thumbs up or a thumbs down you retie it and then you go up you get a breath you come down you tie another one this is a kind of thing where it's like it doesn't sound like that big of a deal but a bunch of people fail underwater not telling life-saving same thing you're gonna rescue a seal instructor from quote-unquote drowning and this person's doing everything to drown they're gonna drown you so that's one pool competency which is where you're learning scuba and they're bringing you down there and they're ripping your mask off and they're pulling your regulator around they're just gonna they're basically gonna again they're gonna make you as uncomfortable as they possibly can in the water and you're either gonna bolt to the surface in which case you fail or you're gonna do the wrong procedures in which case you fail so they got these kind of things that you're constantly doing there was also some crazy thing you told me about that like in the water you had to do something like a pretty long breath hold with a pretty significant task it was beyond the knot tying well there's a 50 meter underwater swim which is not that big of it without fins or with fins that's without fins jeez that's hard I guarantee you could do that you're a swimmer so anyways there's those and then these timed evolutions that you have to do run swim an obstacle course so to make a long story short for me none of those were easy I was not a good runner I was not a good swimmer what was the run criteria roughly those

[01:42:37] I remember because those haven't changed but there's a caveat to him so the run first phase for miles soft sand boots 32 minutes second phase 30 minutes third phase 28 minutes so meaning you had to do three runs and here are those times successively they were weekly okay and you had to hit those times and if you missed those times you failed so the last ones 28 minutes so it's a 7 minute MA 7 min tomorrow which is a joke right well it's a joke on pavement but it's not a joke and here's the caveat the caveat is you're in sand you're in boots you the night before did 1,000 literally 1,000 eight count bodybuilders which is like a burpee with another movement in there you slept for three hours you're on the beach it's cold and the run that's supposed to be four miles is actually four point four two miles or whatever you have no idea but so it's not as easy as it sounds it doesn't sound it crushes plenty of people now if you ran track in high school it's not gonna be hard for you if you swam in high school the swims are gonna be easy for you if you wrestled you're probably gonna do pretty good on the obstacle course so there's some advantages you can have for me it was all hard I wasn't great at running I wasn't great at swimming and I failed to run I failed to run because I decided I was gonna pace myself and by the way you're not allowed to wear a watch and so I wasn't wearing a watch I paced myself as now you know i'ma save a little energy so I went out and was coming to the finish line and the guy started pointing to the you can go over there and take a knee he's pointing to the ocean which means you failed and so

[01:44:08] I'm saying I'm like damn it but from then on I just had to run as hard as I possibly could because you have no idea how long it's gonna be you have no idea what your time is so I would just go on from then on and you don't run together you're staggered in the start this is like on your mark get set go everybody yeah everyone every man for himself and so yeah some people pass some people fail and that's the one that I failed so

[01:44:26] I failed to swim as well and the same thing and actually this one I was swim with a guy who wasn't the best swimmer and this wasn't a funny story I swim the guy who is not a great swimmer and there's something called guiding which means you're looking at the shore and you're keeping yourself going in a straight line either way what are you wearing when you swim in the ocean what we used to wear was the crappy useless wetsuit tops with a beaver tail bottom that led water flow through them it was almost pointless nowadays they were a little bit nicer look the shorty wetsuit so when you guide you're looking you're keeping the disc easing the distance you're going in the right direction so myself and my swim buddy we failed this swim and so now we're all lined up with all the other people that fail to swim and we have to go and explain what happened and my swim buddy he says what went wrong with you guys and I said something like didn't swim hard enough right which is the right answer my swim buddy says willing doesn't know how to guide meaning it was my fault and

[01:45:24] I was kind of taken aback because I didn't expect it and the instructors were like okay fine they split us up and put us with other swim buddies and I passed the next one and this guy failed it again but this all happened in one week because you said a lot of people have to repeat butts right there's a lot of people that get rolled back which means you got hurt or you failed so when

[01:45:45] I went through and again this is to the best of my recollection because here's the thing man SEAL training is a little tiny fraction of your career no one freaking cares about it we never sit around in this story to talk about it like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter if no one cares about buds here's the deal with buds you work out a bunch for six months that's the deal you compare buds to being in a convoy getting ready to roll out in the city of Ramadi or getting ready to patrol out of one of the foreign operating bases there the mentality is not even close it doesn't compare does buds accomplish what it sounds like is one of the most important or two things that seem the most important one making sure that the soldier is physically prepared at a certain level and to and perhaps more importantly making sure that the mental fortitude is at a level as well I'd say it does a decent job you'd get like probably a 90 percent solution on those physically ready like yeah 90 percent the guys come out of there and they're pretty good to go once they get to team ninety percent of the guys they get out of there and they're pretty good to go as far as I care not gonna give up but you still end up with guys in the SEAL Teams that are totally weak and totally mentally pathetic and this is the way it is every organization it can't perfectly screen anything right

[01:46:54] I mean it just doesn't work and I'm guessing that Budds is not a predictor of your success as a seal in other words bud says almost zero prediction of what someone's gonna be like as a seal because you can be a great athlete right it doesn't test leadership for example it doesn't really test teamwork to a high level sure there's teamwork things that you have to do but you can play the game to get through the training and then you can show up at a team and be a complete idiot and look out for yourself and then you're not a good team member there's a test intelligence barely yeah so you've got intelligence intuition leadership there are lots of things that are necessary to succeed is a seal yeah buds is pretty as far as all that stuff goes yeah if you took guys and said okay this guy did great in buds one of the chances that he's a great seal it's a random number generators a coin toss it's pretty much a coin toss those guys that go through buds that are studs and there's horrible seals they're just horrible seals and no one wants them so we don't hear about these seals like we sort of think well fewer seals or if you're a ranger or if you're Delta like if you're elite of the elite by definition it's a meritocracy isn't everybody perfect everybody's awesome that's the funny thing is everyone thinks oh if you were in the

[01:48:04] SEAL Teams then you're a great leader if you're in the SEAL Teams and you're got incredible teamwork and everyone thinks that but no it's not true at all I'm a perfect example because people think Oh jock was super strong or jock was super athlete I'm not a super strong and I'm not a super athlete by any stretch I'm kind of like average I'm kind of like low average you know and do I work out a lot sure I work out a lot but I couldn't win a damn weightlifting competition in any situation just not that so I'm a good example of the fact that people get a mythical idea that every seal is a great leader every seal is a great athlete or every seal was incredible mental fortitude when did you get out 11 2010 yeah that's hard to believe it's been that long it is it is oh my god time does go faster the older we get yes yes it does indeed what was the hardest transition for you to getting out your kids were young pretty young yeah what was it like were there moments when you're at a stoplight and it occurs to you like no one's actually trying to kill you that's coming home from deployment when you come home from deployment that part is a very clear one especially my first deployment were in vehicles all the time and the IE D threat was high and you were getting used to it and we were doing convoys in

[01:49:19] Baghdad and it was like okay cool these people we don't want to let him in our convoy and you're driving really aggressive so there's a little bit of that but once I came home I was from my last deployment was doing work and you get rid of those feelings after we had a little when we came home from Ramadi we had a little I'd call a little decompression time where wasn't formal but we were going hard we were celebrating life I'll put it that way we were happy to be home we were mourning the fact that we lost guys and we were a little bit I know I personally was going I was just going living hard we'll say that living hard was it hard for your wife to sort of I guess it's hard for me to put myself in her shoes or your shoes for that matter but more so in hers to think I've kind of been holding down the fort here and

[01:50:08] I'm really glad you're home but I'm confused as to why you're doing this or was she totally understanding of my wife is a saint my wife is a saint and first of all when I was gone my wife was raising our three kids at the time she was holding down the fort she was giving me zero concerns look I was overseas and as far as I knew everything was fine everything was perfect no water heater was broken no car was broken down no kid was sick no diapers were being changed everything was just handled well that's what was going on and then my wife was going to visit my guys that were wounded in the hospital my wife was going to my guys funerals and she was doing that and by the way when you've got families of seals that are going to the funerals of guys from the task unit every single one of those wives knows that there's just a coin toss that that's not my husband that that's not my son that's not everybody they feel that right so basically when you're going to to bury one of your spouse's teammates there's no way you can't think that one of the chances that this is my husband and it never occurred to me until you just said that but you're not there no I never really thought about that yeah the funerals are the families without the soldiers well there's seals there that go that are back but many of the families are going without there yes yeah so everyone from tasking a bruiser every one of those spouses kids that are all going and they're seeing one of their dad's friends get buried so your kids was your oldest even old enough to have gone my kids did not go no my kids did not go when they got older and there would be especially my son I would take my son if a seal gets killed we'll go to the memorial service because I want him to see what it's about you know what I mean you need to understand what this is because everyone thinks like I said when you're a kid you think I'll know this will never happen to me you know but you got to realize no this is real this is what happens and that's part of life that's part of war and all the glory that people talk about a war they don't show this part of it so but my wife was doing all that and so when I came home and she was just happy

[01:52:24] I was home more than anything else and my wife has always been very emotionally independent she also knew that I'm not normal and she made that pretty clear to me maybe a year or so ago when I was explaining something else try to explain the way someone was behaving and I was kind of saying oh I would never do that and she's like you're not normal and she didn't say it but not a derogatory state is the first time where she said because you'd said it before but she said it in a way that was I was thinking about it she was the thing is you're not normal and I thought about it I thought you know what she's right I'm not normal and that's fine but as far as me coming home she was awesome and she when I said that she basically supported me wonder what I was doing here's an example I'm a total jerk when it comes to jujitsu and we were married I was in in a platoon I was in a task unit and when I'd come home from work at 7 o'clock at night I would grab my bag and I'd go train jujitsu and then

[01:53:26] I'd get up the next morning at 5 o'clock in the morning and I'd go to work and she wouldn't see me all day and I come home and seven o'clock the next day and I take on my back and I go to jujitsu and I would say of the hundreds and hundreds of times that I did that there was probably three times that I can remember where she was actually looking at me with with a look of disappointment like are you serious right now you've been gone for three weeks you've been working every night until seven o'clock and you're gonna actually go and train jiu-jitsu instead of hanging out with your kids for an hour before they go to sleep and three times out of hundreds and hundreds of times is pretty legitimate but she realized that I'm not normal and that she realized that her objections to that were not worth it because now all of a sudden I'm not doing something that really is important to me not that my family's not important to me but this is my release this is

[01:54:14] I think so she cleared me hot you know almost every single time other than maybe three but it's funny like I remember we were talking maybe last year at some point and you said something that really resonated with me because each passing day I feel it more and more and it was we were talking about doing something going somewhere and you're like you know there is nothing I like doing more than hanging out with my family like when it's me and my wife and my daughters and my son and we're at home like there's really nothing else I want to do and nowhere else I want to go and it's sort of funny like I've been reflecting on that and I was like you know I kind of feel the same way like I just never like going anywhere anymore I really most enjoy being home yeah and that's a relatively recent phenomenon for me I don't know it was that an evolution for you well two things number one I'm doing jujitsu right I'm working out everyday if there's waves I'm surfing I play guitar a lot when I family sitting around whether they want to hear me or not but those are some things so I definitely want to do those things and to be quite frank if there was a war going on and I was still active duty and I don't want to be going doing that and this is another crazy thing about my wife is like I used to tell my wife think about this this is hard and I caught some flak I said this on the podcast but here's the reality the situation I told my wife was like the team's is my number one priority the

[01:55:40] SEAL Teams is my priority in my life you are up there but that's my number one priority and that's a crazy thing to say right that's just a crazy thing to say and one of the things that I didn't really make clear on the podcast but when I talked about it is one of the reasons that it's not just it is my party has to be my priority it has to be my priority because here's the deal I'm gonna go overseas I'm gonna be in a combat situation the best thing that I can do for our family is be completely and utterly as prepared as I possibly can so that when things happen I'm ready so I can come home and by the way it's not just me I got 40 guys that are counting on me to make the right decisions at the right time so they come home to so when I say that the SEAL Teams is my priority the reason is because that's my tactical priority right now so that's strategically in the long run

[01:56:35] I'll be here in the future and so will my friends so I had to clarify that a little bit because that's a pretty harsh statement to make do you think that most of your peers felt the same way most I don't know but a lot of them a lot of them man I'm telling you when you're in the seal platoon when you're a young guy on a sailboat and there's nothing else in the world the rest of the world doesn't exist or it exists only for you to go and get into but thinking about what you said a moment ago right which was if tomorrow there was a need for you to go back and serve under the same conditions so not in some nice green zone where you're there in part but you're actually back out there in front of the IDS you would do it again yeah today yes you have three kids you have a wife I have four kids I mean you've got different responsibilities than you had when you were 25 and yet you would be willing to go out there and make that sacrifice and I have to tell you I wouldn't understand I've never really thought about it until now but the way you frame it that way like I I would not be willing to do it I might think I'm too selfish I would not do that and I wonder how many of your peers today meaning the guys that you were with in your twenties in your 30s who now are in the situation you are in which is they've been civilians for a decade they have families do you have a sense of how many of them could actually go back and put their lives at that type of risk a decent amount Wow yeah decent amount yeah there's something you used the word selfish to describe yourself and I mean that's obviously pretty harsh but to go in the opposite direction there's something incredibly unselfish about the guys that

[01:58:18] I used to work with and the guys that still serve right now and it's not a completely I don't want to make everyone out to be these kind of angelic people because there's definitely some self gratification in it like you love doing this and so it's not a hundred percent just you're an angel but there's guys that are willing to sacrifice I mean that's what the US military is filled with the

[01:58:43] US military is filled with men and women that are willing to set aside everything that they have including their life because they believe in a higher ideal and yeah that's a huge huge incredible thing that's why it's so incredible to have been part of that in any way it's incredible do you think part of it is just if you believe the idea that there's no such thing as true well tourism right so even when we act at our most altruistic it's because we are getting something from that we are getting a sense of connectedness we are getting a sense of joy a sense of pride a sense of relational connectivity so what you're describing is like this higher calling that says look I mean there is no higher honor do you think that there's just something missing from the world today versus the world in the 1940s post-world

[01:59:33] War two you know David Brooks has written about this quite a bit in a book that he wrote several years ago called the road to character where he talks about the difference between eulogy virtues and resume virtues and he talks a lot about a big turning point which was sort of post-world War two during the Second World War you didn't just have to be a soldier to understand sacrifice right the women who weren't going to war were killing themselves here making ammunition people were everyone in the country knew what a sacrifice was now the highest sacrifice was paid by the young men on the front lines but everybody was connected to that Vietnam which would be the next major conflict I guess Korea but then

[02:00:15] Vietnam it became disconnected and I would argue that what you went through was even more disconnected so part of the argument of Brooks is we lost something when we lost that connection I don't think he articulated that way but the gist of it was many good things happen from the progression of society through the 60s and 70s and Beyond but one of the things we sort of lost was this sense of something greater than ourselves I guess I wonder if that's part of what appeals to you still is why would you risk today potentially I again as a thought experiment not seeing your family again there must be something really really amazing to take that risk and that amazing thing is is it this sense of a purpose that goes so far beyond anything you can contemplate as a civilian yeah yeah I guess it is because it's very clear to me yeah when you ask this question it's a little bit as I listen to you the fact that you remove I miss it you're like no I wouldn't do that not even like well you know I get it

[02:01:19] I mean we could press you further like if it was an existential threat to you and your family you'd be on the front line so there's the difference I guess there's the connection part that you're talking about and I guess for me I still have a connection in my blood to the guys that I worked with from the guys that raised me in the SEAL Teams that if there was something that they needed me do your thought is well yes I'll be there you know I think part of it is I just feel like my world is shrinking as

[02:01:48] I get older and I feel less and less important I think I'm converging at a point where I think technically the only thing that matters is my family and they're the only ones who I can really influence in a way that matters and therefore my life is not that important outside of that I don't think I have enough belief that I matter or can make a difference outside of that that sounds like such a nihilist view which is not how I I don't want to take that to an extreme or I can just imagine how many people are gonna write and say oh you're an idiot for saying that but again I'll try not to read it right but I just think I have a shrinking view of my place in the universe I think I feel less and less significant as time passes on and that's not a bad thing for someone with my appetite for grandiosity to feel less and less significant but it converges - yeah you know what in the end like outside of your kids your wife your closest closest friends family like you're sort of irrelevant like if you fell off the planet tomorrow it wouldn't matter the earth wouldn't even slow one degree on its axis and so more of that effort feels like those are the only people who matter and those are the ones who I want to make sure I'm doing the best for so I guess that's where it comes from but it also says that I probably can't relate to even when I watch a movie like Saving

[02:03:16] Private Ryan which I mean I'm sure everybody has seen that but if you listen to this and you haven't seen it you must watch it that opening scene is riveting on many levels but one of the levels cuz I actually went to Normandy by total coincidence I was there in December of 99 and I happened to go to

[02:03:37] Normandy on December 6th of 99 which if you're like me and you like to do the math you realize is 666 months to the day from the d-day invasion June 6th of 44 or 45 sorry so in December which is not a nice time in the year to be in northern France the weather was horrible but it actually looked just like the photos of that day which is why that invasion was so challenging because you didn't get what you expected in June one of the gifts of doing that was there was not another soul at the cemetery so you could see 10,000 crosses virtually unobstructed also when I climbed down the cliffs at Omaha it was like awful it was like the weather was awful and so I got to look up and see or at least try to imagine what it would have looked like to be a lamb in a slaughterhouse and what occurred to me was what you said a second ago which was how many of those kids died how quickly did they die and how easy it is it to forget right how many dreams were never realized and that was another thing that I mean just made me cry was looking at the dates on the crosses because even by that point I was in my late 20s or something and I realized that virtually all of them were younger than me and I was like wait this guy never got to go to school this guy never got to go to college this guy never got married and I don't know I'm the one hand I think they died with more purpose than all probably ever have but more than that I was riveted by but did that person's actual life matter more dead or alive in other words like would we have lost the war if John Smith hadn't died on that day these are silly arguments that are circular but the answer to that question is no we wouldn't lost the war if John Smith didn't die on that day but if we didn't have the hundreds and hundreds of thousands millions of John

[02:05:37] Smith John Smith's that were ready to go and make the ultimate sacrifice darkness would have prevailed changing gears from it how do you think about warfare in that evolution that we just talked about right World War 2 Vietnam Afghanistan Iraq don't forget Korea I have forgotten Korea twice now they call it the

[02:05:57] Forgotten War yeah there's a reason yeah there's a reason and Korea was a complete nightmare in many respects and all wars are hell and Korea is right up there right up there Korea was 50 of what 51 55 yeah how much of an evolution took place between World War two in Korea from a military strategic and tactical point pretty similar except for the fact that towards the end of Korea it turned into almost like a trench warfare scenario like almost a world war one type scenario over the Demilitarized Zone yeah they were in trenches I mean not even kind of they were in trenches and they're fighting over could we push their trench back a hundred yards so that kind of happened but it we at least learned like okay you know what we're in their trench in their in their trench it's kind of hold what we got here for a little while instead of which World War one to me

[02:06:47] World War one is the ultimate just nightmare of a war remind me the casualties cuz they always blow my mind and this is like I talk about how good my memory is this is something I constantly forget because it's so upsetting World War 1 Battle of the Somme 60,000 casualties in the first 24 hours to put that in perspective what was the casualty on the American side from 9/11 till today approximately I don't know less than 10,000 and 10,000 was the d-day invasion within four days yeah so the casualties are in those wars were complete insane completely insane in world war on was a special kind of nightmare the thing that I hate about World War one is it didn't really matter how good you were with tactics with leadership with your skill level you were gonna get told at zero 600 when you hear the bugle or you hear the whistle you're gonna go over the top and you're gonna charge and by the way at 5:45 another battalion went and you're gonna hear them get mowed down they're not gonna survive and ten minutes later another battalion is gonna go they're not gonna survive and then at six o'clock you're gonna go and you're not gonna survive and there's nothing you can do about it that is the most sickening war I hate that war

[02:08:09] I hate all wars but that one I I especially hate because of that and because there's some horrible things in world war one if you are an able-bodied man in England and for whatever reason you weren't in a uniform or you weren't going into service so let's say you are the sole support for their family and they wouldn't have to go there was a thing that they would women would give someone a white flower which means you're a coward so to think about that that's the way the society was and by the way and then you were gonna go and you were going to sit in a trench and do you got told to attack and you were gonna die and the fact that these soldiers on both sides did this day after day month after month year after year it's incredible it's incredible that no senior leader called [ __ ] on it no one said you know what this is the dumbest thing I've ever heard

[02:09:10] I'm not gonna send my 700 member telling you to die tomorrow not gonna do it you can shoot me and by the way they did did a podcast about that shot at dawn they took British soldiers that had serious PTSD and traumatic brain injuries that couldn't fight anymore refused to fight bring him out in the morning and shoot him and they were all pardoned but it's just crazy it's crazy to even think about so that's why I get very I always talk a lot about the fact that people think of know they're you just follow orders like go you just follow orders that's what you gonna do it's like no actually no if something's not a good plan then I'm not gonna obey it I'm not gonna obey orders just for the sake of obeying orders that's a tough one too and that's a great business lesson right if that's not cut and dry either because if you tell me to do something that's gonna get my platoon killed and I say

[02:10:01] Peter or sir you know captain Peter I'm not gonna do it and you go okay cool you're fired and here's one of my other guys who's a yes-man and he's gonna take him and he's gonna do what I told him to do so would I have been better to said you know what captain I totally disagree with what you're doing here's another plan here's an alternate no do it my way

[02:10:20] I really disagree I think it's gonna get people I don't care do it my way am I better off at that point saying okay I'll got it and I go and I'm it again risks to the best of my ability or am I better off holding the line and saying you know what you can find someone else and maybe that's enough to wake you up and say wait a second Jacque was been a great guy he's been really supportive now he's telling me no I must be wrong there's that fine line well it's gonna depend heavily on both of those things right it's a function of your track record and it's a function of that person's humility for sure for sure but as the young leader that's a decision I'm gonna have to make which is gonna be better for me which is gonna be better for my troops more importantly which is gonna be better for my troops is it could be better for me to hold the line and say boss this is such a bad plan that I am not willing to execute it you can fire me you can send me to court-martial or whatever but this is a horrible plan it's gonna get people killed and then you go fine you're getting court-martialed and by the way here's Joe and he's gonna do what I told him to do when I read crack hours book where men win glory it's a powerful book on so many levels but a big part of it again is the complete and utter futility of the mission that cost Pat Tillman his life like I couldn't understand and you have to help me understand this you remember the details right there was like I don't know is like a helicopter a

[02:11:36] Humvee that was down like they basically had to go in and get a downed piece of equipment and go through what was clearly a completely risky expose terrain and then of course on top of that to die a friendly fire just is the ultimate you know injury upon insult but I'm reading this and of course you know how it ends when you're reading it which makes it hard to read and you're thinking like how did nobody because there was like it's been so long since

[02:12:02] I've read it but one of the very senior people on the ground so not in command but on the ground was like it's an awful idea there's an awful idea like we're gonna risk the lives of 10 men to get a piece of equipment nope that's the plan we're doing it i I just and you think well okay that story got written by

[02:12:22] Krakauer because of Pat Tillman how many times did that story happen how many Pat Tillman's are there that's why I tell people all the time and I tell them in business too because it happens in business too but in the military in business if you're a subordinate and you have an obligation and in some cases a moral obligation to stand up and say hey

[02:12:41] I don't know I don't think this is the best plan again I wish it was that cut and dry because there's a good chance that if you're Pat Tillman's platoon commander and you say hey boss is a horrible idea I'm not doing it the general or the colonel says okay fine you're not doing it cool I'm sending this other group of guys I'm firing you and replacing you this is what makes leadership so hard it does happen in the business world too and what is all this stem from it goes back to we were talking about earlier this is a lack of humility up the chain of command you've got people that are not humble you can also take ownership for yourself because if you're telling me to do something that I don't think it's smart and I haven't developed a good enough relationship with you where you actually listen to me which is by the way everything that I'm trying to do as a subordinators I'm trying to get a relationship with you so that you trust me so that when I actually say to you hey boss this isn't a good idea you listen and that's the goal right because if I don't take any ownership and say hey my boss told me to do something I just have to go do it like no you have to take ownership of that relationship you have to make sure that they understand that you have to support them enough so that you trust me because if everything that you tell me to do I object to well then I'm just a boy that cried wolf and eventually you just say all jock who doesn't wanna do anything I say but if I do what you tell me to do and I support you and I carry out the things that you want me to carry out and then eventually you tell me to do something when I say this doesn't make any sense you'll listen to me so we have to take ownership of the relationship that we have up the chain of command otherwise your at the whim of some random person that you don't know and that doesn't listen to you I can't remember which organization coined this term but the obligation to dissent is basically what it's called right which is you actually as a subordinate you have an obligation to speak up when something is wrong not that it's an option it's an obligation is that becoming more ingrained in the culture of the military what's interesting Napoleon said that

[02:14:24] Napoleon said if you get told to do something that you know is a bad plan and you executed you're culpable that's Napoleon so this is ideas been around for a long time as to where it falls out in the military today it's all over the place in other words it still so even the style of leadership is that decentralized when I said it's all over the place I use the wrong term I meant that it's scattered so some places have its what I mean it's heterogeneous lis laced some people are good leaders that listen to the decentralized command and some people are not and that's the way it is and are we moving in the right direction I sure hope so I'm doing my best to get it there so going back to

[02:15:01] World War one the time between World War 1 and World War 2 is about 20 years right yeah 1918 to 1939 and when we think about like 20 years ago seems like yesterday mm-hmm in that 20 year period what were the significant changes in either technology strategy maneuver warfare maneuver yeah cuz World War two has almost nothing in common with World

[02:15:21] War one in terms of the fighting towards the end of World War one the Germans started to employ decentralized command that's what they started to do they started say you know what sergeant we got some bad guys over here go and figure out how to handle this actually came from the Napoleonic Wars where the

[02:15:41] Germans the Austrians the Prussians got beat up by Napoleon and they started to say why are we getting beaten by Napoleon and what they realized was they had too much centralized command they had a bunch of fundamental problems and so they started to make plans to figure out a better way to run their organizations that's where you find a the famous command staff the German

[02:16:06] Austrian command staff that's sort of like a famous thing and that's where it started well they didn't really get it going till the end of or one because it's so hard to change a big organizations attitude by the end of World War one they started doing it they started doing decentralized command they started doing maneuver warfare it would have really helped them but they were way late they waited till the end and by then they didn't have the men or material to continue the war so you take 20 years so they realized that at the end it was working they still are gonna lose they get crushed by the Treaty of

[02:16:34] Versailles and now when they start rebuilding they start rebuilding with the attitude we're gonna move fast we're gonna use maneuver warfare we use decentralized command and that's what they did that's what blitzkrieg was it was decentralized command maneuver warfare very quickly and they would have done exceptionally well and continued to do well the Germans had they not started to centralize everything back again to

[02:16:55] Hitler who started making decisions and started telling the generals that were on the Eastern Front what to do what year approximately did Hitler kill Rommel uh it was towards the end was toward the end right it was like 43 44 yeah yeah I've only read one book on Rommel and I don't know why I find him to be such a fascinating character I imagine there are Rommel scholars out there what book did you read attacks yellow cover I can show it to you I still have it and it's been about ten years I thought of doing Rommel on the podcast and I'm actually gonna start off with how he the circumstances under which he killed himself for which he was murdered will have depending on what I said very interesting circumstances they know they brought him and said ok you either gonna go out as a hero and will take care of your family or everyone dies so what do you want unbeliev joke about the car Hitler thought he was part of the group that tried to kill him which I don't think he was certainly that's not how I read it was that he was not one of the guys who worked for me many years ago loved the book so much because after I read it I think I bought a copy for all the guys that I was working with and he typed up these incredible notes from it I'll find them and send them to you you will love this it's like 20 pages of like wasn't a book by Rommel no because his most famous book is attacks that's the book when

[02:18:06] George C Scott is playing Patton he's saying I read your book because that book is about world war 1 and it's a great book and there's some really really good lessons in there it's written very German dry straightforward these are the facts every section has a little section at the end that's like the lessons learned which is probably the highlight when I dude on the podcast I probably spend most of my time in those sections it's also very very tactical now inside tactical lessons there are leadership lessons there are strategic lessons inside tactical lessons for sure but it is very tactical a very tactical book the Rommel papers okay that's the one I'll take a look at that one yeah and it's funny you think about how even at the level of an enormous war slightly different decisions right like you could argue Hitler's arrogance in

[02:18:51] North Africa hundred percent cost them the war and his arrogance to think I can fight on two fronts in the Western in the East that's probably the bigger one and I'll tell you what the Stalingrad scenario I covered that one on my podcast and most of the books that I cover on my podcast or first-person accounts of guys that were there I covered one that was the German guy they're listening to Hitler on the radio talking about the great sacrifice that was made past tense you guys are still alive they're getting said hey these guys held the line they did their best they fought on we're gonna win because of their sacrifices there's no life they're trapped they're starving they're freezing they're getting killed but that's what Hitler did just wrote him off and said no surrender that's it horrible horrible situation but the difference is that World War one was hey we're gonna be in these trenches no decentralized command and then that's the big thing that the Nazis changed was we're going super decentralized command at the beginning of war and that's why they were so effective with blitzkrieg here's the goal the goal is take Poland take the Reimann that's the goal make it happen and these guys were cut loose to go and do that and they did it and they did it quickly and they did it well and then like I said by the end of World War two all the decisions had been centralized back through arrogance because guess what when you win every victory increases your confidence and your arrogance right and it doesn't take long to tip in the wrong direction where you think ah I can take Russia hey no problem we've got plenty of time winter won't come oh no my friend winter is coming winter is coming and that's the big difference is there now you get to

[02:20:29] Korea like I said career was definitely right one last World War two question which is again just sort of a philosophical or theoretical thought experiment if the Japanese had not attacked Pearl Harbor in fact if the Japanese had said we're never gonna wake the sleeping giant over there we're gonna just keep mucking around over here on our side of the Pacific Rim how does world war 2 end would have been rough would the

[02:20:49] Americans have got involved eventually I think they would have I think so yeah would it have been too little too late could have been but I'll tell you what when you flip the switch on the American machine the production I'm talking about the industry like okay the warfighters for sure incredible I mean I remember speaking of the internet when the internet first kind of started I was on some martial arts I don't even know what they're called back then but it was like a chat page or a forum and I was in digit 2 and so this is like yeah this isn't a midnight yeah this is like 90 93 94 95 maybe it's when I got Internet I know exactly this moment and anyways somebody was talking about the Japanese martial arts and the Japanese warriors and all that and the incredible fortitude of the Bushido mindset that the Japanese Empire had and you know it was like the first snide Twitter comment

[02:21:44] I ever made but you know I said the Japanese Bushido warrior spirit was defeated and destroyed by the United States Marine Corps in the Pacific campaign and that's the way it is so the soldier the marine the airmen the sailor from America oh man that is a you know there's another great quote I wish I had this quote on the top of my head it was something along the lines of when the

[02:22:10] Germans attack they yell when the British attack they scream when the French attack they sing when the Americans attack they're silent and they just keep coming they will not stop and that is like just such an awesome in my mind as a kid hearing that I was like wow that's powerful right there's no singing what we're gonna do is we're gonna do our job we can do it quietly or to crush so on top of this American fighting from a humanistic point from this culture this warrior culture this we have in America then you want to talk about what we've lost a little bit we still have it but there's no doubt there is an American call of fighting which is deep right it's deep it's part of American culture like where war fighters where revolutionary and you think it's because we are close enough to our independence relative to some of the other countries I certainly hope so because you're right I always say that hey when people get a taste of freedom that's like the ultimate peacemaker right you want a country to be free or to stop being hostile give them a taste of freedom give them a taste of freedom and people start seeing that a vast majority of people will say wow I like this lifestyle you know what people don't want freedom the people that don't want freedom are the people that fear that their status will come undone because they'll be judged on their performance this is really right so if you take a country where there's no freedom and freedom starts to manifest itself the people that will be scared of the freedom are the people that think if there's freedom I'm gonna be tested against everyone else and I'm gonna fail so I'm just gonna keep everyone under the heel now do you buy the argument that certain parts of the world let's just take each IFFT as an example benevolent dictatorship is a better model than freedom or do you say that freedom can be included within benevolent dictatorship in other words you know I don't want to expose myself as the complete ignoramus that I am when it comes to the politics of the world but could you make the argument that under a Mubarak style of leadership where basically the fundamentalists were shut out right I think where you're going with this is to find out my opinion I think that those types of situations can be good to usher in true freedom over time that's what I think because what you have there exactly that situation you've got the Muslim

[02:24:33] Brotherhood that is scared of freedom because they're gonna end up in a situation that they don't have any control over that they're gonna have to compete with other people that they're gonna they're gonna be judged on their merit rather than just being judged on their force right and so they want to stop that so then you have the government come in and say okay you know what we're gonna instill we're gonna impose freedom we're gonna impose discipline right we're gonna pose discipline on the situation get rid of people that feel that way and then hopefully that creates a culture where we can eventually evolve to a truly free society I mean the biggest challenge with this it actually was something that my daughter and I talked two nights ago just by a complete random coincidence but we were it was our turn cleaning up the kitchen and I don't know how it came up but somehow she asked me she said who is your favorite president and I said probably Lincoln and I gave all my reasons and I said but you could ask 10 people and I think half of them would probably say either Teddy

[02:25:26] Roosevelt or FDR and kind of walked her through sort of high-level history and she said well what about recent presidents and I said you know it's really tough Olivia to evaluate a president whose presidency has taken place in the last 40 years and I don't know if my argument to her made sense but she seemed to get it which was like look by definition any decision a president makes is brutal any book you read on presidents it's like no easy decisions come to them so by definition they're only dealing with the world's worst decisions and maybe part of me getting a little older is realizing the humility of that which is it's a very long arc of history to be able to truly judge what another person did and I think if anything I've got more empathy for things that at the time I felt very strongly about like I remember very strongly in Oh for seeing Bush talk about what was clearly looking like a botched war in Iraq I just wanted him to apologize I just wanted him to say I screwed this up here's a plan to fix it and he didn't he kept doubling down on no this is right this is right this is right and I remember just being completely turned off right and of course now I look back and I said look if we're gonna be brutally honest Olivia

[02:26:41] I don't think we have enough time to know if any of these things made sense you could argue well I think it's been enough time since Vietnam to say that maybe that wasn't the right thing but even there once you really start to understand what happened in Vietnam and now that it's become quite clear how long meaning how many generations of presidents had seen what was happening there it's not just about blaming one president either you can't just say well look this was Johnson's war or this was even Kennedy's or no no this goes back this goes back to probably Truman right so this idea that you can't look through the retrospective scope with a short lens is a scary idea on some ways when you consider how reactionary we can become right another point to that is you're making decisions with what you know at the time right of course this happens a lot with combat where people want a armchair quarterback in hindsight right it's not even just armchair quarterbacking which is hey I'm sitting out here and I could tell what you could do but we're armchair quarterbacking in hindsight with all the perfect knowledge that we have you don't have that situation you're making decisions based on what you know at that time and you're making the best decision you can and it's almost impossible to actually get in that person's frame of mind when they're making those decisions so not only is it take time to pass to see if that was the right decision or not from a presidential standpoint but you got to look and say what did they actually know at that time and okay you can say I would have done something different really really you would have done something different and here's another thing that can happen you can make a great decision and things can go horribly wrong and you can make a bad decision and things can be fine that was a flipside of the discussion with her which is on one level presidents have to make these really hard decisions and they only have so much control of it on the other level it's like you almost wonder how much they matter sometimes when especially when you talk about things like the economy every president wants to take credit for a good economy there's like a hundred other forces there right that are playing a role you know how much credit does Clinton deserve for the booming economy in the late nineties I don't know I've read arguments that say none I've read arguments that have said all of it probably neither of those extremes yeah there's all kinds of factors playing into all those situations but the economy's obvious it's one of my favorite examples of things like the president's touting what the stock market is doing like they've got their hand on that scale yeah especially if they knew what was gonna happen which it's gonna go down they might want to keep their mouths a little bit a little bit to themselves when they start bragging about how good the economy's doing cuz it's never gonna keep going in that direction for too long so now world war ii to korea is a very short period of time what was the big strategic tactical or technological change even though it was a bit of a reversion to this horrible sort of trench warfare it was there wasn't that much time between these two wars actually and a lot of they called up veterans from World War two and said okay reload we're going again and one really interesting story is you know dick winners who is the guy that's the commander of the second of the 506 in the Band of Brothers series you've seen that right I have but I don't recall his name okay so he's just an incredible leader I've covered books about him and his book on my podcasts and I talked about banner puzzle time because banner brothers is really incredible leadership story and dick winners got recalled go to Korea and they got to San Francisco and they said hey I don't know what the criteria was but it was something like if you've done two years world war two step over here and they went over there and they said does anyone not want to go because you don't have to go and dick was just like I'm not going so this is what I was thinking about when you were asking yeah yeah yeah like there's an example of a guy whose commitment and whose leadership is impeccable impeccable and he'd come home and I mean he saw infinitely more infinitely I can't make that word big enough more combat than I ever even came close to saying he came home started a farm in

[02:30:41] Pennsylvania or whatever and started doing his thing carrying on with his life and got recalled and they said hey if you don't want to go you don't have to he said yeah I'm going home then he did and went home so that's the way some people and no one no one's gonna say anything to dick winners ever he died but no one would ever question his patriotism his willingness to sacrifice his leadership has come in but no one would ever question it in any single way and when they said hey do you want to go he said nope not going cool I'll go home don't need you so what was Korea like definitely a lot of similar things from

[02:31:11] World War two and then it kind of stagnated into World War one and now Vietnam is 20 no not even 20 years later it's basically 10 to 15 years later yeah and is that the introduction for Americans to guerrilla warfare it definitely is the introduction on the large scale to guerrilla warfare and that's what made it so challenging we're fighting against asymmetrical situation where we're bigger stronger more well-equipped technologically more advanced against a foe that is inferior in all those ways technology industry capability and we came up against someone that knew how to fight against us and figured it out just like they'd figured out against the French Viet

[02:31:54] Nam's never been taken that's a proud history been around for thousands of years and you've never been taken why is that because you know how to fight in retrospect aside from not going into Vietnam at all knowing everything we know today and perhaps what we've learned through the next huge asymmetric war which was the one you were a part of what is the lesson you take back to that war if Jacko's in a time capsule and he goes back to 1964 yeah these are the common lessons that everyone talks about the big thing in a counterinsurgency is you have to win over the populace and we didn't do that we didn't do that in

[02:32:26] Vietnam you know who did that the Vietcong did that the Communists did that they won over the populace and that's because they are the ones who protect you who allow you to be camouflaged who you mingle like aside from winning hearts in the rebuilding right which clearly that makes sense it seems like that's also important in combat yeah at a minimum they're gonna passively support the insurgents which is basically what happened in Vietnam there's passive support like the villager doesn't care the villager just wants to grow rice the villagers wants to raise their kids or whatever that's the villager wants to do well the

[02:32:58] Americans are just drop the bomb the Americans shot one of my kids the Americans did this and the Vietcong are coming in saying hey why they do this to you will protect you we'll help you and plant these booby traps for us so those are mistakes we made one of my favorite well actually my favorite book is called a belt face by colonel david hackworth and he was trying to fight that guerilla type war trying to win the hearts and minds that's what he was trying to do and he did it and they did very well with it but that strategy did not spread and what you had was the whiz kids this is another great dichotomy the whiz kids saying hey this is how we're going to beat them these the metrics we use to decide if we're winning or not and everyone knows now that the metrics that they decided to use was the body count and so if we're killing more of the enemy then they're killing of us then we'll beat him in a war of attrition and what was that kill count it was the I drank Valley is kind of where we started to realize wait a second we can kill way more of them than they can kill of us and I think the I drank valley that kill count was like a hundred and seventy three to one so for every one American that was dead we killed we suspected that we killed 173 or something like that some crazy kill count and so as Americans we think to ourselves okay well who's gonna put up with that kind of situation no one no one's gonna put up with that well we didn't realize you know he's gonna put up with that the Vietcong are gonna put up with that and you know he's not gonna put up with losing one America there it is there's the answer we fought the war with the wrong strategy and you stick to your guns and those always kids and my point is because I do this with businesses the leadership consulting company and sometimes what we deal with is we deal with companies that are looking at metrics and they're looking at metrics really hard and they bring in a consulting company what's that consulting company can do and they get there they're gonna look at the metrics and they're gonna start saying okay here's what you need to do to win you need to drive these metrics over here and that's cool you've got a look at metrics but you got to balance out what's going on the human side the human factor the leadership what's unfolding inside the company what's the culture inside the company because if you don't have the right culture inside the company the metrics aren't gonna matter and so you have to find that balance between the two sure you got to check the metrics you got to make sure that you're not sacrificing more people than they are but at the same time you can't drive your strategy based on pure metrics and if you do that you can absolutely have problems absolutely so is McNamara still alive or has he passed away dead I believe Westmoreland's definitely dead because I remember when he died I'm trying to remember wasn't

[02:35:31] McNamara the one that they did the documentary on the fog of war possibly I feel like there was a pretty good documentary done either I didn't see it or I saw it so long ago I don't remember did he ever come to grips with the mistakes of Vietnam I don't know not a whole lot of ownership across the board though I can tell you that much so then we fast-forward to first Gulf War mm-hmm right which is in many ways like the greatest technological leap forward right yes in terms of like Warcraft yeah yeah cuz we're talking smart bombs yeah yes stealth right yeah night-vision oh my god I never even thought of that you didn't even have night vision Vietnam they have like starlight but it wasn't anything even close not even remotely close to what we have now so in some ways you could argue quote-unquote the problem with the first Gulf War is maybe a false sense of confidence that this new style of warfare this shock and awe this complete like there's probably no greater Delta in the technologic advantage between two entities than that war right that's a good one yeah and then that becomes the setup of the hubris a decade later right yeah I guess but let's say in the second war in

[02:36:38] Iraq we just said you know what we're gonna do we're gonna get Saddam out of power no relief if we did that we're done really quick yeah it was over pretty quick and then if we were sent a quick oh we're done figured out that would have been we would have been similar it would have been a similar situation over very quickly I mean the first one was over in 72 hours I think of ground fighting the second one few months it's interesting as a civilian I had a hard time in my mind when the news was coming on to understand the difference between the different fronts to understand that there was something going on in Afghanistan and there's something going on in Iraq and these were under very different control right mm-hmm how interchangeable were the macro units between those two in other words were there teams of seals also in

[02:37:24] Afghanistan but the groups that were in Afghanistan we're always gonna stay in Afghanistan when they were deployed or were you going back and forth potentially all services were going back and forth yeah so Marines were going both arm you're gonna both the special operations were going to both yeah for sure you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at
