[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:10] hey steve it's awesome to see you today although i was really hoping we were going to be able to figure out a way to do this in person if we waited long enough but at some point i just thought we just need to sit down and do this and video's almost as good so anyway thanks so much for making time so excited to be here really looking forward to it um i i feel like i haven't seen you in person and has it been like it's been too long it's probably been four years i think it was we drove around in that really noisy car of yours was the last time that i was with you a little tiny thing that made so much noise you know i sure do didn't go very fast but it made a lot of noise for going slow so um you know i think a lot of listeners probably are familiar with you of course they're familiar with you through obviously your books podcast things like that but um maybe it's worth actually telling people a little bit about how you got interested in the study of economics and um obviously it's through that study that that your work became available to a much broader swath of the population than just sort of economists so um what got you interested in studying economics so i was never interested in economics i'm probably still not interested in economics but the way i became an economist was really through the back door i was the worst kind of student in college i mean i got good grades i got into harvard i got good grades at harvard but um but i didn't care about learning at all all i really cared about was gaming the system and i had learned that uh the best way to pick classes was to find the classes that everybody took because it turned out those were both really good classes in general and really easy and it just happened that at harvard act 10 the introductory economics course was exactly one of those courses so i took it not because i was interested in economics but just because my rule of thumb was to take classes like that and i remember roughly i don't know the fifth or the sixth lecture was on this topic called comparative advantage and as the teacher walked us through it i was just disgusted and i thought my god this is the easiest topic in the entire world i have literally known about the concept of comparative advantage since it was five years old i mean i understood it deeply in my soul i didn't know the name like he was putting a name on it and i remember at the time going through and actually thinking this is such a travesty my parents are paying this much per lecture at harvard it was a big number for this total drivel like this is just an insult and as i was walking out of the room my my best friend at college uh was in the same class and he walked out next to me and he said oh my god that that lecture was crazy i said i know how could they teach us such drivel he said no that was the most confusing thing i've ever heard i don't think i couldn't understand that in a million years and i had this moment of clarity where i said wait a second i actually think like an economist and though even though i've never been interested in the topic from that moment on it became clear and clear to me that i was just born thinking like an economist and it's not advice i'd give to other people in general i don't think it's great advice to just do what you're good at but i was so lazy and so intellectually unmotivated that for me it turned out not to be a bad path was just to say who cares what i'm interested in because i wasn't really that interested in anything uh let's just go be an economist and um and and i didn't go willingly i didn't i it took a long time for me to be an academic economist i i graduated i did management consulting it was only my deep disgust and hatred with management consulting which in desperation as i look for any exit i thought well the only thing i can even think of to get out of here is to go get a phd in economics which is what led me to get a phd in economics and if i had known what it meant to get a phd in economics i never would have done it it was only complete ignorance of what i was getting myself into that that led me down that path which turned out to be a lucky path i mean things couldn't almost not have turned out better for me but it was only a series of mistakes miscalculations and ignorance that that led me to this lucky place but but steve there's a lot of um i mean there's a lot of there's got to be some challenge and pain and resilience that requires doing everything you just described so okay maybe econ 101 or whatever the course was was a breeze but at some point you know you're taking senior courses at harvard and economics were they challenging did you find them interesting i mean what was kind of going through your mind as you're plotting your way through undergrad you know i i didn't ever intend to be an academic economist so i didn't approach it the way a normal like someone who who who wants to be an academic economist approached it taken a bunch of math so it turns out at the highest level economics is all about math and i didn't take i didn't take any math i took exactly one math class at harvard it was called math 1a it was because i got a 2 on the calculus ap exam and i couldn't place out and so it was really high school calculus it was the lowest math class i offered at harvard and um and i did do quite well in that class it was essentially me and the the football team and the hockey team were the only people who placed into that and i smoked those guys but um so i just did i just had fun and honestly in college i just had fun and i liked the economics classes and they were and they were easy for me because the intuition economic intuition has always come pretty easily especially on microeconomics uh pretty easily and um and the classes just weren't that hard they didn't require much math i didn't know any math and it was i mean college in general for me was just so much fun uh i i had good friends and good times and it was easy and i had independence and i just you know for me those were the best four years of my life and i didn't take school too seriously but i did well so you know it was all that was just a breeze it was the shock of reality the real world i had no idea how unfun the real world was gonna be when i actually got into it uh but college was fun but it's so funny to hear you say that i i i will forever maintain that college was the worst four years of my life and i hope i can say that now meaning that there will be no four-year period that is still in front of me that's going to be as bad as those four years work but i i always enjoy hearing people talk about college being the best four years of their lives um you mentioned microeconomics um is maybe now's as good a time as any to explain to people the difference between micro and macro economics because it is almost a disservice to talk about economics as though it's one broad topic yeah you're absolutely right in that so microeconomics well let's start with macroeconomics that's what most people think of when they think of economics they think about inflation and uh and unemployment unemployment and economic growth okay and and those are really important fundamental problems um but they are they turn out to be incredibly hard problems because the degree of complexity in the macroeconomic you can the macro economy is almost infinite right so it's it's this complex system built up of billions of individual actors and you've got companies look it's just a mess okay and it it turns out just making a long short very story a long story very short that um that we haven't made much headway and really understanding it because we've we've approached the profession with a kind of discipline which says every model of macroeconomics needs to start with foundations that are really um rational in in the in the base micro foundations and it turns out i think the problem is just too hard and that approach in the end isn't going to win okay but what is microeconomics microeconomics is instead the study of individual decision making so in a world in which there's scarcity and there's competition how do i decide how to spend my income how do i decide what job to do and and how many hours of of work i want to do how do firms decide what to make and where to locate and things like that so these are much smaller decisions and for me much more intuitive decisions um and and they're able to be analyzed both with the the formal models of economics which historically have been uh very heavily predicated on rationality simply because it makes the math easy along with the last 40 years of behavioral economics where we've introduced a lot more psychology and mistakes and a lot more freedom into the models that we use but anyway so um really they're almost distinct micro and macro economics because really macro in the end is is a really complicated not to make all my macro cogs incredibly angry at me but very self-french referential models because the problems are so hard that you need to abstract so greatly to try to deal with the macro problems that i think we don't have a good handle on them so i've really steered clear of the macro problems to focus on the individual decision making which is i think both in my own life much more relevant but also i got something to say because i have some intuition for it so is there a hierarchy within economics the way you know so in physics you sort of have sort of the theoretical physicists and the experimental physicists and nobel prizes will go back and forth between the two of those um how does that work in economics do do a disproportionate amount of nobel prizes or whatever the highest i mean i guess the nobel it's not technically a prize but it's close enough when you look at the highest levels of excellence and awards that are given in the entire field do they disproportionately lie on one side of those or the other so historically economics has been a an entirely theoretical discipline and so the highest status positions historically have been in theory okay uh where i make the distinction between theory and the analysis of data and econometrics and actually trying to you know take messy data and and make sense of it with the data revolution and the emergence of econometrics it's been uh i think a switch in the profession so there are two big prizes in economics there's a nobel prize and then there's something called the job based clark medal which is given to the the most influential economist under the age of four years you've won that prize correct i did win that yeah and um and so that more reflects what's going on in the present time and so those prizes the the clark medal has um mostly gone in the last 20 or 30 years not always but often to people at the intersection of theory and data which i think really is is where the action is um in economics it's people who can make sense of data but are looking at it through a lens of economics and pushing economic thinking in that way i think i don't know if anyone cares about this but economics is really at a crossroads because it turned out when data analysis really started to emerge and we could start to say things about causality in ways we couldn't before the empirical part of economics really took off but all of the easy stuff has been done and so we've kind of estimated most of the parameters that we care about and so the question is what comes next and what's happening in economics is that the push has been in the direction of okay it's not enough to just estimate what's happened in the world in the past that's really what what empirical economics is really good is saying i can look at what's happened in the past i can estimate a number and then i can build models to try and say why now the task is become greater which say i not i don't just want to understand the past i want to be able to build a model that has the flexibility to tell me what would have happened if instead of the us being a democracy we were a dictatorship okay so things that are so far out of the realm of what actually happened that it's almost like science fiction and so what economists do now is they're asked not just to estimate parameters really well but to embed those parameters into models which then have enough degrees of freedom that you can start to imagine if i turn this dial to that tile what would happen and i actually personally think that's a terrible direction because i think i think what has made economics great is that it's easy to understand the estimates we create and you can say whether you like them or not based on fact or the approach or whatever but i think when we get into these more fanciful models i i think we're going to end up running into a huge dead end is that is that they're really too complicated to be estimated well and so we're just going to get into fantasyland of of creating things that are really not um grounded in fact so there's a famous physicist and it's been attributed to so many that i actually don't know who really said it but uh the the spirit of the quote is all models are wrong some are useful um and i feel like economics is certainly a discipline in which that applies and suffers greatly i mean look even thing even something that i think was much simpler to try to understand was you know the extent to which coronavirus was going to be a problem i mean those initial models were out to lunch um and it's i don't fault the people who tried to put those models together the epidemiologists who worked on these models but you know the sensitivity around so many variables was so great that you couldn't even begin to extrapolate and when you did it the only thing i think the models helped you understand was how impossible it would be to predict what was going on and if nothing else it was going to show you what parameters mattered but that was about the extent of what you could extract from that which was you know the rate at which this thing spreads and the length of time that it can lay dormant those things are going to matter a lot and by the way what we should have taken from that is earlier and more aggressive testing was a better solution as opposed to trying to pontificate or estimate whether 60 million americans were going to get it and 5 million were going to die versus 1 million were going to die i mean those that was sort of the wrong thing to be thinking about but again all that's easy in hindsight i but i but i hear you in terms of how um that could be frustrating in in this profession yeah i i mean i have a very strong view about the relationship between data and theory and my view is that the sensible way to do things is to make a really sharp distinction between the two that we should really understand you go to the data and you just understand what the 3 5 9 12 facts are and in my view is that those 12 facts should be things that if any reasonable person looked at the data you'd more or less agree on those facts and to just establish that that is the role of data analysis is to understand those facts and obviously there's you know you want to get it in the direction of causality and whatnot but you never do that with the data alone the data alone are never enough expect accepting a randomized experiment to tell you about causality and um and rarely in economics do we get to do randomized experiments and then i think if you can all agree on the facts then i'm all in favor of models going forward because if i write down a model that is built off of the 12 facts i see it turns out it's really easy the kind of models that economists write down for other economists to say okay i understand whether that's a good model or a bad model what it's sensitive to and what not and um and if you make this bifurcation between understanding the facts and then going into what what those facts imply because we really care not about the facts themselves but we care about the implications of those facts for the future or what they tell us about causality or whatnot i think it's a really powerful model it's not the model that we use in economics and it's definitely not the model we use say in journalism that it's often incredibly hard or in debate right so it's often incredibly hard when a debate is going on to understand are these people disagreeing about the facts or are they disagreeing about the implication of the facts and so like if i had my dream about how we would do journalism every newspaper article would basically have a separate little feature that just said these are the five facts on which i am writing this article and then it would be easy to for me say if it's an erm expert and to say oh those facts don't make any sense or for a fact checker to affect them or in a debate to say hey before we debate i would like each of the participants to lay out the 10 facts that they believe to be true and see if they disagree with each other's facts if they disagree about facts then we're in a very different situation than if we disagree about the implications of those facts and somehow i think that's gotten a lot like that distinction i've never really heard anyone talk about it except for me because i'm probably it's not important but it strikes me as being really really important well let's let's use an example of that where you know i think you and uh dubner have gotten into some you know crosshairs of people is around climate change i mean you wrote about this god has it been 10 years ago now i've lost track yeah was it super free economics or yeah super economics so i think it's been about 10 years okay so let's go back to let's start with some facts what did you actually write because i think that's been very misconstrued over time yeah okay so one thing you can never trust is for people to tell you the truth about the what they've done in the past number one because they're gonna lie but number two they don't even like my i don't really know what i've been i've looked back at that book in a long time either but here's what i think we wrote um so we basically wrote that um at that time there was evidence that the planet was getting warmer but certainly it was it was not completely open and shut and we said but look we're not scientists and what we thought was that the people talking about climate change were asking the wrong question right what people are talking about climate change we're saying is how do we reduce the amount of carbon we put in the air okay which actually wasn't the right question the real right question was the planet is too hot we're not happy about the plant that the planet's getting hotter what is the best way to cool down the planet to me that was really the right question and like the example i give is um you know so i've had a lot of i have a lot of babies i have six kids so some of the kids they poop all the time okay and it's a problem okay so in in because they poo if there's poop on the floor all day long it's a real problem okay so you could say well to solve that problem let's figure out how to keep kids from pooping or how to stuff the poop back in the kit or whatever it's like but the answer is like how do you get the poop so it doesn't go on the ground well it's a diaper okay and it's a very different answer than if you get worried about like well poo shouldn't exist so i think the same with carbon the carbon's coming out and you don't necessarily have to stuff the carbon back in if you can find another way to cool the planet starting from that premise we then talked to real scientists who knew something who are working on what's called geoengineering so these are ways to try to cool the planet okay and look they're not perfect in all sorts of ways but these really smart guys have have come up with a lot of clever plans that we might potentially be able to cool the planet so things like putting sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere turns out super cheaply a couple hundred million dollars a year we could um put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere it it mimics but in a much more efficient way what big volcanic eruptions like mount pinatubo have done and um and that could cool the planet um another like the best idea i think that was out there was it turns out that that certain kinds of clouds that have the right kind of reflectivity in the right level um can actually reflect a bunch of sunlight back and and oceans are really dark so they absorb lots of heat clouds are really light they reflect a lot of heat so uh scientists have come up with a plan never been tested even in 10 years since we did it where a bunch of solar powered dinghies would troll around in the ocean controlled by gps throwing up salt from the water which then seeds the clouds which then leads to a bunch of clouds over the ocean which uh you know his claim their claim from simulations is that that would be enough ten thousand those dinghies would be enough to offset all of of climate change global warming look all these are probably short-term solutions relative to a real solution uh scientific solution or behavioral solution to to try and deal with with um climate change but so that's what we wrote about and um and admittedly in retrospect i regret that we wrote about it in such a lighthearted way i didn't realize that um environmentalists had no sense of humor and so you couldn't like poke fun at mistakes they'd made in the past or and so we really aggravated a lot of people but but what we what we did was we unleashed this um incredible machinery there was a whole machinery around the environmental movement which which basically decided we were enemy number public enemy number one and then set out to destroy us not really worried about what we actually said or whether we were right i mean i think i do think 10 years later almost everyone now thinks that geo engineering is likely to be part of the solution and um it was interesting um one of the magazines i think was the atlantic monthly basically wrote an article about us saying that we were the most evil stupid morons who've ever existed in the history of the planet four years later the same the same magazine wrote essentially our chapter in our book with the exact same examples we had used with no citation at all the fact we had written about it saying how junior engineering was gonna be part of the future so um i think i think it's good not to worry about whether you're right or you credit for it i think you just have to be happy that the movement although way too slow has been in the right direction i think for what's what's inevitable is that the problem of climate change is one which will not i claim ever be solved by behavior change because it's all about what economists call externalities that my own behavior has almost no effect on me and a negative effect on the rest of the world and i would say there's never in the history of mankind been a problem that is fundamentally about externalities which has been solved by telling people you should just do the right thing you know if and hoping that suddenly everyone's just going to start doing the right thing just literally has never happened i don't any reason i think it's gonna start now yeah that's interesting can you think of any examples where humans behave in that way where they do the right thing to help other people yes even if it inconveniences them are there any can we think i mean i i mean there are social norms like on on the roads you know people don't really cut in line very much you know a little bit but i don't think it's because is that also because there's direct feedback and exactly because people yell at you because it's uncomfortable i mean but um you know there's very few things where we were where we have private benefit and look how little things we do around the edges and certainly we do it for family members and whatnot but um but like i i really think honestly if you look at every big problem that's been solved for mankind i i challenge you to find one that wasn't solved by technology and uh and it goes from everything from disease to i mean i i think you know you know much more about this me but if you think about the benefits health benefits that have come from behavior change versus technology invention discovery like i gotta believe you know smoking being maybe the one example where in the face of overwhelming evidence it still took what 40 years for people to cut down on smoking and still a lot of people well and i would argue that it wasn't really due to just a straight it wasn't the knowledge that tobacco killed that actually led to the reduction um in fact if you if you look at the timeline of this it's an interesting case study and behavior change so i think the surgeon general's report on smoking which was the first really unambiguous declaration that smoking killed it had been suspected in the 40s and 50s but it it wasn't until i want to say about 60 ish that you couldn't argue it anymore i mean we're talking hazard ratios of 14x right like there's nothing in biology that produces a hazard ratio of 14x outside of parachuting without parachutes that it's this is going to be this is going to end in a bad way and if there was really no change in tobacco use after that for five six more years the first real dent in tobacco use came with advertising when a law was passed that said you couldn't advertise a tobacco company couldn't advertise tobacco unless it was the commercial was juxtaposed with an anti-tobacco ad and it turned out the anti-tobacco ads were so successful that the tobacco companies voluntarily stopped advertising and that was the first step in the reduction of tobacco and then of course you threw in other things which was laws that said hey you can't have tobacco sitting at the counter it has to be way behind and obviously then you had excise taxes that were imposed and then you had other environmental things you can't smoke on airplanes and so you could even make the case that the reduction in smoking has been less about behavior change and more about a change in the default environment around it which which just speaks more to your point yeah no i think that's true and i think also what's changed in the end is it used to be cool to smoke and now look if you smoke people think you're crazy right it's like so i mean i think that those social norms um again speaking to your point the costs and the benefits of smoking have changed dramatically and if anything it's surprising how little behavior change has followed that as opposed to how much i mean look at i mean again we're in your territory in your mind but look at diabetes and how little behavior change has been in response to to diabetes um it's it's it's surprising in many ways let's go back to this climate change issue because it again it's it's very interesting and it's it's one of those things i think like nutrition where there's a very gray area between true scientific expertise and propaganda [Music] what is it about the use of science as a propaganda i mean frankly i think in fact i'm somewhat what's the word i think i'm somewhat sympathetic to people who are kind of losing faith in the scientific process a little bit i'm talking lay people people who have never studied science but who are sort of sick and tired of hearing scientists stand up on tv and say something and they're a little bit skeptical and so if you're sort of an elitist you look at them and you say well they're morons how can they not believe in science but but the reality is they've kind of been a bit misled haven't they and and i think that this like you look at the the using science as kind of a weapon i guess is is has become a bit problematic right yeah i i honestly i think the um i i'm more favorable towards climate science than i used to be so climate science suffers from the exact same thing that macroeconomics does which is that there's observations but really much of it is based on these models and the models can't possibly have the kind of specificity because it's such a complex system to understand so like most of the leading models at the time we were looking at it had carbon dioxide but nothing about water vapor and and it turns out that many people think water vapor is more important than the interaction between carbon dioxide and water vapor would be more important than anything but the model just like computing power and the complexity was too much um but i i give some credit to look there's a part of climate science which is focused on measurement measuring the temperature of the oceans the rising of the oceans and i think that's kind of been been done well now what you're talking about though is that there's there's such a blurring of the line between the the job of measuring climate change and advocating on tv or in the newspapers for what that means for public policy and and those are very different tasks and you i think as a scientist you want to be very careful about moving from from one role to the other and i think what climate science as an observer a pretty close observer has done a very poor job on is helping people lay people understand when one is an advocacy role versus when one is in a scientific role and and the same people have played both roles and and i think i think really it's um it's it's an unusual branch of science because the people who go into climate science almost always share this view that the climate's really important and we should protect it and and um we should be doing things not to have climate change which is different i think from say physics where like physicists don't have a inherent belief about whether the universe should be expanding or contracting or you know or or whether a particular you know particles should or should not exist it's just like that's a different thing um so okay and the other thing i think which has been completely unrealistic and really problematic for for climate science is that they don't think about economics enough and they don't think about the reality of human behavior and how difficult it will be to have behavior change and they don't think well about the cost of changing our economy so so the the cost of going to a zero car net carbon world are really really big okay and we pay those costs right away and and i'm not saying that we shouldn't necessarily try to do that it might actually be a good idea to do it but to ignore the fact that it's an incredibly expensive solution that's being offered i think has been part of the problem because it hasn't really it's it's it's been a mix of ignoring that and at this or at the same time saying look those costs are good because we're immoral humans are awful humans are ruining the planet and we should suffer for the fact we should have an enormous contraction in the economy like al gore was upset that there were way too many kinds of cereal being sold in the grocery store that's sinful that there are so many choices about cereal but it's like a weird religious thing about we should suffer and again i think it doesn't work well to people who maybe aren't convinced or who don't want to suffer so honestly i think um you know i think if if i were able to do one thing in the world i've tried to do it and i failed at it it would be to have a sensible approach to figuring out whether there is a cheap solution to climate change okay because right now all we're talking about are incredibly expensive ones like complete rethinking of capitalism you know and and um you know and i don't think that the capitalist structure has worked well on trying to solve the problem of okay is if we put or let me put that i think we should take if it were up to me if i were president the first thing i would do is i would have what i call a a um manhattan project for climate change and i would try to convince the 1 000 smartest scientists in the world to stop whatever they're doing and to work on climate change and to like put them in a place like los alamos and to give them resources and because it's a hard problem and it's an interdisciplinary problem and say look for five years let's just work and let's figure out whether or not there's going to be a great way to do carbon sequestration or to do something you know i don't know something out of the box to do it and look either either i think we'll get a solution in five years or we'll figure out oh crap this is never going to work like we have no way out of this other than other than stopping to produce carbon or living in the world look and that's important information to know because if i knew that the only way out of this was we we're going to have to you know live with the carbon we put in there then then the willingness of public policy to impose enormous costs on on carbon producing behavior should go way up but i kind of doubt that's true i have a lot of faith in science i think if we had the best 1 000 scientists within five years we would come up with a reasonably cost effective way to deal with carbon we'd pull it out of the air in some way shape or form and we'd kind of like have the thing solved or we'd know we're never going to i don't disagree with you steve i think where i where i'm a little less optimistic than you and i and i love the idea of a manhattan project for this um i i'd back up one step and reiterate what you said earlier because i think it's so important i phrase it in a somewhat different way but i like how you you discussed it which is we confuse the objective the strategy and the tactics all day long i mean that that to me is like if we were going to list the 10 human failures just as a species it's that we are not wired to differentiate between objectives strategies and tactics and so that's why 10 years ago you were getting lambasted for talking about geoengineering because the only which is a tactic because the only tactic that was being discussed was the reduction of carbon and you were saying well wait a minute if you really want we've lost sight of the objective the objective is to slow warming and warming is a much bigger problem than just how much carbon is in the atmosphere that also deals with insulation so let's let's look at different tactics right okay so so notwithstanding that problem i think my biggest fear steve is there's no question that in five years a well-staffed well-resourced team could come up with what solutions might look like i just don't know that it could ever be implemented from a policy perspective i mean for example i mean i i don't think anybody who's really studied energy seriously disagrees that nuclear energy next gen not i'm not talking about like the nuclear reactors of 70 years ago i don't think there's anybody who doesn't think that next-gen nuclear would play an important role in electricity generation but it's just not a politically palatable solution i don't know where geo engineering falls on that spectrum either for that matter so that would be my fear is you'd come up with solutions but then you'd still be at kind of a gridlock in the implementation of these things yeah so that's uh so that is a good point and that is possible i do think however that one even in that world there is a real insurance value in this investment now so we might not be able to come up with a sensible policy now but if in 20 years all of a sudden the ice shelf on greenland just like begins to slide into the ocean and things are desperate then i believe that we will so my prediction is we will do something like my manhattan project for climate change the question's just when will we do it will we do it as we're staring down you know catastrophe or we will we do it in advance and potentially either avoid catastrophe or at least you know you know get five years earlier i mean not that different the covet right so um for my podcast i i interviewed monster slowly and i know six or seven years ago he proposed well why don't we have in the bank uh a vaccine for like everything we'd ever want but not make very much of it just like have a little bit around so we know how to do it and we have and like look and everyone laughed at them and said how can you how can you suggest that that would cost 500 million dollars we can't waste 500 million dollars and then you come to to a world where the us government is bleeding 6 billion a day in deficits and that would have been like literally the best investment of all time probably if we had done it um so i think that kind of insurance policy i think would be valuable even in a world of gridlock and poor policymaking i i agree completely because the one thing that i i think we haven't stated here but i think we both agree on is this is such an asymmetric risk that it has to be taken seriously and uh and that's probably the thing that bothers me the most about the other argument you know the people on the other side of the argument that say well we don't have enough certainty therefore we shouldn't you know it should be status quo business as usual ignore this and it's true i think the uncertainty the error bars on these projections are bigger than people lead us to believe but it's so asymmetric um you know it's so non-linear if this goes wrong that you have to take that seriously i always there are very few things in economics that shocked me but something that shocked me was um an analysis done a long time ago 10 years ago or more where an economist and i'm embarrassed i can't remember exactly who it was um just just work through the kinds of utility functions so the kind of the the basic models that economists use and said in a world in which bad things happen how much are you willing to pay to avoid bad things and it is it is completely shocking so um i'm making these numbers up but i think they're in the right ballpark so if you have something like a one percent chance of dying like how much will you pay how much would you pay um of your total wealth to avoid a one percent chance of dying today can't turn out the answer isn't one percent it's more like ten or fifteen percent and as it goes up to five percent you're willing to pay like fifty percent of your wealth to avoid it because once you die you're like done so there's it's like otherwise really long flow and it's very counterintuitive it really caught me off guard and it really changed my thinking about the importance of dealing with climate change because i was kind of of the look you know climate change is all in the future we discount the future um you know why worry about it but once i saw that it really changed my perspective on it so i i've come to think that this investment and and the other thing to stress is that the cost of r d is so low compared to the cost of disaster and of implementation that to do the r d is just a no-brainer right so i think for for a billion dollars a year my guess is you could fund the you know you could fund this manhattan project for a billion dollars a year this is like the kind of money that actual philanthropists could do as opposed to even government having to do look if you actually wanted to put whatever solution is is discovered into practice it would probably be enormously expensive but to figure out the answer it's just like trivial and the same the same is true of covet like the you know talking to people who did the vaccines i think at mo dinner it took them like a day or two to come up with the vaccine you know in in all the costs are in the testing in the production but the actual r d part is so cheap compared to everything else that uh to not invest in it just seems like a real mistake first order mistake to me i agree um i'm glad we got off on that tangent because i actually did want to talk about that at some point but it uh it came up uh it came up kind of quick but i want to now go back to um the beginning of the story right so you you graduate from college you go off to work in management consulting which if i remember uh you described as slightly only slightly less uncomfortable than a root canal without novocaine um it's so painful that it in fact exposes you to a phd so you go off to mit so you basically just didn't leave boston you you went from you know harvard to consulting to mit so you really have a penchant for these cold winters and then and then what did you decide to study in your phd because now you actually you got to get serious right you actually have to pick a problem and work on it so i have to say i didn't like consulting but i learned something incredibly important in it and i learned it from the guy who happened to have the cubicle next to a guy named jeff thomas who i'm still friends with and he taught me how to look at the world strategically and it was weird i never did that before it never occurred to me to do it but then i got to grad school and i did have a fundamental understanding while everybody else was really busy working on problem sets and essentially these were all people who got straight a's their whole life and they figured well what worked for me before that's what i got to keep on doing in grad school because that's how i'm going to get ahead and i looked at it and partly it helped that i knew no math and i was completely overmatched and i was like the worst i was i'm not exaggerating when i say that my classmates sat down about a month into it and my friend austin goolsbee who's now gotten you know famous as part of the obama administration later told me that they went through the list of people in the class and tried to decide who was the least likely to succeed and like i was a unanimous choice that i was going to be the worst one and um but look i i had a great approach which is i i um i understood that you had to create research you had to go from being a consumer of knowledge to a producer of knowledge and and uh you know and i also was kind of still uh you know i have to say i didn't really i wasn't internally motivated so what i did was i said well look who's at the top of the hierarchy i might as well try to be that guy and it turned out that that was macroeconomics at mit at the time so for the first semester i tried to be a macroeconomist and it became so clear to me so quickly that i was never going to be a macroeconomist because i always thought that nobody had intuition for macroeconomics until i started talking to some of the people at mit who actually understood oh if the exchange rate between the the euro and the dollar goes up then that's going to trickle through and how second affect you know immigration like oh my god like it made no sense to me so i quit i was smart enough i've always been smart enough to fail quickly so i like realized i couldn't be a macroeconomist the theorists were number two and so i tried to be a theorist and i actually spent a little longer being a theorist actually wrote a couple papers being a theorist um and again it became really clear to me that i didn't have what it took to be a theorist so then i said well kind of the only thing left is doing data analysis and it it turned out i should have been smart enough to know that from the beginning because i was a weird kid i i um the only thing i like to do was sit in my room and essentially study data like as i look back on it i would um this is how weird i was when i was when i was maybe eight i asked for and received a pocket calculator as my my birthday present um and it was overjoyed when i was maybe like nine i graduated to a scientific calculator and my pastime was i was into baseball is i would go through and i would by manually typing into a scientific calculator i type in a column of of like wins for a team and then one by one i would type in each of the statistics like the the team batting average or the team you know number of triples and compute the partial correlation between those two and and and what my dad when my dad came home from work he would ask me what the correlations were between the variables i computed like that was how i spent my time so uh it should have been obvious to me that's what i want to do and the other thing i did was when i was um in is i um i would use data to try and answer real problems like when i was in college i i became obsessed with the racetrack and i would try to you know use data to win at the racetrack which wasn't very successful but like i should have been obvious to me that i that i should have gravitated to to um to doing empirical research but but i didn't because i was still caught up in this idea of well of a status so finally i just said look i'll do what i'm good at but um but honestly i was so far behind the people around me it was an interesting experience it's kind of a satellite but it's interesting i'd been used to being really good at most of the things i did and academically and and i it happens for almost everyone where you some you get to a point where you look around and you realize you were the dumbest person in the room and how you deal with that is really important and strangely and i don't know why that was roughly the greatest feeling i've ever had in my life when i looked around and i was the dumbest person in the room it was this sense of joy it was really interesting somehow i think maybe i had felt pressure my whole life once i was the dumbest person in the room i felt like wow i can do whatever i want like i don't you know i can it's just it was such a joy to be around such talented people and it freed me up to be myself and instead of always trying to follow the crowd i started doing what i liked and what i and i thought well what do i like and i said well i don't know i like watching the tv show cops i love to show cops i watch it every day like well why don't i do research on it so i somehow like found myself and i began just studying the things i liked and um and much to my amazement even though no other economists were really studying those questions i really thought it was a it was a one-way ticket to to like getting a phd and then doing something outside of academics because you know why would it be the case that if these were topics no one else researched they'd be interested in um but i didn't you know i knew i couldn't compete on a level footing with these amazing people around me so i had to compete on like in my own space and am i shocked people liked it you know and they were excited about it got published in good journals and um and i'm i honestly i look back and i say i'm so lucky to have been so far below the bar that i didn't try to i didn't try to do what i think most people do and what i had a tendency to do which was to try to be like figure out what i should be because that's what other people are and i just was myself and it was such a great lesson and i've really practiced being myself ever since looking sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't but i but the great thing about life is when things don't work you can take a different path and so um it's just um you know so i just try to be myself and and i stop doing stuff when being myself isn't a good recipe for it so when you got to chicago um i mean that must have been another difficult decision because chicago is a powerhouse in economics right you could have taken your sort of offbeat approach to economics and gone someplace that is where you're not going to be surrounded by a bunch of nobel laureates so why did you i mean were you so secure in your kind of off the beaten path approach that you said hey i might as well go to another cold winter city and be around smart people but i but not have to compete with them i mean that what was that what was the decision like there you know so i had a lot of choices and i loved cambridge and i had been at harvard and mit and and i really what had happened is i'd given a couple of of presentations at chicago and i had been shocked at how different the questions i got were and i i really went to chicago because i wanted to get to know the enemy at that time uh so so gary becker was one of the most influential economists of the of of the last 50 years and he since passed away but was a real mentor to me he was demonized i mean when i first met him i expected him to be a monster and it turned out well he wasn't he was super smart and he asked great questions and and so i i very self-consciously said i'm going to go to chicago and i'm going to get to know the enemy from the inside for a couple years before i go back to harvard and um what i hadn't anticipated is that the thinking that goes on in chicago it looks like it's really simple it looks like one could learn it i thought look i'm good at economics i can learn this but i i tell you even 25 years later i'm still not very good at the kind of deep thinking that is done in chicago economics and um and i love it and i think it's powerful but i'm still more of a spectator than an actual duo of it and i really got i really got co-opted into the the spirit of chicago but in in some sense i will i will say that i've never i've always been probably unreasonably overly confident in in my own ability and and i was very um i was at ease like i was going to do what i was going to do and i thought i could do a better chicago than anywhere else but it was but i will say it was it was unusual so at that time i think it must have been seven or ten years since someone who had a lot of options had chosen to go to chicago economics over another place including the chicago business school which was really getting most of the town and and one of my advisors so i told one of my advisors at harvard i was going to go to chicago and he said if you do that i will never speak to you again and i said why and he said because if you do that it shows that you are so effing stupid that you're not worth me wasting my breath and um it was interesting that was how weird it was to do that decision um but i did it and he was happy to talk with me you know never stop talking to me and i think he would agree i probably did the right thing but um but but you know it's funny now because it used to be there were these enormous differences between departments now i think they're all kind of the same chicago harvard mit stanford princeton i mean there are yeah there are like all these great departments we've all like blurred the lines together not so different but i you know but but at the time there really was a distinctive personality that for me was really you know really special i'm so glad i did it and i think it's i've been a huge beneficiary of it do you think the field is better that the elite 10 programs have become more homogeneous or do you think it produced it did more for the field when you had these very distinctive schools of thinking and stanford had its way of doing it and chicago had its way and harvard had its way it's a great question such a hard such a hard question i remember uh i remember maybe five or ten years into my coming to chicago milton friedman came back and he was um bemoaning the fact not just that chicago was becoming more like other places but really that what was distinctive about chicago what's called chicago price theory um was basically dying out and how awful that was and one of my colleagues super smart colleagues casey mulligan said milton i thought you believed in market uh it sounds to me like you're like pricier is losing and i thought wow that is exactly right um and even milton friedman in the end didn't really believe in markets when markets moved against him um i don't know i i do think like it sort of used to be that way in medicine right there was a very clear line between east coast medicine and west coast medicine and there was there was a very different way cardiac surgery was done in minnesota versus stanford versus boston i mean those were so different and they produced remarkable innovations in a sense and i i just you know so it yeah no i think you're right like letting i i think these diversity of approaches are useful because number one there's data right it's like let's say let's especially take more something like cardiac surgery where you get real data look you know whether people are living or dying and so you actually can figure out whether one is better than the other so in that world for sure i think this diversity of use is really really important now you might say look it doesn't have to be across departments it can be within department right you have one brilliant surgeon innovating in this way that way but i do think in general that it's this this diversity of views is good and it's especially good in a dynamic world right because it in a world that's static it's kind of like doesn't matter as much but but when something radical happens then often one model is much better situated than the other to deal with whatever this radical occurrence happens some new disease or some i don't know maybe maybe radical things tend not to happen so much in medicine but you know sometimes radical things happen in the economy and um so i i think it's it's impor again i don't know how interested your listeners are in macroeconomics but i think macroeconomics is a case where chicago-style macro more or less won and so all of the world of macro now looks a lot like what was going on in chicago 40 years ago and i think that's been a problem because i think there isn't this diversity of thinking that puts you maybe in a better situation as different kinds of macroeconomic problems arise to have a range of possible approaches and solutions to it so yeah i think um so here's that i think it probably would be better if there were greater differences between the departments but the but it's one of these things where like the facts of life are that it's impossible to maintain that equilibrium because there are all sorts of private forces that are pushing pushing for this homogeneity that you just can't so like it's just like there's no easy way to fight it in some sense and so even though you wish it would happen it's hard to see how to make it happen so let's let's go on to talk a little bit about uh a colleague of yours outside of the world of economics uh steve dubner how did you guys meet so um dubner approached me to write an article about me for the new york times this is um after i'd won the clark medal but well before economics and um and i really was incredibly hesitant to to accept the the invitation because i just didn't i didn't really like to be written about there was no i didn't think to sell so i didn't really i wasn't in the business of trying to market myself and um and in the end i have this my mom though really likes it when i'm in the newspaper and on tv and stuff and so i really remember thinking oh god i'll take this hit for my mom because it'll make my mom so happy if there's a piece about me in the new york times magazine and um and then dominic came out and it was unlike any experience i had ever had with a journalist i honestly think he had read every academic paper i'd ever read i mean i'm talking about like 50 papers and he came out and he ended up interviewing me for i don't think i'm exaggerating if i say maybe 25 hours over three days and there was never a silence so i would he would ask me a question i would answer it and as soon as i answered it he would ask me another question and this went on for 25 hours and it was unbelievably painful to me because it's like it was the last thing i wanted to do and i thought he was gonna say for three hours not 25 and and one of the notable things about it is that i literally did not ask him a question for the first 24 and a half hours and i only thought of him as like this this parasite that was like sucking the life out of me and after 24 and a half hours i actually had the thought to say well like who have you written about before and he started telling me these fantastic stories he was the only guy who had been able to interview the unabomber and he had been in a rock band like and he was really interesting and i and i learned something there which is like especially when you're tired of being asked questions ask the questions yourself it's almost always more interesting to ask the questions than to answer them but still we parted and i would have said i would never see that guy again i mean we were not friendly in any way there was no like meeting of the minds or anything but he did write a piece about me in the new york times that people loved and he gets so pissed at me because i always say like he created this this personality about me as this incredible wonder boy genius who you give me a problem i type away at my computer i solve it an hour later and and people love that persona even though it was completely and totally off i mean it wasn't right at all but um but look i've been riding that for the last 15 years so i can't complain like i've milked it for everything i could um and people loved it and then we ended up you know not you know not through an easy bible we ended up deciding to write freakonomics together not because we had some passion to tell our story but just because we both wanted to make some bucks and um and the publishers were willing to pay us to write this book and um and in the end um uh we had an amazing agent susan gluck who i interviewed for my podcast people i mostly admire and like you know we relive that story but she just like totally out uh negotiated the the publishers and there we were with a super lucrative book deal and no idea at all what we were going to write about we like had no conception of what this book was going to be and i think part of the fun of it was that we both assumed that we had just pulled off like a bank heist and that like no one was ever going to read this book and so we could do whatever we wanted because um it wasn't like my colleagues cared what i wrote about this book that i wanted to read and he was like a serious you know memoirist and his you know people would understand he was just doing this to make some cash and they wouldn't hold it against him and it freed us up i think to write a book that was very different than what we would have written if we actually had the fear that people were going to read it and judge us based on on on what we wrote so we had a lot more fun with them we would have otherwise and we kind of broke a bunch of rules and we were super lucky i think to be in the right place at the right time to have a book that that ended up selling a whole bunch of copies did it come out in 05 or 006 oh i don't know i mean i don't know i mean no idea i'm so good at dates usually i can almost i think probably i mean i i remember reading it as soon as it came out um i still remember where i first learned about it i remember it's it's so odd that i would remember this but i was in the or waiting for a patient to wake up you know waiting to come out of anesthesia so you know we finished operating and it was you know i was just sort of writing the orders to get ready to take the patient to the recovery room and um the chief resident um said i just read this book freakonomics you gotta read it it is unbelievable it's totally incredible and he just started raving about it and um so i just went and picked it up and i couldn't put it down i mean it was just and it was very unusual for me to read anything outside of medicine you know it was very hard for me to make time to do anything that wasn't immediately related to sort of what i needed to to do for work um what so so i'm trying to think which my favorite one was in there um which one did you guys get the most blow back on was it the seat belt one the car seat one did that did that create the most blowback you know we literally had like three lines on on car seats uh we had one one paragraph on car seats and that probably did create about as much negative feedback as anything strangely we really thought abortion was going to be the lightning rod and everyone was going to get upset about it but um abortion and crime but but it turned out that when we act well the back story is that when when i couldn't control the story like when the media reported on my academic results about abortion and crime which by the way that was i think that was in the late 90s wasn't it or early 2000s but the actual 2000 2001 yeah and that in that okay and and and we had no control over the way it was portrayed it was deeply misportrayed it was simplified and it was a it was a nightmare it just it it triggered hostility from all corners of the of the right and the left and and um it just kind of made us look stupid because it was easy to parody it because if you didn't understand how simple and obvious the things we were talking about and how powerful they were in the data it kind of looked like we were crazy people and in part because look nobody talks publicly about abortion unless they have a a stake in it right so all of the conversation about abortion is either stridently pro-life or strongly poor choice but like we didn't have a stake we were just doing something really different which is we said something simple which is abortion was legalized in the us and it turns out that there's this really strong relationship between unwantedness so if a kid is unwanted by his or her parents that they tend to have a hard life and after abortion was legalized there appears to have been a dramatic decline in the number of unwanted children that were born and so just like in a simple empirical like statement in fact fewer unwanted children with legalized abortions should lead to less crime 18 years later you know it's like gotta be true um it's not hard to see why that's true it's just a matter is it a big number a small number and um and back in the umbilical calculations soda said it could be a really big number based on other studies of unwantedness and when you looked at the data um not perfect we obviously didn't want to randomize experiment uh we didn't get to choose who didn't didn't get abortions um we looked at you know things like you know after roe vs wade happened you look exact at some stage it was easy to get abortion some state two was hard and then you look 20 years later and you see that well for the first 15 years the crime pattern is really similar between those states and they only started to diverge once the kids who were exposedly guys abortion were old enough to have you know start committing crimes so like you know it was a really simple straightforward paper that almost anyone could look at the data and make some sense of whether what we're doing was reasonable and sensible and so when we actually got to tell our story in free economics nobody complained and what was really interesting just not just from a data perspective but from a storytelling perspective is it was one of the great successes of storytelling in that people who were pro-choice read that chapter and would pat me on the back and say how amazing like what a great chapter that was and how it pushed the pro-choice agenda and people who were pro-life would slap me on the back and say you know i'm glad someone finally told the truth about pro-life and it was interesting the exact same chapter was read totally different and everybody liked it it was a i gotta say of all the things i've ever done that that was one of the weirdest and most unexpected things that ever happened is that we wrote something that everybody liked when we expected everybody to um to hate it so i honestly we didn't get so freakonomics we wrote all these stories and people just liked it and we you know we kind of had this look we offended lots of groups like we talked about how real estate agents were like the kkk but like in a lighthearted way that even most of the real estate agents didn't get that mad at us and i got invited to speak at the um the national realtors association so i was like everyone's like a good sport about it then when we wrote a second book people got super pissed off um because i guess we hit a little closer to home with stuff like climate change then we wrote a third book and by that time we had alienated everyone it turns out that like there was so the third one's think like a freak right yeah but yeah so by that time there was like every person on the right and the left thought we were jerks by the time we were done with the third one which is more or less where we stopped writing books because we had gone from oh these are these fun-loving economists who poke fun at everything to like those jerks they're like offended me deeply and i'm never gonna buy another book from them again and then remember one night we were having dinner this was at my house in san diego years ago maybe six or seven years ago and i think you were toying with the idea of writing a fourth book about like the freakonomics approach to golf and you really spent the entire night trying to convince me to be the protagonist of that book do you remember this discussion oh my god yeah so i actually wrote large chunks of a book about the free economics of golf and um and and liked it and enjoyed doing it because i have i loved and loved golf and i wasn't that good at it but at the age of 40 i really in in a semi-serious way dedicated myself to becoming a professional golfer and and never got nearly good enough but but improved a lot but i i knew i couldn't do it based on physical talent i knew i had to do it based on i'm being smart and using data in in a particular way and so i've developed all of these sets of tools that i think could be really helpful to a golfer and what i needed was i needed someone who had amazing physical talent and was a complete maniac in the sense that i know you are of like willing to put 10 000 into anything that you started and i thought well what a great chapter would be to take someone who's never golfed before and to see how good you could get that person could get in the air and you were my number one you were my number one we talked about it seriously i mean i really did consider it just out of curiosity which was if i devoted one year to this like i had devoted one year to swimming like how far could you get in a year if you were willing to put in two to three hours a day a very deliberate practice especially with your guidance which as i understood it was going to make a lot of shortcuts um but in the end i think my fear was just the addiction that would come of that like golf yeah it would have been one of those terrible just it could consume someone like me it would be a terrible waste of your talent as well so i only did i did eventually take on a one um one student and it's a funny story so um so larry summers who was the secretary of the treasury and the president of harvard and whatnot so he came to she came to chicago one one time uh to give a speech and this is you know not too many years ago when he was inc is was and is incredibly eminent and um and like i got an email that was addressed to like five nobel laureates the president of the university and to me um demanding our presence um when he comes um to entertain him or you know that like i don't know so he could we he could hold court or whatever and i and i was completely befuddled at how i got on this list of of these folks so i showed up and um i was maybe the fourth one to arrive and he was deep in conversation with a couple of our nobel laureates and the president and he literally like stopped i walked in the room and he like broke off the conversation and he said sorry gentlemen this is who i need to talk to and i'm like wow like my stature and the profession of economics is really going up and he says steve i mean i don't even really know him i've talked like twice in my entire life he says steve i have been needing to talk to you i'm like wow i'm like thinking what what what am i going to tell larry summers and he says i've heard that you're the one guy in the world who can get my handicap from 20 down to five in golf um how were we going to do that and it was hilarious that the thing he cared about was golf and so i i had failed with you peter i thought okay what a great chapter this will be i'm taking larry summers from a 20 handicap down to a five and he turned out to be the worst student that ever existed in the planet he would he like wouldn't do anything like he i sent him all my stuff we worked out you know we were going to work out plans for talking and like he wouldn't practice it was um he was the exact opposite like the reasons i wanted you to be my student were the exact reasons that larry turned out not to be a very good student for this let's hold on to this there there may be a day you know i don't know maybe when my kids are in college or something and i i have a little bit more bandwidth i might be willing to pick this up but i i you you have me very intrigued by this um the title for economics um you got that from your sister right i did so my sister who unfortunately has since passed away from cancer um she was she was a force of nature she she was you know it's funny when you grow up you're around a relatively small set of people and you kind of gauge your own stature in the world relative to the people around you and my sister was so amazing that i always thought i must be like below average in terms of creativity and things because like relative to her i was awful and and so but but she was also odd in the sense that she didn't she didn't really function that well in the world like she wasn't that successful in in traditional metrics because she was kind of she was a little bit like robin williams like like the person most like her that i've ever you know seen is robin williams and that she was incredibly creative but like i don't know like didn't necessarily fit in that well with how the world worked so anyway we tried to write this book about nothing right so this was a book where we we didn't have a theme and we were just you know we didn't have a title that's first we had the worst set of titles and um and i knew immediately my sister was the only one who would come up with a title for this book and so i told her what we were doing and she came back a half an hour later with i would say 10 titles that were better than any title we had come up with but she basically just said look but the title of the book is freakonomics and i'm like you're right the title of the book is freakonomics and uh and even dubner was you know okay yeah for economics that works so we went to the publishers and they just flipped they're like we paid way too much for this book to call it for economics they like refused the title they fought it and it was months of back and forth before they grudgingly said that they called this book free economics well what what were they advocating for what were some of their titles do you remember oh my god you know the one we were at i think i always forget it so i was um um uh i think i think one of the leading candidates just to put you where how bad we were off was e-ray vision like where e stood for economics and i think that was a a not ruled out title before freakonomics um but uh but in the end i think that you know i honestly think this same book with a different title might have sold no copies i mean it's it's um public life in general publishing specifically it's just a huge luck component to it um it depends on like i think our book you know little things happened that made all the difference um we got a good review on the wall street journal um i went on the daily show with jon stewart and somehow he like made it seem really cool and like little things happen with books that kind of determine whether they fly they don't fly and um and i think i think we if we ran back time and uh and thought about this book and it going on i think 99 times out of 100 it would probably wouldn't have solved very many books we're just like super lucky and and a lot of things that happen i mean i mean i think it's a good book i mean i'd like the book i'm not trying to say it's bad book but um but what is really amazing is if you actually sit down and read books and so people send me books all the time because they want me to blur them it's incredible how good these books are like you know random books that i expect to be awful there's so many good books and and um look at nobody reads them and uh you so many good podcasts that nobody listened to but it's just really hard in the clutter of this world to break to break through and um and i think the you know the the tightness of the correlation between how good something is and how much attention it gets much lower than i think most people give credit for steve something you've been talking about quite a bit lately we spoke about it when i was on your podcast i've heard you speak about it on other podcasts um is kind of our shared appreciation in mental health and how underappreciated it is um how long has this been something that's kind of been at least to you as important as i think it is now is this recent or is it something that's always really mattered and you've only kind of come to appreciate how under-utilized these tools are yeah so i am like i was raised um by a father who was like no nonsense and um the the idea of therapy i mean such an embarrassment oh my god i mean like no real man would ever think about uh you know certainly crying like like i would you were not allowed to cry and um you know but you you had a grandfather that committed suicide was it your father's father or your mother's father my my father's father who no but it wasn't a mental like my father my grandfather's suicide was not a mental health issue my grandfather uh who loved life more than anything and was i don't know maybe 90 years old his wife who he loved dearly had terminal cancer and so he decided to commit suicide not out of unhappiness just because he had lived a great life and he was satisfied and he didn't want to be a burden on people so so it wasn't it was in no sense it was it was actually in some sense the opposite it was it was it was um like just uh an acceptance of that the death is part of the nation like in many ways he was extremely far along in the mental health domain because he like accepted death as being a natural part of the cycle of life and was not troubled by um i think honestly for me the big change was um i got divorced and i met met my wife suzanne who um he's much more in tune with these issues and got me thinking about them in a way that i never had before whether it's like kind of more esoteric stuff in the in kind of the spiritual domain or purely about mental health and um and i somehow shook off like a lifetime of uh of of teaching which told me that mental health was a joke and you just gotta like fight through it and uh and came to appreciate so you know seven years ago really is when i started thinking about these issues and i think you're right in saying that i've come to believe now that they are you know dramatically more important than our education system or our society has traditionally given them credit for so you've you've spoken about this a little bit i mean you've spoken about it with me and and you've explained that you'd be even comfortable talking about it today but you know one of your children struggles with an eating disorder um how hard has that been for you and how have you sort of navigated your appreciation for mental health with both her struggle um and your struggle because i i i think that's hard for both of you in different ways obviously you know it's interesting that i um i'm really if there's one thing i'm really good at it's make it's the um i forget the um serenity the serenity prayer i'm really good at understanding the difference between things i can and cannot control and not worrying very much about the ones i can control and if there's one thing was clear to me that i could not control directly it was um my daughter's eating disorder and that no amount of trying to push or pull or whatever was going to do it so it was weird really i approached it with a real calm um i mean it was you know awful to watch um but i didn't struggle in the way that i think most parents struggle which is the feeling of like i should be doing something about it and um i honestly just i mean it was just it you know it's look these are often lethal you know that that um you know and she was you know incredibly accomplished as an anorexic she she was extremely effective at um at um you know torturing herself and in a weird way i think um that that calm was helpful um in in letting her be comfortable with me about it and eventually i think i played you know some very small role in her recovery i mean obviously 99.999 recovery was her own um but uh so in the way it was it was odd i mean that's probably not the answer you expected me to give but um but in a strange way that was not um i you know i maybe more generally with my adult children i i really am maybe better than most parents at understanding that they're their own people and that they live their own lives and that i'm just an observer and um you know i can offer advice but not you know but i have no control over it um so i don't know where do you where do you think that transition takes place age-wise i mean i you know a friend of mine rick elias who was on this podcast once said something that has stuck with me i i don't i don't think a day maybe two days would go by that i don't think of what he said which is raising children is playing a game of tug of war that you have to lose um and you know but he and he said it more eloquently but you know it was like you you lose it gradually obviously right so yeah you know when you're holding the tug of war with your five-year-old you're you're still winning but and with your 13 year old you're really starting to slip and by the time it's the child's 18 it's their rope right or whatever um you seem to have navigated that better than most perhaps yeah i think you know i had a i had a son who died when he was one and that was far and away like a million times a thousand times harder than anything i've ever experienced um in part because your own like your real job as a parent in some sense your biggest job is to keep your children safe and it was so difficult for me to navigate the knowing that i had not kept him safe and i and he was my first son and six kids later um i think i think that really affected my parenting and you know he didn't die because i was abusive or neglectful he died because of a a terrible disease meningitis that came out of nowhere and and i couldn't protect him from it and and i and i think there's one or two ways you can go you can become incredibly fearful like i just happened to watch finding nemo yesterday with my kids and so like you can be like marlon the the dad and nemo who becomes incredibly productive and doesn't want nemo to do anything or you can just understand that the world is one of uncertainty and of loss and of um risk and i really for whatever reason i went that second way and i just said look i can't control the world around me and i'm just gonna do the best i can knowing that that's true and i think so even from a very young age with my kids i um i have a lot of acceptance of their autonomy and their independence and the and the fact that i can't mold them the way i'd like to or shape them um so i think um so even with look do i want my four-year-old to do what i tell her to do i get super pissed off when she doesn't um you know go to bed when i tell you yes but on the other hand i put an enormous value on that autonomy and that independence and um and when i'm you know calm and quiet uh i'm more or less for better worse putty in her hands and will do essentially whatever she'll want because i think a big part of her growing up in life is is learning to have control over situations and what better what better way for her to learn about control than to um than to be able to to have some control in her interactions with me which is totally different than the way i was raised i think in the way um that um maybe i would have raised kids absent the death of my son andrew but but i really have gone in that direction how deliberate was that process when he died that you made a what sounds like a very conscious or even subconscious decision to accept it um and move on without you know as you said basically well look i i'd back up and say the following right i mean i i think one could say that many parents who lose a child are never the same again and i don't say that in a glib way you're not the same again so let me rephrase that no parent who loses a child is the same again but you could make the case that many parents are so damaged after that that that they're they're even externally never the same again um most people i mean i know this about you but my guess is many people would interact with you and never know that you'd lost a son um so i mean what strikes me about it steve is that it's the one of the core tenets of of of something called dialectical behavioral therapy which i've become very fond of which is this idea called radical acceptance which is super hard but it as its name suggests radical acceptance is basically just radically accepting things not saying that they're good radical acceptance doesn't mean it's good that my wife got cancer it's ironically accepted she got cancer um i i work on this every day and it's the hardest thing in the world it's super hard um it's even hard with silly things by the way you know what i mean like it's even hard with the most irrelevant things at times so i want to understand that a bit more how did you possibly come to that type of profound radical acceptance of something so awful so it certainly wasn't conscious it it you know and i wasn't i think the deep it wasn't from deep thinking or anything i just i i would say it happened and in many ways i would say my hunch is that radical acceptance of um big things it must must be easier than radical acceptance of little things because it's so obviously beyond control um look my son had died there was definitely no undoing that and um and i think it it it um i've i i have no real self-awareness um of how it happened uh it just did and it wasn't i didn't work at it let me put it that way i didn't work at it it wasn't something like where i went to therapy and i came to eventually accept it just just happened i mean it was um um almost um disjoint from the grief uh i mean the grief is one thing the grief is real and is you know semi-permanent but how how you how you how you're be how you behave in other situations to me that's just you know i don't know why but that's just how i reacted to it um if that makes some sense um it was it was really long before i consciously invested any time effort resources into thinking about mental health or about um you know about more spiritual things for lack of a better word in the time that you've now come back and reflected more heavily on these issues around mental health in the past as you said seven years have you learned anything new about that experience when andrew died you know i've never literally i have not thought about it in those i mean obviously i think about his death all the time but um but i've never i've never um i've never tried to make any sense of it um um that's the answer i i've literally uh haven't thought about the way in which i processed it um i haven't really talked about it i mean other than talking to you right now i'm not sure um i've talked about his death and um the aftermath of it but i've really never talked or in many ways thought about um much about the implications of it in a weird way um seems strange but it's uh it's it's true what do you think would be necessary to infuse this idea of self-care and mental health into education you talked earlier about how this might be even more important than education which i don't think anybody would argue is not itself important how would you how would you operationalize that if you were education czar you know whatever that might be then you you had a whole over the entire k through 12 system how would you infuse this type of this type of thinking let me take a step back and just first make the case for it because i think that's worth with doing i think we went back to square one and we thought about what we should what we should teach children about navigating the world we would radically overhaul the curriculum and like we'd change math and stuff but but but much more fundamentally i think we would try to teach them the set of skills that will make them happy and able to resolve conflict with other people and to you know you know just get along in the world i i think like at least for my kids i'm much more worried about that than whether they're like really good at calculus it matters less to me that they have like good lives in there and they um know how they know themselves and they make good choices like that um i think that wasn't the spirit when we started school and so our curriculum is very much built off of things from 100 years ago and this wasn't in the air and maybe we didn't have the tools then okay so that's my case for why i think we should be tj so and that doesn't answer your question at all about how to do that okay it's just my belief that as a parent or as a school our goal should be that we raise well-adjusted kids who have a set of tools that are helping them cope with the world around them okay then um and that many adults like you and me have made a lot of investment in these tools later in our lives and maybe we could reduce the need for that if we had invested more earlier as a society in that okay how did that i have no idea i mean it's like impossible because it's impossible to change anything what's the problem the problem is that time during the day is scarce in school and every minute you spend focusing on mental health or self you know care whatever is a minute taken away from something else and that's really hard to do the second thing is who in the world actually knows how to do this well i'm not i'm not sure i i know how to do this well um and even if i did know a person who knew how to do it as well how do i do i know how to scale it absolutely not um i don't know what kind of training you give teachers or who you'd hire so like i think it's it's very amorphous in my mind it's it's a belief that it's important and i think it'll be a lot like let's just say y'all agreed it should happen it will be a long arduous process what i believe the right way to do it is for the department of education to mandate like we have for the common core and math and math that we should have a common core and mental health and that there should be these 17 things that are hit each year you know different ones for anything like no obviously the kind of thing where i think maybe you'd wanna experimentation right so let a bunch of models run see what seems to work and um you know and grow into it i i would be very much in favor of that where we encouraged subsidized um school districts to try out things and um encourage innovation uh but i think we're i think we're a long ways away from that i had the privilege of talking to the the biden transition team not too long ago about education and and i threw out three or four ideas and i and they they listened quite intently to each of the ideas except for the mental health ones like they could not get away they could not get off that topic fast enough like total silence in the room when i when i suggested that as an important thing to do have you ever gone back and spoken with your dad because your dad is still spry as can be doesn't he still work he's still practicing my dad is still a practicing physician at the va hospital so have you ever gone back to your dad and revisited this idea of mental health and his lack of interest in this topic uh i i haven't you know it's funny so i'm i'm actually thinking hard about interviewing my dad for my podcast and um and and i'm pondering so it seems i i so it's it's funny i feel like i feel like somehow doing it via podcast should be the opposite but i somehow feel like well if i'm doing it on the podcast i can ask my dad all sorts of questions that i couldn't ask him otherwise which clearly like logically makes no sense at all why would recording something and playing it for hundreds of thousands of people put questions on the table instead of taking them off the table but in a weird way i think somehow it would be easier for me to ask my dad these ques questions like this in the context of a podcast we'll see what happens i he's a very reluctant potential podcast guest and um and i'm not sure he can do technology well enough to hit the button to actually record it on his end so we'll see um whether it happens but not literally never talk to my father about any of these issues ever super interesting i've i've not talked to my father about my sister's death or his father and mother's death this time just were we're a family that doesn't talk about stuff like that um we're you know we were it was a nice enough family but the word love never never used in my household except with reference to the family dog people love the dog but you would never ever say you loved another family member now how different is that with your current children and your current family is that different so i have self-consciously been very different about that that that that i tell my kids and they tell me they love me you know every time we hang up the phone or whatever um which i don't know if that matters for anything but it is it is that is like i don't do that many things self-consciously in my life but that is one that i very self-consciously tried to um tried to propagate was the idea that you could express your feelings of of love and affection to um in my in my current you know in my family the family i i'm the father figure so you're fond of decision making what's the best decision you've ever made in your life and what's the worst decision you've ever made in your life uh i'm probably going to give you a terrible answer to this um i think my worst decisions i'm too embarrassed to talk okay that's fine i probably wouldn't be able to publicly but i've made a lot of like look i will tell you all of my worst decisions have been about inaction not action i i know that that that like i have not made i've never made it terrible of the hundred worst decisions i've made i'm sure that 99 of them were not doing something as a poetry they're very few really bad things i've done by the way i feel the opposite steve my worst decisions have been decisions of bad action not in action but that's interesting so and what's the best decision you think you've ever made or a subset of the best decisions you've ever made um i think the i don't know if you'd actually call a decision but the decision it's short of a decision to not care what people think about me it's it's not a decision in like oh i went back to school i didn't go to school but but i somehow just made a choice it's a choice i don't know if you can't choice i made a choice to just not care what other people thought about me and um which was a big choice for me because like most high school kids i all i cared about was what other people thought about me and at some point i just broke with that and um and was happy to live with the consequences and it's been it's it's just a it's just a great way to live um to it just frees you up from from so much burden um i think all my best decisions are ones that have i've relieved burdens i'll give you another one which is trivial in comparison but important i guess i used to be super cheap i used to worry about every um transaction i made and like prided myself on being frugal and thinking about oh you know should i spend that dollar on a bottled water in the airport or not and at some point i just said hey this is like i could free up a lot of mind space if if i just didn't worry about decisions that were like under five dollars and it was hard for me to do but i said look i'm gonna stop if it's under five dollars when i start to go into this friends i'm gonna forget about and then i moved it up to like 10 or 20 and like the highest like for me it's like the higher the better and it is just so liberating for me that i just have this rule of thumb that like if it's under some you know ridiculously large amount of money i just don't worry about it and um and look it adds up i probably you know i waste tens of thousands if not more dollars a year because i'm not getting these decisions right and that's awesome because i free up you know 10 of my time to do whatever the hell i want and i love doing the stuff i do and um and it's um it's just super liberating so i think many of the things i like are these things that have been liberating where i i stop worrying about stuff and maybe it's not that far often your idea of radical acceptance like i don't know it's like not radical acceptance but it's like it's just a total acceptance that there's going to be these imperfections i'm just not going to worry about getting things exactly right now do you think in general we as a species are good at decision making what is there a way to to evaluate this i mean like um good compared to what i'm not sure but good compared to compared to optimal no we're terrible i mean it's like it's like behavioral economics of the last 40 to 50 years shows how bad we are at making decisions and i think the best evidence of this is the people who know the most about decision making so whether it's like this really prominent economists who've you know thought enormous amounts about backward induction and optimized behavior in dynamic systems or whether it's danny kahneman who spent more time thinking about behavior again these are the worst decision makers i've ever seen i mean conway even is like very forthright he said like the reason i studied decision making is that i'm awful at it and with everything that he's learned he's still awful at it um and so i think yeah i don't think um i don't think humans are good at making decisions and and i think we can arm ourselves with tools like there are a lot of like a lot of a lot of economics is really common sense codified into helping you make better decisions i think a fair amount of psychology and pop psychology is that as well but um looking and there's no one who talks more than me about how we don't quit enough and um you know and how people get get stuck in bad situations like i know that and i and i have so much trouble quitting i mean it's stuff i should quit i just i i eventually do quit it but it takes me usually like on average two years longer to quit something than then i know what i know i should have quit two years before i do it how can i understand all the problems i understand exactly what the situation is and you know but uh to overcome the the complexity of the brain and all these forces it's super hard to make good decisions what do you think do you think there's an evolutionary force behind that um i think that the evolutionary when when we were evolving the kind of choices you had to make are so different than the ones that we face now that it's not a surprise that evolution would not necessarily be our friend in in these kinds of decisions i mean just i don't know i don't know anything about it really but my sense is that evolution has not been our friend in the nutrition realm right because we evolved in a in an environment of scarcity and now we live in an environment of plenty and all the triggers we get from evolutionary triggers we get are the wrong ones and i you know probably that's the same with decision making right we we we evolved in in settings where we were like facing life and death um problems all the time i mean i think one of the hugest problems that we face mental health-wise is this is trauma and um and and people are stuck in in a trauma mode and reacting to trauma which evolutionarily is probably fantastic because the kind of challenges we faced in and that when we were evolving were short-term incredibly intense risks that you needed to marshal everything in your in your body and your mind to fight but now now those aren't typically the kind of risks that we're we're challenges we're facing and so people end up using the wrong set of tools the the body is just not configured well for the kind of chronic you know chronic settings we live in of of um you know of too many people too much information um you know constant fears and threats around it so like i don't know much about it but but like i i think there's zero reason to think that evolution is our friend when it comes to difficult complex decisions because we just didn't like how complex could the decisions have been um when we were evolving i mean i look back at like this is maybe off track but something really struck me i went to australia for a while and um and and was talking with some guy just we went around um ayers rock uluru and um and talking about um how basically um the aboriginal life had not changed um hardly at all over the course of i don't know 5 000 years or something and it was interesting to think about like you you don't need much innovation at all right you innovate one percent per generation and over 5000 years life is completely transformed so it's like there's literally no innovation going on i mean there's things like they didn't have the wheel because in the bush the wheel didn't do you very much good so like it was interesting to hear about but it just it really hit home for me that observation which is modern life and this idea of progress and and innovation and being better off than your parents like that's a super super modern idea not at all one associated with with mankind's existence over you know huge you know except for this tiny sliver of of kind of post-industrial life that we're in it makes it almost impossible to fathom what another hundred years looks like um for exactly that reason uh the non again the non-linearity of what the acceleration technology has been like in 100 years and uh what it looks like going forward now speaking of a lack of progress this is totally off topic but what you said kind of made me think about this um let's talk about horse racing for a minute you're kind of a fan um did you get to see secretariat at one point i did yeah so i was uh so um when i was in college i wrote my undergraduate thesis on thoroughbred breeding and um and it just happened to be the best library was in lexington kentucky and that's where secretariat was and and i was i i was i didn't really understand how the world worked very well i just figured i could show up at claiborne farms and they would invite me to go see so i showed up unannounced at claiborne farms and i said i would like to see secretariat and and they looked at me like i was i think crazy and like two seconds later one of the part owners of secretariat happened to drive up behind me and and like walk up to them and say hey um we were just going to go say hi to secretariat and and for whatever reason instead of like showing me away they said well this like total clown here thinks he should be secretary too do you mind if he tags the line like okay why don't you get so i did i did get to me because it's funny i was six when secretary won the triple clown crown it's one of my favorites you remember it sports memory uh absolutely i i remember where i was and um and i remember in part because for whatever reason in the belmont i had chosen secretariat as the horse that i thought would win um you know probably based on heavy guidance from adults who had suddenly like led me to think he should win and then that was the race he won by 31

[01:46:29] and i remember that vividly and um so it was i'm not i'm not like a i'm not a very good sports fan in the sense that i i'm not very good at remembering names of players and whatnot or having heroes but but secretary was always one of my heroes and then he died i don't know when he died it was i didn't have gone there in 1988 yeah so he didn't live very much longer after that yeah he was only 19 when he died um why i mean you wrote about thoroughbred breeding why do you think that secretariat was the peak of thoroughbreds and they've never gotten no no horse has ever approached secretariat's speeds i mean i think for the listener just to put in context what's the triple crown you've got the kentucky derby the preakness the belmont to win all three of those and the three of those take place over what about six weeks yeah so to win these three races which get longer i mean technically i guess the it's a mile and a quarter a mile and three-eighths and then a mile and a half um so that for horses that's a pretty big difference in distance so that's speed and endurance in a short period of time i mean it's very difficult to win all three of those secretariat came along and won in 1973 but did you know to this day has the record for the fastest time in each um i think in the kentucky derby what to me is remarkable is negative splitting each quarter mile successively so each of the five quarters was faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and then in the belmont not only running 224 which is like six seconds faster than you know american pharaoh won it yeah but but also winning by whatever 30 31 lengths um no horse has come close to this why do you think that is so i don't know um if i had so there are a couple things to think about so i've actually dabbled with trying to think about could you more in a smarter way do breeding of horses so the way they decide what to breed you know what horse debris to another is not extremely scientific they kind of look at the horse and they have some ideas and so i my hunch is that it's not particularly well done um although just like with humans there's an enormous amount of assorted mating right so it's so you know um it's not like they made the the the the worst mayors to the best studs i mean they make the best and the best you know in the same way that the you know the best basketball players end up you know getting married to the you know volleyball star and then who knows what kind of amazing options they're going to have i think probably the best explanation for it would be that in contrast to human sports i'm not sure there's been any advances in training techniques for horses um in the last 40 or 50 years now maybe there have been but they're not obvious to an outside observer and i've always wanted i have this like i have i have a few little secret dreams and one of my secret dreams which sounds like a disney movie or something is that i would buy a horse an average thoroughbred and i would train that horse the way peter attila trains for ultramarathons and and the horse would actually turn out to be really good i mean i don't really know much about horse training but i don't think i'm greatly exaggerating when i say that the way that horses are currently trained is they stand in their stall for something like 23 and a half hours a day and like roughly once every day or two they bring them out of the stall and they trot around and they run and sometimes they run fast but they don't tend to run fast for more than like three eighths of a mile even though their actual races are going to be a mile a mile a quarter they only like when they train they only run three eighths of a mile and i don't and i think these horses spend almost no time swimming so you might say look their legs are fragile because their legs are fragile you can't like run them all the time but like in my little fantasy world i've got a horse-sized pool with a strong current going against it and my you know you know my horse silver or whatever you know whatever the horses that i have in my disney movie is swimming in the water like four hours a day and i've got him hooked up to oxygen monitors and she's like um you know uh he's he's doing that's that's an interesting point right now stretching or whatever you'd put some zone two training and build some aerobic capacity mitochondrial efficiency i mean that's look i don't think it's i mean i don't know enough about it to say if what you're saying is correct or not that there haven't been advances in 50 years it's hard to believe there haven't been but um i don't know i mean it would be interesting i think though if you let's forget about the golf project i think it would be super fun if you and i because i think i look i'm not going to learn you already know a lot about how humans work and i'm sure you could figure out really quickly how horses work and um it would be i think it would be so much fun to buy some you know to to claim okay because these horses when they run you can claim them for like five thousand dollars take some total illusion well the problem is for the triple crown you'll be a three-year-old so you can't really do it you just got to take some completely on unspecial horse and and what we'd really want to do is we'd want to win the triple crown like four years in a row doing our aerobic thing because look if it were humans like imagine just just imagine you go back to uh you know i don't know to to the time when i you know you know much more than me but like when roger banister was running the four minute mile and i think there's still like not very good training going on at all at that time i mean i may be crazy but is it not true that good high school runners in the us yeah so i think i think right i think in the case of humans we can definitely say that the biggest difference between roger bannister and a good collegiate runner today is knowledge of training much more than equipment or nutrition for sure because so it would be true like if you could magically understand fitness and training and take today's fitness and training and take like a relatively good athlete but nothing special i think you could have won the olympic gold medal in in a range of sports that would be my conjecture take a good athlete and and and and like like like a like a a college a good college caliber athlete and with and the difference between like swimming would be probably a good example like i think you probably the best like the the hundredth or the thousandth best swimmer today is probably better than the best swimmer in the world 50 years ago in terms of times i don't know you would know him yeah i'd have to go back yeah so like that's what i'm saying so you take an a good but not great horse and it seems like you could if you could get the same kind of advances in training you would just i mean i guess the other thing is how much of an outlier was secretariat right i mean i think there's still some debate about was his greatness how much of it was due to the size of his heart unfortunately his heart was not weighed at autopsy but the same vet that did the autopsy on secretariat several years later did the autopsy on sham who was the horse that finished second was basically the second best horse in the world in 1973 and sham had a pretty large heart and he said secretariat's heart was you know at least 15 percent larger which basically puts secretariat's heart at you know twice the size of a normal heart and it's interesting that has been linked to an x chromosome [Music] which may partially explain why secretariat's immediate male offspring weren't that special because his male offspring would have got his y chromosome his female would have got the x and only if that x made it into a male two generations later would that have been particularly fast horse which i think also gets to your point about the lack of sophistication around breeding um i don't know why i find this stuff so interesting i think there's just there's just something so beautiful about these horses but in particular secretariat i've always been so enamored with and in fact when when our middle uh son before he was born i was really lobbying hard for the middle name secretariat uh didn't even get like that didn't even get a prayer uh but i i lobbied really hard for it maybe if you um lived in communist russia you would have had more of a better chance with the the middle name secretary okay steve a couple of last questions for you here because i've been taking up too much of your time what is what do you think is the most interesting question on your mind that you don't have a clue of what the answer is um i don't have a clue so if you want to go so this is just this is just pure weird um but something i think about actually i think of it with you because it's your influence that led me in this direction because you introduced me to sam harris's work and there was uh a few paragraphs in in sam harris's book uh waking up waking up which um which have intrigued me um and which are which i don't really know anything about but i find them intriguing so this is what i find really interesting so he talks about how the left side of the brain has the ability to speak in the right uh the right side of the brain doesn't doesn't have the capability to express itself through speech and um and i'm sure there's a lot more to it than that but it's a starting point that simple observation i find interesting because it got me thinking about the degree to which our lives are mediated through speech obviously when i talk to you i have to use speech but my own inner life is incredibly dictated through speech so i'm putting words on everything like every as i go through my life it's not just this idea of chatter in the back of our head and like is there some you know monkey on my back telling me i'm a loser or whatever that's not really what i'm talking about it's much more about that in general when when i look at a computer i put the word computer on it okay so then it just got me interested in the question of well he kind of makes a little suggestion that it's possible that you could think of the right side of the brain as being held as a slave dominated by the left-hand side of the brain like the right-hand side of the brain has all sorts of interesting things it could do but because it can't speak it's relegated to this awful subsidy role and so i just got interested in the idea of how could i introduce myself to the right side of my brain how could i actually get to meet that part of my brain which i don't even like i know nothing about how the brain works i don't even know if that makes sense but um but like given infinite time which i don't have it's actually i think that's one of the things i would pursue so i pursued it like in a little way which is i found it was actually quite easy with concentration to train myself to to um to be silent silent and stop me um so so what i want to do so i want you know i want to think i just don't want to think with words okay it's really so it's a way so it's i think it's slightly like i don't understand meditation and all the different kinds of things but i think what i'm trying to do is slightly different than what most people are trying to do i'm not going to quiet my brain what i'm trying to do is i'm trying to observe the world with all of my senses but observe them without but free of language okay so that look it's it's totally possible as i i don't know um peel a potato like i know how to peel a potato without calling it a potato without using the word peel you know and almost everything we do in life um even i think in some sense listening i i can kind of i i well i don't know about listening but but like most things i can do on my own i don't need language but i constantly have language as my partner and and so it was an interesting and uh surprisingly easy task to on demand be able to try to put words aside and be word free okay i i won't say that i can do it like at will or perfectly but but i was better at doing that than i thought i'd be and and what followed was kind of interesting and intriguing and and increased my interest in the question as opposed to decreasing which is i find that it's very difficult for me to be unhappy or angry without words that words are really critical to feeling um victimized to feeling um like like it's not that i don't feel anger but i feel very very differently in the absence of words than with words and it's um and i can process much weight so anyway um that's probably a crazy answer to what you just asked but um but that's it's something i i have a hunch that it might be important um i have no clue about how to actually do it well um i'm sure there are probably gurus out there who could maybe help me do it but i've actually never really heard anyone else talk about it um explicitly in in that way but um you know but so when i'm trying to go to sleep it's kind of thing where when i try to go to sleep at night i spend maybe five minutes a day um playing around with this and um and and i um i think it's been good for me in a weird way well i think that last observation about how the the reduction of nomenclature around a negative emotion or an emotion let's not that anger is a negative emotion but a negatively valenced emotion at least uh can reduce its impact that that alone is super interesting as an observation the other the other thing i'd say is that strikes me as something that could be probably augmented by medication right there there could be certain plants or drugs or chemicals that would probably really augment that state so we'll leave it at that that's interesting that's really interesting maybe you can help me with some of those um last thing i want to ask you steve you've mentioned numerous times that the random controlled experiment you know the rct the gold standard of medicine is a tool that is virtually never available to the economist for obvious reasons the scale would be enormous if you could put all of that aside for a moment if you truly had billions of dollars and all the time in the world what experiment would you conduct so it's funny um you know because i i don't actually have big ideas about economics i think economics isn't where i would go with something like that because in some fundamental way i think we understand what's understandable about the economy um i mean it isn't it's not a lack of resources that makes it hard to understand the macro economy is the fact that we have exactly one of them right so absent a set of parallel universes i don't think we're ever going to find out through data or experimentation so look if you give me a different choice which is hey if you had if you could be god and create enormous number of parallel universes then i would have a bunch of interesting macro experiments that i might want to do i really think um so for me when i think about big problems they're much more off and like like i think that um they're rarely about randomization um uh i really think the things i i would well i'll give you an example where maybe this is what you really think about but like i think how we really blew it with covid is that we didn't look so what have we done well we used uh randomized trials to figure out that we have really good vaccines okay but we didn't even i i i fought with montefslavi about this but look i think we were idiots not to do challenge trials where we actually went out and learned much more quickly by giving you know giving people vaccines and giving them covet and seeing if it works you know like i think we were foolish given given the the stakes not to do that um but much more fundamentally i think that we have ruled out medical ethics and societal views have ruled out really sensible like like would we want to know the answers the best way is randomize experiment okay so there's so many you and i have talked about a little bit on my pockets well there's so many cases around covet where we just don't know the basic facts about like i think you made a big point about the six feet thing like six feet away like somebody just made that up and we live with it or another one that just came up is there's a great op-ed piece that said well why is everyone still wearing terrible masks because like at the beginning people you know we're told well don't wear a mask because a mask won't help you anyway which was obviously idiotic because we were really being told that because they didn't want us buying up all the good masks because they wanted to give them the front line health professionals of course if they didn't work why are the front-line health professionals wearing them um but i just think there's like the the the real missed opportunity in covid was not to take the approach that i think is like 100 accepted which is the best way we are able to learn given the constraints of society about kovid is by doing clever little natural experiments where we look at some particular airplane and some particular person we know got coveted and then we go and and do contact tracing to figure out how bad it was look the best way to figure out whether airplanes are dangerous is to put people on airplanes some who have kova and some don't and to figure out who gets it i mean and people like oh you can't do that but look when the stakes are high enough and you got you know especially with kovalev but this brings it back to what this brings it back to the field of economics you you would argue if you pay people enough as volunteers there's going to be a subset of people that are going to say yeah my risk of getting covet and something really bad happening is sufficiently low enough that i'm willing to be one of the healthy volunteers on that airplane who risks getting covered and of course we would argue well that might not be medically ethical but you're saying desperate times call for desperate measures there's a way to solve these problems yeah but yeah and then and then you know manchester lawyer who ran operation um warp speed said yeah but that's no good because then you just have the healthy people and that might not tell you anything but look there are plenty of people who are really really sick and who are worried about their uh their dependence and what's gonna happen their family look there are plenty of people who know their life expectancy is four months who are going to be willing to get exposed to covid if you say we'll take care of your family you know if you die from so like i think i i have a i know i'm completely out of step with a mainstream medical ethics on this but i think um i think medical ethics gets it really wrong because when they think about money they think about small amounts of money and i it's probably wrong like if you if you're willing to offer people a hundred dollars to do this then the only people are gonna do it are gonna be drug addicts and and uneducated people who don't understand but look if you when the stakes are as high as covert you can offer people ten thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars i mean you can offer enough money that everyone's going to be lining up to do it and if everybody's lining up then i think medical ethics no longer has a real a real stake in this because um you know it's just a different problem when everyone is volunteering to do it volunteering because you're paying enough money but then almost every issue of metal medical ethics fades away when when you got a surplus of people volunteering you know i never thought about it that way until you said it steve that is a fantastic point um institutional review boards irbs are adamant about making sure honorariums are very small in studies to prevent coercion that's their big shtick is you can't overpay people otherwise it's coercive but the irony of it is it is coercive if it's low and it disproportionately targets the most vulnerable exactly it's so true and and i i mean on organ donation this has been something i've harped on for a long time people people are really terrified of the idea of a market for organs for like live donors and kidneys and every horror story they tell is a horror story that's embedded in the idea that there's gonna it's gonna be exploited it look and that's because the price the price the market price would be too low this is actually an odd case in which you you want to enforce an actual price which is way above the market price because the the value to our meta you know better than me the amount we spend on dialysis and the amount of suffering associated with it it's like some cr even like measurable percentage of gdp like one or two percent of gdp or some crazy thing like that um and and the value of a really good healthy live kidney to society is enormous it's you know on the order of i don't know you know hundreds of thousands of dollars at least so you could easily pay people a hundred thousand dollars for a good kidney and if you did that i think you might have i don't know might have 10 million people who would 50 million people who would sign up to be kidney donors in that world and in a world in which you know wall street stock brokers are signing up to donate their kidneys and then donate i mean not altruistic they just want a hundred grand look in that world the whole medical ethics is turned upside down and the weird thing is i cannot get anyone to take that scenario seriously even though to me it seems completely and totally obvious that if if um if we could do it someplace it would if if we could get you know i don't know you know guatemala or you know you know or singapore or mozambique or someplace to just do that in one place i bet it would work great and and that one example could lead the rest of the world to follow but but but we are so far from any place being willing to try it um i mean the closest is iran interestingly ironically iran is the one place on the on the planet that's paid for organs but not the way i would do it interesting not that it's the most important problem in the world that is a fan like along with training that horse silver to win the um kentucky derby um that's another of my fantasies is a world in which um i create this market for um for live donors all right so on that note steve we've got three huge problems to follow up on we've got a uh in order figure out how to create a really good uh scratch five golfer in 12 months we've gotta figure out how to take a b player horse as a one-year-old and get a triple crown by age three and we've got to figure out a market for organ donation with a really really really high price premium paid for kidneys let me just add number four is we've got to figure out how to do this manhattan project for climate change that's the most important one i'm gonna i'm gonna personally spend more time thinking about that one than the other three but um that's that's awesome to come out of this podcast with four great problems to work on is uh more than we bargained for my prediction the only one we're going to solve is going to be that five handicap golfer when you get burned out and you you get tired of doing everything else the other three i'm not too optimistic about steve thanks so much for sitting down today thank you peter awesome so it's always so much fun to talk thank you for listening to
