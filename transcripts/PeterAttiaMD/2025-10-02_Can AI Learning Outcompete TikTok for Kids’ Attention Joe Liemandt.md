## Transcript

[00:00:00] Just to make sure I'm putting this in perspective. So my 8-year-old who is that kid who loves baseball >> and all he does is talk baseball stats. He's a literally he is a walking baseball statistic. >> Do you know so and so hit 326 and this many home runs and do you know he was able to hit 477 feet blah blah blah. So he will be able to get to know his AI tutor. They will figure out in short order that the way to his heart is baseball. And anything that you can teach in baseball terms, he's fixated. >> Exactly. >> And AI will be able to give him a lesson to to pursue mastery, >> but under the guise of baseball. >> Under baseball. Right. >> And it's just and we all know this, which is you're always that's what teachers are always trying to do is how do I get what the kids like and associate with it. But at scale, you don't have 30 kids who like all the same things, you know, etc. So here's an example of what you can actually do today. There's if you um we have a there so static you know you have hallucinations and so you don't you don't want to release those yet but we have a dynamic um reading generator it's called teach tales and the goal of this is to get kids to love to read so if you take a third grade boy who's like I hate books right I hate books I'm not a book guy and you're like what's your favorite movie uh the Avengers who are your soccer buddies okay and you create the

[00:01:25] AI generates a choose your own adventure where you're saving the world with your soccer buddies and you know they have to keep clicking >> each be an Avenger >> and you be one and literally and the Lexile level right the difficulty goes up it knows right so it's keeping you in the zone of proximal development within 10% of you know what you know your

[00:01:42] Lexile level kids will sit there and click for an hour right just totally engaged >> non-stop reading >> non-stop and just all of a sudden you know because we do have a reading problem in this country people don't read books and all these things This is the kind of thing where Gen AI is going to be able to suck kids in, right? And you know, our competition is Fortnite and Tik Tok, right? And we need to use things like Gen AI to create such compelling content for kids that's related to what they care about that also teaches, okay, I got to teach you fractions, but we're doing this baseball thing, so you're fine, right? You love that. Um, you know, there's a whole program that a lot of people in finance where, you know, uh, and there's there's actually a program where they have a mother daughter thing back to a different way to try to solve it without an AI tutor where there's all these finance moms who teach their daughters poker in middle school and they're like,

[00:02:36] I'm going to get them into poker to teach all these skills and the math skills and all the things that aren't being taught in my school. But with us, we can get that engagement level where the kids are interested in it. And to give you a couple examples and I'll use uh some of our high school kids. So, you know, when you transfer into, you know, uh Alpha High, your knowledge of history is very limited, which is if it's in the musical Hamilton, you know, it occurred.

[00:03:04] And if it didn't occur, you know, if it's not in a song in Hamilton, you don't know it, you know, because we don't teach history very much anymore. And but all the kids know Hamilton. They all sing songs. So our our US history, AP world history, they literally used AI. They did this on their own. It wasn't our stuff. They used AI to generate here's all the facts. You know, there's nine units in US history. For each unit, they created a song and they said, give me all the facts that I need to know for this unit. And they pumped it into Sumo, which is an available, you know, song generator. And they got they created just their own album of songs.

[00:03:43] And they all would just sit around and sing the songs and, you know, learn the facts that way and do it in a way they all were very interested in, right? And they all got fives on their AP because you can do it to mastery and and so Gen AI is going to allow us to create this awesome dynamic content that's relatable, you know, and focused on what or uh applicable to what kids want. The other part is you know there's a learning science concept also bells advanced frameworks of you know the fastest way to learn is basically analogy and so do you have a knowledge graph right >> this is the a in the ABC so so Dean

[00:04:18] Schwarz's book >> which I guess we're going to link to that in in the show notes goes through a toz everything that learning science has come up with >> exactly right so he has so Dean Schwarz from Stanford right school of education one of the leaders in the field >> right has written a book and he's like here it is you know um and every letter has a different one but this one >> a is analogy is one of the ones I remember >> and analogies right where that's the fastest way to learn and so if you know what a kid knows like part of we have a content team when I talk about those hundred facts ideas and concepts per hour what they're using as reference is they're using Tik Tok memes as cuz kids know Tik Tok right and they know what's on Tik Tok and you're like well let's take what we're trying to teach them and use something they already know And that's actually the fastest way to have kids learn concepts. And so those are all coming. Then even when you talk even further, the part we don't have in yet, but you know, our our team's working on it is we also take into account, we will be taking into account the cognitive load, right? This of their brain, which is >> we know we're going to be able to create a lesson that where we know how many working memory slots you have. We know what you know to fluency and what you don't. And we're not going to give you a question that's going to overload your working memory. Or we also know how many reps you need, right? And GT kids need fewer reps. And so we're not going to bore you by giving you too many reps to memorize it. Conversely, we're going to make sure you have enough reps if if you need them. And so this personalized learning where you're generating the content dynamically um I is going to be just this crazy unlock for these kids. Um, and you know, 5 years from now, everybody's going to look back and be like, "Okay, well, obviously, you know, kids can learn 10 times faster." You know, it's we're we wake up every day and they're just like, you know, it's like Neo in the Matrix, right? Where that's a physical upload.

[00:06:10] Ours is, right? Using learning science concepts, kids can learn 10 times faster. And when you think about that, you have 12 years, right? You have 12 years to fill your kids' head with cool stuff, knowledge, right? because they have to hang out in that right in their brain for the the rest of their life.

[00:06:28] And we've allocated 12 years to fill it up. We just need two hours a day at 10 times faster. And all the kids can have more stuff and more cool stuff about stuff they like in their heads to mastery level levels none of us as as parents could ever imagine, right? And still give the kids their time back for the rest of the day to do all other things.
