This clip is from episode  354 – What the dying can teach us about living well: lessons on life and reflections on mortality | BJ Miller, M.D. and Bridget Sumser, L.C.S.W.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Lessons from the Dying – Insights gained from spending time with people near the end of life
- Common Regrets Shared – People most often regret not being emotionally honest, suppressing feelings, or failing to express love due to shame or fear
- Being Present in the Now – Embracing the present moment becomes a coping strategy, reinforced by the reality that tomorrow is never guaranteed
- We Die How We Lived – The idea that death reflects the way one lived is emphasized, suggesting that the emotional patterns and coping strategies we develop in life persist until the end
- Start Practicing Today – The final message encourages viewers to start building emotional and psychological "muscles" now, since we all begin dying the moment we start living

## Transcript

[00:00:00] You've obviously spent a lot of time with people in um by definition the final stage of their life. What what have you learned? What have you learned that changes the way you live your life or the way you want to live your life? Well, I can say something, you know, there's again huge beautiful questions you ask Peter. me.

[00:00:25] But one is, and maybe this is some relief for your audience, um I think we all would love to, you know, I think many of us would say we'd love to be fearless and love to go into our death unafraid or um live a life so conscious that we have no regrets. I would like to kind of just and my patients have taught me to kind of undo those strangle holds a little bit. It's more the truth that I've learned from folks at the end is is is more like have have a change your relationship to fear, your relationship to regret. The mark of living with no regrets. Yeah, that might be an there may be something for you in that, but I I'm not sure how if you're being really honest with yourself how possible that is. So it's not necessarily it's it the lesson has something to do with coming around to accepting everything that's in you including the gnarly stuff like regret and fear and even suffering. Are there certain regrets that people have shared with you more more often than others?

[00:01:30] Well, invariably or a little bit invariably, but they all the common thread depending sort of whether it's I regret working too much or I regret, you know, didn't spend this I didn't tell tell my kids I love them. That sort of the standard y uh regret menu. What they all seem to have in common is they regret not letting themselves feel or not letting themselves be true to the what they actually felt. something got in there, shame or something else, wedged in themselves and separated themselves from themselves or separated themselves from other people they love.

[00:02:05] And the regret has something to do about artificially or accidentally putting a wedge between you and anything. um you know like you could be spend a lifetime running from fear but the I've watched a lot of people come around to when they finally got the cue that fear was just a natural part of being in a body like they became okay with fear they took away that sort of secondary shaming of fear and then then fear became this it was sort of rightsized to them and it was defanged you I've seen that play out a lot and the same with regret you know so it's it's I just think that the commonality back to your question has something to do with not being quite true to themselves or not allowing a trying to keep something out of their experience and all the work they did.

[00:02:50] And when they come to realize that it's all got to go anyway, you kind of welcome even pain. Just get to feel anything is kind of wild and magical. Do people need to be really close to the end to typically come to that near inevitable realization or is that something people are realizing 6 months out where they can do something about it where they still have all their faculties and they can still, you know, mend a bridge or um mend a relationship. Yeah, absolutely. That can happen anytime. Kids back to kids are doing, you know, they're not gumming their own works up. They can do that pretty and to so yes we can do this we can learn to do this another reason why we would invite this subject into our daily lives if you look out your window death and life are happening all the time you see it on your windshield you like this is it's all over the place if you can sort of really be aware let let these messages in then you can let the lessons in toowards reconciliation or why hold a grudge why be on any why would you ever cause suffering in another person knowingly and yourself included etc. So yeah and

[00:04:04] Buddhism was lot sort of founded around this question and to give you a life of practice around meditation how do you hold your mind so that you don't suffer unnecessarily so that you can be okay with the fact of your death. So yeah there are body there's scholarship bodies of thought and just your own personal experience of living daily life if you let it in you can gain these lessons any time along the way of life.

[00:04:28] Yeah, I mean I I don't you know if I think about my own learning like you it you can't I don't think really hang out in this space a lot and not really wrestle with the reality that we don't know when we're going to die which means that this is my life. I mean, I think that's I've got two young kids, so regular I'm kind of like, okay, this is my life. This is my life just as like a management strategy, but I think there's also like a a tether to the reality that like this moment is what I have, right?

[00:05:00] It it is not it may start to sound trit, but it is not tomorrow is not promised to me. 10 years is not promised to me. And if that is true, can I use that as this reminder that like this moment, the way that I speak to you, being tender when I do things out of my value system, right? Staying really connected to now, right, is the invitation that comes from or comes next to or has come for me in being so aware of mortality, right? And that you do not have to be sick. You do not have to be facing the end of your life. No one in your life has to be dying right now to be really to just take pause and be like this is my life this moment and then the next. Do I remember that all the time?

[00:05:48] Absolutely not. But it is a very available reminder and practice. Yeah. I stay I intentionally stay connected to it. I intentionally make it something my kids can be connected to because it's inarguable, right? We can we can have three different takes on everything that we've said today, but it is inarguable that we are always living in the reality that we don't know when we're going to die. I just want Yeah.

[00:06:18] Amen, sister. And I think there that's gets back to sort of the dos and don'ts. Do have a relationship with all with mystery with not knowing. You know, do have a relationship with the present moment. You know, those are some pretty good dos. I don't want to what I'm saying is not like light or easy. It doesn't make me not afraid.

[00:06:39] It doesn't make me, you know, not I I feel very aware of how much I want to be alive and how long I hope my life is. and also humbled by the fact that like what I have influence over and control over really inarguably is right now and I hear you not being ashamed of your fear and that's a difference. I think a lot of people would be afraid and then what they're really experiencing is the shame of being fearful. I'm very terrified every time I get on a plane. Yeah. So, and I think and I think also sort of dubtailing to is this word control comes up a lot. It's a it's a big one. And I think in terms of if we're going to remotely dispense any advice, uh, you know, it would be, you know, the serenity prayer, it comes up a lot one way or another. I think a lot of your listeners will know this. you know, essentially sort of the the the ability to discern what you can control and focus some efforts there and let go of all the things you can't control and maybe in the middle identify that even though there are some huge things we can't control, there is a lot we can influence, right? And that those are distin those are different and that there's like kind of that spectrum between control, influence and like you know surrender.

[00:08:04] Um, and how do we build our flexibility? Well, and how do you learn to sit with I think that message of the serenity prayer. Often I hear people, myself included in the past, some friends take that me that wisdom of that message and say, "Okay, I'm just going to focus my attention on what I can control." Sorry, send the mic. Um, and then they have a lifetime of sort of focusing their uh line of sight in one direction. I think what we let go of is the other half of that message which is not oh don't give a about it because you can't control it like learn sit with all that you can't control practice not being in control that will serve you very well as you head to your death what what about the role of forgiveness how often do you encounter the dying who are wrestling with needing the forgiveness of someone or needing to forgive someone. It's a big theme. It's written about a fair amount. The I love, you know, the things to kind of focus on. I saying out loud, I love you. I forgive you. Please forgive me. These are these are thank you. These are and there's, you know, these are tried andrude messages that seem to cut across culture and stand up pretty well.

[00:09:27] Um, but so back to your specific question about forgiveness, I don't know how often. I guess I would say my I would say more commonly what I see people needing to learn how to do is forgive themselves is probably if you know picking something sort of common that one comes I see that a lot and so that's how does it present and how do you encounter it being at odds with themselves you know when there is no boogeyman there is no they're just not comfortable with themselves they're at odds with themselves self-loathing, self-critical even in the final weeks of life. Some if they've had enough, you know, we have a bias. There's a bias that all the people we've seen have had the benefit of hospice and ballet of care involved. So, they've been loved on, they've been heard, they've been, you know, so there's an inbornne bias to our experiences. Um, I don't know if I have like a good answer about the forgiveness piece. I think um I think it comes up I don't know that I think it comes up a lot a lot. I don't know. Yeah. Again,

[00:10:41] I think that might be the bias of people that you've spent time with over time. Those things have gotten to. They're not a death. There's no need for a deathbed. I mean, there's not a lot of trueisms in this space that I generally um vibe with and I'm pretty allergic to most of them. But I will say that I do think there's kind of something to like people die the way that they live. Yeah. Right. Like for most people, those who lived in love die surrounded by love kind of thing.

[00:11:10] Yeah. No matter like if you had a lot of people around you, maybe there's going to be more people around you. If you were a person that dug into your life and really investigated your mind and you did that relationally and you shared your reflections and like that's also more likely to happen when you're dying, right? So, if there's an experience you would like to happen, if you're imagining into the future, you're like,

[00:11:33] I think dying in this way would be okay or more tolerable or nice or beautiful, start doing it now. Like you want to forgive, like you're worried about forgiveness, like investigate that now, right? You want to feel more connected, how do you do that? You want to be in your body more, how do you do that?

[00:11:50] Right? Like that's the best way to get there at the end is that you're building those muscles. Now, I mean, some people do 180s with with a big diagnosis or the awareness that they're dying, but mostly we lean on the places that we have hyperdeveloped, right? because they're comforting, because they're familiar in the face of this kind of vast thing. I mean, that might be the single most important insight of them all, which is we die how we lived and we will, what's the expression? We we we rise to the level of our training, something to that effect, right? In in sports, we talk about that. Um, right at fatigue, you rise to the level of your training.

[00:12:38] And so we will we will default to our regular strategies. The strategies that got us through life are probably the strategies that will get us through death. And so what we should all be doing is imagining the death we want and begin practicing that at life and make that our scaffolding today. I think about as good as advice as I can imagine is especially if you throw in the caveat that along the way learn to deal with things when they don't go as planned, you know, again. So like so that you don't have this sense of failure at the end. I mean one of the saddest things I think we see is people who feel like they're failing at dying. So I don't want to set it up as an accomplishment per se or an achievement per se, but your advice sounds really good to me.

[00:13:25] Right. Like we can't control for the outcome with certainty, but we can build the muscles and the capacities that that are most likely going or are going to help us land in that place. You know, if you're a person who builds new coping skills or new ways of being in like high stress adversity, like you'll probably do that then, right? Yeah. D. Sorry. just keep going.

[00:13:54] But like you said, it's such it's not it feels like a throwaway line. When do we begin dying? I mean, you know, you don't become a different person when you're dying. You're still going to be Peter. You're going to still be bridge. I'm still BJ. And that, you know, so it has already begun. That act of dying, we never finish answering that question. What goes into that? Like the the final day or two when the body's really shutting down. So active dying has its own kind of frame and we can revisit that any old time but everything up to that is some form of living. So you can begin practicing this dying thing the today.
