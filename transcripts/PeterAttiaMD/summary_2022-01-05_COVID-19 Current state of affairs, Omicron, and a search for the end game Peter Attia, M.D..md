In this episode, Peter sits down with Drs. Marty Makary and Zubin Damania (aka ZDoggMD), both previous guests on The Drive. Marty is a Johns Hopkins professor and public health researcher and ZDoggMD is a UCSF Stanford trained internist and the founder of Turntable Health. This episode, recorded on December 27, 2021, was in part inspired by some of the shoddy science and even worse messaging coming from top officials regarding COVID-19. 

In this discussion, Marty and ZDoggMD discuss what is known about the omicron variant, the risks and benefits of vaccines for all age groups, and the taboo subject of natural immunity and the protection it offers against infection and severe disease. Furthermore, they discuss at length the poor messaging coming from our public officials, the justification (and lack thereof) for certain mandates and policies in light of the current evidence, and the problems caused by the highly politicized and polarized nature of the subject. Themes throughout the conversation include the difference between science and advocacy, the messaging which is sowing mistrust in science despite major progress, and a search for what a possible “end” to this situation might look like. 

NOTE: Since this episode was recorded over the holiday and published ASAP, this is an audio-only episode with limited show notes.

We discuss:

00:13:15 - Measuring immunity and protection from severe disease—circulating antibodies, B cells, and T cells 
00:18:45 - Policy questions: what is the end game and how does the world go back to 2019?
00:24:00 - A policy-minded framework for viewing COVID and the problem of groupthink
00:39:00 - The difference between science and advocacy
00:46:00 - Natural immunity from COVID after infection 
00:57:15 - The unfortunate erosion of trust in science despite impressive progress 
01:02:30 - Do the current mandates and policies make sense in light of existing data?
01:18:15 - Risks associated with vaccines, and the risk of being labeled an anti-vaxxer when questioning them
01:26:15 - Data on incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines 
01:35:00 - Outstanding questions about myocarditis as a side effect of mRNA vaccination and the benefit of boosters
01:40:30 - The risk-reward of boosters and recommendations being ignored by policy makers in the US
01:43:30 - Sowing distrust: Lack of honesty and humility from top officials and policy makers ;
01:52:15 - Thoughts on testing: does it make sense to be pushing widespread testing for COVID?
01:58:45 - What is the end point to all of this? 
02:05:30 - Downstream consequences of lockdowns and draconian policy measures 
02:10:30 - The polarized nature of COVID—tribalism, skeptics, and demonization of ideas
02:20:00 - Looking back at past pandemics for perspective and the potential for another pandemic in the future
02:25:00 - What parents can do if their kids are subject to unreasonable policies

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode:

**Executive Summary**:
This episode features a discussion between Dr. Peter Attia, Dr. Marty Machary, and Dr. Zubin Damania (ZDoggMD) about COVID-19, focusing on Omicron, vaccines, natural immunity, and policy decisions. The conversation explores the balance between science and advocacy, while examining current data and potential future implications of various policy decisions.

**Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Omicron shows 90% less efficiency in infecting lung cells compared to previous variants [00:15:00]
- Natural immunity appears to provide strong protection, with T-cell immunity remaining solid against Omicron [00:25:00]
- Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID drops to 35-45% within 10 weeks after booster [00:45:00]
- Myocarditis risk in young males after mRNA vaccines is approximately 1 in 7,000 [01:15:00]

**Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider individual risk factors when making vaccination decisions [01:20:00]
- Focus on metabolic health and vitamin D levels [01:30:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For older adults (65+): Consider boosters if no prior infection [01:45:00]
- For young healthy individuals: Weigh risks and benefits of boosters carefully [01:50:00]

**Notable Quotes**:
"We've moved to a second pandemic after COVID-19, which is a pandemic of lunacy" - Dr. Marty Machary [01:55:00]

"Strong convictions loosely held" - Discussion principle mentioned regarding scientific thinking [02:30:00]

**Follow-up Questions**:
1. Long-term impacts of school closures and mask mandates on children's development
2. Optimal timing between vaccine doses
3. Role of T-cell immunity in long-term protection
4. Impact of current policies on future pandemic response
