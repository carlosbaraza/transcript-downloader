## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this clip from The Drive podcast featuring a discussion about productivity and decision-making:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This segment focuses on the relationship between productivity, decision-making, and habits. The discussion primarily centers on the importance of creating intentional stillness time for deep thinking and managing decision fatigue. The conversation explores how habits can support productivity not by directly making us productive, but by creating the conditions that allow for productivity.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Decision fatigue is a scientifically documented phenomenon that occurs with increased decision-making throughout the day [05:41]
- The brain distinguishes between "hot states" and "cold states" which affect decision-making capacity [06:32]
- Deep thought is identified as the most important element of productivity [03:35]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Create dedicated time for stillness and thinking without distractions [00:00]
- Make important decisions during "cold states" rather than "hot states" [06:32]
- Design decision structures to minimize less important choices [05:41]

4-7. (No specific information provided in the clip about supplements, exercise, nutrition, or biomarkers)

8. **References & Resources**:
- Cal Newport's work on deep work is referenced [01:06]
- President Obama's decision-making strategy is cited [05:41]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"The most important element of productivity is deep thought" [03:57]
"Habits are so important not because they make us productive, but because they allow us to be productive" [04:29]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What specific techniques can be used to transition from "hot" to "cold" states for better decision-making?
- How can one measure the effectiveness of stillness time on productivity?
- What is the optimal duration and frequency for deep thinking sessions?

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or analyze additional aspects of the discussion?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] My brother, it's his superpower is making stillness time. Interesting. Um he's very disciplined about this. He is very disciplined about time to think. Tell me how he does that. Like tell me a little bit more like what if I was watching him what would it look like? Well, you would actually think at the surface it's quite selfish, right? He'll he'll say for the next two hours I don't you know he'll tell his wife and his kids like I need to be left completely alone and I need to go for a walk with no phone with no anything.

[00:00:36] Um and I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to walk in the fields. You know, he lives on a farm and he's like and I'm going to just be with my thoughts and with nothing else and then I can come back and do my best work. Yeah. Um, but he forces that in. Um, and I think I I am convinced that all of us could do better work if we did that. Um, and yet

[00:01:06] I struggle to do it. There there's a bit of a a trap that I fall into, which is, yeah, but think about how much more I could get done in those two hours. Like I don't have the two hours to be still. Right. So, um, Cal Newport has done a lot of work on this. Y and one of the things one of the mistakes that we make and this is just a a cognitive heristic that we fall into is that we look at some types of activities as being unproductive because they don't have yield immediate dividends. Right.

[00:01:37] This actually is part of the whole habit system. Absolutely. It absolutely is. It's about building those habits to recognize pro deep productivity, deep work, right? Yep. And so one of the things that I'm sure it happens to me, I'm sure it happens to you, is that I say if I go take a walk in the woods for 2 hours, like what do I have to show for it, right? There's like whereas if I sit down and I pound through these emails for 2 hours, suddenly I like my inbox is half the size it used to be. It feels really like an accomplishment. Now, of course, all that does is create more emails for me. And it turns out half of those I could have ignored.

[00:02:11] But so what I need to do is I need to train my brain. And my brain oftentimes doesn't believe me, right? I know intellectually taking that walk in the woods will is going to yield dividends, that I'm going to be able to do better work. But my brain, there's a part of my brain that looks at my stated preferences, what I believe and want to be true, and another part of my brain that looks at revealed preferences. How do I actually behave? And that revealed part of my brain is saying, you never take walks. Like, you always sit down and do your email. You must think that doing email is more valuable than taking a walk. So I have to convince myself convince that revealed preference is part of my brain. No, the walk is really good. Like if I if I take this walk, I'm going to I'm going to get more work done. I'm going to be able to get through those emails faster because I'm going to hit delete on more of them.

[00:02:58] This actually is a productivity enhancer. We don't we have to hack our own brains. Sometimes we have to remind oursel of a reward. Often times the salience of a reward increases simply because we tell ourselves it is a reward and we have to take advantage of that to try and sometimes play with our own brain because we'll act in our sometimes in not our best interests and so what do you think is the relationship then between productivity and habit? How implicit and how explicit is it?

[00:03:35] So I think it's huge. I think it's huge. But but let me be very clear how I mean that because often times the things that we do out of habit are not the productive things but our habits can set us up to be productive. As I mentioned before the the most important element of productivity is deep thought. Right?

[00:03:57] Because making the right choice, making the right decision, spending my time on the right task right now yields many more dividends than simply getting something done. It's the difference between productivity and busyiness. So the question is, how do I set myself up to make better choices? Well, the way that I do that is I build habits that give me not only the time and space to make a choice, but the prompt to make a choice. Because there's a lot of times that I'm going to avoid making a choice if I can. My brain doesn't like making choices. It's energy. It costs energy.

[00:04:29] It feels like it's depleting me. So, my brain is going to say, "Oh, you walked in the cafeteria. Like, don't get the salad. Just get the sandwich you get every single time. You know, it's going to you're going to like it, right?" So, how do I build a habit that allows me the space to make that choice and the prompt to make that choice? That's why habits are so important is not because they make us productive, it's because they allow us to be productive. say more about the decision fatigue because I think that's something that many people listening to us right now can relate to.

[00:04:59] Um I have become much more aware of it in myself recently and I don't think it's age related per se. I think it's just complexity related. So the more things you're juggling the more I find myself unable to make simple decisions. And it's like I can't tell you how internally frustrated I get sometimes when I'm asked to make decisions. So there's two things happening there. And you're exactly right that decision fatigue is real, right? We've seen it in done actually at this point hundreds of studies that the more decisions you have to make in a day, the more fatigued you get. But there's some there's some elements that play into this. The first is structuring decision design. So,

[00:05:41] President Obama, in one interview, he said that the most important habit that he developed when he was president is he bought 12 of the same suits and shirts. So, every morning when he woke up, he just he knew exactly what he's going to put on. It's the same. There's no other options in his closet. He just has to grab one of them.

[00:05:59] Yep. And he said the reason why is because the day was so exhausting with decisions and each of the decisions he made was so important that he had to preserve his ability to make decisions. So, and avoid that fatigue. So, the first thing is how do we design our decisions so that we're only having to make the important ones and we're making the the less important ones automatic things where we don't have to make a choice. Right? The second thing that happens there is that decisions are harder to make in a hot state than they are in a cold state.

[00:06:32] So, if you're hungry and you go into the cafeteria, it's going to be a lot harder for you to choose that really healthy salad over that really tasty sandwich because you're in a hot state. Yep. Now, in a cold state that morning when you just had breakfast, if you say, "My implementation intention is I'm going to eat a salad today. When I walk in, that's I'm I know which salad I'm going to get." It's a lot easier to make that decision. So, here's what I think is happening when your wife says that to you. Two things. Number one, you don't have a mental heristic in place to say, "I'm going to I'm going to curate the decisions I have to make." Because if you had that, and you probably do now, but like the first time it comes up, you don't have the heristic. And the heristic is when my wife asks me where to go to dinner, I'm just going to choose one of them. I'm not even going to like think about like which one is the best one. I'm just going to choose one, right? So, I'm going to create a design a decision structure for myself that allows me to focus on the most important decisions and ignore the the smaller ones. Secondly, she I'm gonna ask her not to ask me to make that decision at the end of the day when I'm exhausted and I've been making choices all day long.

[00:07:40] Yeah. I'm going to say, "Look, I'm in a hot state right now. I can't think about where to go to dinner, I'm thinking about other stuff, but if you ask me 2 hours from now after I've had a beer and I've started watching TV, I think I'll be ready to answer that question."
