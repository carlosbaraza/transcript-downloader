[00:00:10] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast of my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode my guest this week is author speaker and Family Therapist terri real as a family therapist and teacher for more than 25 years Terry's the best-selling author of a number of books including I don't want to talk about it overcoming the secret legacy of male depression how can I get through to you reconnecting men and women and I believe his most recent book is the new rules of marriage what you need to know to make love work Terry also founded the relational love Institute offering workshops for couples individuals and patients around the country along with a professional training program for clinicians know if you've listened to this podcast for a while I think on at least three or four episodes I have brought up Terry's name and his book I don't want to talk about it and I think

[00:01:38] I've even alluded to it as probably one of the books I have gifted more than any other I've wanted to interview Terry for quite some time now because I just think that the way he thinks about the relationship between anger depression and inter-relational strife is so illuminating and you know I sort of sheepishly worked up the nerve to ask him at some point hey Terry you know would it be okay if I interviewed you and and I was just delighted that he agreed to and he agreed I'm very short notice like in a matter of days in this episode we talk about Terry's background grew up with an abusive father and that has turned out to be a while an awful and unfortunate thing that happened to

[00:02:20] Terry probably the greatest gift that came to many of us who have been helped by Terry because it was that relationship with his father that really forged his path to become a therapist and to better understand male depression and anger we talked about how trauma during a child's upbringing can shape them later in life and how it can be passed on for generations over and over again we talk about why people sometimes need to be in painful situations to have breakthroughs what it means to hit rock-bottom how to live a relational life and the importance of living with healthy satisfying rich emotional connections we talk a lot about narcissism and touch on

[00:02:55] David Foster Wallace and the idea of how we don't truly know what someone is going through in life this idea of being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes we talk about a lot of other things but I think in the end I hope you'll just take my word for it that this is worth investing the time and listening to I enjoyed this discussion immensely and I look forward to sharing it so without further delay please enjoy my discussion with Terry real Harry thank you so much for making time to speak with me it's been a long time that

[00:03:28] I've wanted to I don't know turn the tables a little bit and ask you the questions yeah well it's a great pleasure to be here I'm looking forward to an interesting conversation I think I just want to kind of jump into some stuff maybe for the listener I'll tell a little bit of a story about how we were connected and then jump into you telling your story so about 18 months ago a woman who I have yet to interview on the podcast but certainly will as therapure ell who I was working with at the time and still continue to work with said

[00:03:57] Peter you've got me and Laurie as these two amazing therapists in your life but you don't have a male therapist and you need one and I'd already worked with two or three guys but I just didn't have that connection and she said I want you to read a book and next week when we meet I want you to tell me what you thought about the book and if the book resonated with you and if it did I will introduce you to the author and if it didn't that's okay we'll keep looking and the book was I don't want to talk about it and so I went home bought the book read the book and came back in a week and said even if not one other person has read that book he wrote it for me and it was worth the effort he put into it and the rest is sort of history so can you start with a little bit about your background how you grew up well people always ask me how I became a family therapist and my stock answer is I started about four I grew up at poor and

[00:05:02] Camden New Jersey a little hanging on by your fingernails middle-class Enclave in a town that was rapidly becoming a ghost town my parents were under a lot of stress my father was a loving smart violent emotionally brutal man and I went to therapy school I'd already spent the four years in a doctoral program of literature and when I went to therapy school after that and I had to go to therapy school to get the skills I needed to talk to this man to get him to open up to me and I needed to understand what the hell had happened to him I needed to make sense out of my father and his violence so that I would not repeat it I don't have Terry you described him using three phrases I might be paraphrasing a little bit but I could have sworn you said loving smart and brutally violent or at least violent those people don't think of those as going together that seems like a contradiction in some way yeah it does me to imagine what it felt like through a four-year-old it's confusing but real life is confusing there are many many parents who are warm and nurturing when they're warm and nurturing when they tear on you and they're brutal that's not an uncommon pattern and what that does for a child is just confusing it's very confusing and it breeds a great deal of mistrust because the rug is always being pulled out from under you when did that first occur to you that something wasn't right I mean I it sounds odd that a four year old could be even perceptive that anything that they're experiencing is not the norm we've glossed over this but I do want to go back into it I mean you weren't exactly the perfect child you were kind of a bad kid growing up if I recall right well I became a bad kid I didn't start off but I guess nobody does right yeah I was invited to be a bad kid I took the invitation and then I was punished for it you know I was a scapegoat child Peter there were three it is old 12-step the hero child the good one the achiever the scapegoat child the bad one to rebel and the lost child the one that nobody pays any attention to at all and I was a scapegoat child and scapegoat um I'm really happy I feel it's a gift to have been the scapegoat child the scapegoat child is the one that wants to bring up to the surface all of the pathology and the truth that's being denied and suppressed and they usually do interaction rather than verbs but they express the family dysfunction or pathology or ill ease and then they get punished for it or they tell the truth they literally tell the truths about the family and the dad's an alcoholic only you would say that so I was a scapegoat and I was a true teller and now I'm the professional truth teller and it's what

[00:08:04] I do for a living and instead of getting punished for it I'm getting paid for it so there we are so it's not a given that when you were sitting there in high school you were gonna quote-unquote make it tell me a little bit about that transition from high school into college there's a story in your book about I think your dad even accompanied you off to college didn't need that first trip yeah they did first of all oh my gosh let me go back of my schooling if the whole thing really started in about second grade I came home with bad report card and you never know what my dad was going to do I was scared to death but he looked at it and he threw it on the floor and he laughed and he said it's just because those are so stupid and you're so bright they don't know what to do with you okay now the technical tariff for my father was doing just then it's called false empowerment he was pumping me up it was no favor to a little boy I didn't get good grades in school until I got to college I went through elementary junior and high school I figured out that if I showed up every other week that would be enough to get a D average and that's what I did and then I went to the boardwalk in Atlantic City and I sat down at Woolworths and I'd spend the whole day writing and I would show up at school once every ten days to two weeks

[00:09:28] I was going to go to Europe and be a writer but I got a 1a in the draft which is a whole other story scared to death and I went to college to get out of the draft and I had no grades so the only college he would accept me was Atlantic Community College and that's why I spent my first year and I needed to get out and I got all these because I wanted to get out and then I transferred from there to Rutgers my mother and my father came to visit me they stood out like sore thumbs I was completely embarrassed by their blatantly blue-collar out of place nest the last word my father said before he left me was keep your nose for the grindstone and your pecker dry which to this day I don't really quite know what the hell that was supposed to mean and my mother who was six foot and obese the bank on the car that I was driving off in with France bang on the car so the guy jammed on his brakes and then she gave me a little wave and I kissed goodbye were you the oldest of your siblings no no in true birth order the older one is more the hero child usually and the second one is the scapegoat older one goes to father second one goes to mother if you have two boys so the story goes anyway that's what happened to me I have a fraternal twin brother he's six minutes older than I am and he's every inch the older brother and on every inch the younger brother how much did you know at the time of your father's pathology in his upbringing what brought pain into his life oh nothing he wouldn't talk to me he weren't talking about anything of consequence let alone his own life and it wasn't until I was in my late twenties and I'd already become a therapist that I finally had enough skill to persist and get through be gentle enough to get through his defenses and finally at about 28 29 years old he told me his story which is a pretty horrific story in his own right can you tell us some of that story sure my father's mother died when he was nine it was during the Depression in America he and a younger brother he was 11 his younger brother was 9 his mother was dead his father who he describes as a passive loser of a man owned a little candy store and lost it the family broke up and lived in various people's houses and one day in a fit of depression my father's father tried to kill him and his brother and himself he tried to gas up in the garage with his car my father remembers his father craving him in his arms saying and at 11:00 my father knew there's something horribly wrong and he began to fight so the story goes and he kicked the window out of the car and that woke his father up but he grabbed his little brother and got out of the car and according to my father that was the last real authentic contact he had with his father for the rest of his life so it's safe to probably assume that his father also inherited a legacy of pain that may have gone beyond just the experiences he had in the loss of his wife yes I think that's right I think depression runs up and down my family

[00:13:12] I'm struggled with depression in my day I am gratefully on antidepressants as we speak and happily so I'm sure that my grandfather was subject to depression and his circumstances were dire so when you talk about your dad you said brutal loving smart but you didn't say depressed so how does depression fit into what your father was experiencing and and also it lashing out well there's a saying in a a they say hurt people hurt people and as you know central to my work on masculinity is the translation of shame into grandiosity of feeling less than inadequate unlovable somehow to the one down of shame and then you flip into the one up of grandiosity superiority better that attack a Beijing angel righteous indignation and this I believe is the dynamic of abuse and most violence on this planet and if central to masculinity and traditional manhood the flip from the one down victim to the one up Avenger anyway what's devilish about shifting from shame and the grandiosity from injury to attack is it works it makes you feel better in the short run it just creates havoc in your life and that's what happened with my father my father despised vulnerability because he despised his own boundaries he saw his father is weak and he despised weakness ever since and so when I was in his eyes weak precisely when I was vulnerable is when he would attack he was punishing his own father and punishing his own vulnerability it was a hyper-masculine response to trauma does that make sense to you what

[00:15:13] I'm saying it does how prevalent do you think this is I mean it's possible I think if I just consider the sampling of my own population of male patients which may be males make up two-thirds of my patients 60% say I wonder just how prevalent this is in the lives of people who haven't been maybe so literally abused the way your father was yeah well

[00:15:40] I wasn't I mean I was actually my father what did gives us a goal but there are there are many look one of my great mentors a woman named PA melody defined trauma or injury as any significantly less than nurture at transaction between parent and child any significantly less than nurturing transaction between parent and child injures the child now that's a whole range of course and we're all imperfect and it's exactly our parents imperfections and how we adapt to them that shapes what most people would call our character I call it our adaptive child itself but at any rate we're all shaped by injuries the question is are they part of the imperfect dealings of being a human being with other human beings is there repair as their accountability is there something beyond the rupture or is it just injury and rupture my model for relationships comes from Edie tronic who was the pioneer of infant observational research he actually stuck a camera in front of mothers and babies and saw what they did and Edie believes that the basic rhythm of all relationships is harmony disharmony and repair closeness disruption and the return to closeness and in my dysfunctional family and in all the dysfunctional families I've treated over the years there's little to no repair the repair process has gotten

[00:17:18] Jane up somehow and so there's just injury and then you live with it until the next injury so it's not the disharmony you're saying it's not the harmony to disharmony that's the problem it's the inability to go from disharmony to repair right at the upper levels we all heard our kids were all imperfect I told a story about putting Justin's hockey shoes on the wrong feet why don't you tell that story actually I think it is a great illustration that any parent can really do yeah well we were really rush

[00:17:52] Justin was a hockey player which is sports in general is completely not my domain my kid is a total jock he's been really disappointed in some ways that he doesn't have a Boston sports dad and I appreciate that he said I'm gonna go to Southwest I reached out Boston and I'm gonna find a beer-drinking Trump supporting real father because nothing but sports all day that ain't me anyway we were playing hockey I was already feeling a little overwhelmed because it's not my domain we were late he was whining I was putting his shoes on the parents were trying to talk to me

[00:18:31] I was trying to get him out on the ice he goes out on the ice comes back he must have been like I don't know eight or nine comes back ten minutes later says we heard my boots are killing me they were come on Justin just go out there and play I think he's got his skates on right now you're saying this case yeah and then he does obedient little boy and he plays this little heart out when I'm taking his skates off at the end of the game to my horror there were two red pre blisters on his feet I had put the damn shoes on the wrong feet

[00:19:06] Oh God but here's what I say when I tell this story if it had been Justina instead of Justin would I have been so firm or would I have listened to my daughter and I think the honest answer is I would have listened more this is masculinity in that moment I was the voice of patriarchy in collecting itself on my son you've spoken about this patriarchal model that is I mean it's really everything you rail against isn't it you're not a fan of this can you vent a little bit more about this because for many men it's all we've known I mean it is you describe we're gonna get to what relational living means which is I mean I think prior to meeting you I didn't

[00:19:54] I just couldn't have fathomed what you were talking about so if you pause for a moment that's a hell of a sentence that just came out sure that's a big sentence and you speak for an awful lot of men most many many many of the men that I see simply don't know what living in healthy satisfying rich emotional connection feels like they just don't know what are you talking it's Greek yeah it is a little bit abstract and it's if it hasn't been modeled for you which it's not generally that's not a common model it's the less common model

[00:20:36] I guess I would say I don't can't speak to prevalence again but say a little bit more about this what is it that you're talking about as the norm let's start with what this sort of traditional model is sure well they're never waves of saying at the simplest way of saying is what I mean patriarch I'm talking about traditional gender roles for men and women and what I mean traditional pretty feminism but still very much with us so the traditional role for women is everybody's written about the last 50 years is to be accommodating and resentful to lose their voice Carol

[00:21:10] Gilligan wrote this back in the eighties in a different voice and she wrote about a woman's loss of voice loss of authentic connection about the edge of adolescence thirteen fourteen they fall prey to what Carol calls the tyranny of the nice and the kind and they lose their voice they stop telling the truth they start being to be honest manipulative that's part of the traditional female role so traditionally what you've got is an accommodating resentful woman and on the other side you have a shutdown driven inwardly haunted outwardly success one of things I say Peter maybe you'll be able to relate to that when I say is in even wordly the shame based outwardly driven man coupled with inwardly resentful outwardly accommodating warmoth that's America's power couple man successful couple in the world well it's a dangerous combination because there's not enough there's not enough inertia to question it or challenge it internally that probably doesn't make sense what I'm saying but I think you know what I mean it's it doesn't have enough of a forcing mechanism to call into question whereas at least if one of those two phenotypes is different there could be more tension that drives a change potentially and then feminism hit and there was tension that drills the change and I'm gonna say something and maybe some of your listeners will push back on this but I believe that in the 60 70 80 's here's a question Peter what value is shared by mainstream patriarchal culture and almost virtually of all of the so-called counterculture personal growth movements what value is shared by the mainstream and counterculture hmm probably some semblance of independence or freedom yeah you're close the individual the sanctity of individualism personal growth is personal growth not relational growth and so I summarize personal growth or personal empowerment as I was weak now I'm strong go screw yourself and it was big I lived through that revolution in the seventies in the eighties and women were mad skies and I was weak now I'm strong I'm gonna stand back and say it in the old way I want to and you best listen and like it ok that's a step in the right direction but I think there's another step and if I can be so bold as to being male therapist but I have been doing feminist family therapy for 40 years look the next step is loving voice when women moved from voiceless nest and resentment to finally lay a color stash in below I see it all the time in my office finally when women do speak they often speak in ways that are so aggressive that nobody in the right mind can listen to them so relational empowerment is the next step relational empowerment is I'm going to be strong and loving at the same time in the same breath you see I believe that under the patriarchal system there's a little bit abstract but let me say it under the patriarchal system one can either be connected or powerful but you can't happy both at the same time and we say that again under patriarchy which is a system we're all and we're fish and patriarchy is the water under the system we're all in you can either be connected that's affiliative feminine or you can be powerful that's independent masculine but you can't be both at the same time when women do become powerful and when they did as a movement back in the 70s and 80s it was a lot of the women in my office I say to them you after 50 years of feminism you have earned the right to be as obnoxious as men have always been congratulation the next step is loving voice and that's true for both men and women that's standing up for yourself and cherishing the other person relationship in the same breath honey I love you to pieces could you please tone down the way you're speaking to me right now so I can hear you versus I don't like how you're talking to me your ways are saying the same thing yeah you've talked a lot about this idea of enlightened self-interest this might be one example of it yeah because under the Patriot patriarchy is linear and there are two aspects of patriarchy for men the essence of traditional masculinity is twofold one is the denial of vulnerability the mourning vulnerable you are as a man the more manly you are the more vulnerable the more girly you are it's like physics that's just straightforward its misogyny it's my dad it's despising the vulnerable and then the second issue is the delusion of dominance

[00:26:23] God gives Adam dominion over the earth which is really a bad idea the Greeks knew better the Greek spoke about you Burris placing yourself above nature was the tragic flaw in every Greek tragic figure they knew better they knew about humility the delusion of dominance feeling that you are over nature that you have the right the entitlement and even the responsibility to be above nature is a court delusion that will kill us if the nature that you're above is your wife or your kids or your body or your own thinking or it's the planet at large mother nature don't worry about it we'll cook up something in land and take care of we'll kill ourselves if we don't come out of this delusion that's the masculine part of the traditional gender role cut off and false empowerment you alluded to shame earlier I want to go back to that because I think it sets the stage for some of the other concepts that I want to explore can you explain the difference between shame and guilt yeah well this is Renee brown I used to say healthy shame and unhealthy shame but she kind of ruined that made shame ban altogether so for simplicity sake healthy self-esteem let's start off with that that's one of those things that everybody talks about and who really defines it what does it really mean healthy self-esteem it means the capacity to cherish yourself to esteem yourself healthy self esteem to esteem yourself in the face of your imperfections and what you do and I have to teach this to people in general men in particular what you do is just what we want to do with our children when they screw up you hold the person in warm regard you cast a very sober eye on the bad behavior feel bad about the bad behavior you've done but don't take yourself apart as a person you're a good flawed person who screwed up your fine learn from it make amends and get on with it shame is I'm a bad person shame if I feel bad about behavior I feel bad about Who I am as a person and it eats you up alive is for many of us a constant companion for those of us who were unloved or shamed as children we contend with that Allah and the shame is the feeling of unworthiness impotence helplessness unloved ability defected once why does it happen though Terry is it something we are born is it the default setting that we're born with I don't believe so I believe that we were shamed were shamed of children by either being neglected and abandoned somehow and or by being mistreated and misaligned somehow and we take on that chain and we feel bad about our cells usually now guilt is feeling bad about the bad behavior and one of the things that I teach particularly man is when you go from some sort of acting out some offensive behavior when you're in doing that offensive behavior you're in a state of grandiosity you're entitled you're better than you deserve it so you're in a state of grandiosity and you're in a state of self entitlement and self preoccupation when you go from that when you go from inflation to deflation from I deserves on big when I tell my guys is you go from one form of self preoccupation that guess what another form of self preoccupation just went from positive the negative you know what here's what I want you to do bill I'm sitting with Bill and wife and Bill just screwed up here's what I want you to do what I want you to do is what my kids tell me I want you to get over yourself I want you to stop thinking about what a you are and start thinking about how you hurt your wife pay attention to her feel bad for her make amends to her let the energy go out to her now Shane's really hard to get over I understand that I'm gonna give you 60 seconds ready go and they do then come out of shame but do they need your permission I mean do you think that and again we could even use examples of patience is there a sense of I feel guilty about what I've done the right thing to do is to dwell on it for a very long period of time and despise myself for it for all the good well not withstanding the lack of productivity but is that the underlying sort of emotional logic behind shame or at least in the example you gave of Bill oh no it goes way beyond that look once shame starts in childhood and there are big forces at play first of all I was an exception most children if you mistreat them if you're harsh to them if you don't meet their needs they will blame themselves and they will try to contort themselves into whatever the parent needs in order to win that connection and love with love seeking animals and you blame yourself you try and get that parent back in the connection with you you start reading them this is the gift of the drama of the gifted child with the gift you read them you blame yourself and you see Peter it's compassionate to blame yourself because you're feeling bad for your when my father would beat me I would feel bad for him that's a measurement I don't feel sorry for him he was pathetic to me at what age Terry does that a four-year-old would experience that or is that a 10 year olds experience 5 sex the point being for most children is safer to blame yourself than to come to grips with a random hostile universe it makes a lot more sense that I brought this on myself that means that if I do something different I might be able to control it versus the people are supposed to protect me from the world are inflicting me with the brutality of the world and I'm completely in their care and helpless that is a scary thought so people do shame to protect themselves and people also do shame because this is complicated there's some multi-generational legacy my father beat his depression into me with a strap his father beat the depression into my father with gas we passed this on from generation to generation until somebody does something about one of the most profound things I remember you've ever said to me and again I think I don't maybe you were paraphrasing but it's I wrote it down and I see it often in my journal is every man is a bridge spanning two legacies the one he inherits and the one he passes on did I get that about right you got that absolutely right and let me give you another one they say I need a pretension to quote yourself but I do it in this one I'll butcher it but here it goes family pathology roles from generation to generation like a fire in the woods taking down everything in its path until one person in one generation has the courage to turn and face the flames that person brings peace to his ancestors and spares the children that follow that's what I'm about I'm about facilitating that what's the natural history of not doing anything about this I mean is this literally something where you could say look shame will ill laws of entropy basically dictate shame will always propagate unless there is deliberate and act attention brought to halt it yes because even the best of parents will injure will neglect oh honey I'm sorry you skinned your knee and then we just okay

[00:35:01] Doris let me call you back okay and you know what you should've hung up the phone and dealt with the knee on the spot that's a little misalignment that's a little injury that's normal it's part of human development it's okay the child cries maybe in a very safe house the child says mommy why don't you just Ben thing up the phone I'm sorry I'm sorry honey and there's repair and this is the kind of traffic that is part of being human that part's fine but when you start going lower down on the spectrum then things get a lot less fine how does one differentiate between preventing the propagation of shame or trauma and the over coddling of kids because right now the pendulum has really swung the other way in society where there were books about this entire topic of how we've coddled an entire generation and as a result of that there's an entitlement and a whole bunch of other things that are the result of it internally I have my own litmus test but I don't know that it's worth much I'm very curious as to how an expert thinks about this I don't know that I have a particular formula I would say trust your gut and civilize the little creatures the thing is that you have to understand self-esteem like the California no sense the California drives for self-esteem was so misguided it just made me pull my hair out what most people think of a self-esteem is confidence and mastery okay that's fine that's what it is but that ain't self esteem self esteem is spiritual its ontological you have Worth and dignity as a human being because you're here on this planet and you're worth cannot be better or worse than the guy to the left of the guy who arrived you no matter what you say or do it can't be added to it can't be subtracted from it's a spiritual effect you know this is the dr. Peter this is part of the

[00:36:54] Hippocratic oath if one guy is pulled into the ER I need a skid row bomb and the other ones state senator by-the-book at any rate is triage based on me because you don't triage based on status that's grotesque every person is equal we know this in the abstract but we don't live it unless you do some of the work that I invite you to do you don't live like that you judge other people it's better than or less than and you judge yourself is better than unless man all day long I have to tell you I've been doing recovery work for thirty forty years or so since I was a teenager and 69 I don't do that anymore inside my head I don't go up and I don't know down not much it's not my baseline and if I do nine out of ten times I'll catch it it's a lot better living like this than it was living like that I help men and women move from that to this all day long that's what I do for living say more about the up and the down you've alluded to it already with the one up one down cycle but say a little bit more about that

[00:38:11] I suspect that resonates for people when it's described in some detail yeah the field of psychotherapy and self-help and all that for 15 years he's done a great job of figuring out how to hit people come up from the one down of shame Oprah Winfrey or all this stuff has been great in the trauma techniques in therapy we've done a terrible job of the other self-esteem disorder helping people come down from the one up of grandiosity and their flip sides of the same coin one down one up inferiority superiority and it's our grandiosity that gets us into so much trouble in our relationships shame is an implosion of grandiosity is acting out or some kind of explosion the great secret that I run around the country telling therapist is this shame feels bad grandiosity feels good that's the open secret it feels good to get drunk it feels good to get it feels good to make out with your secretary it feels good to tell your boss to shove his job in the mall that you're being grandiose it's like an intoxicant it feels good so you have to think your way down from grandiosity it takes a smarter person and you think you're wait now you come down from grandiosity even though it feels good because it's in your interest to come down from our men more susceptible to grandiosity than women well men's grandiosity in this culture tends to be more overt men tend to lead from the one up grandiose position and have covert shame 10 to the tons of exception whereas women tend to lead more from the victim one down position and have covered issues of grandiosity so we're complements for each other yeah let's go over that a little bit more because in the book I don't want to talk about it you talked a lot about overt and covert depression and it's the opposite of that as you said the on average for what it's worth men tend to be more covert in their depression women more overt we explain that distinction well when I first wrote I don't want to talk about it depression we're seen as a woman's disease this was the first book that had ever been written about male depression nobody said that phrase what layer was the first edition of that early 90s late 1997-98 and the idea was that women were two to four times more prone to depression than men the subtitle of my book I don't want to talk about is the hidden epidemic of depression in men and it's hidden for two reasons the first is the men are shamed of it it's not unwillingly to be depressed it is unmanly to be overwhelmed by feelings and vulnerable so women face the Sigma of a mental disorder but men feel that very personally it feels like they're unmanned by this disorder and they're ashamed of it and they hide it and the people around them will often collude with their idea family physicians for the first line of defense and depression and 70% of them do not diagnose a patient with depression the studies indicate and I believe it's because we're afraid to unmask that poor man and further shame him wives are like that kids are like that are big is very protective some men do such a good job of hiding the depression that they hide it from themselves and this is what I call covert depression and what you see is not the depression so much but the defense's the man who directed to defend against the depression and you see acting out you see sexual act yeah you see porn addiction you see self medication you see anger you see a sudden isolation and withdrawal I talked about the unholy triad of covert depression radical isolation anger and acting out sexual acting out and of course the self medication includes drinking and drugging if you look at women and men look at what I now call over depression it's like two to four times more women than men if you add into the grid domestic violence and alcoholism and drugs it comes right back up to evil and we know things like for example in areas where men lose their job there's a dramatic rise in domestic violence and the missing billiard ball in the middle between those two points is depression low self-esteem and what happens to man with covert depression is what I've been talking about all evening which is the 12 literation of shame into grandiosity of helpless listen to righteousness victimhood into attack and that translation of shame into grandiosity helplessness into attack is a central motif of traditional American masculinity look at all the adventure of movies I wrote about this and I don't want to talk about it

[00:43:34] Rambo these guys are innocent guys who were pressed to the wall by bad guys and then finally got halfway through the movie they pick up an Uzi and start blowing people away and we cheer we cheer the roof from shame the grandiosity feels like the swell of empowerment and we get drunk on it but in silent it's emotionally violent its violent to the person your grandiose - and it does violence to your own soul and this comes back to the sort of patriarchal society which places a value on that strength I mean what do you think biologically or socially accounts for that distinction we could wrestle around this one for a long line most of the people in my field are not saying is it biological or is it cultural and social that's not the question for almost anybody anywhere the question now is how do they interact because it's both that's both of course it's both but just because something is biological doesn't mean necessarily mean that we should cede to it aggression is biological for he said the first man to hurl an epithet instead of a rock was the creator of civilization we have all sorts of impulses that are bio high school but that doesn't necessarily mean we're supposed to go with them the thing between our raw biological impulses and our behavior is called civilization yeah you've talked a little bit about this idea in the past that you've written about it that the steps to sort of fixing this so if everything we've talked about is recognizing this how hard is that how long does it take for you with a patient I know you work a lot with couples do you work individually with men and women equally or disproportionately with one or the other now I work this proportionately with man

[00:45:33] I'll see no and again and but I do mostly cope you see and yeah I don't know somebody may correct me on this but what I do is I teach people how to live relational lives how to open their hearts and open their voices have a listen to respond without getting defensive in egotistical how to do this how dull their relationally is what we're born for us the only thing that really makes us happy and I do believe that the best way of teaching somebody how to live a relational life is to get their partner and maybe their kids in and work on the relationship rather than do it abstractly on the side do you find that most men need to be in crisis to hear what you're saying right now yeah I had a guy an older gentleman a very successful businessman and we started talking about men and grandiosity and he got very resonant with it and he came to me and he said I have a young colleague that I just I had brought on to our team and he's the most brilliant young man

[00:46:40] I've ever met but he's so narcissistic it's impossible to work what do I do and I sadly said to him I think he's too young I think that life hasn't roughed them up enough yet you have to start to get it that your old tracks are not working and for some men particularly if they're successful and wealthy they're shielded from those consequences but it's not it doesn't do them good yes you want a crisis look the so-called midlife crisis in men is this is my read on it the midlife crisis comes at whatever age when you've peaked when you're at the top of your game and you either feel that the masculine agenda is something that you have failed you have not caught the brass ring you're not rich enough you're not smart enough or you feel that the agendas failed you you have the brass ring I deal a lot with high rollers you have at the brass ring guess what you're as miserable as you were before so that's kind of a damned if you do damned if you don't realization that seems to suggest as you said once you reach a point at which either you've reached or achieved whatever success is supposed to be if you deem it to be

[00:47:56] Hollow you're hosed and if you haven't achieved it you're hosed because you're Willy Loman or your favorite example right right that's right you fail or the agenda fails you and that's a great opportunity I like crisis as a Family Therapist the other crisis of course for men is for women of our if they're gay their male partners I like to say that most of the men I treat or what I call wife mandated referrals [Music] they've been sent or their marriages in crisis or they've already separated from their wife of 30 years and they're all wrecked but there's some sort of crisis in their relationships as driving them deeper in your book you certainly most of the case studies fit that description right I'm trying to remember is there an example of a man in the book who just showed up on his own doing sort of self exploration and introspection yeah there are a few there are a few and I love them dearly there was a young fella Kurt who came from the Midwest he was a farmer's son he came to me because he couldn't get girls he couldn't get past the first date this is deconstructing patriarchy so I said well what do you do because he was a good-looking guy and he was intelligent he said well I just I tell them that I do this and I do that and I'm capable of this and I've won that award and except we never what are you doing that's not a date that's a resume and he said to me I just figure I've only got one shot so I better make it good it's funny but it's sad well it's patriarchy men are taught that just being who you are is not enough that you have to earn connection through achievement and turn your back on relationship I call this the Icarus syndrome you have to leave hearth and home go fly into the Sun to be worthy of guess what hearth and home you're the one that left to begin with they're waiting for you this happens all the time guys go off and work a hundred hours a week to be worthy of the whites and kids who just want them to come home already where does that come from where is that drive coming from where this inferiority coming from visit all stem from this shame that you've talked about the seeds of which are sown in little boys yes we're taught to supplement the lack of inside out healthy self-esteem with outside in false self-esteem and there's three this is Pia there's three there's performance-based this team I have worse because of what I can do and that's a big ones for men there's other based esteem I have worse because you think I do and of course push to extreme best love addiction and that's big for women and then you have I have worth because of what I have I have big muscles I have a beautiful life I am in Boston I have a kid in Harvard that's the be-all and end-all attribute-based esteem is what our culture runs our if everybody woke up tomorrow with healthy self-esteem and full recovery our economy would collapse the whole advertising industry is built on use this deodorant be a special person what was the first one the second one was other based the third one was attribute based what was the first one interesting he forgot a performance based I have worked because of what I can do ok I get funny guy it's ironic that I forget that well while we're on the topic of deconstructing people like me let's talk about narcissism a little bit you've already alluded to the Greek gods you write very eloquently about this yeah thank you narcissism is largely misunderstood narcissism is not a disorder of too much self-love but too little narcissus is an addict if you remember the myth he pisses off I forget who you know I think it doesn't fall for any of her nymphs and she curses him and says you're gonna fall in love with the first next thing you see widely cursed the next thing he sees is he bends over well to get some water is the image of himself he is rooted from that moment to the well bent over endlessly sighing as he tries to grasp the beautiful creature in the well and every time he tries to touch it it dissolves the great thing about narcissus is if narcissus had self-love he could leave the well he's rooted to the well because he's addicted to his image not the internal self but the image to construct itself that comes when you have no internal self that's what he's addicted to and he dies he dies from that well he starves to death an echo beautiful echo is a place next to him this is to me the essence of heterosexual relationships traditionally our sisters has been over as well and echo has been over narcissism and our sisters has no motility and echo has no voice and narcissus endlessly signs at his own beautiful reflection and echo endlessly repeats those eyes as she sighs for him there we are is there any benefit in narcissism is it always pathologic no there's healthy we talk about healthy narcissism healthy entitlement that's good does your healthy entitlement get strained through patriarchy it goes back to what the great anthropologist we am I store speaks of is the difference between power over and power with is your narcissism about agency and assertiveness and power with fine is your narcissism about superiority and contempt not so these concepts they resonate I think you and I we've spoken about David Foster Wallace I'm such a fan of the commencement speech he delivered 2005 at Kenyon College this is water and so much of what he's talking about is this sort of grandiosity one up ship that he describes as being the root of so much misery and that's the interesting side of it isn't it right which is in the short run that grandiosity is an amazing anesthetic but it it has a very bitter aftertaste well it's like drinking three martinis he really would have been better with just one and that third one makes you feel better in the moment but oh boy do you pay for it this is how I describe it to my usually my guys into audience oohs bear with me I'll be Andrew a little bit so Boston I'm convinced and I think statistically as the worst drivers in the United States I come from New Jersey

[00:55:15] I've lived for 10 years in New York in New York or Jersey somebody will cut you off because they're kind of a pig and they'll speed up and keep going in Boston somebody will cut you off and then they'll drop down to 20 miles an hour because they're passive-aggressive and they'll just stick their Fanny in your face and make you sit there all right so I got one of these guys pulls that move on me pulls out an enemy and then slows down I'm looking through the windscreen at that little head in front of me and I'm doing that Star Wars laser beam thing you know I'm like like exploding that family and I'm way into grandiosity I mean this guy is the this guy is a this guy is whatever they're barely deserves to breathe in a former day I would have pulled up rolled down my window and let him have it now as I'm looking at that fat little head for the windscreen I start breathing myself down from my anger from my indignation from my superiority from my contempt and I say to myself as I look at that head this isn't for you this is for me you may deserve to have somebody pull next to you and blow you away but I deserve to not be that person and here's what I say hey Peter I grew up in a contempt drenched family i internalized that contempt and it became depression I've wrestled with for 40 years I played out that can and I did damage to a lot of nice relationships that way you know what fat little head not today not today I've had enough contempt in my life I can do without it so that's an interesting take that's the take that is coming out in a very self-interested way which is just from a pure self-preservation standpoint there is no upside to you being upset about this and to just preserve your own sanity you're saying look assume the worst about this person which is to say they've done this deliberately or they've somehow done this to spite me and it's all about me even if that were true I'm not going to give in to it now the flip side to that the thing that as you know I work on and I'm I think I'm batting 50% at this now I'm batting 500 to use baseball terms which is a hell of a lot better than what I used to bat which was zero just straight up zero is

[00:57:46] I go through that sort of Foster Wallace narrative of I don't know the story of what's going on I don't know that maybe that person that's as fast as they're able to drive maybe there's something else going on in that person's life maybe that person's wife just left them today or maybe that person lost their kid and they're so distracted they can't driving around or something as mundane as that it's so trivial and actually share with you an interesting story because I had a pretty interesting example of this a couple of months ago I don't think I told you this story but we have this thing it's a grocery delivery service I'm blanking on the name of it but it's like instacart something like that it's awesome you've literally on your phone pick up what the groceries are going to be in the groceries show up this is a bit of an embarrassing story so bear with me it's embarrassing in the sense that as I tell it it highlights what a sort of grandiose prick I can be so it's four o'clock and I pull out the instacart and it says you know it'll be here in 90 minutes and I think that's perfect because it'll be here at 5:30 that's a Saturday I got to make dinner and it's got to be ready by 6:00 so it's perfectly timed and to make a very long story short at every step of the way

[00:58:59] Terry this thing just keeps dragging it out sorry it's gonna be 15 minutes late the store is crowded sorry it's gonna be another 20 minutes late the store is really crowded sorry to do to do to do to do to do and I'm too stupid to put the phone down and go and do something else and I'm not making this up I wish I was making this up

[00:59:21] I actually pace around the kitchen for about an hour just waiting for the updates because now I realize I've lost my window to go and work out which was I was what I was planning to do or something else and so it's now seven o'clock it's a full three hours late so I've blown my window to make dinner I sort of feel like I screwed up and you know whatever whatever and if I get one more text message from this thing giving me one more dumb excuse like I'm gonna lose my mind and my wife who is now sort of hovering around me has a real practical concern which is this person is going to come to the door and get blasted by me being the idiot that I am and sure enough the doorbell rings and I beeline to the door with every intention of obliterating this person I have no idea what I'm actually going to say by the way it's like I've rehearsed what

[01:00:23] I'm gonna say but it's how does it take you yeah I know what I'm capable of let's put that way and Jill is on my heels basically thinking to herself how am I going to mitigate this damage because this person even though they're an hour and a half late does not deserve what's about to come and I open the door and it's this overweight woman who's sweating profusely and she's got the three five whatever bags of groceries on the ground and she says I'm sorry I'm late it was really crowded and I broke the eggs and I'm not kidding Terry I almost started crying and I thought my god you how could you have almost torn into this person I don't know how to describe it

[01:01:19] I just in that moment I couldn't get out of my own way I invited her in I said oh don't worry about the eggs I think I ordered them by accident I don't even want eggs we don't eat eggs I hate eggs come on in dude would you like a drink I mean I practically invited her to stay for dinner in that moment because I felt so bad about how I had been thinking about her now to this day I don't know what changed in me and how I got lucky in that moment but I thought to myself if I could reproduce this at every moment of my life I would be a happy man I wouldn't be the piece of that I'm probably hardwired to be hardly soft wired to be you're not a piece of you're just like the rest of us listen that's a beautiful story Peter and what you had was a moment of empathy of compassion of humanity that's like what

[01:02:13] I teach sex addicts who stare at women to remind themselves this is somebody's daughter somebody's mother this is somebody's sister there's not a porn queen or blow-up doll is the person and that's what you did you got past your entitled indignation the thing about it is it's case in point of what I've been talking about you felt helpless you wanted the goddamn food and it was not going to get there and so it was ready to get there and you had nothing to say about it the more helpless you felt the more angry you got that's how it works the helplessness is one down and shame the anger is grandiosity and righteousness and like a lot of men the longer that food took the more helpless you got the more hangry you got that's the formula when you describe it that way it seems so obvious and so predictable does the knowledge of that in any way help us I think it does I think it does it's funny just before I started this I would spend all day with a couple and she was about to leave him after 20 five years of marriage both in there 71 derful time except once or twice a day he'll scream at her or he'll yell with utter Andorians and contend what I got he was raised by two alcoholics his father would talk to his mother this way all day long it was a terrible terrible childhood growing up and I told him that he had adult child of alcoholics stamped on his forehead and that the issue when you grow up with alcoholics is trust why would you trust what was the intimacy ever done for you and I know this from my own dysfunctional family and what happens to him is he described that he was waiting for her and they were late to get to somewhere and he got annoyed with her and if she were responsible and if she were competent then and if she loved him and she wouldn't be dragging her feet like that well we get to the details without rolling parents and guess what they're not responsible or competent but can I pause for a second and ask you a question Terry well when you're doing that type of work with a couple in that situation does he actually believe that or is that a subconscious thing that you have to extract that is part of the template of his belief system wait does he actually believe that his wife is incompetent and irresponsible yes yes he actually believes that but he hired her because she is a little dizzy we always marry her unfinished business so he gets triggered that's not the issue we all trigger each other we all pick people who will trigger us that's all other conversation I call that the mysticism of marriage that's not the point the point is what happens then and what happened then to him is he would move into control now listen what I said is I'll bet every time you get angry is the moment when you feel you're dependent on her and she's not coming through for you because you're anti dependent and the more dependent on her and the more she doesn't come through for you the more helpless you feel and the angrier you feel and then it all comes out and he got it he got it and he started to cry and I said listen I have a move I have way out I have a move you can make next time you feel that rush of annoyance you memorize and he is he's going to repeat this ten times a day to himself when I'm annoyed it means that I'm dependent and I don't like it or trust it that's what this means I'm feeling helpless and I want you to go to your wife and say one word to her vulnerable and honey you've you're vulnerable you stop on a dime and you go give your husband up because he just did a good piece of work and she said fine and he said fine I honestly believe that after this day with me he's not going to yell at her anymore and if he does if he slipped she can touch him on the shoulder and remind him vulnerable oh yeah vulnerable that's leading a couple out of patriarchy we talked about relational living you once explained to me something you used

[01:06:41] Dickens as a way to describe it which is the sort of the ghost of Christmas future that the ghost of Christmas past in the ghost of Christmas present and you did it in that order do you remember this discussion oh yeah did what I tell my therapist my students this is the best rendition of the work that I've created I call it relational life therapy for obvious reasons I guess the essence of that rhythm well let me just say it this way let me do it straight for us relational therapy as I've created it has three phases the first is loving confrontation this is what you're doing

[01:07:19] Peter to blow your foot off take a look at it and feel bad about it you've been on cruise control wake up the second phase of family of origin work where did you learn this where did you learn this product who did you see do it or who did it to you or who did you do it to and nobody stopped you and corrected where did this come from and

[01:07:39] I'll do trauma work deep family of origin inner child work in presence of the other partner sitting there that's the second phase and then the third phase is teaching this is how you do it right there's how you stand up for yourself in a loving voice about a large pond this is how you listen to your partner's complaint and don't get defensive but enter into their experience would be compassionate like you did with that woman these are skills so the third phase is skill so good to go back to

[01:08:09] Dickens I said the best rendition of our LT relational line therapy is a Christmas story you've got screwed she was anti relational and self-medicating with after we based the theme and won money has the more self-esteem you feel via and he's visited by three ghosts I don't know Dickens order but I'll do it mine the first is the ghost of Christmas future and he takes Scrooge to his own funeral and everybody's delighted that he's dead that's the negative consequence that's the confrontation then he goes back into his past and he had a miserable childhood a minimal sad jobs that goes back to the family of origin and where all this comes from and then he goes to Bob Cratchit's house

[01:08:56] Tiny Tim where he sees what a functional family looks like and he learns what connection looks like then he goes buys a whole bunch of turkeys and he's a transformed human being what is the transformation he's relational he's in connection it seems that that order is necessary it doesn't always occur in that order but it goes back to sort of a question I asked you earlier which was how do you get somebody to do this if they're not in crisis and my own personal experience and that of the people that I've known is everything you're talking about Terry is really hard it's harder than anything

[01:09:35] I've ever described or tried to do if you said to me Peter just go run a marathon I'd be like okay I know how to do that you put one foot in front of the other and you just keep doing it until you're done and you'll get blisters and it won't matter but at least for me the type of work that you describe is so challenging that the activation energy to get there the barrier to overcome that you have to be an incredible pain you have to be incredibly miserable incredibly depressed incredibly angry or see incredible pain in others that you've caused

[01:10:10] I mean it's some combination of these things and and that's why I do like the way that that story the way you tell that story but I mean let me tell you another story which I think illustrates the work and sort of Dickens in the flesh man can I tell you a story of Harry absolutely so Harry comes to me as marriage is in crisis you're absolutely right about that his wife is about to leave him I see because lemons a couple and if the typical he said she said the couple never presents with a presenting problem they're always - his and hers or isn't his person earth anyway his problem with her was that she was a dis quote unquote okay and her problem with him was that he was brutal quote unquote okay Harry give me some examples of surely being a death well she's often ten fifteen sometimes even 20 minutes late she never apologizes senators score for five things she'll come back before and she just did okay surely tell me about Harry's being a brew well in just the last two weeks he called me the c-word he stood in the doorway and physically barred me from leaving and he spit on my windshield this temperatures going I got a Harry I say to him I picked the most egregious water say you spit on her windshield well yeah first of all let me pause and say in the work that I do I take sides we're taught as couples therapist to never take sides and always be even this is a problem this is not

[01:11:51] Shirley's problem it's a hairy we name names and we tell it like it is and this work anyway Harry you spit on her windshield oh yeah well yeah but you should have heard what she was saying you don't expect me to take that kind of bull just so I look at him for a little bit bee bee bee bee and I say that I'm Harry

[01:12:14] I don't know I barely know you but it occurs to me you don't know the difference between standing up for yourself and attacking somebody that stopped him a little bit now listen where did you get this from who was the angry person and your family growing up he says my father said tell me about it he was he was horrible he would come home and man you scattered you get in his way you wish you had in fact my mother was never around she worked three jobs so she was nobody to count on I took care of my little sister what did you do I protected her I kept her out of my father's way I locked her in the basement he said not only get me wrong this is a finished basement with

[01:12:57] TVs and videos and coloring books and all that but I would lock the door so dad couldn't get her I said how old was she three how old were you five she was story I said I don't know Harry I wasn't there but pardon my french but I imagine there was some five-year-old version of looking at your father and saying yourself something like you lay a hand on my sister and I'll kill you he said yeah yeah that's exactly right that's exactly what it was I said

[01:13:31] Harry how did I know that said okay I'll buy how did you know that I said because you defend yourself like an angry five-year-old will you let me teach you how to do this in a more civilized way and he looked at me this is not a sensitive to age guy he looked at me he said I think you better and we did that's how this works so in that situation I'm amazed by at least one element of that which is maybe you just glossed over it but what was the pain point that got him to so easily be willing to put I mean I'm gonna come back to the language of wounded children and adaptive children and maladaptive adults but in that parlance you very quickly got him to at least agree to put the adoptive child in another chair and I will come back to that in her child stuff because I really want to dig on it but I mean is that normal that in such a short period of time you can you can get in particular an angry man to accept the error of his ways yes I call it breaking up the clan you wake him up and it's that in part just because you took sides named names and didn't mess around yes large part I run around the country

[01:14:55] Peter telling its therapist that there's some serious design flaws in therapy and the biggest design flaw is that we're all taught to be terminally nice to our clients and people don't tell the truth I tell the therapist when you tell each other at the watercooler after the session I can't believe what a you up I can't believe what a milquetoast this guy that's what you should be saying in the session find a responsible way to say it there because that's the damn issue but we therapists are taught to hold back and I think it's a great great to service to everyone so let's go back to Harry so you've got a pretty quick pass on the ghost of Christmas future you talk straight to him some people certainly me need a lot more than that

[01:15:44] I needed to literally go to some funerals before I could get my head out of my ass and then you go back and you do the family of origin and the trauma work you posed a series of questions can you repeat them yeah who did this to you or who did you see do it or who did you do it to and no one stopped you and basically I mean I've thought about this so much Terry it's hard for me to come up with too many examples of behaviors that don't have at least one of those three types of mirroring this is how this stuff gets transmitted from one generation to the next this is exactly how it's done so Harry was I mean that's just an awful example of how wounded he was as a kid fortunately most kids don't need to go through something that extreme how did

[01:16:40] Harry respond to that how would you take use this language now of what was his adaptation to that and then what's that little adaptation serving him today well I have a saying adaptive then maladaptive now I mean I always teach my students to have great respect for that adaptive child part of the person the adaptive child part of you when people do trauma work we always think of the young wounded child and one that was on the receiving end of the abuse or neglect but between that child and the functional adult there stands an older child part of us older children but I can collaborate them and that's how you adapted so for example I have an intrusive mother today okay my adaptation is I defend myself from her intrusion by coming behind thick walls I erect sick walls interestingly not all that unlike my father's and when he deals with my mother I marry a woman who of course is highly emotional just like my mother and when she gets highly emotional with me guess what you think I do I put up wall so she's my intrusive mother I'm that little boy and I'm using the same adaptation that I used when I was four now at 45 it was exactly what I needed to do it for is getting me into a world of trouble at 45 when we do that in her child work I think that what you just said is an important part of it that sometimes maybe if you're on the outside you miss this distinction which is sort of one of the first things you do is you thank the adaptive child right yes you saved my ass I have an exercise and your listeners can do this exercise if they want when I do a workshop I do a two-day workshop for the general public on basic skills and I give people homework assignment on the first day and now I'm giving away my my secrets here but this is what I tell you to do and everybody does it

[01:18:47] I want you to take at least an hour on them I want you to write a letter to your adoptive child dear little Peter dear PD or whatever you call them first I want to thank you you really saved my ass you protected my autonomy you preserve me from you taught me this you kid okay this is what you did for me thank you this is what you gave to me you gave me Drive gave me intelligence who gave me discernment you gave me ambition who gave me goals there's what you cost me you cost me me you're constantly connection it cost me above you cost me being honest with myself you cost me getting comfort from anybody else and then the last one I'm here now the adult the inner adult and I can take care of both of us and from now on what that's going to look like is and then you find it love Peter that's the assignment this type of work is very emotional yeah does one heal enough from sort of inflicted wounds to ever does the adaptive child ever vanish no it never vanishes and we're always we often mistake our adaptive child for Anna functional adult but let me just say the functional adult has nuance the functional adult is forgiving the functional adult is warm and supple the adapt that job is rigid and harsh and black and white it's a kid's version of a grown-up anyway no they're always with us I don't believe that some trauma people say they're gone forever but I think we contend with these little parts of us the difference is as you move into deeper and deeper recovery the baseline is not this little boy the baseline of my adult and the little boy takes over episodically and as your recovery work deepens less frequently and you catch it earlier and you bring yourself down from that one up or up from that one down so that the net-net is you're spending it was that house was the island and peaks of grandiosity and Shane for example where the norm and over time as you tamed those Peaks and spend more time in house that becomes your life and up and down become episodes so - with fighting in the couple so - with any of it you start off all over the place and then you know what it's like it's like a physical training it's like core work this is core work and the stronger your core the more you spend your time and health and the more ill health becomes the exception that's how it works I mean this might be kind of a dumb question but how long do you think it really takes to go from a state of pathology so you're a person who is really quite dysfunctional you've really reached a nadir in terms of your misery and the misery you inflict on others but you've gone through the first two stages meaning you've confronted what the world in your continued state is going to look like and you've gone back and looked at the family of origin you've gone through the inner child work as appropriate hour as necessary and you're now at the teaching skill development stage which strikes me as the most difficult stage and the one that takes the longest is this is this a journey of years yes but it doesn't mean you have to be in therapy for year look it's like once we get to the skill phase its mastering what I call the relational technology it's a technology and it's like any adult mastering a new skill set it's like learning the skiing or forties or learning to play the piano or learning how to speak French and it takes about the same amount of time if your assiduous that it takes about three to five years do you don't need to be in therapy all that time but it takes about three to five years of practice until you're really pretty fluent I remember we had an interview once and I said that relationality was my second language my first language is selfishness which is true they thought it was great but I feel pretty fluent in relation now and they have lived in the world of relationality for decades and I speak it pretty well is it my native language deeply deeply deeply but in terms of what hits the surface it's my second language but it's the country on it that's actually a really great analogy because I think most people who have tried to learn another language can appreciate that it's doable it's not just something you can decide you want to do without practicing it it's one thing to say oh god I'm going to Italy this summer I can't wait to learn

[01:23:57] Italian oh great did you hire an Italian teacher no oh did you download one of those Italian teaching apps no did you buy a book about it now well exactly how do you hope to learn Italian I mean there's truth by fire you could just simply go to Italy immerse yourself in it and not allow yourself to speak

[01:24:15] English and eventually I suppose you'll learn Italian but for most people a little bit of structure can help that but you'll probably never speak it without an accent and that doesn't mean you're not functional but yeah I think that analogy is a great one so let me say it takes about three to five years before you're really pretty comfortable speaking this new language of relationality having said that this way of thinking ecologically instead of linearly you're in the system you're not above the system you want power with not power over these ways of hamming yourself are so different from the defaults that you were raised with in the culture at large and they work so that's better that doing them poorly will transform your life and your relationship and you can start doing them poorly right away that is probably again there's probably an analogy there within language which is if you even spent a couple of months practicing a language you could certainly get to the point where the people in the restaurants and the taxis would appreciate your efforts and make every effort to help you yeah I think that's right and you know what in terms of how long it takes it's really simple it depends on the sincerity the person on that blown away by diagnosis I'm not blown away by character disorders we can look I had a couple they would be called in psychiatry borderline personality disorders bad people tough tough people I mean yelling screaming throwing things he goes to the hotel she goes after him she's banging on the door she's dragged off by the police this is true this actually happened but here's the thing she got pregnant and she was determined that she was not gonna do to her kid what was done to her and he came on board and with my help these people cleaned up in about six months I've dealt with neurotics who have attitude and I can't get to them for two years these people were different people within a matter of months she went on and became a therapist and she studied she's now a relational life therapist and a good one so I don't care how far back you are I just want to know if you have heart do you ever find in couples therapy that you have to recommend to the couple a separation or just a divorce where you realize one person is really in this to change and the other is not is that usually what a breaking point comes down to well it depends on what change we're talking about I mean that's one person this wants to be neater and the other one doesn't that survivable if one person wants to be monogamous I think it doesn't that's more of a serious problem it depends on what's going on but there are some deal-breakers I wrote a piece you can get it off my web site which I would love people to come and check out yeah your website is your name it is it

[01:27:14] Terry or Terrence as the website te r ry r l just google me and I'll take you there yeah we were that you said you wrote an article oh yeah called growing to know where you can get it off my website about is for couples therapist but it's about when to break somebody up and what we put ourselves through when we do that but their deal-breakers if somebody has a drinking or drug problem they don't do anything about if somebody doesn't want to be monogamous and the other one does here's an interesting one which i think is what you were talking about if there's a serious discrepancy in the level of maturity between the two people level of health if one of them gets healthy and the other one doesn't then eventually the pathology of the unhealthy one is too hard for the other one to stomach and they leave so their deal-breakers obviously violence is a deal breaker not every couple is safe and in terms of I often always recommend a physical separation if there's yelling and screaming of a house and their children in now I universally just tell the people about what's called witness abuse children are boundary-less they're wide open if your child is listening to you scream at your wife it goes into them as if you were screaming at them there's no different and so since you're screaming and yelling at each other and your children are there I give you 30 days to clean up I do this almost every time if you're still yelling and screaming each other 30 days from now one of you leaves which one should it be that's an interesting point you alluded to earlier which is up until a certain age a child is incapable of differentiating between being screamed at directly versus just being a bystander how long does that effect persist forever it persists as long as if it's exactly the same as if you were standing there and your parent was screaming at you it persisted so frankly until you do some trauma work and and metabolize it how long our kids susceptible to that what's the window in which obviously that I can see that being the case for a five-year-old is that the case for a 12 year old as well absolutely the case for a 12 year old that's really sobering especially for someone like me for whom anger such an easy default yeah that's right that's right you can go to my website I did a piece for 2020 with a raging woman and her there passive aggressive husband woman I said to her do you have pictures of your kids and she did they had beautiful golden-hued Latino kids they were gorgeous and I said this is what I want you to do before you rage at your husband I want you take the pictures out of your children now once you look at me eyes and I want you to say I know that what I'm about to do is going to cause you harm but right now my anger is more important to me than you are so screw you and I say shall we try that this is one TV you can feed and I put my arm around her and hold up the pictures right now I'm thinking about as she sobs and she puts down the pictures and she said I will never you know and my husband again and that was about 17 years ago and she has been true to her word they're divorced she got rid of them and whatever ones have but no more rage after that session people routinely there's the thing about three to five years of learning let me do the other side people would tell me sit on my couch swear off behavior they've engaged in their entire lives get up and it's gone permanently go on that's what happened today with this man he realized every time he was quote-unquote annoyed with his wife that the contempt coming out of him was ten times greater than what he experienced it being because he grew up with so much contempt he thinks it's just a love tap and she's flat on the floor and when he got it when he really got it he turned to her does it just happen before we started our call he turned to her with tears in his eyes and he said you are the most delicate precious thing in the world to me my in the world have I been punching him and he says never again never again never again

[01:31:52] Terry do you find that that type of transformation can also exist when there's an actual chemical addiction involved as well I mean you've sort of very loosely we sort of glossed over it quickly about the substance addiction sex addiction process addiction other sort of real number to stop gambling or stop a sex addiction or an alcohol addiction absolutely not they need treatment and they need probably intensive treatment but why is anger different I mean anger strikes me as very similar I mean dopamine producing it has all of the same you know grandiosity anger shame doesn't that have all of the same attributes as alcohol addiction yes and you know Peter

[01:32:43] I don't know the answer to this one because you're right there are many behaviors that will kick out endogenous chemicals that mimic the substances that you ingest and why didn't you have to go to a 12-step program for your anger I do send people to 12-step programs for their anger sometimes I don't know the answer to that what I look for with substance abuse is you wake up and you say okay I'll go to rehab you wake up and you go okay I'll go to 12-step I go to 90 days minded meeting so you get committed to recovery and that's the transformation but the recovery takes a long time in awhile so does the rest of it look I'm recounting these marvellous

[01:33:28] Laurence Ashton turnaround but let's be clear when I'm done with people I send them back for ongoing therapy ninety nine out of a hundred times yes you've made to turnaround now in order to keep it you're gonna have to have ongoing support for awhile the transformation needs to be digested and made real Terry you talked about at the outset that the whole reason you turned your life around got into therapy was to fix yourself and somehow reconcile your relationship with your dad how did that end sadly as well as can be expected on paying too little my dad died of ALS which is a great metaphor he lost his arms and his legs and finally his lungs and he died when he had a OS before he died he was paralyzed that my mama was a nurse was taking care of him I asked for his blessing and it was very funny because my mom was holding up the phone and he was going to give him rice washing and my mom dropped the phone my dad ii screaming at her

[01:34:38] Holly I can't believe it and then she starts yelling dad like guys guys guys can you stop guys oh yeah sorry can I have my blessing now okay okay that's my family anyway it's so sad and so funny Terry but my father gave me a beautiful blessing he said I remember this he said may nothing I've said were done in your life prevent you in any way from achieving your greatest potential and may your work with man be blessed and he was a stony yes maybe work with men be glassed that's a nice process and on his deathbed as I wrote about and I don't want to talk about it he looked at my brother and me and he said listen I'm really sorry and he apologized for the way he'd been with us and he said I got to tell you when you're looking at this the way I'm looking at this right now in this hospital bed it's only about love he said it's only about love everything else which is that's probably the last conversation they had

[01:35:52] I mean I don't think he could say it any better could you yeah no that's the bottom one well Terry I promised you we'd wrap this up at a certain time and we are to the minute at that time so I want to thank you very much for making the time especially on a short notice I've been wanting to have a discussion like this with you publicly almost from the day I read your book which was even before we started working together I want to just thank you for everything personally and otherwise thank you Peter I want to thank you for the service of this podcast as you do I want to acknowledge if I may that it's been very moving for me to watch you change in our work together and the changes as I'm sure you speak about at times have been truly transformational you are one of those people we've been talking about tonight and I'm very very proud of you if I can say that thank you very much thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription method and membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally kick has comprehensive podcast show notes that detail every topic pay per person thing we discuss on each episode the word on the street is nobody's show notes rival these monthly AMA episodes are asking me anything episodes hearing these episodes completely access to our private podcast feed that allows you to hear everything without having to listen to skills like this the qualies which are a super short podcast typically less than five minutes that we release every Tuesday through
