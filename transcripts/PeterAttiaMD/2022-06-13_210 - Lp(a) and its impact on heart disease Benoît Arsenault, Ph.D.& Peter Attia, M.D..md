Benoît Arsenault is a research scientist focused on understanding how lifestyle and genetic factors contribute to cardiovascular disease risk. In this episode, the discussion casts a spotlight on Lp(a)—the single most important genetically-inherited trait when it comes to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. Benoît explains the biology of Lp(a), how it’s inherited, the importance of measuring Lp(a) levels, and the diseases most associated with high Lp(a). He dives into data on the possible treatments for lowering Lp(a) such niacin, statins, and PCSK9 inhibitors, as well as the most exciting new potential therapeutic—antisense oligonucleotides.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast about Lp(a):

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features a detailed discussion between Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Benoît Arsenault about lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease that affects approximately 20% of the population. The conversation covers the history of Lp(a) research, its biological mechanisms, measurement challenges, and current therapeutic approaches. They discuss how Lp(a) is one of the most common hereditary drivers of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, yet remains underrecognized in clinical practice.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Lp(a) was discovered in 1963 by Kari Berg [00:15:30]
- About 20% of the population has elevated Lp(a) levels [00:10:15]
- Lp(a) levels are determined primarily by genetics and production rate [00:45:20]
- Elevated Lp(a) increases risk for:
  * Aortic valve stenosis
  * Myocardial infarction
  * Peripheral artery disease
  * Ischemic stroke
  * Chronic kidney disease [01:15:30]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Measure Lp(a) at least once in lifetime [00:55:20]
- Aggressive management of other cardiovascular risk factors if Lp(a) is elevated [01:20:15]
- Consider early screening of aortic valve function [01:45:30]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Statins don't effectively lower Lp(a) [00:35:20]
- PCSK9 inhibitors can lower Lp(a) by ~30% [01:25:30]
- Niacin is not recommended for Lp(a) management [01:30:15]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Lp(a) should be measured in nanomoles/liter when possible [00:25:30]
- Alternative measurement in mg/dL is acceptable [00:26:15]
- High Lp(a) typically considered >50 mg/dL or >125 nmol/L [00:28:30]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"Lp(a) is hands down the most common hereditary driver of ASCVD" [01:05:30]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What is the optimal age to begin Lp(a) screening?
- How will antisense oligonucleotides change Lp(a) management?
- What determines the variable expression of Lp(a)-related disease in different individuals?

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:09] hey benoit wonderful to uh to sit with you today and talk about a subject matter that you know honestly i think uh five certainly ten years ago nobody would have a clue what we were talking about and yet today we get so many requests to go back and revisit this subject matter so again delighted to have you here and um look forward to talking about something that you know probably impacts a lot more people than uh than than most white might appreciate so let's take a step back and give me a sense of where your interest in this little lipoprotein lp little a came from so first peter thank you so much for the wonderful invitation i'm really excited about our discussion today so um i got involved in lpa research actually during my uh post doc years i trained here at laval university in in quebec city did some work in the field of of lipids looking at ldl particle size uh triglycerides apob etc on cardiovascular outcomes so that was in 2006 to 2009 and that was really at a point where not that many people talked about lp literally because there had been so many negative studies on on lpa and the risk of cardiovascular disease like emis and stroke and so on and it's really the genetic association studies that have uh kind of resurrected the field of lpa and these were published in 2009 to 2011 and that was during the time i was a postdoc in amsterdam and uh i was working over there with uh with john castelline and he was working on the treating to new targets trial the tnt trial which is the the trial that one of the first trials that have that that that showed that if you uh reduce uh low density lipoprotein levels uh by increasing the statin dose you'll get an incremental benefit in in cardiovascular outcomes so we were working on a bunch of uh sub-analyses in the in that trial and they had just measured a whole panel of of emerging biomarkers that they thought was associated with that could be associated with cardiovascular events like like crp antiprobe enp other markers inflammatory markers other biomarkers of insulin sensitivity and lpa and it turned out that of a huge list of 18 biomarkers that they had measured in thousands of individuals lpa was actually the the strongest of them that that was predicting uh residual uh cardiovascular risk so that was uh i think the first paper i i published on on lpa in uh in those years and at the time we were also wondering if there was uh any genetic variants that could explain a statin response because uh statin work well in in most people but there's a huge inter-individual variability in terms of ldl lowering associated with statins so this is uh this came at a time where uh genome-wide association studies were increasingly used and they were used to also well they were first used to identify genetic variants associated with specific diseases but they were beginning to be used in pharmacogenetic studies so we were part of a big genetic consortium that was called the gist consortium so genomic investigation of statin therapy and it turned out from that big analysis that lpa was the most important genetic risk factor for that explain uh statin response so uh we've shown that if you have high lpa then your uh ldl would be uh wouldn't be lowered as much as if you didn't have a high lpa well we're going to talk about that in some detail because right now i think many people will not understand exactly why that's the case because they won't necessarily understand the relationship between ldl and lpa and why what you just described is completely intuitive today based on all the work that's been done in the last decade but let's take a step back into that epidemiology so that for the people who aren't familiar with lp little a we can give them a sense of why this is such an important topic so we'll start with um an observation right so we'll start with the epidemiology which is uh elevated levels of this particular lipoprotein which occur in about what fraction of the population so depending on uh ethnicity actually it can be very high as for instance in individuals of african ancestry who have the highest level and all the way down to uh chinese and japanese that probably have the lowest levels but we can say like in the ballpark that about 20 of the world population has an lpa level that puts them in a higher risk category so if we uh go go down in time uh lpa was discovered uh in 1963 by a swedish scientist called named carrie berg and he was one of the first to show in the late 70s and at the beginning of the 80s in different european cohorts that lpa was associated with uh with cardiovascular events and lpa uh has been measured uh was measured more probably more currently at that time in these big epidemiology uh studies uh the thing is however that the assays that they were using were probably not the best they were certainly not as good as as they are today there was a lot of variability uh and a lot of these studies published in the 90s and in the uh in the early 2000s came out negative so uh and that really uh was really tough uh for for the field because nobody talked about uh lpa at that moment tell people what you mean about the studies came out negative and what negative with respect to what hypothesis and why the the the hypothesis was that high lpa was associated with uh with cardiovascular events like uh myocardial infarction stroke etc so uh the hypothesis was that people with higher lpa levels uh were at the highest risk and it turned out not to be the case in many many uh of those studies uh and so we realized after afterwards that the assays that had been used were probably uh not very good so the assays really did not correctly identify people with uh with high lp little a and i think you know this has to be this has to be attributable to the the complex uh structure of of lipoprotein literally which has uh in in the lpa genes there's a copper a copy number uh variation uh and the antibodies that are used against that sometimes they can uh they can bind to different epitopes of of lpa and so now we have antibodies that are binding to lpa on other regions so we get a much better sense of the number of lpa particles in the in the bloodstream but back in the days uh these the assays that were used they were overestimating uh the uh isoform size that was bigger and they were underestimating the small lpa isoform size which is associated with uh with high lpa so a lot of research has uh has been done on that and now we have better assay we don't have uh we don't have like optimal assays now but uh these these problems most of these problems have been solved and and you you can really see in the literature the interest on on lpa that uh that actually match uh this uh this effect because the uh lpa gene was uh cloned in the eighties by the group of angelos cano escanu at the university of uh chicago and and you can see it if you just look at the pubmed search you would see like a straight line from the 70s to the mid 80s and when these studies came back negative you would see like the number of pubmed searches would go down and they came back up in 2009 and 2010 when genetic association studies uh were beginning to be published because the great thing about genetic studies is that you don't necessarily need to measure uh lipoprotein a level so you can look at genetic variants at common genetic variants that are associated with diseases and there were three big studies published in 2009 that have very convincingly shows that genetic variants associated with high lpa levels we're tracking with with cardiovascular events and now you can see the the pubmed searches on lpa going back up again and they haven't been as high as they are today yeah and we should make sure people understand some of the semantics so lpa is the gene that codes for april lipoprotein little a which then binds to an ldl and then turns an ldl from being just a garden variety ldl into an lp little a and i think once people understand that it becomes easier i think for us to communicate in this way so i'm going to restate that and i really want everyone to understand this so there's a gene lpa is the gene and this gene everybody has this gene but we have different variants of it and so a subset of the population and it varies considerably by ethnicity so african uh east asian also quite high down to caucasian and uh and and um as you mentioned chinese japanese etc so you're going to see different expressions of the apo lipoprotein little a this apolipoprotein little a which we'll talk a lot about and what it looks like and its structure and what its heterogeneity is all about but it wraps onto a low density lipoprotein and then it becomes kind of a supercharged load low density lipoprotein it becomes a particularly nefarious ldl and we're going to talk about all the reasons why it's not responsive to the same treatments etc so um would you add anything to that like i don't want to make it too complicated yet but i want to make sure everybody understands when we talk about the lpa gene which is identified during the gus experiments how the genotype allows us to not know everything about the phenotype but we can start to get into trying to impute causal relationships and eventually we're going to talk of course about mendelian randomization where we can go even deeper anything you want to add to sort of the basics of this no i think you've explained it perfectly peter maybe the only thing i would add is that part of the genetic heterogeneity among different people is the the apo lipoprotein a isoform size so uh people express uh different lpa isoforms some some are bigger than uh than the other and that that probably uh that well that actually plays an important part of the uh equation explaining why some people have a higher lp a little late than others i'm glad you reinforced that point because and this is going to get into a little bit of chemistry which i know some people will understand and some might not one of the big challenges here as you've now alluded to twice is the difficulty in measurement now when we look at something like apob and people who listen to this podcast a lot we'll be very familiar with apob we talk an awful lot about it one of the things we talk about is that by measuring the concentration of apob you can completely and accurately measure the concentration of the atherogenic particles the majority of which are ldl and the reason for that is twofold the first is that every ldl has one and only one apob 100 particle on it the second is that all apob's are the same size therefore they have a molar weight and by knowing the mass you know the number now there are i always like to point out two contrasts to this right the hdl particle by contrast has multiple apoas on it and this is totally different from apo little a so we're not going to talk about that other than to say it's apo big a and therefore you don't have a unique number and then of course with lp little a you have the problem that you raised which creates enormous challenges there is no molar weight for apo little a right this is this is the fundamental problem in the assay of trying to measure this thing exactly and uh we're really moving in the right direction in terms of getting the lpa measurement in uh nanomoles per per liter and uh there's there's more and more labs that are that are doing this and this is clearly the the way to go we have to move away from measurements in in milligrams per deciliter which is really influenced by the isoform size of lpa and the measurement in nanomolar will actually give you a much better sense of the number of lpa particles in the circulation and that's what we should be uh aiming at now will that require electrophoresis how will that actually be measured or will it use i mean it's going to be you measured through uh immunoturbidimetric assays so not by by nmr nmr can actually give you a a pretty good estimate of uh ldl particle number but you have to use antibodies to to to measure to measure lpa okay so we got a little in the weeds there i apologize we'll come back to that stuff later but let's pick it up back about a decade ago when the g was studies were able to uh distance themselves from the limitations of the assay and focus instead on the genotype and the heterogeneity of the genotype these g-was studies now found a much stronger association between the variance of this genotype that produced high copy numbers of apo little pro april lipoprotein little a and incipit cardiovascular events correct exactly so there were i think three studies that were all published in 2009 uh the first one was the one uh by robert clark from the uk they use the pro-cardis consortium which were if i recall well there were 3000 people with heart disease and 3000 controls and they've identified two snips in the lpa regions that are completely different uh from from one another from one another and they you really saw the the the dose response effect of these snips on lpa levels with a proportional uh effect on the risk of heart disease so it was like the kind of the first mendelian randomization uh study where um they they nicely showed that if you had one lpa raising allele you had higher lpa levels whereas if you had two or more lpa rising variants then you had even higher lpa levels and the risk was proportionally higher also worth explaining how important this type of analysis is because it really is the bridge between observational epidemiology and clinical trials and of course we're going to talk about clinical trials many of which are ongoing but the importance of what you just said benoit is the following there are a handful of assumptions that make this type of mendelian randomization essential one is the assumption that the sorting of these genes is random right so in other words you know we look at a population and we can say we can look at this as though nature did an experiment and it randomized the population to different copy numbers of these alleles that are going to produce different amounts of the protein but the second important piece of a mendelian randomization being able to link something causal is the assumption that the gene of interest is not doing something else that you're unaware of right in other words if the lpa gene was on the one hand responsible for making april like the protein little a which it is but on the other side it also changed your i'm making this up your susceptibility to secondhand smoke and people who had that gene would be debilitated by secondhand smoke people who didn't have that gene had complete immunity to secondhand smoke imagine such a gene existed well all of a sudden the mendelian randomization wouldn't be very helpful because those people who are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease from having more copies of lp little a you don't know if it's that or if it's the exposure or susceptibility to secondhand smoke so do you have a sense i mean i think in the case of lp little a it's pretty straightforward because it's a relatively simple gene but when that type of analysis was done was it relatively easy to demonstrate that that gene wasn't doing anything else uh both in its coding and non-coding regions yeah first let me say that i think that a lot of genesis would disagree that lpa is a relatively easy gene i mean there's like i think 2 000 different variants that are associated with lpa and you add in the isoform and each isoform has a specific sets of a specific set of different variants so so so that being said uh i think you you really nicely explained it and the the beauty of working with lpa but also with most proteins in the circulation is that you you're um you're looking at cis-acting snips so cis-acting means uh variants that are acting within the window of the gene that expressing their their protein as in opposition to like a transacting snip would be for instance a snip in the ctp gene for instance which we know might be associated with lpa but ctp does a lot of other things it regulates hdl cholesterol levels it regulates triglycerides so we don't use uh ctp genes when we do uh mendelian randomization on uh on on lpa and the the example that you that you mentioned you know uh a specific gene being associated with an intermediate phenotype that could on the other hand influence uh lpa would be reverse causality and uh in in in the case of lpa it's we're you know we're very very confident that that we're using the the correct uh genetic instruments to infer a causal relationship between lpa and a wide range of uh atrocious cardiovascular diseases so to put a bow on that we really have two independent types of analyses now that make it very clear that lp little a is playing a causal role in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease independent of ldl which you referred to earlier by commenting and using the term residual risk which i think people might not appreciate residual risk meaning what is the risk that remains in terms of ascvd in the presence of ldl lowering and of course lp little a would be one such example and those two pieces of information are now the regular observational epidemiology provided that the assays more accurately capture the measurement of lp little a and now these mendelian randomizations that effectively are nature's randomized experiments provided those two criteria we discussed can be met is that is that a fair synthesis of the state of the of the art today in terms of our understanding yes i think you can also add the third assumption which would be that the effect of the variance on the outcome so the effect of lpa variants on cardiovascular disease are explained by higher lpa levels and i think for lpa it's it's a fairly uh fair assumption to make okay so let's talk about how this is done clinically today um most i mean over the past decade i've seen three different types of commercial assays for measuring lp little a i don't believe two of them are in existence anymore one was the lp little a cholesterol content so i assume that this was an assay that was looking at the cholesterol content of the lp little a's which means the ldls that had apolipoprotein little a on them you just measure the cholesterol content so it was analogous to measuring ldl cholesterol but for this narrow subset is that essay still in existence uh well i think there are certain labs that that still use it but it's really not the way that the the field is moving to because the cholesterol and you can make the same uh the same argument for ldl the cholesterol within a certain lipoprotein does not necessarily tell you a lot of information about the number of particles that are in the bloodstream which is the most important thing if you to measure if you want to estimate risk so for for ldl apob there's some discordance uh but for lpa the discordance is even higher exactly so uh so so what you really want to do is uh try to find a lab that will give you an an lpa measurement in in nanomoles per liter right now there are some labs that have done that i i've seen a lot of those labs so one of them was called um god health diagnostics labs i think that was the name of the lab they no longer exist they did calculate an lp little a in nanomole per liter i don't know what their methodology was most labs are using milligrams per deciliter so they are simply telling you i say simply they are telling you the mass of lp little a now just to be clear are we in that assay looking at the mass of the entire lp little a are they just trying to estimate the mass of the apolipa protein little a's it's the mass of the particles so so it's a much better measurement than lpa cholesterol that you that you just referred to so uh and and we shouldn't you know let a good be the enemy of perfect here if you have an lpa measurement in milligrams per deciliter and it puts you in a high risk range so let's say you're you're it it gives you an lpa level of above 50 then the chances of the lpa assay that's that will give you a result in nanomoles per liter it will also give you a high a high level so if you have a an lpa measured in milligrams per deciliter you can obviously try to get a second measurement in in nanomoles per liter but you know if you have a healthy lpa in a high range both methods will give you uh the the the same information that you have an lpa in the in the higher range now you have to keep in mind though that if you have an lpa for instance of 50 milligrams per deciliter the measurement in nano moles per liter will be around 125 nanomoles per liter so some some people have measurements using both methods and they just say well for some reason my lpa doubled well that's not the case the lpa didn't double and it's remarkably stable uh over time so most guidelines will probably tell you just to measure lpa once in a lifetime and it's relatively relatively stable yeah i mean i think that's the take-home point here is unlike ldl and apob which are so modifiable and therefore it really matters that you know what you're measuring because you're going to be measuring it over and over and over and over again with lp little a at this point in time this is going to be changing but at this point in time it's basically something we measure to determine risk after which point we don't really need to measure it we've established risk and now we need to take measures elsewhere so let's now kind of talk a little bit about the biology of lp little a um we'll include figures in the show notes to the podcast so we'll we'll be able to show people exactly what this thing looks like and how it intersects with and binds to the ldl particle uh how it's distinct from the apob etc but let's talk a little bit about the production of this thing is it hepatically produced it's produced in the liver yes exactly so all the lipoprotein a particles originate from the apo lipoprotein little a that's pretty much only expressed in uh in the liver um so there's a there's it's not entirely clear in the literature how or or where specifically uh an apo lipoprotein literally will become an lp uh literally so where it will bind to uh to apob and ultimately and ldl particles there's multiple uh hypotheses that that have been uh that have been tested so some people say that the apolipoprotein literally which is like a a glycoprotein is secreted in the bloodstream and there it will bind to whichever ldl is closer to it to form lpa there's another hypothesis that suggests that it's probably at earlier after uh the secretion of of lpa so not entirely in the bloodstream but when it leaves hepatocyte in the space of this in the uh in the liver that the the binding of apo lipoprotein literally with uh with ldl but now i think we have very good evidence that to suggest that this happens uh within a liver cell the binding of apoa to april b to eventually form lpa there's so there's good evidence to suggest that as soon as the lpa the apoa is produced uh it can form an lpa when it meets uh with an april b particle and for whatever reason that just seems a bit more intuitively obvious given the mechanics of it right you're you're you're bringing so many ldls to the liver you're making apolipa protein little a in the liver it seems like a more obvious place for the marriage to occur than in the periphery but again it remains to be seen although seems like it's more likely that that is the case correct correct and the so the levels of lpa are determined by the levels of production of by the rate of production of lpa particle and little by uh by its catabolism we're still not entirely sure of how the catabolism of lpa occurs we we've it's probably by well most of it is by the liver there's a little bit by the a little bit of catabolism by the kidney as well uh but identifying like the receptor uh at the surface of hepatocyte that um that that will remove lpa from the bloodstream has been challenging so there's some evidence suggesting that uh the ldl receptor might be one of them there's some evidence for and against that uh and there's also the plasminogen uh receptor and i i i think we're going to eventually talk about uh the homology uh between april lipoprotein literally and and plasminogen so let's go back to this point which is that it's really the production of apolipoprotein little a that determines the concentration of lp little a and if that weren't the case it might be that by simply reducing the amount of targets for it i.e reducing the amount of ldl you might reduce the amount of lp little a but in fact that does not appear to be true with one notable exception that we will get to down the line in other words if you give somebody a statin which is a very potent drug to lower ldl the primary mechanism by which it does so is by increasing hepatic clearance of ldl so you have more and longer lasting ldl receptors on the liver and they're pulling those ldl out of circulation which is lowering the plasma concentration and yet that does nothing to offset the amount of lp little a which goes back to the explanation that started your journey here which was why is it that some people respond really well to statins and some don't and obviously it would be the higher your lp little a the worse your statin responds because there's a subset of your ldl that are not responding to the statin so maybe let's start by explaining how a statin takes an ldl out of circulation and why this doesn't work for an lp little a which is basically just an ldl with this one other little thing covalently bound to it exactly so the statins actually reduce ldl particles in the circulation by up regulating the ldl receptor at the surface of the hepatocytes so the density of the ldl receptor at the surface of the hepatocyte is super important the more ldl receptor you have the higher the catabolism of april b containing lipoproteins will be because apob binds to the to the ldl receptor so under the assumption that lpa is catabolized by the ldl receptor you would think that statins would actually reduce lpe levels whereas we we see that there's not really a lowering effect of statins on on lpa and there's even been more than one studies that have shown that if you put somebody on a statin you'll even have a small increase in uh in lpa levels now that shouldn't be a reason not to put someone on a statin of course because there there's been uh trials like uh the heart protection study uh that have shown that a treatment with statin is beneficial in patients with high lpa levels even maybe even more so than patients with low lpa levels so uh one should not like um don't prescribe a statin because you're afraid of a small lpa level it might be an interesting thing to do to measure lpa levels before and after the initiation of uh of a statin but overall we have so much experience with with statin that we know they work in the overwhelming majority of individuals and and especially even even better in patients with with high lpa yeah i mean one hypothesis for that might be that the statins are bringing a higher influx of ldl to the site of the production of the april lipoprotein little a and that might possibly be why you're seeing an increase in lp little a again that would be if that were true that would make it even more likely the scenario that that's the source of the the merger between april ipo protein the delay and ldl what's the approximate magnitude by which um ldl or apob let's be specific i guess because that's really the metric we care about what's the magnitude by which apob would go up in the presence of a statin for an lp little a pardon me let me restate that what's the magnitude by which lp little a would go up in the context of a statin uh well that depends on the study uh there's there's been a lot of studies that have shown that statins don't have an effect and most of the studies have shown like a 10 increment in in lpa levels so if you have low lpa levels at you know and you're treated with a statin you'll still remain with a low lpa level and if you have high lpa level then you'll obviously still remain with with a with a high lpa level although it's going to be uh a little bit higher so so it's important to uh to say that uh as as we you know move forward with uh lpa lowering drugs that that that aren't being tested on on top of statin therapy at the moment uh so we uh we have uh published a paper in patients with aortic valve stenosis at the astronomer trial where you can actually get a i think it was a 20 increment in in in lipoprotein literally so it might not be trivial so so the signal is is there but let me restate that uh the statins are are very effective in in patients with lpa even though there's a small increment of lpa yeah and an easy way to think about this would be if you give a statin and let's say in the most aggressive case the lp little a goes up by 10 but the apo b comes down by 60 percent you'd have to make the case that an lp little a is six times more atherogenic on a particle for particle basis for that to be an equi an equivalence maneuver so that begs the question what is it about lp little a that's so virulent what is it about lp little a that makes it i assume more atherogenic on a particle for particle basis than its garden-variety apob bearing cousin yeah there's no question about this peter i mean on a per-particle basis lpa is much more atrogenic than an equivalent ldl particles uh well first of all an lpa has an ldl particle on it so uh by definition it's you know as atherogenic just to start with um there's also evidence uh that lpa might uh influence the rates of thrombosis because lpa has a sequence homology with with plasminogen which plays a role in uh in clotting and has anti-fibrinolytic activity but uh the the i think the most important thing is the number of oxidized phospholipids that are transported by lipoprotein literally which is much higher than the amount of oxidized phospholipids that that you see on ldl particles and oxidized phospholipids have effects on a wide variety of cells endothelial cells smooth muscle cells macrophages cells of the aortic valve like valvular interstitial cells now they're sending in signals that will drive pro-inflammatory um maybe pro-trombotic and pro-calcifying signals to to these cells so that is probably the most important reason why on a per-particle basis lpa is more atherogenic than lpl than ldl sorry so let's talk about these oxidized phospholipids i think most people might not be familiar with what a phospholipid is um but before we do that let's explain to people what an ldl looks like physically in relation to an ldl so if an ldl is a largely spherical uh compound that has on its surface a single lipoprotein called apob 100 that wraps around it how does that now interact with the apo lipoprotein little a to become an lp little a okay so to answer this question i'm going to tell you a little bit about the structure of april lipoprotein literally and to explain that i'm going to talk about plasminogen for for a minute so plasminogen is a gene that's expressed on chromosome six it has uh five kringle repeats now a kringle is uh it's called a kringle because it resembles a danish pastry so it's a a little uh round of proteins and you have five of them that are uh one another in the protein now lpa is the gene right next to plasminogen on chromosome six and we have reasons to believe that along the lines of evolution it probably emerged from a duplication of the of the plasminogen uh gene um so lpa which would have been very important tens and hundreds of thousands of years ago because trauma was such a threat to our species much more than it is today and of course trauma carries with it in the short term an immediate risk of hemorrhagic shock blood loss ultimately septic shock probably would have killed just as many people from the infection but anything that would have reduced your risk of hemorrhagic shock would have been a generally positive thing up until 100 years ago or a couple hundred years ago so tell people exactly how plasminogen would have played a role in that and why this is something that if a duplication was created probably worked to an evolutionary advantage again until we lived long enough for it not to yeah there's uh there's a lot of hypotheses uh out there and the effect of lpa on wound healing is is certainly one of them and this is being studied er ex ex-vivo so that might be one of the reason why why we have high lpa levels in 20 of the population and why before that even there was the duplication of the um of the plasminogen gene now when we're talking about that duplication uh it's it's only the kringle 4 and kringle 5 that remain in the lpa gene and the kringle 4 is even separated in 10 different subunits so there's the kringle 4 type 1 all the way to the kringle 4 type 10. now the most important is probably the kringle 4 type 2 which is where the copy number variation is so you can have so one can have um one uh kringle 4 type 2 or only a couple and you can also have the way all up to 40 kringle 4 type 2 repeats so this is where when we talk about lpa isoform size it's due to variation in kringle 4 type 2. um so there's an other kringle repeats that are are parts that are uh important uh kringle 4 type 10 is probably the most important for the binding of oxidized phospholipid and to answer your question peter about the interaction between apo a and april b you have to look at the kringle 4 type 9 which contains cysteine residues which can be which are important to do a disulfide bridge with uh with april b so it's a a covalent uh bound that's happening because of the cysteine residual residues on kringle 4 type 9. so interesting sort of thought experiment if if and this is really the reason i'm asking this question is not just to be difficult it's to try to understand the pathophysiology of it better especially as it pertains to the oxidized phospholipid if you could create a drug that would cleave the does that disulfide bond so it couldn't it wouldn't lower apob and it wouldn't lower apolipoprotein little a it would just prevent their union and therefore it would eliminate lp little a but you still had a high concentration of april lipoprotein little a floating around by itself dragging with it oxidized phospholipids would you guess that it would still be problematic or would your guess be that no because it wouldn't be able to gain residence in the tissues such as the sub-endothelial space the interstitial space of the aortic valve all the places where it wreaks havoc yeah i'm only going to speculate here of course there's i don't think there's solid data on the low at the the the form of apo a that's not bound to two ldl particles um so so we know that uh apoa can still have oxidized phospholipids and we are not entirely sure how if you're talking about lpa how it it gets inside the cells if it gets inside the cells now we have some evidence and we've we've published that uh with a colleague of mine patrick matsuya here who's a who's a heart surgeon we've looked at the an lpa receptor in the valvular interstitial cell so these are the types of cells that are very abundant in the in the aortic valve and just to remind our audience lpa is also associated to a very significant extent to aortic valve stenosis and when i'm talking about lpa receptor i'm not talking about the receptor for lipoprotein literally i'm talking about the receptor for lysophosphatidic acid which is generated by uh by lpa by an enzyme called autotaxin which is actually carried by lpa in in the blood so on top of oxidized phospholipids apob ldl lpa has its specific proteome so it carries a lot of of different proteins that have different function that makes lpa even more atrogenic now these um oxidized phospholipid can have a signaling effect uh in the uh in the aortic valve and that might be totally uh independent from from from ldl so so we don't know i'm i'm only speculating here but there's some signaling effects of uh of oxidized phospholipids that i think are very important and they act they um they activate a lot of of different inflammatory processes uh and also uh osteoblastic uh processes because these types of uh valvular insert in interstitial cells are becoming like uh osteoblasts which are the cell types that that that make bones so it makes a lot of sense you know when you're talking about uh aortic valve calcification that there's uh a bone-like uh process that's that's happening within this tissue yeah for all of our patients that have elevated lp little a one of the first tests we do is get a baseline uh look at their aortic valve so typically we'll do it with an echocardiogram if we can get a good enough view if not we'll use a cardiac mri but it's for exactly this reason what's the approximate hazard ratio how much does risk go up for aortic stenosis in an individual with elevated lp little a and how much does it depend on whether or not they have a normal aortic valve to begin with which has three leaflets a so-called tricuspid valve versus if they have a relatively common anatomic variant with only two leaflets which is called a bicuspid valve which even outside of lp little a would increase your risk for stenosis exactly so there's not really good evidence showing that lpa is associated with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis because we we're studying genes that that are associated with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis and we don't see really an effect of of lpa there now that being said it might accelerate the uh the formation of aortic stenosis in patients with bicuspid aortic valves who are already at risk exactly so uh so lpa is probably an initiator of uh aortic valve stenosis and we've known that uh since 2013 when uh george chana sulis and and when the post uh they they published this genome-wide association studies of aortic valve calcification in the in the charge consortium and they've shown that lpa the with that one variant associated with high lpa level was the most important variant associated with aortic valve disease now we had known for a few years that lpa was present in the valve and in the valve it actually co-localizes with oxidized phospholipids so so we we we knew this but uh that that study was really uh i think a game changer for uh our understanding of of aortic valve stenosis now when we're looking at the effect of high lpa on aortic valve stenosis it really depends on the level of lpa so if you're looking at patients that have high-ish lpa levels such as uh well let's say 50 milligrams per deciliter or 125 nanomolar their risk can be increased by uh 50 percent uh to maybe a hundred percent or or double but when you're you're going into and you look at patients that have very high lpa uh the risk can can increase quite uh quite substantially so if you have patients with with a very high lpa level then what you're doing looking at the uh at the aortic valve especially by by echo because it's probably the most uh widely available tool to uh to investigate this now in our in our lab we perform [Music] sodium fluoride pet ct so positron emission tomography coupled with computed tomography using a radio tracer that's called that that's called sodium fluoride and in patients that have high lpa levels but these were patients from the general population we can already see like a signal before the onset of aortic valve calcification uh using this uh this uh this radial tracer so this this really tells you that there's an effect of lpa on the initiation uh of the of the process of aortic valves and what is so you're seeing before any gradient appears before any flow-related metric you're seeing a metabolic change at the valve yeah exactly so the the sodium fluoride will actually bind to a chemical called hydroxy apatite which is uh literally the a complex of calcium and phosphorus which will eventually be involved in the pathophysiology of of aortic valve stenosis and we see that process happening very early at the earliest stage of the of the disease and we also see an effect of lpa on the later stage of the disease so the the data that's available so far that have looked at the progression rates of aortic valve stenosis has shown that patients with high lpa might even progress more rapidly than patients with uh who have uh who have low lpa especially within in younger patients uh that have uh that have a high lpa because when you're looking at patients you know that are above 75 or or 80 there's a lot of calcium that's already present in the valve and the mechanism might be very different in younger patient compared to uh to older patients when you're when we're investigating the progression of aortic valve stenosis yeah and if we're going to create a public service announcement here for primary care physicians it's so important to identify aortic stenosis in its earliest stages because the outcome data are quite clear that the earlier you intervene the better the outcome so you know i think 25 years ago we had a certain threshold in terms of uh surface area of the valve and gradient of pressure across the valve at which point you would you know replace the aortic valve if you look at literature today it seems that you're getting better and better outcomes when you proceed earlier and earlier before the heart is overly taxed based on that based on that pressure head that it faces and of course the increased risk of spontaneous cardiac death and other things that goes up with aortic stenosis so aortic stenosis is a very serious problem independent of ascbd atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease which is what most people think of when they think of lp little a assuming they know something about what we're talking about in terms of this molecule so um let's go back to another point you raised so you you and again i think when people look at the diagram this will be much easier we get into the anatomy of the fourth and fifth region of these kringle repeats and which of the subunits can create this vast heterogeneity why two people can have an lpa gene that over expresses lp well lpa through apolyp protein little a but they can have one of them can have a molar mass that's very high one can have a molar mass that's very low because of these number of kringle repeats what does the number of these repeats tell us about the pathophysiology of this uh well if you had asked me that question 10 years ago i would have said a lot but um our uh understanding of the pathophysiology of lpa is increasing every every week now basically so uh maybe 10 years ago there was this debate about lpa as to whether or not it was the l the lpa concentration that matter or if lpa concentration didn't matter at all because it's the uh apoa isoform size that that matter small isoform size being associated with higher lpa levels and there has been some epidemiological studies that have measured apoa isoform size either through pcr or immunoblotting etc so in the same patient you can have lpa levels measured and you can have the apoa isoform size and using the techniques that were available back then they did multiple adjustment adjusting lpa concentration for the apoa isoform size and looking at the association of apoa isoform size with outcome adjusting for lpa levels and the data back then was going all over the place basically so some studies were saying is the concentration some other studies were saying it's the apoe isoform size that matters and once again these questions were ultimately resolve by looking at genetics so there's there's one variant that's associated with small lpa isoform size but that's also associated with a low lpa so you can see this was our way to do a discordance analysis by looking at that specific snip and that genetic variant was not associated with cardiovascular diseases at all and in many studies uh now it's been shown that i probably the best study that has investigated that is uh is a study from the decode cohort which is a cohort from uh from iceland they have uh they sequenced uh they did a whole genome sequencing and i think it was fifty thousand ah sorry fifteen thousand uh individuals and they've shown unequivocally that the lpa isoform size even though you can sequence it really was not associated with the risk of heart attacks and strokes once you take into consideration lpa level so it's really the lpa number uh that matters and that's actually very positive for for the field that because there's so many puzzles that we still need to figure out in terms of of the association between lpa and risk so at least we can you know [Music] i think i can we can convincingly say that it's the the the number of lpa particles that that matter and not necessarily the iso form size and that the isoform size matters because it's associated with different levels of of lpa and not through an independent effect so really this for once creates a beautiful symmetry here which is it mirrors apob the first second and third order factor in the fa in the uh then the harm caused by an ldl particle is the number of the particles the size all of those things only factor into the number so why is it that smaller particles are more often associated with a poor phenotype because when you have smaller particles you generally have more of them so that's good to know do we have a sense of the complexity in why some families because again we didn't talk about the inheritance of this so in fact before i ask this question let's go back and explain the inheritance of this it's a very important piece of the puzzle how is this gene inherited and what are the implications for people who have elevated levels of this as far as their offspring yeah that's a that's a very good question uh so the pattern of inheritance is true autosomal dominant uh pattern of inheritance so uh it's like any uh like for instance if you compare it with a monogenic disorder let's say familial hypercholesterolemia in in quebec we have a very famous mutation which is a 15 kilobase deletion in the ldl receptor so if uh if you inherit that then if you inherit at least one copy you know you'll you'll have fh for lpa if you inherit a genetic variant that's associated with high lpa chances are you'll have ilpa as well because you only need one variant and not necessarily two so you need either the allele from uh your father or your mother that will rise lpa but it's a bit more complex than that because we we cannot necessarily consider it monogenic disorders because there's 2 000 different variants in the lpa region that are associated with high lpa so your father can have an high lpa because of a specific variant and your mother can have an lpa variant that lowers lpa but it depends on the combination of snips that you will ultimately get so it's not uh it's not as clear as any monogenic disorder even though it's a dominant mode of uh of inheritance it's been shown uh that um that the the children you can uh they have uh a very different lpa levels than than their uh than their their mothers and fathers and you cannot really estimate it so you really have to to measure it and for people that are asking the question at what time i should get an lpa measurement let's say if i had a heart attack at an early age and i want to prevent that in in my children then we know that the uh lpa gene is fully expressed by age two uh in the liver of course uh and that the levels that you will get at five years old are probably uh going to remain um that's well maybe not the same levels but if you have high level of h5 so it will probably increase through adulthood but very very slowly yeah so again some very important information there right piece one of that is you cannot predict the phenotype of the offspring from the phenotype of the parents and let's contrast this with apoe the gene by the way there's a lot of parallels between apoe and lpa apo e is a gene that today doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose all it seems to do is increase your risk of alzheimer's disease and even increase your risk of cardiovascular disease independent of that um there are three isoforms the two three four type and it's this fourth type that's high risk so you can argue how in the world does this gene exist and of course the answer is evolution wasn't really thinking about alzheimer's disease so therefore there must have been some benefit of it and of course we now know there is right this this genotype was associated with protection from parasitic infections in the brain which would have been far more to our advantage a hundred thousand years ago fifty thousand years ago ten thousand years ago than the downside of alzheimer's disease in your seventies or eighties but with apoe because you have these three discrete isoforms you only have six combinations and therefore if you know what the parents isoforms are you can probabilistically give a distribution for what the children will be you still would need to measure it of course but there's a finite number of outcomes now of course there you're measuring genotype and not phenotype we don't measure the phenotype of apoe yet so here you have so many genes that are associated with this thing that if the parents are both elevated the probability that the offspring are going to be elevated seems pretty high if one parent is elevated and the other is not there's a pretty decent chance that the offspring will not tell me about the situation in which both parents are not elevated but yet could carry genes that or could carry variants of lpa that when combined could elevate is that has that been observed or does one safely say if both of your parents are below 30 milligrams per deciliter the probability that you are going to be north of 50 is very small i think it's very small but you still have to to measure it uh peter i i i to be honest i don't think i would know the answer to that uh so that's why we we simply um suggest to measure lpa well the guidelines now most guidelines will tell you to measure it in everybody at least once in their lifetime but when do the guidelines suggest that that start do the guidelines suggest doing it in adolescence when you have a long enough runway to take action if the lp little a is elevated or do they not specify i don't think they they specify that and the the guidelines are actually just starting to uh advise for for lpa measurements so some some guidelines uh like the american heart association guidelines uh which are um probably the less favorable for lpa measurement they'll tell you to measure i don't remember exactly but in patients with atrocious cardiovascular disease or with a family history of atrocious cardiovascular disease in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or in patients with aortic valve stenosis so but the guidelines don't usually so in other words measure the lp little a once they've demonstrated that the disease that it causes is present yeah pretty much that's fantastic advice so if you look at the yeah but if you look at the canadian guidelines though they'll they'll tell you to measure it in everybody at least once in their in their lifetime so there's and by the way this is where canadians also stand out over americans canadians have long adopted the measurement of apob as the superior measurement to quantify ldl risk and yet here in the united states the guidelines still favor the use of ldl cholesterol which is clearly inferior to apob yeah absolutely so i i would like to comment on that i think i think the the canadian guidelines are are much more up to date with the with the recent uh literature on that there's clearly no no doubt about it but as are the european guidelines while we're on the topic yeah the european guidelines the canadian guidelines are in line with the available evidence and the united states guidelines are you know just 40 years out of date but that's all yeah absolutely and the european guidelines actually they they advise to measure lp in everybody for a different reason it was to identify patients who have very very high lpa levels because we realize uh throughout the years that the having a super high lpa might be a cause for familial hypercholesterolemia so um so and you need to measure ldl to diagnose uh familial hypercholesterolemia and after the after mutation in the ldl receptor mutation or variation in the lpa gene might even be the second cause of familial hypercholesterolemia and the reason for that is quite simple because when you measure ldl you also measure lpa cholesterol so if you have a very high ldl and also a very high lpa there's a very good chance that the high ldl cholesterol will actually be high lpa uh cholesterol so um so yeah this is i thought i think it's really under appreciated uh and and actually that's the reason why it's in the european guidelines but now i think most of the guidelines that will that will be put forward will just simply for whatever reason to measure lpa at least once and i don't know if it's in the pediatric guidelines because i don't really follow that that literature but uh maybe in children uh who have strokes at a a young age many of them have a high lpa so it's not as as clean as the literature in adults but there's been a lot of studies looking at high lpa and stroke in children so uh if you have a family history or relatives that had a stroke at a at a young age it might be a good idea to uh to to measure lpa as well yeah that's actually a terrifying thought by the way um you know my view on these things of course is just that the amount of energy that goes into debating it is so ridiculous compared to the relatively low cost of simply measuring the thing the people who debate why uh why would you spend 14 on an apo b test it's like if your life isn't worth 14 we shouldn't be having this discussion uh same is true for measuring lp little a so uh i think it should be done on everybody non-negotiable certainly before your 18th birthday that would be my that would be my thinking on this um so uh let's go back now but by the way i i what's the greatest that you've seen uh number of lpa lp little a to ldl i i had a patient once when we were measuring both in nanomole per liter who had an lp little a of 690 nanomole per liter in the context of an ldl particle concentration of about 1800 nanomole per liter so a little over one third of his ldl were lp little a i assume you've seen numbers even in excess of that uh yeah well um just to to be to be clear peter i don't see i don't see patients i'm not i'm not a refresher i've seen and i've seen some very interesting case reports uh on children that have uh fh and high lpa some of them even had to have liver transplant because uh the the the lipids were just so high and they were having events in children years so uh so but those are only uh case reports of course it's it's it's not uh it's not mainstream and i wouldn't want to scare anybody but this is this is as dangerous as it can get so let's talk about other therapies that have been proposed so there was certainly a day and sadly there are still a number of physicians that i interact with including those who carry the uh the title of lipidologist who are recommending the use of niacin to lower lp little a can you talk a little bit about the history of that um and at the risk of spoiling the punch line why we do not believe that is a good idea yeah um well it was even in the latest in the last guidelines of the european atherosclerosis society to advise uh niacin treatment in some patients with with high lpa um we did not have cardio large cardiovascular outcome studies uh on uh on under literally any effect of of of niacin therapy now we know that niacin therapy will actually reduce lpa levels it will increase hdl it will lower triglycerides so the effects on on plasma lipids are are actually pretty good um however and then you know if you're looking at lpa the reduction the mean reduction will probably be about 20 or 30 percent with with niacin and there are as you say some lipidologists that have seen like very important reductions of of lpa with niacin that that actually so they've decided to keep those patients on on niacin and i don't see any any any problem with that the thing is however when you look at the actual evidence we have two large uh cardiovascular outcomes trials we have the aim high trial and the heart protection study to trive trial that have shown that there's no cardiovascular benefits in treating uh well anyone with uh with niacin and we see a lot of side effects as well flushing being the most the most important side effect of of niacin so we have those risks and we don't have that many benefits so that's why niacin is not as prescribed as it uh as it once was there are still people that have that are using it niacin reduces the production of uh of lpa uh but uh and an lpa still predicts the risk of events in patients treated with niacin so we know that from the from the aim high trial so when you're looking at the cost to benefit uh ratio for for for nice and the evidence really isn't is isn't there to support so why do you think this is i mean if we look at the effect of niacin on raising hdl which it does right hdl cholesterol goes up with niacin administration at a high enough dose but the outcome trials are very clear that that does not translate into benefit it makes you think a little bit of the c-tep trials where you give a c-type inhibitor hdl cholesterol goes up in some cases you actually saw more events but usually at best you see no effect there it's a little easier to argue why that could be happening when you look at the complexity of hdl biology and you understand how much we don't understand and therefore that hdl functionality is what really matters and we don't have an assay for hdl functionality so these things that we measure like the amount of cholesterol in an hdl particle is a pretty useless measurement in that it tells us nothing about how the hdl actually works especially when you consider that you can have high cholesterol in an hdl particle because of all the cholesterol that's entering it or you could have high cholesterol and nhl particle because not much cholesterol is leaving it those would be two completely different states of affairs and again it makes sense why you can dismiss the notion that raising hdl cholesterol is valuable pharmacologically in the case of lp little a it's a bit more confusing because as you said niacin actually inhibits the production of apolipoprotein little a and for all of the nastiness associated with ldl and lp little a their biology is actually easier to understand in other words the things that they're doing to hurt you are easier to understand than what hdl is doing to help you so why do you think there is not a more clear signal between the use of niacin and the reduction of events yeah it's a very good question and the mendelian randomization studies have been very clear that you will need a very large reduction in lpa to produce cardiovascular benefits there was the first study has uh has shown that i suggested that because it's basically only modeling right we there's no trial data so we can at best uh estimate the treatment effect so it's suggested that you needed a hundred milligrams per deciliter reduction in lpa to get a benefit in a trial that would be comparable to a statin treatment like over whatever reduction is that a five year you'd need to see that in a five year window or what yeah well that's actually the problem because when you're looking at mendelian randomization studies you're looking at primary prevention and we're looking at lifelong reductions so it's very hard to estimate oh so the mr says if you want to reduce if you want to take that mortality curve down to the next rung it's a hundred milligram per deciliter reduction and lifetime exposure which means there's one study that that showed that there's other study that came out after that that said well it's probably not a hundred it's might be around 50 milligrams per deciliter but it's still high so you need a large effect so it's not a 20 reduction there's a bigger point there which is which you alluded to if that that's over the course of your life that's that's yeah well that means over five years you might have to basically obliterate it if you're going to want to see a benefit yes and well that's what the uh anti-scientists and the antisense nucleotides will do and we'll i guess we'll come back to that later but when they compare it to ldl though they also compare it to lifelong exposure to lower ldl so so they're they're not necessarily comparing lifelong reduction to to trial uh data that we you know with statin trials we have between two and seven years length of treatment in patients that already have disease so you cannot really compare apple in oranges but when you compare the lifelong effect and that's obviously a caveat of those of those studies because you're trying to get lifelong effects um to estimate the results of a trial using lifelong effects so uh so you have to you know take some and and leave some for those um for those kinds of studies but i want to come back to something that you said about uh ctp inhibitors because we we do have evidence at least for the uh anacetrapib that uh it might lead to cardiovascular benefit the truth is that was the one that was that the merck one yes they stopped the trial even though it was trending in a positive direction is that correct exactly so there's one reason for that was that they saw a lot of drug accumulation in adipose tissue which is not something you want if you want to prescribe a lifelong treatment and the second thing is that while the treatment effect was not spectacular uh lehigh so it was i think it was a six percent reduction in the rate of events but because i'm saying this because you talk about hdl and functionality and in that trial i don't remember the name of the trial it was a reveal trial they they've shown yeah that was stopped about two years ago it was relatively recent maybe three years ago right well maybe a little bit more than that but it was a big trial i think 30 000 patients so this is why we need big trials in that in that uh in that arena um so what they showed is that the it was the reduction in the number of apob lipoproteins that actually mattered it really didn't matter like the risk was not proportional to the hdl in rising effect it was proportional to the apob lowering effect and when you're looking and if you plot all the all the clinical trials together if you plot the apob lowering effect to the reduction in cardiovascular disease you can see that all these trials line perfectly on the line and even uh that that specific trial with anesthetic bib it fell right on the line same with pcsk9 inhibitors same with ezetimibe any ldl lowering drug that's that that's out there will basically well there's maybe some few a few exceptions but it will land on this line so it's really not about hdl so much i well when they developed the drug they thought it was about hdl of course but it's really it's really funny because actually it's it it just further convinced us to uh hit low it hit on uh april b containing lipoproteins as hard as we can yeah it is kind of the silver lining in all of this sometimes it's easy if you think about this stuff too much philosophically to lament the fact that we even have apob right because there's no real need for apob you know we could we could survive with no circulating apob and we wouldn't have any atherosclerotic disease so every time you get a little depressed and have that thought you can also realize how fortunate are we that the biology of apob is so much more well understood than that of apo a now i'm talking apo big a and that eradicating apob is becoming easier and easier and easier and safer and safer and safer and it's the single most important thing that you can do in the plasma to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic disease i mean all these things make for a very fortunate turn of events for our species and that's why turning to this pesky lp little a is so important because of what you described at the outset which is this residual risk in the individuals and it's interesting you talked about 20 that's higher than i that's that's higher than the number i quote my patients i usually tell my patients it's 10 so i've been understating this for some time i didn't realize it so all comers 20 of the population would be over 50 milligrams per deciliter yeah depending on on ethnicity so it's certainly above 15 no no doubt about it and some population especially in populations of of european ancestry they have the highest uh lpa level i'm sorry of african ancestry they have the uh highest lpa levels and they also have the highest lpa levels adjusted for uh lpa isoform size as well so uh in most of indiv individuals what if you look at the distribution of lpa in the population it's really skewed towards the null so it means that there's a lot of patient most individuals have very low levels of of lpa and there's some individual as we as we mentioned 15 to 20 percent that have high lpa levels now in individuals of african ancestry it's it's a more like a gaussian distribution so um so that's one of the reasons why they have higher lpa does that mean they have higher risk if they have a higher lpa not necessarily because the the risk is really proportionate uh to the to the level so there's nobody within shouting distance of the of what i'm about to say i believe which is lp little a is hands down the most common hereditary driver of ascvd correct i mean fh wouldn't even get within the same zip code when you think about genetic things that are driving uh atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease correct it is by far the most prevalent form of dyslipidemia so you can argue that maybe it's and and we have to talk about penetrance as well so the penetrance is the proportion of individuals with a certain genotype that will have the femoral disease exactly so the penetrance is obviously not a hundred percent right uh so so when i hear people say that you know lpa for the pharmaceutical industry is a market of 1.4 billion people i say well hold on a second it's not it's not everyone that has a high lpa that will have an event and we need to figure out uh what are the the drivers of of risk in patients with with high lpa and we're starting to study that then we see that there is some residual risk effect even in patients with with high lpa so we see that for instance uh if you have a high lpa but have lower crp levels or lower like inflammation you might be you might not have a risk that's as high as if you have high crp so you can argue that residual inflammation is very important but there need to be more studies on this because one can make the case that while it might be the same for smoking or type 2 diabetes or any other cardiovascular risk factor that you can think of but even then if even if lpa is not fully penetrant it is so common that it is by far the most important form of this lipidemia that will explain a lot of cardiovascular events at the population level and what i find so tragic about that statement is the number of good physicians out there really great doctors that are working hard taking care of patients frontline physicians family medicine physicians internists who have no idea what it is you know you ask them about it and they look at you as though you've asked them something in a different language um i still struggle to understand that disconnect given its urgency i i wonder if that's a uniquely american phenomenon do you have any insight i know you're not a clinician but do you have an insight as to whether or not the literacy around this in canada and europe is higher i don't have any reasons to believe that the literacy in canada or europe is higher than it is in the in america even with even with your guidelines being more forward-leaning oh yeah but these guidelines are new and it will take a lot of time before they implement it sometimes it's you know it it takes a a full decade before it you know it's transmitted to younger generation of physician and and people actually talk about it so that's one of the reason i'm so glad that we get to do this this podcast hopefully this this will raise awareness for uh the physicians out there that no didn't have uh any information about lpa and you know you can't blame them because well uh it it's obviously in the guidelines but you know not all physicians and read all the lipids guidelines there's so many guidelines out there that you can't blame them for that but i mean that's why we have to do more education to uh to physicians and i think one of the reason that people are reluctant to measure lpa is that because there's no treatment for for high lpa so sometimes um you know when you and so so any um any medical procedure that you do even if it's asking for a measurement of of any labs that you can mention it has benefits but it also have it also has consequences uh so for instance you can uh you know you don't want to stress anybody saying hey you have this risk factor it's super important and you don't want to do like an over diagnosis and an over treatment uh so so i used to i used to think that a lot but now you know we're in the age of uh shared decision making uh you we can communicate the the correct information uh to to patient tell them uh tell them what we know and even though there's no specific therapy for high lpa it doesn't mean you can't do anything um and i mean there's trial data showing that if you prescribe for instance a statin and if you lower ldl cholesterol levels in patients that have some risk factors for for cardiovascular disease you'll reduce the risk of events so in patients with high lpa you need to manage ldl you need to manage lpa you need to manage uh lifestyle smoking cessation and etc and we've actually shown that i i worked i've been working for more than 15 years with investigators in in amsterdam and cambridge on the epic norfolk study so the epic norfolk study is the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition and they have lpa measurement in 18 000 individuals and we've looked in that in that population at uh the effect of lpa on the risk of events but according to what the uh american heart association calls the life simple seven so uh smoking having a healthy diet being physically active having low body weight ldl cholesterol no diabetes and blood pressure that's on target and if you look at patients that have high lpa and that manage all of these risk factors it's a observational study of course but you can if you consider it a causal relationship you could reduce your risk by by two-thirds so so that's not trivial so so we're trying to uh so that's one reason why we should uh we should measure we should measure lpa if it's just to uh target the the other risk factors we'll have a lot of benefits in terms of prevention of of cardiovascular diseases at the population level and i think this is another great example of the parallel with apoe the genotype uh as recently as even a couple of years ago i would have enormous arguments with physicians about patients that we were co-managing right so this would be a patient who has both of us as their physician and the patient would say look i want to have my apoe genotype measured i would say i completely concur the other physician would say that's an absolutely horrible idea what good comes of that if they discover that they have an apoe4 gene and their risk is higher all you've done is create anxiety to which i would argue perhaps in some individuals sure and that's why it should be something that is done with consent but it that assumption can assumes you can do nothing about it and while you can't change the gene the evidence that you can modify behaviors that will lower the risk is enormous now in the case of apoe it's even more complicated because we now know what we didn't know a few years ago which is there are so many other genes that will either amplify or attenuate the risk of apoe so frankly today knowing that you're apoe4 positive in my opinion carries much less information than it once did so i want to ask you about something parallel with lp little a i've had patients who have had modest lp little a meaning 150 125 nanomole per liter 60 milligram per deciliter have had the most devastating ascvd that you can shake a stick at i mean six vessel disease calcium scores of 2 000 i mean these are people who are having you know coronary artery bypass surgery in their 50s and their lp little a is you know a little elevated and by the way their ldl and apob were not through the roof they're not smokers they're not hypertensive they're they're not type 2 diabetic etc hard to explain those ones similarly i've had patients whose family histories do not suggest advanced or premature asvd and i told you about one of them earlier 690 nanomole per liter lp little a now this person had a zero calcium score admittedly they were in their 40s so at least say you know a calcium score of zero in your 40s doesn't generally tell you anything but at least tells you that this person isn't having advanced atherosclerosis their family history is very uninspiring and at least one of their parents had to have an elevated level grandparents nothing and i scratch my head and i think why is it that this person seems somewhat immune from their very elevated lp little a whereas this other person who's elevated but not through the roof is ravaged by it well you're describing my next grand proposal peter so this is exactly what we're what we're trying to study and i alluded earlier to the penetrance of high lpa and that's exactly what you're what you're referring to so there might i misunderstood i thought you were referring to the penetrance in terms of the expression of the protein you were referring to the penetrance of the disease yes exactly i misunderstood that so so but you know we can say a lot about that because uh we actually measured um so in our lab we isolated the lpa particle from the blood of donors and patients with aortic valve stenosis so the reason being that well we're going to study those those particles because those patients they were matched for age sex statin therapy smoking etc so they're like the same uh people demographically speaking but one of them has a disease and the other one doesn't so and they have they all have high lpa so and the they were matched for lpa levels so we thought well maybe there's something happening in the particle maybe they have more oxidized phospholipids maybe they have different proteins so we've studied that and we we realized that these uh patients might have more cell adhesion molecules that are transported by lpa which make them more quote unquote sticky to endothelial cells or or fibrin clots or whatever they would make them or me maybe even macrophages because patients with high lpa also have activated macrophages which can penetrate much more easier in the in the vessel wall there's more apoptosis in the in the macrophage there's more cytokine production like il-6 il8 etc so there might be something that's different in the lpa particle that's just an hypothesis this was a study of i think there were 20 patients in each uh in each study arm because you know it's not easy to measure uh to to remove lpa from the blood and have it in a sufficient quantity that you can actually do proteomics on it so this is it took my a phd student of mine at least one year just to recruit the patients and isolate their that's just because the the electrophoresis is complicated or the isolation after the electrode is it getting it out of the body that's complicated or isolating it once it's ex vivo uh well once it sex vivo you have to isolate it it's not difficult to isolate it because you need to do ultra centrifugation but it has the same density of uh well i well it probably has it has the same size as ldl and the same density as hdl so you have to do chromatography columns to just basically separate it from ldl particles and also hdl particles so you need to do a size exclusion chromatography and an affinity-based [Music] uh chromatography so so it's uh it took a lot of time just to set up that uh that technique and uh we worked with uh a great colleague of mine marlies kashinsky who's at the robarts uh research institute in london ontario and she's been uh doing this for for ages but she helped us uh doing that and we're actually i think one of the first to actually uh isolate lpa from the blood of of patients so so that might be an explanation for this different expression of the disease in in in in people that have all high lpa but some that that are lower than others so that's just a hypothesis there's you need to look at other risk factors maybe um there's another gene that's out there that uh might be might code for a receptor of ldl there's labs that are really devoted to finding other genes uh aside lpa uh that that might explain and then the g one hasn't identified any because that would be your first tool before i'd go looking for that gene or that receptor rather i i would be trying to just find out what the association is right absolutely and those studies have been done probably the best g was on on lpa levels was published uh i think last year by the group uh of uh george chane sulis in uh ed mcgill uh in montreal and uh and james engert uh what they showed is that well obviously the biggest hit was at the lpa locus uh but we and we had known this for a while that april e actually uh also regulates uh high lpa levels so that's another reason why is there concordance is there some concordance with high with with apoe and lpa yeah so so the the apoe that will the apoe allele that will rise the risk of heart attacks will also rise uh lp levels so you have that you have the ctp gene and and then we haven't talked about the low the lpa lowering effect of ctp inhibitors which is actually higher than what you can get with niacin therapy so some have suggested that the benefits of all the quote unquote benefits of ctp inhibition might be due to a certain extent to high lpa levels but the problem with with niacin trials and ctp trials is that they weren't done particularly in in patients with high lpas so they're probably underpowered at least when it comes to trying to understand that yeah because you would have to recruit only patients that have high lpa which would mean to get rid of 80 of the trial population so so these trials will be will be very hard to do and then when you look at the other genes you have ctp and you also have apoh which is on another chromosome and apoh codes for beta2 glycoproteins and that protein might actually influence the the presence of oxidized phospholipids on april a so that might be interesting and i don't know uh i can't think of a study that have tried to look at that locus with high lpa to see if it has a modulatory effect on on outcomes but that would be a very interesting study to do so these are these are the genes that that i can think of interestingly the ldl receptor and also the most probably important regulator of ldl receptor pcsk9 they did not pop up in uh in that g was which is uh which was a little bit uh surprising to me uh given the effect of of uh sk9 inhibitors on on lpa before we get to that i want to go back to and really make sure we flush out this oxidized phospholipid plasminogen basically the atrogenicity of this particle is it clear that lp little a's enter the sub-endothelial space as ldls do or is that unclear yeah well there's not as much research that's been done on lpa but you know it's if you look at postmortem studies you can see lpa in uh in atterosterotic plaques and you can and you can certainly see it on on aortic valves because there's more easier like aortic valves are much more easier to get than atherosclerotic plaque because you can remove the valve and then you can study it in the under the microscope so there's there's good evidence um that the lpa can actually penetrate there usually what they do is they will bind to uh to clots uh that are uh in their region of uh of the atoroma and that's one one of the reasons why they might also be present uh present there but and they can also send their oxidized phospholipids through different uh through different receptors uh because we don't really know what is the receptor for lpa in those uh in those tissue um so at the surface of macrophages there are scavenger receptors uh tall like receptors cd36 that might um that might bind lpa they bind a bunch of things and but they also might bind npa which will uh uh ensure that lpa get gets trapped in the macrophages myoperoxidines uh lpa sorry sorry i'm intel but if i'm hearing you correctly benoit it would almost suggest that lp little a plays less of a role in the initiation of atherosclerosis which is really initiated by the monocyte becoming the macrophage in the sub-endothelial space and engulfing the oxidized ldl to become that foam cell that's really the initiating trigger you're saying lp little a might not be playing a role in that or maybe it is i want to make sure i'm not misquoting you but where it really lights things on fire is once you already have a plaque that's where the ability to form a clot goes up potentially if you say it has more vcams on it it's attracting even more macrophages to the site of injury so so am i capturing what you're saying correctly absolutely uh i think it's actually both so the macrophages of patients with high lpa are already activated and they will get uh as soon as there's and some endothelial dysfunction they'll get there they might even cause endothelial dysfunction so lpa is is is associated it's probably a main driver before the onset of any discernible plaque but it also has this double whammy where it's it initiates the disease but it also is associated with the progression uh with the progression of the of the of the disease and we see it in for instance i i talked to you a little bit earlier about the uh pet imaging of uh of with sodium fluoride these studies have also been done by uh eric strews in in amsterdam uh what they showed is that if you you don't use uh sodium fluoride but you use fdg so fluorodeoxyglucose um which is um basically a marker of macrophage activation and if you looked at the carotids and also the aorta of patients that have no disease but that are separated on the basis of whether or not they have high lpa you'll see a lot of light in uh patients with high lpa so that tells you that it also it's also associated with uh with inflammation with the inflammatory plaque uh in uh even in patients that don't have uh established uh disease so that's one of the reason why it's um it's this kind of particle is so dangerous and the association is obviously very strong for um ascvd and aortic stenosis how high is the association specifically for cerebral vascular disease it's clearly not as high so there's there's obviously a signal if i if i would have to uh rank those uh atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease the first one will be aortic valve stenosis that's um it's obviously less present or prevalent than uh than mi or or stroke but the but there are fewer contributing factors beyond lp little a the way you have apob exactly exactly so the relative risk is actually higher that the absolute risk is lower because there's not that many people that have that might be two percent of the of the population age above 60 but if you look at top quintile versus lower quintile the biggest risk is with aortic valve stenosis after that it depends on the steady sometimes it's myocardial infarction sometimes it's peripheral artery disease and we haven't talked about that but lpa is very strongly associated with pad as well so it's aortic valve stenosis pad and mi then ischemic stroke and it's important to make the distinction between hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke because lpa is only associated with with ischemic stroke and yeah i think that's it it's also associated with chronic kidney disease so that's it really it's only associated with aortic stenosis mis peripheral vascular disease ischemic cerebral strokes and kidney disease but aside from that it really does nothing yeah there was some uh some literature maybe uh 15 or 20 years ago on deep vein thrombosis and and lpa and there has been new studies published on that there's been genome-wide association studies and we really don't see a signal for lpa being associated with with deep vein thrombosis too so so that was part of the concept part of the conversation for a while but now i think it's pretty clear that it's really more closely associated with uh atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases and less with uh trombonic events do you think i mean we do have an assay i believe for ox uh aux ldl correct yeah is that assay picking up the oxidized phospholipid of lp little a included in that calculation no absolutely absolutely not totally different yeah well there is actually an assay to measure uh oxidized phospholipids on a b container is that is that sam tamika's assay exactly exactly so they they have an assay that measures uh aux pls on april b including lpa of course and also aux pls on uh april lipoprotein literally so but the correlation coefficient between these two is very high and the correlation between lpa levels and aux pl on april b is also very high so uh of course that can provide some information and there's been uh and obviously sam tsumikus has measured uh ox pl on april b in all of the cohorts that that that he could put his his hands on and it's a good predictor of all of the diseases that we've uh but is it is it a predictor beyond the level and the number of lp little a particles no i don't think there's good evidence to suggest that it's it's a better marker than or it predicts above and beyond uh lpa i think we should advise people to measure lpa that that would be a gigantic step and then we can see if the if if at some point we have convincing evidence that you know measuring uh oxidized phospholipid will bring in an added value but i haven't seen much data that that that suggests that yeah and and i i stopped measuring aux ldl because i didn't see any benefit to it over apob so it sounds like it's potentially the same thing here and of course the whole you you'd hope that it would have benefit above and beyond so that it would help you stratify risk further but uh interesting that it does not very complicated to know what to make of this these these oxidized phospholipid tails that are sitting around there wreaking havoc and um potentially also forming part of this explanation for the for the for the differential expression of the disease right yeah so so it's and it's the same for for uh ldl as well so the ldl particles they get oxidized they also have oxidized phospholipids and that's one of the reasons why ldl particle uh cause aterosclerotic cardiovascular disease but uh the measuring them in the plasma will not it will not tell you how many oxidized ldl particles you have in your in your plaque so uh so that's why we need to stick with uh with apob and nlpa because uh you'll get a you'll get a sense of all of the lipoproteins that that cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases so you alluded earlier to a pcsk9 protein which we'll talk about um tell people before we get into the drug just tell people about the pcsk9 protein how it works what its relationship is to the ldl receptor absolutely so pcsk9 uh it means proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type nine it was discovered in 2003 by a a collaboration between nabil siddha who's at montreal and catherine bualo who's in france they had identified this family in france that had a familial hypercholesterolemia but they couldn't find a mutation in the ldl receptor gene that explain the familial hypercholesterolemia so by the way before you get into this i just want to say this is one of my absolute favorite stories in all of medicine certainly in the modern era of medicine you know if you think the last 20 30 years this story is remarkable so please indulge us thanks for doing me the honor so so they had identified this family that had fh without a mutation in the ldl receptor and the paper was published in nature genetics in 2003 so you can think that they had been working on this for for a few years so that was probably at the time where the human genome was being sequenced so that was uh during the days of uh so that was pre genome wide association studies and whole genome sequencing where uh you were doing linkage analysis with satellite dna and uh yeah so i was an undergrad at that time i was learning these uh these techniques and i i wasn't in the lipids field so so i i heard that story after but uh so so what they found is that uh they were able to map the the gene in in that family to uh a protein that was at the time called narc one and so they they didn't know that uh that that it was uh a pro protein convertase so uh when they identified that uh that family in france they partnered up with uh with nabil siddha who's um a world renowned scientist on uh pro protein convertasis and they uh mapped it to narc 1 which eventually became pcsk9 so the the way pcsk9 works is that it's a regulator of the ldl receptor so when the cells makes an ldl receptor it will also make pcsk9 now pcsk9 can bind to the ldl receptor that can happen inside the cell and when that happens the ldl receptor gets degraded in the lysosome that can also happen extracellularly when the ldl receptor obviously in the hepatocyte gets stuck at the membrane but pcsk9 gets secreted so you can actually measure pcsk9 levels in the blood but when it gets secreted it can actually bind the ldl receptor and when that happens the ldl receptor cannot bind ldl particles and i told you earlier that ldl receptor density at the surface of hepatocyte is super important for ldl clearance so because pcsk9 can be can be secreted and by the time that they had realized that they had shown that there were actually families in in montreal that had a gain of function mutation in in pcsk9 that had uh familial hypercholesterolemia and then in 2006 the group of helen hobbs at ut southwestern had shown that there are common variants in pcsk9 that are associated with lower levels of of pcsk9 lower levels of ldl and protection against cardiovascular diseases now the pharmaceutical industry didn't need much more information to develop pcsk9 inhibitors right and and i remember that paper like it was yesterday i mean it's hard what is that now 16 16 years ago 16 years yeah absolutely yeah i i remember i was uh i was a master student at the time and we were we were witnessing that and it was it was very a very exciting time um so let me just make sure we go we synthesize that for people because it's such a big deal right so familial hypercholesterolemia is a very heterogeneous disease there are at least 3 500 mutations that produce the exact same phenotype very very elevated cholesterol these are patients that have total cholesterol typically north of 300 milligrams per deciliter ldl cholesterol by definition above 190 milligrams per deciliter off therapy and often much higher this disease is unequivocally linked to accelerated ascvd and what was discovered in 2003 was yet another gene that was associated with it but what made it different is most of the genes not all but most of the genes associated with fh directly involved the ldl receptor this one didn't seem to instead they discovered that it was this protein that wreaks havoc on the ldl receptor when it's overexpressed either by degrading the ldl receptor in the lysosome before it gets brought to the surface or frankly just interfering with the receptor when it's at the surface does pcsk9 also degrade um ldl receptors or increase their turnover when they are at the surface of hepatocytes yeah exactly that's that's exactly what i was going to say that's the third mechanism through which pcsk9 can influence ldl receptor density because what people don't really appreciate is that the ldl receptor when it does its job of bringing ldl particles within the hepatocytes gets recycled at the surface of the hepatocyte and that can happen a hundred times in the in the life of the ldl receptor because it takes a lot of energy to the cell to make them produce the ldl receptor and once and a pcsk9 is bound to an ldl receptor then it prevents its recycling so so the the cell has to make more ldl receptor and when it does that because they're under genetic control of the sre bp2 um transcription factor so then the ldl receptor gets uh produced and so is pcsk9 so so you can have this uh this vicious cycle so um and it's interesting to think that if if the story had stopped there it's not clear we'd be where we are today without the 2006 paper which showed wow as bad as that gain of function is the loss of function is really amazing where now you found these people who had the opposite of fh these are people who were basically missing their pcsk9 not completely just significantly underexpressed and these were people that as adults walked around with neonate levels of ldl cholesterol 10 20 30 milligrams per deciliter yeah so so the the most frequent um uh variant that they look at was present in two percent of the population and they saw very mild ldl reduction so they i don't remember this is 2006. so i'm gonna say 20 reduction in in ldl but you know it's a lifelong reduction right that's right the mr would still suggest that that's beneficial exactly but there has been some that there has been some studies on as you say patients or individuals that have virtually no ldl because they have no pcsk9 really and they don't have of course atrocious cardiovascular disease because you need ldl for that but they have uh they're perfectly fit uh you know it doesn't influence reproduction or or hormones or or anything uh they have uh and they don't have dimensions exactly no increase in the risk of other diseases so they have normal risk for cancer alzheimer's disease every other disease and they just don't have the risk of a cvd and their ldl cholesterol is 10 20 milligrams per deciliter very important teaching point here i think for for the listener which is it might be tempting to say how can someone with such little cholesterol in their plasma not have other problems when we understand the importance of cholesterol in creating lipid bilayers of cells and being a precursor to steroidal hormones and i addressed this in a previous podcast but i think it's worth stating this again when you look at how much cholesterol is in the body and isolate that fraction which is in the plasma even if you take that to zero you've maybe reduced the total body pool of cholesterol by about 10 percent so yeah and and there's still some cholesterol in the blood right because the liver will secrete very low density lipoproteins that will not necessarily be targeted by by pcs canines and there's high exit as well so you still have a total cholesterol that might fall from 180 milligrams per deciliter it might fall to 70 milligrams per deciliter or 60 milligrams per deciliter but it's not zero you're right but you know the point is you still have so much cholesterol in extra like an extra apob tissue right the the the red blood cells all of the tissue the hepatocytes et cetera so yeah and we we're seeing that also in the the trials because uh well obviously the industry develop antibodies monoclonal antibodies against bcsk9 and these have been tested in two large cardiovascular outcomes trials and they've shown that if you reduce ldl through these pcsk9 inhibitors you get a reduction in in cardiovascular events and now in these trials now these were all patients that were already treated with statins and you add on to that a pcsk9 inhibitor and you really bring ldl cholesterol levels to the floor and in post-doc analyses of these trials you can see that the benefit was also correlated with the uh reduction in ldl levels so patients that have the lowest ldl levels had the lowest uh risk of having a second event is i say second event because these were uh these trials were done in patients with uh stable cad and also acute coronary syndrome so it really tells us that there's there doesn't seem we haven't identified yet the the level of ldl that's that's so low that it's going to harm uh any physiological or disease process yeah it's such it's such an important point um and and again i think you know you're referring to fourier and odyssey i gotta tell you this is one of those beautiful moments again where it i i was a little worried that fourier and odyssey were not going to be positive trials especially fourier because you'll recall fourier the patients had an average starting ldl cholesterol in the 70s i can't remember if it was 71 or 77. i think the mean was 90 and they brought it back down to 30 milligrams was the mean 90 i thought the mean at the beginning was in the 70s but i could be wrong there was not an entry level of ldl sometimes you see that in these kinds of trials you have to bring the ldl down to a certain level uh but that was not the case so it was they were just being treated with uh standard of care which is obvious yeah so these were all very high doses of statins so if you're right and they were if they came in on a statin maximally and their ldl was 90 that's still very low that still puts them at the 10th percentile i thought it was 70 so that would have been at the 5th percentile but the point is when patients come in and they already have such a low ldl you add a drug that lowers them to the 30s but the trial was only five years and my thought was there's no way in five years you ha that's not long enough to see a benefit when the patients are starting out so low and that turned out to be wrong so the trial support was supposed to last five it was four point four she saw a benefit at 2.2 years old wait that's right it was 2.2 and four years exactly odyssey was 2.4 years or something exactly exactly so me too uh so basically they stopped the trial when they knew they had an effect but when the trial was published uh that was in 2000 it was august august of 15 i think okay well that long okay well there had been post-doc analyses uh from from phase three trials that were uh that were very positive in the new england journal i i don't know if you're referring to these papers but uh anyway so four year trial uh sorry yes yes i'm referring to the fda approval which was on the earliest analysis which was august of 15 obviously subsequent analyses came after but but i believe at that point you had the 2.2 in the 2.4 year data because basically repatha and praluent were approved within a month of each other if my memory starts me correctly yeah based on their ldl lowering and not necessarily on their effect of cardiovascular disease so i was actually very surprised because in that trial the relative risk reduction if you compare pcsk9 with placebo was only 15 percent so people were kind of expecting like a 20 plus percent reduction and many people were kind of disappointed by by that but i mean it happened over 2.2 years only so that's what's underrepresented remember i can't remember if i wrote a blog post about this and if i didn't i'm sure i wrote it in an email to a friend and i hope i could find that email but it was a friend of mine who worked at a hedge fund yeah so it must have been an email i don't think i wrote a blog post he said because you remember amgen's price share price declined with those results and it was i think it was because they didn't hit the relative risk reduction it was so modest and and i said to him i said that's a mis that's that tells me wall street doesn't understand atherosclerosis if you can hit a 15 relative risk reduction which ultimately turned into a bigger risk reduction in 2.2 years on a group of patients who show up on the maximum dose of a statin whose ldl is already at the 10th percentile you've changed the you've changed the field of cardiovascular medicine yeah i i completely agree and i was saying i i remember thinking this that you know if they really wanted to make a trial to increase their stock price they they would have made make it the full four years right because then you would have seen the biggest increase because if you look at the kaplan-meier curves they're still going in opposite direction they haven't stabilized so and i talked earlier about the cholesterol treatment trial is curve uh the the data from the fourier and odyssey trial they fall exactly on the same uh curve where you're looking at achieved apob levels and reduction in event it's right there at the at the lower end of the curves of the curve of course because that's that's the in that's a trial in which they they saw the the biggest uh reduction in in ldl b so let's go back and close the loop on one thing before we now talk about pcs k9 and lp little a so you've explained now why a pcsk9 inhibitor the drugs we're talking about are so effective in lowering apob because they're basically mimicking the most extreme loss of function of this gene you're taking away that protein that does those three things to reduce lp ldl clearance why is it remind us that statins don't lower lp little a you would think well we know why statins get the ldl receptor to be more dense that should do it so the the the obvious explanation here is ldl receptors don't clear lp little a but why is that isn't an lp little a just an ldl with a little extra thing on it why is that causing so much difficulty for the statin i told you earlier that lpa levels were determined by their rate of production and one of the players that was an anticip unanticipated player in uh in april a pro lpa slash apoa production is actually pcsk9 because if you incubate cells liver cells with uh with with pcsk9 you'll see the expression of apoa going up and in lipoprotein turnover studies you also see that so if you treat uh people with a pcsk9 inhibitor you will actually see a reduction in the production rate of uh of april a and there was a nice uh study that's a bit complex to uh to fully appreciate by uh gerald watts who's in uh pert australia he's shown this but he also showed in a second group that if you treat patients with a pcsk9 inhibitor and the statin you see the [Music] and that's probably what where the ldl receptor presence gets maximized at the surface of the liver cells you can actually see clearance uh or increment in the fractional catabolic rate of of lpa so there's still so much that we don't know in this uh in this area so and it's not totally clear why uh we see this difference of pcsk9 inhibitors that's depending on whether or not you're treated with with a statin and i think all comers we see that a pcsk9 inhibitor is lowering lp little a by is about 30 percent is the on average yeah and so the average is is probably between 25 and 30 in all comers but the variability is enormous i mean i exactly the very the variability is is very important and it's another example where we need to study patients that have high lpa because these are the patients that we want to provide an answer to and there's only been one trial that had tested the effect of a pcsk9 inhibitor on in patients with lpa there there had been sub analyses in fourier and odyssey outcomes uh and when you look at that trial it's called the initial trials and all these postdoc analyses of um of randomized controlled trials of pcsk9 inhibitors you see that in patients with high lpa the reduction is approximately 15 so it's not spectacular and in in the anishco trial what they did is that they've looked at arterial wall inflammation using fluorodeoxyglucose this is a trial run by uh zai fayyad at mount sinai in new york and eric strews in in amsterdam uh they showed that even though you you reduce ldl by uh i don't know what percentage but it was a spectacular reduction in ldl a very small reduction in lpa of 15 you don't see any effect on arterial wall inflammation so that means that you know there's an important uh residual risk that's associated with lba because if you lower ldl with pcsk9 inhibitors you know there's no outcomes data although they did link lpa with recurrent cardiovascular disease in this in these trials you see uh that the pro-inflammatory effect of lpa on the vasculature still remains so we're gonna have to go after lpa even in patients that have very low uh very low levels of ldl there's no doubt about that and so is one interpretation of the fact that um pcsk9 inhibitors can lower lp little a by 30 percent but that might not be sufficient to ameliorate the lp little a risk specifically is that it's just simply not enough it gets back to what you said earlier yeah it you're going to have to eliminate lp little a and and it becomes a bit more of a step function than the gradient we see with apo b yeah i i don't know if we need to eliminate lp little a but we need to take we need to get it probably bring it down yeah yeah yeah to a lower level so that point that's what they're testing yeah so that brings us to where we are today right so what's the state of the art today in 2022 with my patients who have elevated lp little a i take a two two prong effect uh when it comes to lipid management obviously there's many things we're doing outside of lipid management the first is absolutely eradicating apob so we're very aggressive on this because it's very clear that you can do this safely and effectively we target an apo b of about 30 to 40 milligrams per deciliter so we target an apob at what we would call a physiologic level so the level that a child would have it's clear that a child can have an apob of 30 and have no problems with development which is the most cholesterol demanding period of their life so there's absolutely no reason that we shouldn't be able to take an adult there without side effects meaning provided we can do it without side effects from the medications but the second thing we do is we're very liberal in the use of pcsk9 inhibitors because even though we don't know the answer yet our belief is even if it whacks it 30 which is about what we see we see on average about a 30 reduction in lp little a it's worth it until we get to antisense oligonucleotides so let's talk about antisense oligonucleotides what are they yeah now before we get into that uh i i'll tell you that i do the same thing i mean i'm going to turn 40 this year so i decided i decided to had to have a lipid check and have my lpa remeasured and it's very high it's at 200 nanomolars i knew that because i had my genotype done with a direct to consumer company and and they let you look at your own data so they they send you all of your snip information so i went and looked at my favorite snip in lpa and i was uh a carrier of one of the most famous mutation variants in the in lpa so and that's exactly what i decided to do so my ldl was a bit higher than than average my lpa was i so i just started to to take a statin and of course i've been on [Music] close to vegetarian dairy diet for more than three years i i'm physically active but you know at some points you have to look at your at your labs and say well there's i need to do more so so even i started taking a statin even though i'm not 40 yet because i i i see those studies and i see the importance of going after ldl very early and very aggressively now i'm not on a super high dose i need to have it to check it after three months but um but if it doesn't go down i'll increase the dose so so and that's i think what uh people who have high lpa uh should do so coming down to the uh oligo uh the antisense oligonucleotides against lpa this is a very exciting time for uh for lpa research so the probably the the first horse in the race will be uh the the compound by ionis uh pharmaceuticals so it is an antisense oligonucleotide against the lpa gene well all of them all of them will be and the second one is uh the and they just released some data on this in the in nature medicine a couple of months ago and it's called old pass iran it's uh it's not an oligonucleotide it's an si rna against uh lpa it's the compound by amgen and i believe they'll they'll need to do a phase three trial but with the first one with the uh ionis compound ionis is the company that used to be called isis like before exactly it became horrible to have the name isis it was it's a san diego-based company i remember i used to swim with a guy who worked there and he had a his his duffel bag which was from work said isis on it and i was like yeah you're probably going to want to change that yeah you can't board a plane with that [Laughter] so um so yeah so they they have they they already uh have phase two data that's been published in 2020 uh in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease a very nice dose ascending study and they've shown that in the dose that they're going to use in their trial which is a monthly injection you can get mean reduction of lpa levels of 80 even in patients with high lpa so that's very encouraging because this is what we're gonna need to uh to to to prevent uh heart attacks and and and obviously to have successful uh cardiovascular outcomes trial and in that study they also showed that uh 90 of patients who were treated on that dose had lpa levels below 50 milligrams per deciliter so it's very potent it's a second generation um antisense oligonucleotide and they have launched a trial a cardiovascular outcomes trial that's called horizon and they're recruiting a little under 8 000 patients with stable cardiovascular diseases and they will study the effect of lpa in of their antisense oligonucleotides in the prevention of major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events and is this a secondary prevention trial it is a secondary prevention trial so this is where you have to start you have to take the patients that have the highest risk to have uh to have a positive trials there's uh to my knowledge there's no uh plan for a trial in primary prevention but that will that will be the author eventually have to come yeah so yeah do you do you have a sense of how far they are in their enrollment because this trial and maybe it's just because of how emotionally invested i am in this i don't i have a normal lp little a but it's just i think i take care of enough patients that don't this trial feels to me like the molasses rolling uphill in january trial and as a as a quebecois you can appreciate the speed with which molasses will roll uphill in january what is taking so long this is a trial that feels like it's a year away from being completed every year for the past seven years yeah well uh first of all uh be being an investigator in a research center at times of kovid was very very difficult to bring people into the hospital for an exploratory trial so uh so so that has had i i don't know for that specific trial but i can tell you for any lab or any clinical research facility the any patient that were recruited and especially in our hospital we're the the covet hospital for the entire region so i mean people don't want to come here during during a pandemic so so i i'm thinking that this is probably part of the of the explanation so we'll have the result uh of that trial probably in 2025 because um i told you earlier that trial is going to be 8 000 patients when i saw that i thought well this is not enough i mean they do they need to do a big trial uh and this is it's it's kind of risky to do a trial in only 8 000 patients but the way i understand it it's that is that they're gonna use the full four years of their uh of their treatment period so even though you have less patients and for instance fourier or odyssey outcomes that have 16 15 000 yeah exactly so they're recruiting half for the roughly the same population so but they're they're gonna they're gonna study it for uh a longer period so that might also explain why it's not going to be published anytime soon and we need we need to be patient and i'm really looking forward to seeing the the results of that trial because they hold the the fate of the entire field in their in their hands so really looking forward and also especially for the for the for the patients uh really looking forward to seeing the results of that trial and i hope that there will be other companies i know there are there's three companies that have uh antisense oligonucleotides against uh lpa so you have uh ionis which is partnering with novartis for the for the the trial uh amgen has one uh and there's also another uh sir any company called silence therapeutics that have that have an lpa inhibitor i don't think they have released their phase one study yet but i think we'll see more and more uh of of these companies because there's still there's still money to make i think in that in that area of residual cardiovascular risk because we can uh target ldl as as low as we want and there's still a an underappreciated amount of residual risk that's associated with uh with with different things with the triglycerides inflammation but the first thing that comes to mind to me is is the risk associated with high lpa it's an amazing decade we're in if in fact this study is published in in 2015 uh apparently in 2025 you'll have exactly a decade between the approval of pcsk9 inhibitors and potentially the approval of this uh anti-since oligonucleotide for lp little a and you could argue that those two things will have an outsized effect on on human health so benoit i want to thank you very much for spending all this time with me today and by extension with all of our listeners this is such an important topic that i think of this almost as a a public service announcement uh if you're listening to this podcast there's a at least a 10 and maybe a 20 chance that your lp little a is elevated you really need to demand that your physician checks this level we think that the milligram per deciliter mass measurement is probably sufficient and if you're elevated on that level at least at this moment in time the best thing that we can do is keep apob as low as possible and manage all of the other manageable risk factors hypertension smoking insulin resistance etc that that traffic with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease the other thing i think we can at least i would be comfortable recommending i know you're not a physician so you probably wouldn't be comfortable making a recommendation i would also insist that you at least once have an echocardiogram to look for even the earliest signs of aortic stenosis as it is imminently more treatable and the outcomes are better if it is addressed earlier well thank you peter for having me and thank you for
