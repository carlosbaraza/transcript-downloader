Richard Miller is a professor of pathology and the Director of the Center for Aging Research at the University of Michigan, as wells as a previous guest on The Drive. In this episode, Rich provides an update on the exciting work of the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), an initiative designed to assess potential life-extending interventions in mice. Rich covers the notable successes like rapamycin, 17⍺-estradiol, and acarbose as well as notable failures like nicotinamide riboside, metformin, and resveratrol, providing valuable lessons about the intricacies of the aging process. Rich delves deep into aging biomarkers and aging rate indicators, unraveling crucial insights into the science of geroprotective molecules. Additionally, Rich discusses some surprising successes of recent molecules tested by the ITP and concludes with an optimistic look at future frontiers, including bridging the gap from mice to humans.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Richard Miller discussing the Interventions Testing Program (ITP), a multi-site research initiative studying potential anti-aging compounds in mice. The discussion covers successful and failed interventions, new findings about aging biomarkers, and methodological insights about mouse models in aging research. Key highlights include the program's rigorous testing protocols, breakthrough findings with several compounds including rapamycin and 17-α-estradiol, and the development of novel aging rate indicators.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- ITP operates across three research sites with $1 million annual funding per site [00:05:30]
- Uses genetically heterogeneous UM-HET3 mice instead of standard C57BL/6 mice [00:12:17]
- Identified 13 consistent aging rate indicators across 10 different slow-aging mouse models [01:02:42]
- Rapamycin + acarbose combination showed 29% lifespan increase, the largest ever observed [01:54:18]
- New findings on meclizine and astaxanthin showing ~10% lifespan extension in males [02:11:50]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- None specifically mentioned for humans, as findings are primarily in mouse models

Context-specific recommendations:
- Meclizine shows promise for both seasickness and potential longevity benefits [02:10:13]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications discussed:
- Rapamycin [01:54:18]
- 17-α-estradiol [01:51:12]
- Meclizine [02:11:50]
- Astaxanthin [02:13:34]
- Fisetin (showed no effect) [02:16:11]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
Key biomarkers discussed:
- UCP1 in fat tissue [01:02:42]
- GPLD1 in liver and plasma [01:13:03]
- BDNF and DCX in brain [01:15:01]
- P16 and P21 for senescent cells [02:17:49]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"To make me happy it has to be an anti-aging drug and the evidence has to be effects on many different age-sensitive properties" [00:00:00]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal dosing protocol for the rapamycin + acarbose combination?
2. How do aging rate indicators translate to human applications?
3. What are the mechanisms behind sex-specific effects of 17-α-estradiol?
4. How might cognitive testing protocols be integrated into future ITP studies?
