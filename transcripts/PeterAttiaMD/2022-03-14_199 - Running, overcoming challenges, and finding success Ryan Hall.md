## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA hey Ryan looking very forward to having this discussion with you today I've been uh I've been a fan of yours for for a long time actually and and running is kind of like I don't know it's sort of like F1 it's not really that popular in the United States although it's becoming more so I mean obviously Netflix's drive to survive

[00:00:26] Series has made F1 very popular and I think also people are stting to become a little bit more aware of Runners after uh well I don't really know what it is but I think Kip choi's two-hour sub you know effort kind of got a lot of people in this country excited about it but um anyway I I think for me the interest in running started because I used to swim with Alan web so back in the early 2000s when he was you know this Phenom who you know sets the High School record for the mile um and I'm swimming next to this guy in the next Lane and just became kind of interested in his journey and then obviously learned about you and the other Runners of that generation so anyway um your transformation has been remarkable and I almost don't know where to begin but um let let's just start with because people probably you know some people won't know a lot about you but you know so so you grew up in Big

[00:01:19] Bear right yeah correct Southern California yeah but it's at altitude so it's not it doesn't it's not like beach Southern California people think SoCal they think you know or County or San Diego right yeah I mean Big Bear is a really cool place to grow up I mean we're like two hours from the beach so it's one of the few places you can like both Surf and snowboard or ski in the same day you know so yeah we grew up with snow I live like a mile away from

[00:01:45] Snow Summit and it was just like honestly it's like the perfect place to grow up as a distance Runner like when you look at the best guys in the world they're often times coming from Ethiopia and Kenya places that are at 7,000 ft altitude and that's exactly what was at and so kind of just found myself in like the perfect scenario for a distance

[00:02:05] Runner and even in the sense of being able to uh live high and train low so when I was growing up in high school my dad was my coach started a cross country and track team just so I could run there wasn't even one available at Big Bear high school and uh we would drop down like twice a week drive an hour down to sea level get on a track at sea level run some super hard interval sessions and then pop back up to altitude so um it was you know we're kind of before our time in a lot of ways you know like the research and studies are showing how beneficial that kind of training is but we were just doing it because that it just made sense it was the environment in which I found myself and um pretty crazy to look back on it now and see how things like that really do kind of contribute to the trajectory of the path that you're on and I suspect there's something to um being in that environment when you're young during the the formative years of your cardiovascular system um I I look at at like my daughter who's 13 and she loves volleyball and basketball but doesn't like cross country or track and I I I'm trying not to be a psycho about it but

[00:03:09] I'm also sort of telling her like you have this really narrow window in which your cardiovascular system is quite malleable um and like I'm very fortunate that because I was involved in boxing I had to do so much cardio both aerobic and anerobic training during those formative years and even though I'm a fraction of that level of Fitness today

[00:03:29] I can still ride on you know what I had then but I feel like if you don't push that system hard in your teenage years it's very hard to develop it later I don't know if that's true but that has been my impression and then to take that one step further which is what someone like you's been able to do to have that altitude Arbitrage is I think just unbelievable oh yeah I mean I the effects of cardio at a young age definitely play on later in life like now for example like I really don't do much cardio at all like last year I had nine months where just focus on strength training just trying to get as big and strong as I can my weight went up from 167 to 192 over nine months and I was literally doing Zero running none like no other cardio no biking no swimming nothing I hopped on a treadmill at the end of that period when I was at my heaviest just to see like let me see where my miles at cuz I was going to train for this challenge that I tried this 500 lb deadlift into a sub five minute mile so I was like let me see where I'm at just starting wise hopped on a treadmill after my weight session 518 for the mile with zero zero training and that I think that goes to kind of like what you're talking about like when you develop that early on and like you just need little touches here and there

[00:04:43] I take pretty short rest between a lot of my lifts and that's like enough to keep me in 518 mile shape without even trying you know but yeah I mean there's a ton of interesting things like they talk about um kids who were born at altitude and how they have greater um potential for cardio development over time but it's kind of interesting like looking at my family I'm in the middle of five kids my youngest brother Chad he's super into endurance stuff um and he was born at altitude where I was born in Seattle Washington so how how old were you when you got to Big Bear I was five years old so pretty young so I've spent most of my time at altitude but he was born in altitude but we didn't really see a whole drastic effect I mean he was a really good runner he won the national championships in High School cross country so a stud Runner went went to Oregon on scholarship and all that stuff but um between him and I there's not like a huge difference in what we've seen in terms of our topend potential for for cardio well the other thing that you alluded to that I wanted to talk about later but we might as well just talk about it now because you brought it up and I think it's an important thing that I became pretty interested in many years later when I was swimming and trying to look for ways to improve was um basically the Matrix of living High living low low training High training low and coming up with what was the optimal scenario and it turned out as you pointed out this is something for which we have a very clear answer today the answer wasn't clear 20 years ago today the answer is Crystal Clear which is the best results are attained from living High training low when it comes to intensity so you can live high train high for low-end um aerobic efficiency but you have to train that anerobic Peak at sea level and so so I remember swimming up in Colorado Springs at the

[00:06:32] Olympic Training Center when I would go up there for some swim camps and stuff and being a guy who lived at sea level who would then go to try to push it hard in Colorado I mean it was a total waste of time I mean it was a complete waste of time to try to do any top end anerobic stuff um when I hadn't you know had any ability to do that in fact it was the exact opposite you'd want to do and so I had friends who who lived at sea level but they would put they would have oxygen deprivation tents that they would sleep in at sea level to to functionally replicate the living high so then they could train at sea level what you described growing up is really the kind of perfect way to be able to do that um you you made it sound like that was just sort of accidentally discovered though you guys just sort of empirically stumbled upon the efficacy of that training yeah yeah it was just kind of like it just felt good you know anytime

[00:07:22] I'd pop down to sea level to do track workout it's kind of like you're saying Peter it's like I try that stuff at altitude and like running 400 me to repeats on short rests or like longer um aerobic efforts where you're trying to do like mile reps super fast you just you got to do it you have to structure it different at altitude whereas you go down to sea level and you can you can spend a lot of time at race Pace you know working on that turnover which you just can't do it altitud without breaking it up more and so that's what we do a lot of when we're up high staying up high for intervals is we'll just break things up where you're doing a bunch of 200s on really short rest um but yeah we just enjoyed popping down to sea level for those sessions just felt good and it was working right like the results like were very obvious but yeah the whole altitude thing is really interesting because my wife Sarah who's a professional marathon runner she's run 220 for the marathon which is the second fastest ever by an American and uh it took her she grew up at sea level in

[00:08:18] Santa Rosa California so when you're talking Peter about going up to Colorado and doing the swimming stuff there's also this effect of like how many years have you spent in altitude so like for example am super good at altitude in terms of running you know like I can run pretty close to my sea level times at 7,000 ft altitude what could do at any distance uh so particular I'm thinking about like marathon training so like what's most important marathon training is your thresholds so 15 Mile thresholds we're just run 15 miles at that kind of marathon intensity and I could run 12 15 miles at 448 per mile which is about marathon pace um at 7,000 ft and if I pop down to sea level maybe I'm running like 442 Pace 440 Pace but I didn't get a huge conversion from altitude to sea level whereas someone like my wife Sarah who wasn't as accustomed altitude she'll get sometimes like 20 seconds a mile where she's running that much slower at altitude that much faster at sea level but she's also gotten better the more time she spin at altitude so she first we moved to Mammoth Lakes out of college after we graduated from Stanford in 2005 and uh she was hating living in Mammoth 8,000 ft for such a long time but gradually over time like she's gotten much much better at altitude probably still not as good as like I was when I was in my Prime but um now we have to even go up to higher altitudes to get similar effects to what we were getting before so we have a place in cresa

[00:09:46] Colorado where we're sleeping at 9,400 FT and every time she goes up there we see a massive jump um in her Fitness just from doing like a month stand up there so you have to keep like kind of playing with it cuz you really like the science is there and um your experiences are true but also your body's Dynamic it's always changing right so you got to like you just can't repeat the same thing over and over and over again like you have to realize like my my whole like body is always changing always adapting so I got to be throwing new things at it and that's like a big thing

[00:10:19] I've learned in the lifting space as well it's like if I'm just doing the same lifting all the time and not like trying new mechanisms to add weight to the bar different tactics like I'm just just not going to see growth right so it's just it that's the fun thing about running training lifting it's all just an experiment of one it's just all just a giant experiment right and you're just always like tweaking little variables and that's what I love about Fitness running all of that stuff is I love seeing growth I love just like the frustration of not seeing growth getting plateaus and be like what is going on right now and like my mind's just like chewing on this over and over again for like months and months and then I'm just making little tweaks little tweaks till

[00:10:59] I find it then you find it and bang it clicks you know and whether it's in the waight room or running all of a sudden like you're doing what you couldn't do before and you're like ah I just love I love learning and growing in that way you know well you you really touched on a lot of things there but one of them is this concept of progressive overload and um I think that that is one of the hardest things to really do when you're training yourself as most of us are right most of us you know we're just kind of Weekend Warriors and we're we're sort of Our Own coaches and it is very easy to get kind of comfortable uh and again it's true in the weight room it's true on the bike it's true if you're running or whatever it is you're doing um but but there in lies the challenge of being able to progressively overload which doesn't always mean weight it can mean sets it can mean reps it can mean reduction in rest time there's so many ways that one can progressively overload lately I've become pretty obsessed with

[00:11:54] Blood Flow Restriction and weight training so that becomes another way to progressively overload using a fraction of the weight that we would normally use um so yeah I've been doing some of that too I love that especially for runners because like Runners like I got hurt I was training for the Beijing Olympics I was at the Olympic Training Center in

[00:12:12] Chula Vista working with a strength coach he had me on one of those vibrating platforms to warm up for squatting and it work great like I was able to like warm up and get into much deeper squat than I never got into before but like as a runner like most Runners are super tight and like the ankle Mobility isn't there like shouldn't be down in a butt to the ground squat it's just not beneficial for distance Runners it's not specific for distance Runners right and so anyways long story short I ended up tweaking like the connection to my patella and uh that bothered me all the way up to Beijing in Beijing and I was kicking myself so much for getting hurt lifting you know and so you had a pretty good run in Beijing though I mean you finished 10th if I recall yeah yeah yeah

[00:12:56] I was 10th there but it just to me like it wasn't about what place I finished it was this uh the sensation of clicking yeah you didn't click so you went out a little slow in that race if I recall you you were very tentative like the first 15K and then you actually kind of came back you you basic I don't know if you negative split by time but it seemed by effort you certainly did yeah I mean we could we could I could I wrote a book about like that whole experience you know like so much went into that but I also wasn't clicking in training you know how you can tell when like in training it's like oh I just feel like before I ran the Houston half like I I went for a run in Big Bear a couple days before that race and it was snowing like crazy like those big old snow like snowflakes or come down super slow and it was just stacking up I was literally running like a foot of snow on the roads that hadn't been plowed yet and I felt like Tigger like I just felt like I was just bouncing along just effortless like when things are clicking in training then it's like oo this is going to be fun you know you're kind of licking your chops kind of feel going into Beijing I didn't take a big break after running 206 at the London Marathon uh in April I didn't take my customary two week break where I put on 10 pounds and don't run at all I didn't do that and so then I was just kind of flat like the whole buildup for Beijing so I wasn't I wasn't right going into the race but then there's also this thing of you're talking to the the scientists and we're doing like all this stuff at the Olympic

[00:14:27] Training Center where they're prepping us for the race talking about how hot and humid it's going to be and it was one of those big Life Learning experiences for me where um the the story line is it's going to be so hot and humid it's going to be slow it's going to be one in like 212 211 right and so we're just buying this story and we're just hearing the story over and over again and I didn't do what I learned to do after that which is like you got to be like the samurai it's like you got to be ready for any situation that's going to come you know and not expect anything so like the saying is like expect nothing be ready for anything and I wasn't in that state of mind I was like all right it's going to be chill the first mile or and and right from the gun Samy just like gone the guy who ended up winning the gold medal just took it out super hard right and it was like a a mentally I got hit in the chin with an uppercut like right out out of the gate you know because I wasn't I wasn't ready for that scenario at all so then you get back and you're in like 60th place and you're trying to win a medal and you're like you don't win a medal from 60th place I mean you but you have to really like coach yourself through some tough spots cuz um you don't have momentum on your side and a lot of like competing well and anything is getting excited while you're out there right like you got to be just building this like snowball of excitement as the races playing out and

[00:15:47] I was having the opposite experience of that where I was like I'm not where I want to be I'm too far back can't even see the leaders the helicopter's like way off in the distance you know and uh and so I had to kind of Coach myself through and actually how I did that was by encouraging other guys around me which isn't a normal tactic that you do but as I kind of like encouraged other people it encouraged me that like I was like able to hold a conversation with people and I just felt better from just like trying to actually help other people out and it shifted what was happening inside my mind inside my heart then I was able to kind of find my own

[00:16:22] Rhythm and start to work my way up in that race and finish 10th which I wasn't stoked on at the time like I was you know trying trying to get a medal but it's funny the further removed you get from these things and the older you get you you appreciate it more you know and I look back on it now proud of the was

[00:16:37] Meb also I mean meb's Meb got a silver if I recall in Athens in ' 04 right was was yeah and was he there in o08 he wasn't no so we were training together up in uh Mammoth Lakes and he was dealing with a lot of injury issues going into it so he I think he dnfed at the trials that year in 2007 he had some gnarly kind of hips stuff going on and that was actually really cool to um see me in that situation where he went through so many injuries so many downtimes and like even like mentally struggling with how to handle that and see him pop out the other end of that wi

[00:17:14] New York wi Boston um was just incredible so he's we were Neighbors in uh in Mammoth when we were training we live like 400 meters apart he's always been kind of like a big brother to me so I'm such a good dude and yeah I was you know in that race when he won lost in and that was such a special experience I remember I was I was having a bad a horrible day for you though yeah yeah yeah I was running terrible yeah but I just remember coming up over Heartbreak

[00:17:39] Hill and you know we don't know what's happening out there I knew Meb was away and I knew that like our group was pretty far back and I knew he had a chance of winning it but you don't know what's happening so I I was coming up over Heartbreak Hill and I remember just yelling at the spectators on the side I was like how is Meb doing when he came past here and they're like he was winning when he came past and I knew if he got over heartbreak kill in the lead he was going to win that thing so it's funny it's um it is hard to believe that that was 2014 because that's just one of those races that is seared in my mind I remember it so well because I used to I don't want to say I trained with me but we trained at the same place in San

[00:18:16] Diego so there's this place called Fiesta Island it's it's perfectly flat so that's where all the time trial races are so uh three or four days a week I would do my training on Fiesta Island it's 7 kilometers and it's perfectly flat and and me would do his Tempo runs there and early on a Tuesday or Thursday morning we'd be the only two guys out there me on my bike him running um and you know I think it's actually worth pointing out to people listening to this who aren't familiar with some of these times just how fast you guys run so you threw around some numbers earlier like you know marathon pace 442 to 448 I mean these are such insanely fast speeds that

[00:19:00] I think the the likelihood that a person could run that speed for half a mile is virtually zero right like I know right now I could not go out and run 800 meters half a mile at that pace there's simply no way yeah which is funny because I can't either I I know but it's just it's so fast and I used to have a sign in my office that said 442 so it was a pace clock and it said 442 and it actually came from I I remember getting this idea off something one of your sponsors did for one of your races many many years ago they had a treadmill set up to that pace and the idea was they just had random people show up and they're like how long can you hold the pace that he holds for a little over two hours and so they'd put a harness around a person's waist and they'd make them run at 442 and these people were getting shot off the back of this treadmill after 30 seconds 40 seconds one person made it a minute right and the reason I had that sign up in my office was I was um very circumspect [ __ ] off by the notion that people would say hey man we're training for a marathon not a Sprint this is a marathon not a Sprint and I tried to make the point to people that okay but if you want to win a marathon it feels like sprinting so let's be clear it's one thing to go out and run a marathon and take 6 hours to do it it's another thing to go out and win a marathon so if you're trying to win a marathon you have to understand the pain that these guys are in you have to understand what 442 means it is insanity and yes for you it is below your threshold but your threshold is so high so you know looking at you know Meb win that race and and having seen him in the months leading up to that and I'm on my bike and I'm seeing how fast he's running you know doing his tempo repeats and stuff it's just it is really amazing and I I do think it's one of those things where I wish everybody could try to run at that pace and do the exercise that that was done on that treadmill or something like that because otherwise I think a lot of what we're going to talk about today is very hard to understand from a physiological standpoint yeah I mean if like people just go out to the track and just try and run 200 meters at uh yeah like my my half marathon pace is 433 per mile right so that's 34 seconds per 200 so if you just go out to the track and try and run a 34 it's pretty crazy because yeah like you know guys when they're racing they make it look so effortless like Kip chogi when he's running sub two like it looks so slow so and it's 34 seconds per 200 is what he's running and that is very fast like 200 but yeah I mean what you're talking about Peter is super important like distance Runners are not slow like like world class marathoners like I want the guy now I'm coaching you know I want the guy who can run 49 seconds for a 400 like that's the kind of speed you have to have now you don't have to have that speed while you're doing marathon training but you need to have had that speed before that like as a kid growing up that's why like with kids I'm like get as fast as you can because if you want to be a world- class marathoner I need 49 second speed right like that's the kind of speed that Kip chogi has and then that carries you on to be able to run a great mile to be able to run a great 5K like it's all built off speed like that's what we work on on with training it's like let me develop your 5K speed your mile speed first which is directly correlated to your Sprint speed let me develop all that and then we'll grow that into 10K speed then we'll grow that into half marathon speed then we'll grow that into

[00:22:41] Marathon speed but marathoners are they have wheels and we would have to train in training I'm doing 50 meter Sprints twice a week in the middle of marathon training 50 meter Sprints like little Hill Sprints we're in the weight room like you got it's a power to weight ratio like so you got to have power and that's an area I've grown a ton in since

[00:23:01] I've retired from running and as I look back at my the weights I was doing I I just kind of like scratch my head I'm like I wish I could go back and do things a little bit differently in the weight room because I don't think I was using my time effectively there but um yeah it's power is so important for for distance Runners of all I mean unless maybe if you're doing like super ultra stuff maybe it's not quite as important but for I think I think it matters everywhere and I think I I know that Meb was doing deadlifts as he was preparing for 2014 I mean um one of the I talked to a guy who had had had overseen part of his strength training program and one of the things he was really fixated on was his strength to weight ratio is measured by a deadlift yeah hex bar deadlift right that's right hexar deadlift with a um High Ecentric pardon me high concentric and a dropped

[00:23:52] Ecentric so no so you pick it up drop it pick it up drop it right so the reason for that being the Ecentric tears the the muscle fibers as you're tearing the muscle fibers that's what's creating hypertrophy we didn't want any hypertrophy we just wanted the strength so it was pick it up drop it pick it up drop it when Meb first started if I recall his strength to body weight ratio for a single rep max was 1.3 so pretty pathetic right if we can to be honest right he could only deadlift 1.3 times his body weight um I believe going into Boston he was able to get to 3 to one maybe it was 2.7 but it was in that vicinity and the logic for this was really just physics when you run you have to hit the ground with a toe you know with let's assume your toe striking not heel striking but your foot has to hit the ground the harder you hit the ground the harder the ground hits you the harder the ground hits you the higher you go the higher you go the further your stride and so um they basically had calculated that for Meb to run the pace he wanted to run in Boston that year he needed to add four Ines to his stride and to do that basically required taking his maximal Force per unit body weight from something like 1.3 to 2.7 that was going to translate to four more inches of stride so he didn't increase his stride rate he just increased stride length and that was done through strength and I think I suspect that that's becoming more understood in running now right because you know there was a day when I ECT

[00:25:29] Runners were told don't lift weights right you want to be as skinny as possible uh it's not about that type of strength and I'm guessing that that's not at all how you coach your Runners no yeah we're we're super into strength training and kind of like you're saying like your my understanding even has changed so much throughout the years where like I used to always think of like think about your foot action hitting the ground I always thought it as being like a tiger paw and you're like pulling the ground when really that's not what you're going for you're going for like your say you're stomping the ground you're putting Force into the ground that's going to shoot you up and out right so like and I never thought about that way I always always just trying to like paw the ground and so that's where you want to use your glutes too right your glutes are your strongest biggest muscle and yet like so many

[00:26:13] Runners myself included as a pro Runner I had very underdeveloped glutes I would have been way faster way better if my glute strength was was better yeah and your hamstrings were probably quite weak and probably incredibly tight and right yeah and that those insights came from sprinters right so if I I believe Usain

[00:26:31] Bolt has the greatest uh Force per unit Mass ever measured on a um Force plate treadmill so these you've probably seen these these treadmills where when you run on the treadmill and it tells you how much force you're putting into the ground and I believe Usain Bolt is able to put six times his body weight into the ground with each strike with each foot strike I mean it's just it's crazy to think how strong that is yeah yeah it's unreal but yeah I think for people who are listening if you're a runner like try that next time you go out try like pushing through the ground rather than trying to Paw the ground and like how you contact the ground so important so a lot of people are rolling through the ground it's very difficult to utilize those glutes and to really put

[00:27:15] Force into the ground when you're rolling from your heel to your toe right so you got to like contact the ground like midfoot and just be like stomping the ground and but yeah the weight training helps tremendously with that so so so important for sprinters for yeah and the hexar deadlift that's my favorite lift like if I if I was advising runners or when I am coaching

[00:27:35] Runners that's the first lift that they do on the day it's the most important one and the one that we're always trying to increase the amount of load they're able to handle with that have you used this device called a g-light so it's these two little red boxes that shine a a laser beam between them and they measure how high you can jump and your ground contact Time h no no that sounds interesting interesting so it's become part of my training now and um so the way it works is it's shining a little laser across the floor so you lay these things down on the floor and if you stand between them static and you jump and come down it will tell you with

[00:28:12] Incredible Precision how high you've jumped because it measures how long you're off the ground and it it's it's a simple way and you know it's a simple physics formula to figure out how high you went um so that's really interesting so one you can use it for static vertical jump but I think where you would find it more interesting for your Runners is when you do depth jumps so now you put it in front of a box and you have the athlete jump off the Box hit the ground and jump up now it gives you two pieces of information it tells you how long you were in contact with the ground and how high you went and the mark of a great

[00:28:50] Runner or a person who is very good at generating fours is you should have a higher vertical jump when you jump off a box and land and go up than just static most people don't most people will jump higher static off the ground than off the box and the reason is their ground contact time is way too long and they dissipate way too much force I forget the metrics that um

[00:29:18] I I believe you want to be beneath 28 seconds of ground contact time I think that's the number um I struggle with this so so I'm still jumping higher from a static than off a box um and my ground contact time is always north of3 seconds so this is one of the things I've been working on not because I'm remotely interested in running fast but because

[00:29:39] I'm interested in become very in in my feet becoming very good at low dissipation um and and load transfer and force transfer so I think that's just a very important skill as you age whether you're walking down a flight of stairs whether you're hiking um but for a runner I would suspect if you could get people down into a ground contact time of like 0. 2 to 0.25 it that's going to translate to exactly what you're saying because the way you describe it like the the sort of rolling foot on the ground like you're never going to get forced that way you're just spending you could be spending you know 6 seconds on the ground when you're rolling your foot across it instead you want to be like hitting it super quickly and getting up yeah you know what blows my mind about that though as we're talking about this

[00:30:24] I'm just thinking I'm sure you're familiar with Jim Ryan right yeah so I'm just thinking about him and somehow he was a heel Striker and like I know of like I think daythan renhe is a heel Striker uh obdi I just saw him the other day up in Flag stop he's also a heel Striker I'm like how are these guys running so fast from heel striking like is it a thing where like they could be much faster if they weren't heel striking or like is there some kind of advantageousness to that that we're not aware of or seen I don't know I'm super curious about that I would put put it in what you said earlier it might be that a combination of a there are just some people who really you know adapt to a certain way of doing things and it might be that they run really well despite that but I I everything I've read on this subject matter and all the experts

[00:31:13] I've spoken to suggest that you know for foot to to toe striking is The Way We Were Meant to run you know if you if you go back and look at kind of how our ancestors ran and you look at really how force transfer would be most efficient you don't want to be striking on the heel yeah I mean that makes sense to me but yeah it's it's interesting to see people getting away with it but I I'm with you I'm always interested in like not like what can you get away with but what is optimal right because I think it's easy to do that when you look at like how the Africans train like we've spent a lot of time training in Kenya and Ethiopia and like they don't even go cool down and these are the best runners in the world on the planet and they don't go cool down and I'm like we're we learned to cool down like Middle School cross country and the importance of that you know and and you find yourself being like oh maybe they got it right maybe we shouldn't be cooling down but I always remind myself like well what is optimal like that's really what I'm after not like what can you get away with you know yeah so so let's I mean I've gotten so off track I wanted to kind of go through a bunch of other things but like I just want to now geek out on all this other stuff but but I I think just for folks to have a bit of a sense of your trajectory because we've touched on so many things I mean we very quickly just in passing throughout there the Houston

[00:32:27] Marathon where you became the first American to break an hour and you still hold the American record for that a record that may stand for some time um but let let's go back you're growing up in Big Bear your dad an amazing baseball player um and you were typical baseball basketball Etc didn't pick up running if

[00:32:44] I recall till you were like 13 or something yeah correct yeah you did your homework yeah man well I remember uh and you did like your first run you just decided that I want to run around the lake that's a 15 mile run do how much did that hurt oh it was the Pain Train the whole time yeah like there was there was no like magic to that run right it was like just suffering the whole time I was in basketball shoes I had no idea what I was doing my legs just felt like they just got pounded into a million little pieces like halfway through it so I mean we had to stop multiple times we stopped at a liquor store and got like a soie like a drink or whatever and stopped and

[00:33:23] Ice my legs and really like if my dad wasn't there I probably would have made it around the Lake but that was such a learning experience for me now as a dad of for myself being like how do we respond to our kids and their crazy ideas you know like this was just some like crazy thing that I decided to do when I was 13 and yet look what it did like it it totally changed the trajectory of my entire life like completely different now and just some crazy idea it' been very easy for my dad to be like you know what let's just start with like a 2 Mile Run instead of starting with a 15 M run you know but that that wouldn't have captured me in the same way like I needed a hook that was just going to be like I'm forever changed like the the trajectory of my life is never going to be the same like

[00:34:05] I needed something big like that and uh I'm so glad that he didn't like try and gun down my ideas just like all right if that's what you want to do let's let's I can't imagine that pain actually because I had a very similar experience at a far smaller distance when I was maybe 12 and I just woke up one day and I was like I want to go run five miles I want to see how fast I can run five miles and so I put on my crappy shoes and I went out and I ran 5 miles and it hurt so much it hurt so much and the next day I was like

[00:34:40] I'm going to do it again and I went out I did it again and it hurt so much and I went out and I did it the third day and it hurt so much and then something on the fourth day changed and on the fourth day I felt awesome and then I just never stopped uh you know I just started adding more distance from there but when you think about how nonlinear running is like if I was feeling that pain at five miles five miles is a quarter of 13 in terms of effort so um just like what was going through your mind at the Five Mile

[00:35:15] Mark at the Eight Mile Mark you know what what were you act were you were you thinking I love this pain I love proving to myself that I can do this or was it part of you thinking why am I doing this yeah I mean there were so many thoughts that's the thing about distance running it's really like what's going on your head is hugely important right and so like now like when I'm training athletes on the mental aspect of it I tell them like you got to have a whole bunch of different like arrows essentially that you can pull out and use because it's like sometimes you use one thing it doesn't work you got to go to something else and it doesn't work so I have all these different tactics in managing pain and discomfort but like honestly like one of the biggest ones that is most helpful for me is simply turning the mind off you just turn the mind off and you just like keep putting one foot in front of the other like it sounds so simple and so basic but like I can tell you like the last 5K of the Boston

[00:36:07] Marathon when I'm in a world of pain and just trying to get to the Finish Line as fast as I can there's no like profound thoughts going in through here it's just like put one foot in front of the other as fast as you can like it's that simple right and it's so in those moments like often times I'm just like turn the brain off just keep moving like just keep moving and a lot of it is just like to like refusing to believe that you can't take one more step like you get yourself at least I get myself in trouble when I start thinking too far down the road I'm like oh I still have so far to go there's no way I could possibly do this like you get overwhelmed by the the scope of the challenge sometimes especially when you're do trying to do something you've never done and that's worse than the actual discomfort you're feeling right it's that being overwhelmed thing is is not a good feeling at all and that's that's what makes people give up and give in so if you can bring yourself back to the present to what you're doing right now what I found is there's always enough to get me through this moment there's not always enough to get me through like what's coming all down the line if I try to just like I'm going to handle all of it right now it's like no just just just do what's right in front of you just handle what's this mile that you're in right now which is why you know I wrote my book entitled run the mile you're in because just like you just got to bring yourself back to being present in this moment and there's always enough to get you through this moment one of the things about running that strikes me is difficult in that regard is you can't dissociate yourself from the visual cues of how much lies ahead um I used to swim long distances and there was a there were a couple of really dogmatic rules that we had in in ultra distance swimming and one of them was never look up towards Shore like you only know you're coming to land when you start to see the bottom of the ocean like when you're you know and that you typically don't get that until you're like half a mile from Shore but this idea that you would ever lift your head up to look forward is a total disaster and I got a really bad taste to that on a swim that

[00:38:07] I was doing it was a training swim across Lake Tahoe so this was not supposed to be a very difficult swim this was a 12 mile swim and um that should have taken a little under six hours um but I I didn't do my homework I didn't hire a good boat captain and he didn't understand the navigation so to make a very long story short we didn't we didn't go across the lake we zigzagged across the lake and when when we hit this 5H hour mark in my head I'm thinking I should only be two miles from

[00:38:43] Shore so I look up at him and I say how much further do we have and he says about two miles and I say or maybe four miles or something I forget what the number was but it made sense whatever he said made sense and then I stupidly looked towards the shore and had a mental image of what it looked like I couldn't see the trees or anything like that you could it couldn't make out detail so I just put my head down and hammered for two more hour for one more hour thinking okay but in an hour I should see the bottom of Lake Tahoe coming up at me and I didn't it looked exactly the same and I lifted my head up and it looked exactly the same meaning we were much further than he told me we were and that is the closest I've ever come to like quitting a swim I was mentally destroyed and then I said how far are we and he said I don't know I think like four miles and I was like come on like what are you talking about like you can't mess with a swimmer like

[00:39:41] I mean I was so pissed off um but again what did why was I pissed off I was pissed off because I had an idea in my mind that was so far ahead I wasn't in the in the Mile right I wasn't in that moment and I think for runners like you don't have the luxury that a swimmer does to literally I could swim with my eyes closed I I can really drown out all of that other stuff and you gave that example of being in Beijing and it's not just that you know you're in 60th it's that you see the helicopter that's over the leaders and they're a quarter mile up the road that requires an extra level of mental fortitude in my mind to be able to run your race at that point yeah yeah and like I said it all comes back to getting excited right if you're going to perform well you got to be excited about how you're doing so it's like how can you get excite not just like make it through that moment but find something to get excited about in that moment you know so um there's so

[00:40:40] I talk a lot about like reframing things in your mind and that to me is like one of the most helpful things that I use all the time right so like for example I was just doing this crazy challenge is called chop wood carry water where I split a cord of wood at my house and Flagstaff and then I drove to the Grand

[00:40:57] Canyon ran down to the bottom of the Grand Canyon holding these seven gallon water these are the big blue ones right I saw this on instag yeah yeah they weigh like 62 pounds each when they're full so I was running down there it's a 10k run 6.3 mile run down to the bottom of the Grand Canyon you dropped 5,000 ft and then got to the Colorado River fill them up and then farmer carry them out of the Grand Canyon and I remember being down at the bottom and filling up those jugs and just being like looking up and and have just run all down that and I was like what did I get myself into like the sun was already getting down super low and uh that was the hardest part of the whole challenge for me was like just starting it out right because I knew I knew was waiting for me I knew how far I had to go but again I so just to be clear you carried you carried 63 pounds in each hand of water up 6.3 miles at basically a grade of I don't know seven or eight perc I'm guessing right yeah yeah I think it's like 7% grade yeah how long did that take you six hours and help me understand what your hands were doing were you using grip did you have like wraps around your hands or something no no just just hand in it I have good uh I have good calluses on my hands from all the lifting I've been doing but yeah I mean my hands took a beating but actually interesting did you ever have to like put did you ever have to stop and put them down oh yeah yeah yeah I can only carry him like like 50 m at a time so it was it was a lot of carries yeah that is that is actually more insane than your deadlift 500 lbs run a

[00:42:39] FIV minute mile attempt which also was super impressive but th what this farmers carry thing is ridiculous actually that's that's it it was it was such a crazy experience you know but I was talking about reframing and I had to reframe a lot in that you know cuz I thought I was like oh I think it'll take me like four hours to carry these out and our goal was to try to beat the Sun but like I said the sun was already like it was like 3 4:00 when we got down to the bottom so I was just like found myself wanting to get frustrated about how this was going how long this was going to take I'm never going to get out of here all those thoughts are going through my mind you know and I just had to like reframe it and come to pece with like what was happening out there and just accept it and then get excited about it you know like I was looking at the Moon is coming up is so epic like it was dark all my buddies are there cheering for me giving me food and water and stuff it was just such a beautiful experience but

[00:43:36] I had to reframe it to be able to see it that way because how I was seeing it at the bottom of the canyon was like oh man this is going to suck what I get myself into I don't know if I can get out of here like all those negative thoughts but then as I was able to accept it and then reframe it then I was able to embrace this really beautiful experience and one that was life-changing for me that you know I'll never forget getting to the top of that Canyon and putting those jugs down and how good it felt to like finish that thing you know but I had to kind of like change how I was thinking about the whole situation which is what you have to do when you're in a race and it's not unfolding how it's how you want it to unfold well I can relate to that on a number of my swims where things didn't go well but you're right it's there's something about saying I'm not going to quit I'm gonna put my head down and I'm going to do this um you when you get to the other end it's pretty remarkable and I've had the ability to be you know coaching people when they do swims and in in swimming once you touch the boat or anything you're disqualified so it's a very you can have zero assistance out there and one of the things that I learned from watching other coaches and then I would do it with people is whenever a swimmer says they want to quit I wouldn't let them do it right I would say no no no

[00:44:49] I'm not going to let you do this you got to give me another 10 minutes and then we'll talk again and if they still want to quit I say I need another 10 10 minutes and then we talk and then I make them do this three times um and part of it is just to show them that they can swim another 30 minutes so if you can swim another 30 minutes you could probably swim another four hours or whatever the amount is but also you realize like and this sounds so cruel but you also tell them like you you make sure they understand that what they're doing is you want to quit right now just to be clear you you're you're saying you want to quit doing this thing right now is that right yes okay well if you know after 30 minutes then fine you can come on out but um I guess there's just no substitute for that feeling of when you when you finish uh although that that literally strikes me as the hardest physical thing I could ever imagine doing um because it's it's say more about what the cardio struggle of that was like like what you know you're are you kind of in a slow jog Trot like what what kind of pace were you moving at yeah so like basically a fast walk you know you you want to make your legs and heart do as much of the work as possible because just holding that much weight in your hand becomes an issue you know um but really the reason why I'd say is even harder than running a marathon is when you're running a marathon like my heart rate's usually around 167 I have a really low heart rate what's your maximum heart rate I don't know what it would be now at that time though I I couldn't get it over 200 it was probably like 195 197 like I had a resting heart rate of 27 when I was at my fittest like it was I've always had a really low heart rate but it get super low now it's nowhere near that um but all that to say like usually the first 20 miles of a marathon or maybe the first 17 miles like feels pretty good you're conversational you're floating along like it's just fun you know you're just enjoying the ride and then of course like it gets really hard and you got to grit down and bear it whereas this was just like it was like I was doing interval training because I was right like I'm going like 30 second carries set it down take as minimal rest as possible what would a typical rest be when you did that 30 seconds on yeah like 30 seconds off kind of thing I would just go till I caught my breath and go again and uh and so it was like

[00:47:08] I'm breathing super hard when I set it down Catch My Breath just to where I'm breathing normally again and then go again so it's just like I was breathing if you listen to the video which we're going to have a whole video coming out here pretty soon like you'll hear me just breathing super hard like a truck like the whole time and it's like six hours straight of doing that was the most intense thing I've ever done before like I'm not used to breathing that hard the whole time so how much did you Dr more that do you have a sense of heal what what volume you consumed of water and whatever the the amount of water and calories I was taking it was insane I had a my buddy was helping me I had a lot of buddies helping me but one guy was just in charge of doing my food and water after every third carry I'm taking in water and then I'm taking in Sugar like I was eating gummy worms like a maniac I probably took in like like 3,000 calories coming up from the canyon cuz I was just burning so much cuz I'm like 183 lbs plus carrying 124 pounds of water weight and you're going up 5,000 ft so my body was just like my metabolism was Unreal but that was a big part about being and why I wanted to do this so check this out like the biggest to me the most important part of training whether it's run training or weightlifting training is consistency and it blows my mind mind what my body's capable of doing and my athletes are capable of doing when you're just consistent so when I was training for this I never did longer well twice I did longer but for the most part I did 20 minute carries every other day so that was all the training I did 20 minutes 20 minutes with basically the same weight 60 call it 65 pounds in each hand and you would do the same thing 30 seconds on 30 seconds off 30 seconds on 30 seconds off for 20 minutes yep and then off of that I was able to do a six hour carry out of the can and did you do that at elevation I'm sorry at grade as well not on Flats no just flat which you know like I I could have train for it better but like I'm a full-time dad I got my lifting that I'm into I coach my wife I have online training business Run free training so I have a ton of stuff going

[00:49:14] I don't have time to go do like hour water carries but plus it's easy to be consistent when it's 20 minutes right like I can't find an excuse and be like oh I don't have 20 minutes like I would get home late at night and put on the headlamp and if I hadn't done my carry go do my carry because 20 minutes is nothing right I can be consistent with that whereas if I'm trying to be like okay every other day I'm going to do an hour nope I'm not going to be able to stick to that you know so I think a big part about being successful in running

[00:49:39] Fitness is like just make the bar low make it easy to be consistent right so yeah I did all that off 20 minute carries but I knew what is super important in doing any kind of ultra stuff is fueling right so I knew I was like if I take in enough calories and I stay hydrated I'm going to be okay I can get through anything right but how much did you need to experiment with that because that was um that was something I experimented with a lot um in my own very very very modest forms of endurance training was learning the fuel and um and making dumb mistakes sometimes like did this I did this one training swim uh many years ago um and it was like kind of your penultimate like it was the longest training swim I would do before the actual swim so it was like a 24 mile swim so I did an 18 mile was the last training swim and someone had told me hey a really good way to avoid getting the runs is to take like I forget what it is like what's the anti-d EM modium yes exactly it was em modium and I was like well you know it's funny I've never had the runs when swimming but I'd hate to get it I should try I should see what happens if I take a modium before this swim so sure enough and of course like an idiot I don't just take the recommended dose I take 2x the recommended dose and so I'm out there and in in I think at that time my regimen was 200 mL of fluid every 20 minutes so 600 mL an hour of fluid multiplied by I think that turned into a seven maybe an 8 Hour swim and the last four miles I was about to I thought I was going to die like I was so bloated and it didn't really occur to me why cuz it was like you know 8 hours earlier that I had taken the EM modium right I I never put two and two together that this was the problem so we finally we started in

[00:51:34] La Hoya swam up to like I don't know salana Beach and then swam back down and when when we get back to Shore and my friend who is guiding me pulls the kayak on the beach and I pick up the kayak to carry it with him so I'm in the front of the kayak he's in the back we're carrying it on the beach it's like this beautiful day in La Hoya families are playing everywhere this kid had dug a big hole in the ground next to his sand castle and as we walk by it I just went and I just puked like literally it looked like8 lers of of whatever it was

[00:52:08] I was drinking like Hammer Strength something or other like into this hole and I was like all right note to self man em modium not for swims but but that's a dumb example but like um you know you mentioned like the amount of sugar you're consuming but I know some athletes who L who just cannot not put sugar in they get really sick they have to use more complex carbohydrates so how did you um how empirical were you both let's go back to your marathon training when it was like everything's on the line this is your this is your job how deliberate were you in figuring out what was the right ratio of Goo versus Rice versus potato versus you know all of it in liquid how did you figure all that out yeah we were I mean we were super specific with it when I was running professionally and I think you know the running professionally my experiences they're carried over into this challenge right so um from my experience and a lot of our athletes experience like you can train your gut to take in stuff it's when you throw new stuff at it it's not used to when you have you know adverse reactions like you're having um so like for us number one I'm loading for two days before the marathon so and that was taken from like nutritionist I was working with he's like Hey listen like spread this load out like you don't want to blow it up and like be feeling terrible the day before for this race like load for 2 days leading up to it so what that would look like is I'd eat 400 calories of carbohydrate additional to what I'd normally eat when I'm training hard right so I wouldn't be like Oh I'm not running that much the last couple days so I'm going to cut down how much I'm eating I would still eat like I was training and the 400 extra calories of carb and I keep those carbs like super simple um because you know like a lots going on with nerves and Jitters leading up to your race you just want to make it as easy on your system like there's a a time in place for complex carbs and high fiber diet and all that stuff like usually that's like how we're eating but the days before race we're keeping it super super simple so for you that was what rice and potatoes yeah like white rice I was big on like the white rice uh pasta um sourdough bread I really like because it's lower glycemic index um but it digests really easy maltodextrin is a carb that I really like to take in you got to be careful I've had some bad uh experiences with other branded stuff that's like supposed to like like I forget what it's called like glucose a or one of those things I tried that before racing had my athletes try it and they had a terrible time with their stomach so you never want to try something new leading up to a race you haven't tried before so always try it in training that's just like a given you know but um I love Malto dextrin CU it's a liquid calorie so if I'm not hungry and it's it's uh tasteless so I can mix it up with the protein powder Shake It

[00:54:52] Up shoot it down that that's actually what my pre-race meal was was a liquid meal because I'd wake up from all this carb loading I'm doing the day before and I'd wake up really full and then I'd eat anyways so like three hours before the race take my shake with the protein powder molto extran a little bit of olive oil in there as a healthy fat to help slow things down a little bit more and then I was uh taking a gel right on the starting line sipping on water the whole time and then we we' actually how

[00:55:20] I did my bottles and we get so we get bottles every 5K so we get to put them out on a table you can put whatever you want in it you could strap a gel to it if you want but how I always did things is we would make them not very concentrated the first uh bottle and then they'd get increasingly concentrated as the race was going on and then they' get decreasingly concentrated later later in the race and the reason for that was like it's easier to absorb things when you're not as tired right so you kind of want to make sure you're front loading your carb intake during the marathon because your body can just process it a lot easier I mean when you get to 40K of marathon like you don't feel like taking in carbs at all so often times we grab that bottle we take a swig of it and then like it tricks your body to think it's getting carbs right and then we just spit it out we wouldn't even drink it but your body thinks oh carbs are on the way like and it responds like as if it's going to get carbs but doesn't get anything so that would give you a little jolt of energy just with 2K to go there but typically yeah the the bottles would be not as concentrated more concentrated we put a gel at 10K a gel at 20K and that no sorry a gel at 15K and a gel at 30k and that gel at 30k would be a caffeinated gel again just to get a little bit more of a hit of caffeine we time our caffeine intake to where we're taking it also like 75 minutes prior to race start um yeah and caffeine's a really interesting thing to talk about

[00:56:43] I'm like intrigued by that one because that was one of the things that when it came on board it was like oh there's no going back like I couldn't imagine doing a race without caffeine and yet like people have such different experiences with it and uh you know I've learned from like science recently how it does like increase your core temperature which is kind of detrimental to endurance activities but the thing that's interesting is like that I I understand the science behind that but that just hasn't been my experience at all like I am 100% faster with caffeine on board than without caffeine on board and I've tried both ways you know did you ever experiment with

[00:57:20] Tylenol no no I never did so there's some really interesting research and I was actually talking about this like a couple weeks with Lance Armstrong I don't know how it came up but we were talking about and same thing like he had never used Tylenol in the tour um it's a pretty remarkable performance-enhancing drug right so perfectly legal right W has not banned Tylenol to my to my knowledge um but we're talking about like a 1 to 2% performance boost uh it's not entirely clear if it comes through the temperature reduction or the pain reduction but um it was absolutely part of my stack during time trials right so you know a time trial is like basically an hour of threshold right it's it's super painful um and I I feel like I was getting like a one two maybe even at times a 3% performance gain from Tylenol and I would take like a thousand milligrams you know an hour before the race so I'm C I was just I'm curious if other athletes have tried that yeah no

[00:58:22] I'm not familiar with other athletes trying it but I'm definitely going to try that with my athlet now yeah I would I would give it a try and again it's we don't even really know how Tylenol works so it's for such a common medication we don't actually understand its mechanism of action but it is a very good medication at keeping temperature down which is obviously its first indication is to lower you know for fever um but it also reduces pain and it does it in a way that's different from NSAIDs um and you know outside of being needing to be careful on the dose because obviously it is a it's a very liver toxic drug at high doses U but within normal amounts like you know a th000 milligrams you know it's an incredibly safe drug and um it would be curious to know how how much of a benefit your athletes would get on that and how much you would get from it yeah I'll try that is there any application to lifting if it's keeping your core temperature down i' seem that' be helpful for lifting as well I don't know I haven't seen the literature and lifting you know where I did see literature and lifting and this is freaking hilarious um this was probably like eight years ago I saw some papers that looked at how Viagra improved improved lifting performance so of course I went out and got a ton of

[00:59:30] Viagra and um in the end I couldn't do it be not for the reasons that most people would imagine um the reason I couldn't do it is just the symptoms I was getting so light headed from it because it's a vasod dilator in part um and so so I maybe my blood pressure my blood pressure is not that high it's it's has actually kind of low and so maybe I just couldn't tolerate the the the sort of light headedness that came from it but the research was actually pretty compelling um at 25 to 50 milligrams of Viagra um boosting strength performance and and not just strength actually if I recall it was more of muscular endurance not strength actually um and I I didn't I didn't find the difference because of the symptoms that I had because of the side effects but that might be another thing worth you know experimenting with is kind of that 25 to 50 milligrams of Viagra to see what does that do as as far as um not a mean not a mean maximal effort but a submaximal effort repeatedly so probably you'd see more of that on your best 10 rep deadlift as opposed to your max deadlift okay that's interesting So speaking of core temperature have you played it all with Palmer cooling no are you familiar with that at all no I mean

[01:00:47] I I used to check my core temp before and after long swims because we had the opposite problem we were you're swimming in cold water and um so sometimes I'd actually swim with a rectal probe just to see how low and and usually your temp would drop like four 5 degrees so you'd start at 98 or 99 and I'd come out of the water at 93 94 so you were getting a different you were getting a performance detriment when your temperature went too low so really we really operate in this pretty narrow band of of temperature right too much and too little is is pretty bad right yeah it's interesting like I've been uh Dr huberman out of Stamford neuroscientist he talks about Palmer cooling so we've been playing with that a little bit like there's some pretty remarkable research coming out Stanford about the effects of that both in strength training and in the endurance space it's a little bit so the the best way is to dump heat core temp through your body is through your face your upper face where there's no uh hair and then also through your hands and the bottom of your feet so they developed like this uh glove and they've had this for years like this was there at Stan you put your hands in this glove and you dump Heat and the thing is you don't want it too cold right so you don't want it like icy cold just cool so it doesn't uh dilate Val of dilation or constrict yeah yeah sorry and so then you're dumping all your heat out brings your core temp down and then you're good to go after that so we've been playing a little bit with that with like holding cold packs in your hands and um in between lifts like holding cold things or putting your hands in Cool Water dumping your temp that's that's kind of like one thing that we're playing with a little bit more but it makes a lot of sense to me it's like why humans can do these uh persistence hunts you know where they go and Chase down animals it's because the animal like overheats it's not as good at dumping temperature whereas like humans are better at regulating temperature so if you can keep your temperature in that kind of optimal range in theory it should like increase your endurance as well so yeah there's always like I love like exploring this stuff and trying new tactics out like that so so when you mention this now I do recall I have experimented with this um with what's called a cooling helmet so I had this helmet that you um it had inserts into it that you would put in the freezer so like gel packs that you would freeze and you would put this thing on your head so

[01:03:07] I would ride on my trainer with this cooling helmet and it definitely made a difference but I never for some reason I could never bring myself to do it like in a race or something like that um but the other thing I've noticed on that effect was just this summer so this was my first summer living in Austin and obviously it gets super hot in Austin in the summer hotter than I'm used to in

[01:03:31] Southern California and um when I drive a race car um I've never used any form of cooling device before so I always just drive like you know you got a fire suit on so you have noax suit on you got a race suit on and especially when you drive a closed cockpit car so not a formula car you're not getting the wind as you're driving and of course these cars are hot as hell because you know he's a race car there's no air conditioning and you're just you've got all this engine heat coming at you so you really get hot and I've always just sort of suffered through this even though so many people I know say invest in a cooling vest so you have these vests that run ice water around your torso and and I I was like I don't need that I don't need that I don't need that

[01:04:14] I got this i got this i got this and finally one day my friend was like dude just try it I mean GameChanger total GameChanger to drive a race car with a cooling vest on under hot conditions um so tell me tell me more about this cooling vest because we play with these things as well I have kind of like the archaic ones it's like you put it you fill it up it turns into gel and then you freeze it and it's just like it's slowly like gets back to temperature but do these do you actually like plug them in yeah this would not be great for a runner because it's it would be too heavy but so it's a it's a shirt actually um and it has really really fine you know C you know like whatever little cables running up and down it and it it has a little box that runs cold water through you up up and down up and down up and down and in the car it's easy you just you have a power unit you're running it out of the car um so it' be it it did occur to me like is there a way like if let's say the thing weighs an extra six pounds like what would be the cost trade-off if you were on a bike with one of these things like could one of these things be engineered to only add like four or 5 pounds which would of course be detrimental on the bike but would it offset by the performance gain you'd have but obviously in a car it's an enormous performance booster um especially in close cockpit cars in

[01:05:38] Formula cars it's not as big a deal because you don't get as hot you like you're getting so much air blown on you but um yeah it's it's it's it it it blew my mind what a difference that the temperature would make in terms of performance and everything like even like that night when you're done the difference between the day you use it and the day you don't is is the difference between feeling like you're going to die and feeling like yeah I'm tired but I'm I'm okay yeah and I bet you're like mentally in a lot better place too right it's like when you're all super hot or super cold like it's so easy to go mental really quick so I bet it helps a ton for like your focus for sure it's it's it's and even little silly things like just like you're you're perspiring less and even though you wear like a a head sock a Bala clava like you know anytime sweat is getting in your eyes it's super annoying you know you don't you you want to keep your hands on the steering wheel so it's uh anything that they can get get around that but um so how do you implement that in a runner then like obviously I can see how in strength training you can use that but if you're training a guy to run a marathon what how can you incorporate any of these cooling things uh into the actual race yeah so I think part of it is like especially for guys who train in hot and humid places is just having it available beforehand right so at least like after you do your warmup you do your drills and strides you're getting your core temperature back down by doing some heat dumping with your hands you know um and then if you're doing training such as interval training you know you can get it in between sets so

[01:07:08] I'll have like a bucket of cold water at the track and just between sets go put your hands in there dump a bunch of heat and then back at it and it it definitely like I feel like it makes a big difference you know I feel like it's super helpful but in terms of like applying it while you're actually running that's where you got to get more creative so we done things with like these packs that you break you know those instant cold packs break those open and just hold them and you you only have to do it for like I think like 2 minutes is kind of Ideal to hold them for that long which is kind of a long time that's kind of a hindrance but if it's worth the trade and you're getting the performance benefit from it then it's you know maybe worth it but um yeah like I'm curious I haven't tried the the gloves that they have at Stanford that they use on the football team and a lot of the athletic programs but again like you can't like you know stop your run in the middle of race and put your hands in some cold glove but um who knows like what the application could be I it just create it just requires someone to get creative with it you know and figure out a way to make it more applicable to running like when you're mentioning like the biking I was like oh it' be cool if they could make like somehow the handles be colder you know put some kind of technology in there so then you're getting polymer cooling while your hands are on the handles like things like that they can find a way to do it in a lightweight way could be like really powerful you know yeah that that that's actually a great idea if it could be done again really light because these days most bikes are U most bikes are coming in at below the UCI limit of whatever it is now 14.9 pounds so most cyclists actually have to add ballast to their bikes you know in the tour to front like most cyclists are actually adding weight to their bikes um to to get them up to legal weight so yeah there there's definitely a bit of room to play with there I don't know how much but um that that would be that would be pretty cool so speaking of Stanford that's where you go to college right um

[01:08:54] I assume you were recruited very heavily to every you know top running Powerhouse program there was right yeah yeah which was cool because I was in the middle of five kids growing up and my dad was a teacher my mom's a stay home mom so we were always like you know pinching pennies so I knew like part of running for me is like if

[01:09:12] I'm going to go to a good college like I'm going have to earn my way there kind of thing you know um so yeah it was pretty cool to like be getting recruited all over the place and it's funny cuz Stanford was the one place I was like I'm definitely not going to Stanford cuz um you know I I wasn't heavily focused on academics in high school I knew the academics like they don't they don't cut slack to athletes there like we in it just like everyone else you know like there's not a lot of special assistance going on so I knew it'd be like academically a super big challenge for me as well as like the athletic part and

[01:09:42] I was like I don't know I just don't want to put myself in that kind of a challenging space and it was it was super challenging like it was three years of really big struggle and then you know I hit one cross country season really well was a part of a NCAA winning team two years there in cross country and then my my fourth year at Stanford um things just clicked and that's the thing I love about running and Fitness in general it's like everything can be going so wrong for so long and then yet like when when things start to click it's such a good feeling when you push through and you get to that point where it's just coming you know the weight's coming off the ground easy and um it's such a cool feeling that was the sensation I had during that fourth year me and my teammate doson went one two um in track and at that point like I was I was having a very lackluster career at

[01:10:31] Stanford i' never even been to NCAA championships and track but again in running it doesn't matter right it's just you and the clock and the other guys out there and everything was clicking we went one two NC's and all of a sudden it was like deals are coming in and I have the opportunity to run professionally and I'm say for my wife

[01:10:48] Sarah and we we I was planning on coming back for a fifth year but because things clicked so well that year I'd seen some my other teammates come through Stanford have a really good fourth year and then not do well their fifth year and then have no contract right did timing thing yeah I reted my freshman year I was like

[01:11:07] I said I was on The Struggle Bus I was hurt I was injured I was sick I'd get poison oak every winter like it was like the the perfect combination of everything going wrong I was struggling academically I was struggling with depression actually left Stanford uh for a quarter of my sophomore year wasn't sure if I was going to go back and you know I thought in that situation that I could change what was going on inside my head and heart by changing my location so I was like I'm going to go back home the last place everything was clicking for me and everything was working I was sick of the struggle you know and I went back home and got even more depressed and I was like well that that was stupid like go back to to where I knew I was supposed to be and that was Stanford so went back there and then things gradually started to get better and um but yeah I I had my struggles at

[01:11:54] Stanford you know like it was a a beautiful place to go to school love the people the environment I still like to go back and visit there but it was for the most part like a big big struggle in in all areas athletically academically and uh so yeah but again I hit it that fourth year and then the doors came open to to run professionally and uh left the farm after that what do you what do you think changed and clicked like what what do you think you were struggling with from a running perspective um CU I think in high school you ran a 402 mile which

[01:12:27] I I know you wanted to break that 4minute barrier uh which is pretty rarified air isn't Jim Ryan and Alan Webb the only two to do that or has someone else now broken four minutes uh for the mile in high school yeah at the time when I was running there was only four guys who had done it um so yeah had

[01:12:45] Jim Ryan two other guys blanking on their name then Allen and uh you know I was the same year you mentioned swim with Allen I love Allen like good friends with him such a good dude um but yeah I remember watching him run 353 at pre and it was just like my head exploded I was like I can't believe I just saw that that was just like that that was unbelievable right like that and then he went to Michigan and struggled right I mean it wasn't yeah yeah yeah he struggle his sophomore year yeah him and I like have a lot of parallels even like the year that we both hit it bigs 2007 um he set the AR in the in the mile I set the AR in the half and um we were like crossing paths all the time too like I was his roommate over in Europe in 2006 when we were over there racing that summer we were both struggling um for various reasons you know but um we we both like have very high highs and very low lows Allan and I are pretty similar that way you know but he's definitely like one of the most talented Runners I've ever seen like the amount of talent that guy has he just he he has such a good work ethic that sometimes it comes back to bite him like we'd be on the track in Europe and he go does his run and then he's doing like hurdle drills and plios and all this stuff for like hours afterwards and we're all like have left and we're showered up and eating and he's like still out there grinding right so he just like would be so intensely focused that um you know when it was clicking it was great but I think sometimes he kind of overcooked himself a little bit but um man such an immense talent and it was so cool to get to see him have his moment you know running 346 for the mile was he was just he was insane that year he was just on fire he's just un tou able if if the Olympics would have been that year he' been gold medalist like without a doubt do you remember his

[01:14:29] Olympic trials in ' 04 in Sacramento when he just ran away from the field like I you know that's again just one of those moments I remember because that that was actually the summer that I I think 03 and 04 were the Summers that I saw him the most at the pool and like you wouldn't believe that that was a 1500 in terms of the margin of Victory he had over those guys right like that looked like a 5,000 or a 10K in terms of how far ahead he was of everybody else yeah I mean he was so dominant when he was on like people weren't beating him he was he was impossible to beat so he was fun to watch in his in his prime so what do you think changed in your senior year oh yeah yeah we were talking about that I know I keep distracting you I'm

[01:15:11] I'm I keep I'm doing a horrible job here today I keep taking us on these tangents and I just yeah this is more of a dinner conversation than a podcast but yeah no I like it I like it um so funny thing is I'm always very concerned with the nuts and bolts of training what I'm doing right that's always my focus as an athlete and yet what I've kind of the lesson that I've had to learn from the time I've gotten into sports since a kid until now at 39 is like it's way more important how I do what I'm doing meaning like my heart condition what's going on in my head than what I'm actually doing so like for example like my tendency is to try to prove myself in training to myself like I'm not really trying to prove myself to anyone else I just want to know I'm fit I'm ready ready to go right so often times I'll come to these workouts and I'm racing them it's like I'm going head down like all out like everything I have inside me often times I'm going harder in training than I'm going in racing right and yet like that is not the best way for my body to absorb the work like I need to be making deposits not making withdrawals when I'm training so if I if

[01:16:15] I go into these workouts confident in who I am knowing the purpose of the workout then I'm in a much better place I'm absorbing the training a lot better so um what happened to answer your question was my identity was all wrapped up in my performances right so that's why I struggling with depression is I look in the mirror in the morning I was struggling with my running I was hurt I was frustrated with how things were going I wasn't getting better and so I just saw myself as a failure you know and um it's very difficult to have that happen every single morning get up look in the mirror failure failure failure failure you know and so when I went back home like my faith has always been a huge part of my life and uh I I started to realize like I need to see myself how

[01:17:00] God sees me and how God sees me has nothing to do with my performance right it's like think about like your kids right like you don't really care how good they are at a certain sport right like you love it's unal who they are yeah and so like can I love myself that same way right often times like we're able to love other people and treat other people a lot better than we actually treat oursel in our mind you know and so I started to kind of get to the bottom of that and be like you know what like God loves me regardless of how

[01:17:27] I do so I'm going to choose on a daily basis it wasn't a onetime thing it's still something I have to cultivate to this day of like I'm going to choose to love myself regardless of how I'm performing right like what really makes me special has nothing to do with how fast I am or how much weight I can lift or any of those things and as that began to sink in it took all the pressure off myself like I was just carrying around this like heavy burden to every single workout every single race because if I wasn't proving to myself that I was important by running fast I was hating myself right and so as I took these weights off and be like no actually I'm cool with who I am like actually I love myself whether I have a great workout or a bad workout that just took the weights off and it also made me Fearless too it's like okay now I can go out and just air it out and I'm gonna fail a bunch of times and I can live with that I'm okay with that right so there's something powerful about coming to peace with the worst case scenario and it might sound like a place shouldn't go before a race but often times I do like to go there

[01:18:28] I'm like okay like I could go out with all these African guys go out and under 62 minutes for the the half marathon in route to Marathon at Boston I might blow up might not work out like but hey I know I can handle that I know I'm okay I'm cool with myself if that happens and I'm G give myself a shot to like and I think that's what we're kind of lacking for a lot of American distance Runners is the willingness to put yourself out there to take a big risk and that's with

[01:18:56] Africans their mentality is just like no you just go with the lead group and if you blow up don't take it personally get up and go again the next time right like they don't take their failures personally whereas like Americans myself like I take it super personally right if I fail that means I'm a failure for them it's like if they fail like it that's just a part of the process who cares like just go again you know so as those weights were able to come off me I approach my approach to workouts to races changed started to click a lot better a big thing is I learned also too like I didn't have to beat my work my teammates in training anymore like I could just work with them I didn't have to try to drop them even if I could drop them I was like I don't need to like I'm secure in who I am you know so that was a huge shift but again it wasn't like all of a sudden and Bam the results came it was like years and years and then it turned into something um so that that that was really the most freeing thing I think I've experienced in my career in terms of what's going on internally that freed me up to uh enter into my full potential in running and despite how much of just this kind of very friendly person you are I would imagine that you kind of alienated a lot of teammates when you came in with that mode of every workout is Hammer Time yes 100% like I would go home over the summer and usually it's supposed to be kind of like chill Base building training right and I would just train my brains out and I would come back and I would just be blast ing everyone all the time yeah I remember talking to now like one of my good friends and teammates Ian Dobson and he's a big reason why I did so well coming out of Stanford in my first years as a pro Runner he's like dude yeah we used to like not be a fan like you're just always trying to like like you'd always come back in super good shape and you're always taking it to us and uh and that changed like as I was able to work with guys that got along a lot better with them and I just learn like just communicate with people right like if I tell these guys like I'm working out with my teammates hey guys like I'm feeling really good I'm go a little bit quicker if that's cool like that's a lot different than just like taking off without saying anything so like for people who are working out and like group environments like it's crazy just how that little communication within the group can really shift things the

[01:21:09] Dynamics of the group and make it to where like everyone's cool with what's happening and you're not just like throwing in random surges and there's a lot of that that goes on and and running you know within groups like there's races and different characters and people who can't work out in groups and it gets it gets a little bit intense at times but if if the communication is there like guys can work together and actually make each other better so when you turn pro is that what 05 yeah um and

[01:21:37] I think your lead sponsor is A6 at the time right yep correct so had it entered your mind yet that you would find your sweet spot in this half marathon to marathon world or were you still thinking you know I'm going to be a 5k 10K guy like what were you thinking in 05 was going to be uh the place where you would Make Your

[01:21:55] Mark yeah so I never thought I'd run a marathon right so I grew up like loving the movie Prefontaine and you know that scene where he's like no one's going to tell me I'm not fast enough you know but like the truth is like I wasn't fast enough I wanted to be a mile right and kind of like what we're chatting about earlier the importance of speed it's like only having I ran 50 for 400 um in high school and but only having that kind of speed limited my upper end potential I mean in the 5,000 m guys are closing in 52 so if your top end speed is 50 like you're going to have a hard time closing in 52 right so your your best 5K is like 13 16 16 yeah and put that in perspective what's the American record in the 5K good question where's it at now it's around 1250 give or take yeah so at the time like that was one of the faster times coming out of college you know things are definitely shifting a lot with uh you know the new shoe technology and stuff in terms of times um but yeah at the time like that was a pretty solid run so and and that's why like coming off the wake of that it

[01:23:06] I spent a year professionally just focusing on the 5K didn't improve at all over the 5K my 5K stayed roughly the same I think I ran like 1320 something 1322 the next year and uh the Beijing Olympics were kind of on the horizon the trials was coming up the following year and it's kind of of those things where I was like I got to figure out like my vision for my running was always to run with the best guys in the world and what event I am I going to be most competitive in here you know I'm 23 years old I got to figure this out and so I there was all of a sudden an openness to longer distances um whereas before I'd always been like I said very close-minded just being like I'm just want to be a world-class Myer like Allen was you know um so how many half marathons had you run before Houston in ' 07 zero that was your first half

[01:23:54] Marathon yeah that was my first I had run a couple 20ks which is essentially the same thing it's like a a k less right so um but yeah I got worked on the track that first year and I'll never forget I was in London I was racing against um B which is the world record holder at the time over 5,000 meters and uh I remember I was coming down the backstretch of the track and I was watching on the Jumbotron pic and Craig

[01:24:17] Mam and Australian guy finishing in this kicking duel and I was like nowhere even close to him right and it was kind of like one of those moments of being like yeah this isn't this isn't my best event like a moment of realization so then that openness allowed me to start experimenting with longer stuff so I went home that Summer started training for some longer distance stuff did the world 20K championships the US national 20K Champs and it was clicking pretty well and then I got into marathon training over the win over the the late fallwinter and Houston was just supposed to be like a check-in along the way let's see how this marathon training is going was planning on debuting at the

[01:24:56] Los Angeles Marathon um because there weren't like a lot of offers out on the table having not really run a lot of longer distance races so take me back to this race in Houston because I don't I don't think I think I missed somewhere in there that that was actually your first half marathon because obviously the result of that race is so out of this world that it's it it's easy to miss that little detail so it's it's the beginning of 2007 year before you know year and a half before the Olympics you're sort of trying to figure out where you where you belong in this running world you show up to Houston it's and at the time the American record for a half marathon is an hour and 55 seconds so tell me what you're thinking at the start line what are your expectations what are you there to prove to yourself so I had written down on my hands this was like before the days of like a GPS watch that isn't overly cumbersome you know like they the big old brick ones but not like little nice ones so I was just using a timax watch right and so I had written down on my hand like three different categories of times that I was going for so like one if I was having an a day and that was like just under American record Pace one if I was having a b day which was like 6130 or something and one for like a c day like 62 flat right and uh and like I said training was just going phenomenal like where I was blowing my own mind but more like it's the feeling like that's what I love the most about Athletics and about running and about that day like describe Houston as being like heaven and hell at the same time it was Heaven because like it I was floating the whole time it felt easy the entire way it was insane like the coolest sensation one of the coolest bodily Sensations I've ever experienced in my life and if I could go to heaven and experience that feeling of running like that every single day I would like it was Unreal but the reason why I was also hell and it kind of haunted me is especially all throughout my running careers I could never get back there so it is my my best half marathon by far I never broke 61 again and I can never figure out how to go back to you went 59 5943 43 so you you obliterate the

[01:27:07] American record like that's over a minute off the American record right and so I was running going back to the story of the race like the first mile I was just going out and you know now we have so much science and technology and heart rate we can go off of and uh we're looking our watch million times but again I'm just looking at like my normal timx watch and so in what's happening in my mind in that first mile is I'm literally like going into my mind's eye picturing myself back on Green chch Road in Mammoth where we trained and being like if I was running a 13 Mile threshold could I maintain this effort that I'm currently at and the answer was yes so I was just rolling with it right came through the first milees like 5:35

[01:27:47] I was like that felt too easy like I wasn't supposed to be running this fast but that just felt too easy so me just like Notch it down a little bit more did an effort that I know again going back in my mind's eye I know I can hold this effort to the finish and next mil was like five 432 and then the next mile was like 428 and I was just like starting to scare myself a little bit I was like okay like let's not screw this thing up like obviously you're going to have a heck of a day today no one else is around like meb's in the race and all those guys like from the very first miles just me and the roads right but it didn't matter like I was so mentally close clicked in and like everything was just firing it just like all how it was supposed to be right like the most magical sensation like I've ever had and uh and so I just kept pushing and just again like it's waiting for it to get hard almost and it never never did like

[01:28:41] I had one issue out there around mile 9 where my stomach got a little bit turny because over half marathon we're not taking in any fluids if the weather's right the cool conditions and it was a nice cool perfect day to run in Houston that day flat course and so I wasn't taking in anything around mile 9 my stomach got a little bit upset and you know that passed a couple minut minutes later but literally like it was it was easy the entire way like I I'm still super curious you know if I had Pac makers and if that was a full Marathon what I could have run that day cuz um you know I got myself back in really good shape but never that kind of shape over half marathon again and uh and looking back on it that's why like I'm such a big proponent of speed now right it's like I spent not just the last year

[01:29:26] Focus On 5K development I had spent my entire running career from the time I was 13 for 10 years until I was 23 working on speed working on F and then all of a sudden I piled on marathon training where I'm hitting longer thresholds higher volume than I've ever done before and bang there it is right so that's why that 5K speed like I can't emphasize it enough with my athletes I'm coaching now like you just you have the further away I got from that 5K Fitness the harder the half felt the harder the marathon felt but uh that day in Houston it was just it's like a warm knife through butter all day long when you crossed that finish line um did you feel like you know I actually could have gone a little bit harder yeah that's interesting right because I'm talking about how easy it felt yet like I wasn't like leaving anything in the tank necessarily you know um so I felt like I was running as hard as I ran practice but I mean if you watch go back and watch like YouTube video like I didn't and that's why like when people do like Kip chogi Breaking 2 like he didn't look crazy tired after that right but there's also you get this huge hit of adrenaline when you come across the line do something like that like breaking 60 was kind of a lifetime goal for me and then to go and do it my first marathon and like Peter it was crazy too like so my parents were on the lead vehicle my wife was on the lead vehicle my agent my coach they're all on the lead vehicle so I'm literally staring at them the entire race and they're not allowed to ch or anything but you know like any athletic performance that I've done like I was just a piece of the puzzle right like it wasn't all me like my mom like she provided the safe place for me my refuge every time I would come back all rattled because I had a bad workout I got hurt or whatever like she was like she provided that home that provided that

[01:31:14] Refuge my dad was my coach my wife was there for me through the depression at Stanford and all the times all the good all the bad you know and so staring it the people who were your team the entire race was like hugely emotionally empowering for me as well you know so I'll never forget I was actually they they get to the Finish Line the lead car they kind of zip up the road a little bit but they Dro my parents and Sarah and my wife like 200 meters before the finish line and that they have to like they're like running back to try to get to the finish before I get there so I'm come down the finishing stretch and I see my mom just like booking it like trying to make it to Finish Line before

[01:31:54] I get there and I actually passed her she didn't make it so like if you look closely in some of the they might have blurred her out in some of the pictures but like she's in the back like sprinting behind me uh but yeah I'll never forget like coming across the Finish Line giving my parents a big hug giving my wife a big hug my coach and it was kind of this the sensation of like we did this you know like it wasn't so special cuz I felt like I had done anything incredible but it was like we all did this thing together and it was just just and amazing lifetime you know moment that I'll never forget now from a professional standpoint how much did your life change in that moment because that really put you on the map as

[01:32:33] America's great hope for the marathon in 2008 right yeah I mean it was it was huge I went from you know like a guy who was decent on the track NCAA champ so I had a little bit of credentials behind me that put me inside of the top 10 all-time performers over half marathon so it was kind of like all of a sudden this moment of realization of like oh dang like I have have a chance at this like I have a chance at medling in

[01:32:56] Beijing like I and all there was just the excitement of like I found it like I felt like I'd been hitting my head against a wall for so long with the shorter distance stuff just wasn't quite clicking right like it just wasn't quite me and that day in Houston it was like this is what I was created to do right and I think it's we all have this kind of experience in life where we're kind of searching out like what am I here for like why was I created like what is my giftedness when you find like that area where like this is why I'm here this is how I was M made to this is what I was made to do right it's kind of that moment of like whoa like this is this is it this is my thing you know and it did like create a little bit more of heighten my own expectations you know like after that like I never showed up in another race thinking I couldn't win or um not having high expectations for the race you know so that that was maybe a little bit of a harder thing for me to manage um but it was just more than anything just a cool moment of like realizing like now I'm I'm in the club you know with the best guys in the world

[01:34:04] I think you said it really well right which is this was Heaven this was hell and I the hell part of that is something that I've I've always observed great athletes with with a with just a tincture of sadness too because um the stage on which you compete is the most brutal stage because it's the one for which you have the shortest um halflife right so um you know when you say like this is what I was meant to do on the one hand most of us canot even relate to what you're talking about right like I can't relate to being the best in the world at anything any I couldn't relate to being the best the best the thousandth best person in the world at anything anything right physical not physical doesn't matter um but now when you take that thing that is your gift and you knowledge that well actually it's something that is very fleeting right like there's a very narrow window in your life in which you get to be really good at this and by the way as a runner technically it's a day right like you're going to have a single best run and you don't necessarily know when it's going to be you might be very good for a decade but there's really going to be a time when you look back and say that was the best I could ever do obviously for the half marathon we know when that day was four years later it would be your best marathon of all time um but I think for some people I I would imagine at least that makes being a retired athlete or an athlete who's passed his or her prime a very difficult process um do you talk with your athletes about that even though they're on the upswing right they're they're in the part of the you know hey I want to get better I want to get better but do you spend any time with them talking about hey this first of all enjoy this like crazy because it's going to be gone and it's going to be gone probably by the time you're 30 and you have the rest of your life to not be the best at this thing um and secondly here's how you can prepare for that yeah absolutely I mean

[01:36:06] I talk a lot with my wife about that because she's 38 turning 39 in April and she's actually running the best stuff she's ever run still which is incredible and I think speaks to like why women age better than men in a lot of ways um but what was really impactful for me at the end of my career was this moment I was in an airplane I was looking out over everything and just trying to get clarity about what was going on cuz I just been through four years of massive struggle right and what I felt like I was just kind of like having a little prayer session with God and what I felt like what I sensing is just this REM reminder that it's not meant to last forever because I think like you're saying Peter it's like when you're in it you feel like it is going to last forever and it is supposed to last forever but that's actually the like what makes life so beautiful right right is that like nothing lasts forever right it's like what makes the sunset so beautiful it doesn't just stay in the sky forever it's what makes life so special because it's not just going to go on forever right so um having that moment of realization that this it it's okay for it to not last forever it's okay that like that was my day and I I did I savored it for everything is worth right and that's absolutely what I tell my athletes as well like savor every second of it right but but life is going to change you're going to enter into New

[01:37:26] Seasons and life is beautiful every single day all around you right so like having this perspective of like yes this is very important this is what we're going after but like true beauty is around us all the time if we have the eyes to see it and the ears to hear it and so like removing oursel from the performance some ways can be super super helpful not only is we transition out of sport but even when we're in sport just being like this is something that is adding to my life it is not not my life right and like I can have this day in

[01:37:56] Houston have this very beautiful experience this very magical day but I can actually just go for a walk outside my house and look at the trees and look at the sun and the stars and be outside in the moon and get the same kind of like gratitude for life just by simply entering into nature and being fully present in it you know so um I've definitely like my perspective has changed I was for a long time just all wrapped into this performance performance performance performance you know and uh it's it's easy to be that way and I do enjoy going after performances I love like seeing growth seeing change in the body seeing adaptation um going after big goals like

[01:38:34] I love that's still very much who I am and I think that's something that helps people transition out of the sport a lot of people talk about having a sense of identity loss when they stop doing whatever their sport is but for me like I had to figure out how do I stay true to who I am because running was just an expression of who I was right um and it it was like my painting right but now like I have to find another mechanism to express who I am so I'm doing that like in the lifting space and these crazy challenges that I'm doing I'm still like finding a way to express myself and I think that's what as humans like we want to have that experience right like we're here for a reason and we want to express ourself on our canvas whatever it might be and when you lose that ability to be able to express yourself that's when things can get dark pretty quick right so like for people from my athletes who are transitioning out of the sports being like okay like how do you stay true to who you are like I love physical challenge I love seeing growth and so

[01:39:33] I'm going to express it now through lifting and that's going to come to an end at some point and then I'm going to find another way to express it but I think as long as we're continually finding ways to be ourself and to express ourself we're going to be happy individuals in some ways your experience post this amazing breakthrough in the half marathon is kind of paralleled in in a way with what happened in 2011 right so in you go into Beijing in '08 in some ways with the expectation of the

[01:40:01] Running World on your shoulders like you're you're going to medal in the marathon your trajectory has been unbelievable we talked about that race 10th Place finish still very impressive especially the way in which you did it where you went out a little tentative and then had to kind of you know try to reel people back and go from 60th to 10th um now let's fast forward it's 2011 how were you feeling going into the

[01:40:25] Boston Marathon that year was there what was it about your training that led you into that race so poised to do so well yeah so I I had a big transition so I was training up in Mammoth and then 2010 um left the mammoth track club and again like a big part was like my faith was inspiring that decision like I've always just been a super spiritual person have a ton of respect from people of every Faith tradition and background you know um but for my own Journey like

[01:40:54] I just love that part of life that spiritual Dimension you know and I was just really desperate to experience God in some way right so decided to leave the mammoth Track Club essentially like have God as my coach but really that just looked like like me spending a lot of time in prayer trying to connect with

[01:41:10] God and um again that's where I got this kind of like Revelation it's not about what I do it's about how I do what I do like that came from that season so I kind of went through the season and then I was kind of experimenting with some new styles of training that I'd never done before and again like new stimulus always is helpful for the body right so

[01:41:29] I'd been kind of in the same routine the same doing the same structure training and there's little variations and of course tell me a little bit about that because one of the things my wife actually insisted on today and I'm not doing a good job of it though I promise I will is she my wife's a runner and she really wants to know every detail about your training and so maybe we can talk a little bit about it here in the pre transition so I.E in the 2010 Mammoth days kind of what's your volume how did you warm up how much body work were you doing what kind of stretching all that sort of stuff like what were the tempo runs like and then I'm curious to hear what that looked like when you basically became self-coached right post post that departure yeah so it's pretty simple you know it's like uh just a layout like a quick sample week like every Tuesday I'm doing interval sessions where you're working on that kind of like 5K specific kind of speed um things like 6 by mile 10x K uh 800 M repeats 400 meter repeats

[01:42:25] I've kind of since like gravitated more towards shorter distance repeats 400s 200s things like that I think that's way more important for marathoners because you kind of want a lot of differential between how fast those Tuesday intervals are compared to your like Thursday or Friday threshold prior to your departure when they were one mile repeats and 1K repeats um let's say the main set was 10 by a kilometer or 6 by a mile that's the main set what's the warmup how do you go from like when you arrive at the track what's the first thing you do so we do like 20 minute easy Jog and then we'd come back do some like Dynamic flexibility or maybe some static stuff but not a lot of static stretching going on stretching has not been a huge part of like my my running all you actually want some tension in your legs think about it like your muscles being Springs like if there's some tension a a tightly wound spring is going to respond to the ground quicker right compared to like a slinky that's super slow so you actually want a certain amount of tension healthy tension you want full range of motion but so we're doing a lots of like

[01:43:26] Mobility work to get that full range but keeping some tension in the leg so not a lot of static stff that 20 minute jog for you is what pace that's like 8 minute mile I mean how slow yeah yep kind of like that eight minute mile Pace kind of range kind of just like let your body do what it wants to do but no effort right you're not breathing hard you're conversational the whole time get back you do that Dynamic flexibility and stuff going to some drills and strides and I have videos of all this on my

[01:43:52] YouTube channel run free training YouTube channel if people are curious to check it out um but drills and strides before maybe like it takes like five 10 minutes to do that the strides are maybe like six times 100 meters something like that and then you change shoes into your Racing shoes and then straight into the workout and then you would do let's say it's a six by a mile how fast would you run that mile so if you're your half marathon pace would be a 432 is your marathon pace would be a 442 to 445 how much faster do you need to run that mile so yeah if we were doing it up at altitude I would typically be running right around that kind of 430 Pace at 7,000 ft um so if you're down at sea level that's kind of equivalent to like 420 is maybe a tad bit under so that the 6X Mile and the the K that's more of like 10K specific workout um but again I would kind of gravitate more towards like 5K specific stuff um a little much rest in between each set so so with the miles we'd keep it fairly tight like 90 seconds to 2 minutes again kind of depends it's like when you're at altitude you take a little bit more rest but it's crazy like you know as you get fit like you recover super fast so um and the intensity you know it's like we're not doing like Max

[01:45:09] Sprints where those guys got to take like 10 minutes between Sprints right like we're very much like when you're doing that 10K range I ideally you're running effort you should be able to hold for 10K and you're stopping it a mile so you're not like killing it you know so anyway between 90 seconds and 2 minutes on the rest walking during the 90c recovery or standing still yeah you're walking kind of sometimes we're like walk jogging just like slow walk jog kind of depends like I like doing

[01:45:33] In-N-Out kind of intervals too um that was like one of prefontaine's workouts where you do like 200 meters fast 200 M kind of moderate so the moderate part would be at like 8 minute pace or even faster like like 7 minute pace and then the fast part is it like goal 5K Pace or slightly slower than mile Pace even so there's a lot of different ways variations that we take on those workouts and what would be the cool down at the end of that main set and then a 20 minute cool down and then uh and then the whole day you know we're just spent like resting doing some Mobility work eating um ice bathing which you know it's funny like the the science on the ice bath has changed quite a bit like we would go from these workouts in Long Run straight to a creek straight into cold water whereas you know the science is now showing you want your body to respond to the inflammation first so that's more what we do now where we wouldn't do an ice bath I don't we don't do a ton of ice baths in general but there's a whole bunch of other good positive effects of ice bathing like dopamine going up tfold and all this stuff right have some anti-depressant effects um and and would you be doing two workouts on that day or one so yeah so then we'll come back in the afternoon just like a 30 35 minute easy run and then go straight to the weight room and then do our leg lifting so that's that's a mistake I see a lot of Runners make is you want all your leg stressors to be on the same day and it's not what you feel like doing like you don't feel like doing weights after doing a hard run you do the hard run first and then ideally you come back in the afternoon you could do it right after the hard run but you probably won't get quite as much out of it because you're bringing fatigue into the lifting if you space it out a little bit more you usually feel better during the lifting um so yeah we do our hard leg session in the afternoon and then uh and then head home eat early to bed I always describe my life was uh more of a professional sleep than in professional running like honestly I was just sleeping all the time I would book out every single day from 1: to 3:00 p.m. would be my business meeting and so no calls nothing scheduled during that time and those were just 2our naps every single day so the the sleep and that's the thing so what were you sleeping like 10 hours a day between the nap and night yeah yeah probably right around there

[01:47:44] I'm like I'm probably in bed for 9 to 10 hours every night but there' also be some restlessness from the hard training and and honestly maybe even from sleeping too much you know I wasn't very sleep deprived so sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night be starving go get some a snack get back in bed lay there and awake for an hour or two then fall back asleep but just you want it's like like the Kenyans the Ethiopians they spend a ton of time off their feet as well right so it's like when you're not training you're trying to not be doing anything so we're like Runners Pro

[01:48:18] Runners are very lazy people like from day to day like we don't go for walks or hik or do anything it's just train eat sleep stay off your feet like and you're always aware of that energy expenditure you're trying to save as much as you can for your training I I remember in high school I grew up in Canada and so we had a lot of really amazing Jamaican Runners of course they were sprinters and they used to just tease each other so much because they'd be like they'd be like look we are the laziest people you will ever meet and if you want to make us run faster just put a couch at the Finish

[01:48:51] Line like whoever can get to the Finish Line first gets to lay on that couch um but it was really work hard play hard right it was really like super intense workouts these guys would do and then as much nothing as possible to really conserve energy now um as you probably know cyclists have to work very hard deliberately to calorie restrict and often they show up you know to you know major tour events right so not the one-day classic stuff but when you're thinking about the tour to France the jur the VTA these sort of huge stage races you know they're very depleted right they're showing up um you know like they're trying to be as light as possible everything comes down to this one single metric that I think running doesn't quite have but in cycling you have this thing called watts per kilo everything is watts per kilo if you lined up all the cyclists at the beginning of the tour to France and you could know what everybody's threshold was in watts per kilo that would predict the order they would finish barring strategic you know mishap or an injury or an accident um how deliberately were you watching your weight during this period of time or were you basically just saying I could eat as much as I wanted and my weight would basically float to a level that I was happy with yeah no I mean I was very specific with it and you know preface all this with just saying like it's not the most healthy lifestyle right like doing what

[01:50:18] I was doing training the level I was doing wasn't optimal for my health like my testosterone was clinically low every single time I tested it right how low in the hundreds like 150 something like that oh so you had the testosterone of a woman yeah yeah yeah which is really interesting like how do you run so fast with such low testosterone I don't understand that yeah I I when I finished residency my testosterone was in the 220s that's like through so it was probably in the low 200s throughout all of residency and not because of training just because of sleep deprivation and a whole bunch of other factors but wow I I that's 100s is staggeringly low yeah and it would it would kind of come back up when I take these two week breaks right so going back to the weight thing I would take I would get down to ideally I raced my best at 137 I got I'm 5 foot 10

[01:51:08] I got down as low as 127 but I wasn't if if I was less than 137 I was getting worse which is really interesting because I was on Lance's podcast and we were chatting about this and uh he said he didn't ever feel like he could get too light whereas I was much the opposite if I was under 137 it was it was not good for me at all Lance was a really big cyclist for for for his type of racing I mean Lance's race weight was like 160 to 165 um which for a guy who's 5 foot n 5 foot 10 that's quite a lot of weight for a for a for a guy who was such a good climber um and I think today we see guys being quite a bit lighter in the in the in that group like I think a GC

[01:51:56] Contender today is God probably like 140 pounds you know F 591 140 would be a great cyclist build um so for you to be so if if you're if you're optimal which by the way 137 that still strikes me as crazy light but if you're 137 were you managing up to that weight or down to that weight down to that weight so so yeah I take these two we breaks breaks where I wouldn't run at all and literally it was like donut eating competition for two weeks straight so I would I'd literally put on like over 10 pounds in in that twoe period And I hated myself for doing that like it wasn't good for me emotionally or mentally but it worked every single time from my buildup so again I'm not saying like athletes should do this right but my problem was I was getting so lean and so light I I should have taken a more healthy approach to putting on weight to being good to my body shap shiing my macros around during that time off and do it in a healthy way not with a bunch of crap like I was doing um but I'd put on those 10 lbs 12 lbs get up to like 150ish and then it'd be like a 6mon gradual reduction in body weight to where I'd get to that 137 just like a couple weeks before my competition and then I was I was good to go but also too like I think it's highly specific for athletes so like I said I'm in the middle of five kids my brothers who aren't athletic like walk around at like 165 to 170 so that's probably where my natural body weight should be somewhere right in that range and so I was trying to get down to weights that were pretty far from my normal right so and that's why it was like pretty unhealthy for me to be and why I couldn't stay down in those 137s 140s for very long because I would just get super super rundown my motivation would go down my training would go to crap so you know I was again if someone is more more naturally made to be a marathon or smaller frame sits already like their normal body weight would be like my wife Sarah like she's sits around like 110 is year round but even if she wasn't running she'd probably be about the same weight right so she can sit at that weight year round no problem whereas for me like it's not healthy for me to be down at 137 so I have to come back out of it so that's where it's really important for people just know their body and where it should naturally be and then realizing okay if you're going to manipulate it down to a range where you're the fastest in the is at you got to come back out of that as well yeah my wife's the same way sure her walk around weight is 110 111 and she has to work to maintain that weight as opposed to um do anything else and uh

[01:54:36] I I think that's probably why she's just a good runner is it's just she's naturally so light that uh it it comes to her easily in that regard um so tell me what volume what was your weekly mileage when you were still training with Mammoth so is probably you again this was like preg Garin days it's probably around like 110 or so um I thought it was more than that but then we got Gins and started measuring a lot of the loops we were doing for our easy running we're like oh these aren't nearly they're like a mile shorter than we thought so it's probably a little bit less than I thought but those easy days are just chill and I think this is the other mistake that a lot of Runners make is they're just kind of running the same all the time and that will get you to a certain level right like there's a place for that but if you really want to see how good you can get get you got to like have your hard days super hard and your easy days super chill so like often times like you know like I said I'm running 12 miles under five minute pace and then the next day I'm coming back and running like 8:30 pace for a easy run just super super chill and slow so having that kind of variance between pacing I think is super important I mean it's it's not really rocket science right it's like you stress the body you rest the body it adaps and then you keep repeating the cycle over and over it's not rocket science but you I mean if there's one thing that I spend a lot of time talking about with my patients when it comes to this particular aspect of training it's um and again this isn't to train them for to become competitive athletes but it's important from a physiologic standpoint as we think about longevity it's most people are training in this garbage Zone where it's too high in intensity to build a true aerobic foundation and too low an intensity to truly stress the body glycolytically so you know we talk about it in zones right so there we think zone two is how we describe it and this is we we Define it by lactate metabolism so zone two is that all day Pace lactate has to be below two Millar you have to be a this is a pace you should be able to hold all day from a metabolic standpoint you probably can't hold it all day from a muscular and structural standpoint but metabolically you should be able to hold this pace all day um and that's easier than you know people are used to to training um and then at the other end of the spectrum there's like got to be this real push Pace kind of your 4x4 Pace right four on all out four off and most people aren't used to that level of discomfort so they're kind of in this no man's land so they're suffering two problems one they're in a physiologic no man's land and two there's no variability to it anyway um so even though you say it's obvious I I think it's important for people to hear this discussion because I don't I don't think enough people understand both for performance and also longevity why you have to be at the more extremes of kind of zone two zone five is where the progress comes and one one kind of like easy way to help manipulate this system a little bit is if you're coffee drinker you talked a little bit about caffeine but like we' only have caffeine before our hard days and then so the easy day like you feel like death like you're tired from the workout but also because you don't have caffeine on board and you you're just kind of forced to take it really slow like you don't feel like you could run fast if your life depended on it so if you trying to like a lot of the clients were're working with a runfree it's like not reasonable for them to not have any caffeine on the day but we're like let's at least manipulate it so you're having it more so before the hard workouts and then a lot less on the easy day and and there are some athletes I'm sure you've seen that don't really get a benefit from caffeine like I never got a benefit from caffeine and to this day like I can drink coffee at any time of day has no bearing on my sleep so I get no up from it I get no down from it I just I could drink three coffees a day for a month and then stop experience no headaches no withdrawal not even notice it um and and there are different uh genes that are responsible for caffeine metabolism so so people do sort of vary in that but I've always been incredibly um envious of the people who are very sensitive to caffeine because it's an awesome tool to have in your toolkit for just this purpose but also just for wakefulness and overcoming jet leg and travel and stuff like that yeah yeah when used correctly it can be super helpful of course like when abused and if you're sensitive to it and you're drinking it later in the day and it screws up your sleep then it's you know stops being helpful but yeah yeah it's interesting it's like like I was saying everyone's an experiment of one right so that's why you got to just play with stuff till you find what works for you so once you became self- coached did you how did the workouts change what did you do leading up to 2011 Boston in terms of volume intensity and everything else so so one of the big adjustments I made I started spacing things out so I don't think I finished the week so we had the intervals on Tuesday you know and then like a long threshold on Friday so you get two easy days before that so you're feeling a little bit better for that threshold and tell me about the threshold the threshold is a constant it's like a simulated slightly higher than race Pace shorter distance yeah yeah and it gets more towards race Pace as it gets longer so we' grow those out you're starting out at maybe like five or six miles and then you get to where you're doing 15 miles straight without stopping and I would do three of those every single 12we buildup for a marathon which that would be a very typical buildup for Marathon about 12 weeks I make sure I get three of those long thresholds in and those were my biggest indicator workouts it's kind of like whatever I knew I could hold for 15 miles in training in the context of hard training right so it's not like you don't fully taper for this workout and just bang the heck out of it and be like oh I can run this for a marathon it's like no your legs like need to be a little bit fatigued you need be in the middle of hard training but then generally speaking whatever you can run for that 15 Mile threshold you can hold for a marathon which is also kind of like mindblowing and hard for first time marathoners to believe that CU you're like how do I go 11 more miles at this pace but that's the magic of tapering the energy out on the course the car bloating all that stuff like your body finds a way to be able to hold that through so that that 50 mile threshold or that threshold of varying distances on Friday and then Sunday coming back with a long run so again you're doing that long run with a little bit of fatigue in your in your legs that' be anywhere from an hour 45 to 2 and 1 half hours but during that time we're and we would go off time not distance but we're covering I sometimes I'd be running over the Marathon distance for two and a half hours right so those are those are high quality efforts often times it's kind of like medium pace so say maybe six minute pace for the first half of that and then the second half of that we're doing like flick style running where you're practicing changing gears on Tire legs and just hitting that aerobic end a little bit harder towards the end of it but a lot of it is just like mentally learning like how do I turn my legs on when I feel really dead when I'm 25 miles into this race how do I what cues can I go to to turn things on and and to change gears here because it's it it doesn't matter if you're running six minute pace or 8 minute pace when you get 20 miles into your run you feel tired right and so you got to just learn like okay what mental cues can I pull on here to to turn everything on okay so but everything you just described was how you were doing it before 2011 so then and then how did you tweak that formula so I started spacing things out a little bit more I started just taking two easy days between every session so I was I was uh focusing on like a nine 10 day cycle but then I was making those workouts higher quality bigger so like one workout that I implemented instead of saying like those Tuesday short sessions which just might been a little bit again I think I got too far away from 5K Fitness I should have spent more time developing that but but this workout I absolutely love for marathoning where I do 20 by 1,000

[02:02:33] Metter with uh 200 meter easy jog between each th000 meter and that was done at faster than marathon pace so the goal is to like drive your threshold down so you spend all this time doing threshold running a certain pace and then you're going just a tad bit quicker than that for these broken up thresholds and uh much quicker so your if your

[02:02:53] Marathon Target Pace for a k is what is two just under three minutes or just over three minutes yeah 3 minutes is a 206 and change 20630 Marathon so yeah so like maybe I'll be shooting for like 255s like 5 Seconds perk quicker kind of feel how many days would let's just assume we're talking about it as a week even though it's a n-day cycle how many weeks would you succeed on that day where you would actually go 255 or better for each of the 20K versus fail somewhere along the way you know actually I think I was pretty successful most days right but I think a lot of that is because I wasn't trying to bite off more than I can chew right like I wasn't trying to hit home runs and workouts like they were workouts where I was kind of set up to see success and often too like my thresholds would just get better every time I would attempt it right um as the mil buildup is going I'm getting stronger I'm getting in better shape I'm also getting lighter which is making things a little bit easier and so usually I was seeing pretty good progress from uh that 12 12we buildup where I'm getting pretty almost what would happen though more likely than not in almost every single buildup I have is you get little niggles right where you get little like foot pain little knee pain just little things that pop up so if I missed a workout is usually more for that reason and then that's when you got to like go to the cross training which is an area I've also like learned in and grown so much in and utiliz a lot more now as a coach than when I was running but when I was a runner I was just kind of like the old school like like Runner die kind of mentality which is not not a helpful mentality to have so what did you expect to happen uh on that April Day in 2011 so I was coming off a terrible half marathon so a month before that race I ran I don't even I can tell you my time

[02:04:52] I don't think I ever looked it up it like 66 minutes or something for half marathon which is you know 7 minutes off my personal best and training been going super well things have been clicking well I thought it was in really good shape it's kind of one of those scenarios where you go to the start with this really high expectation but then it's easy to have that like shattered you know and so things just weren't clicking in the race created negative mindset negative snowball excitement gone and then just trying to get to the

[02:05:18] Finish Line you know so not a good run at all super been out of shape afterwards because I didn't know why how long was that before the Boston Marathon a month a month out yeah and so you know that's one that you want to go well to create confidence right and and again I had no reason to descri I I didn't know why it went so bad nothing I could put my finger on so those are the hardest ones to manage mentally right so uh but you know I got back up and just started training again and I found this over and over again not just with myself but with athletes like coach often times like these races when you're in heavy marathon training won't go well but then they'll turn something on inside of you it's like neurologically all of a sudden you're like firing and so I came out of that race and just started feeling phenomenal like like similar to how I felt before Houston and it was a very like quick change it was like the next week all of a sudden I was like like I said training had been going well before but it got taken even to the next level and there was all these different factors going into why that might have been I think the race helped also we headed back to Stanford to train it sea level and so that was very much how we'd utilize altitude pre kids we have kids now so we can't do this but we had spend like two months up at altitude drop down to sea level for a month go back up drop back down and that was taken from Jack

[02:06:35] Daniels who's done a ton a ton of research in the running space I think probably one of the most Brilliant Minds in running in my opinion especially from a scientific uh perspective and I was asking him corresponding with him and like hey what's the best way to utilize alud and that's what he recommended he's like go up to altitude shoot back down because what you see is you see a big dramatic increase in your hematic rate hemoglobin early on in those first three weeks and then it just starts to taper off right and so then you then you head back down to sea level and it's going to go back down but then you see when you come back up to altitude again another big dramatic shift so you just always want that shifting up right so um that's what we were doing we head back down to sea level and again there's positives to training at sea level like I'm sleeping way better when I'm at sea level I'm running faster um able to do workouts I can't do at altitude and so things just started clicking like crazy I was doing again I also started having caffeine every single day and that was the first time my career I started doing this and uh and so I started running my easy runs a lot quicker and I have no idea if this like was something that was obviously it worked but I don't know if it was be in despite of this or because of this you know um but I was running a lot of my easy runs at like 530 520 pace and just like floating through it just feeling even like the day before the race do a easy 30 minute run plus like 6X 100 meter strides that's kind of a custom run for us before the marathon like I'm so glad Sarah wasn't there my wife because she would have killed me for running as fast as I did I was by myself and I was just hammering I was running like 5:30 Pace but it was just easy I was just floating wasn't even breathing what was it what would be the difference in your hematocrit how much would your hematocrit vary between sea level and elevation that's a good question you know I don't remember off the top of my head we weren't super great about doing blood work I wish we had done more of that like we would do it just kind of like it seemed like random times you know we pop down the Olympic Training

[02:08:33] Center get some blood work done and see where it was at but to be honest I I can't remember the differences but it would it would come up pretty significantly in those first three weeks for sure so yeah just feeling like a million bucks heading into that race but I did have this like kind of thing hovering over me of like you just tanked a half marathon kind of thing but uh then the day before the race I remember talking to the race one of the race organizers and she's told me like you know like we're supposed to get a really good Tailwind tomorrow right and I was just when I heard that I just lit up inside because I I get excited about running fast like I'd rather break a world record than win a gold medal like that's just how I am you know um and I remember talking to Bill Rogers who won the Boston Marathon four times won New

[02:09:20] York four times and he was telling me he's like he's like you know about once every 10 years you get a wicked Tailwind in Boston then you can really roll so he had a year when he got a Tailwind he stopped four times in the race to like tie his shoe to walk to get water and he still ran 209 and so um I his words like were in my head and standing on the starting line in hopkington that morning and I'm looking at the flag and it's just going in the exact direction we're going to run I was like I'm never never going to get a day like this again like

[02:09:51] I'm going make the most of it and I always like to go the front and Lead like that was kind of my signature but I didn't I didn't let one moment go by in that race where I wasn't pressing I was like I'm going to get everything I can out of every single Mile and so we were rolling we were like a lot of our miles in the 430s during that race um we came through the half in 6152 I believe was our split and uh the race the race organizer was on a motorcycle in front of us and he saw our split it halfway saw the clock and he's like he radioed his clock eyes is like hey you guys messed up the clocks it says 6150 they're like yeah that's right so we were I mean at the time the world record I believe was like low 204 so we're you know Under World Record pace and again like the first half of the

[02:10:35] Boston Marathon is slightly down so and we had the wind you Heartbreak Hill at the very end as well yeah you have Heartbreak Hill like all through 17 and a half miles till 20 it's like up and down Hills so it's it's typically known as a challenging slow course but again if you get the right wind and you make the most of it because these aren't Pace races either like most fast races you have Pac makers in there and they're in charge of pace guys are just tucked in for most first 20 miles at least and then they're off and running the last 10K well in this race there just me at the front just hammering and all of

[02:11:08] Africa sitting on my back behind me enjoying the ride but I didn't care I was like I'm going to make the most of today um I remember one one memory from that race was one of the guys on the side of the road like some of the spots like especially early on in hopkington you're just going through neighborhoods and stuff people out in their lawn chairs and one of the guys yelled at me he's like hey Ryan don't let him steal your tailwind and I was thinking about that for a while I was like is that possible like I don't think so but um lots of kind of funny funny memories from that and uh it was just cool to like be with those guys be in the lead group and and also to get to push them along to something that would have it was a super historic day you know like the top two guys went on to run 203 low like I think 2030 four or something like that which was well like almost a minute under the world record at the time and uh you know

[02:11:57] I finished fourth and ran 20458 but I'll never forget another memorable part of the race was coming through with a mile to go and uh seeing they have a clock at a mile to go and it was right at two hours right but I'm in the like serious pain cave right I went out super fast super late in the race no one's around me and I'm just like holding on for dear life and I was like I saw two hours flat and I was like okay like if I break 5 minutes for this last mile like I'm going be under 205 and my PR at the time was 206 17 so I was already I was going to run a big PR no matter what I was like 205 that's insane that sounds pretty good you know and there's a part of me that is like just enjoy this last mile run like 5:30 just soak it all in and just enjoy it but then there was a part of me's like you know what you might never be here again like why don't you just put your head down grit your teeth and bear it try to break five and get under 205 and so that's what I did and it was a world of pain that last mile was a blur um the crowds in Boston are just insane though like I'll never forget running down Boon Street and just the crowd's just going crazy and you know I was in fourth place but I didn't even care because like to me performance shifted away from like beating other people to me maximizing my own potential and that's what I get most excited about and it's like that with my lifting too it's like there's guys deadlifting well over h a double what I'm able to do right but to me like that's not important it's about like me optimizing what I've been given my gift and and also just seeing the the fun part of the seeing the growth and the Improvement right so coming across the Finish Line I just like put my hands out and just soaked it all in yelled super loud my wife was there at the Finish to give me a big hug and uh it was super special I felt like I'd won the race even though I hadn't um but one of those those moments where just like this is again like

[02:13:47] Houston like one of those magical days that you know you may never get again so just soak it all in and enjoy it but yeah special day so I mean to me the most amazing part of your journey is not the successes it's the it's it's the the way in which you've been able to kind of carry yourself through the failures right and I think you know you got this parallel between 07 and 08 right where and we see it again now here in 11 and 12 so how are you feeling going into

[02:14:17] London again I think the expectations early in that season are very high right out of a 204 I was you know I was like I'm going to take a shot at winning this race even though you know i' just been beaten by a minute by those guys so I knew I knew it wasn't you know like I was expected to necessarily win but I knew I had a shot like you know if you run 204 for the marathon in those days like you have a chance to win a gold medal so um yeah and again I this was a theme going back to Beijing talking about not putting on the weight after I ran London leading up to the buildup for

[02:14:51] Beijing and how that made my training flat I did the same thing um and this is one of those things where it's like okay like having a coach is a helpful thing because if a Coach if I would have told a coach what I was going to do he'd have been like that's a really bad idea let's just stick with what we know works for you in this situation and that's putting on 10 pounds but instead of doing that again my heart was good my intentions were good I was like okay like again like Faith's a big part of who I am I really want to hear God and a way that people use across all Traditions to do this is fasting right so I instead of putting on 10 lbs I did a one week fast where all how close to the

[02:15:28] Olympics so let's see Boston was April 15th and the Olympics were August so you know it was enough time to where I was going to get a full buildup for the for the game so I had plenty of time to like put on weight and do my usual thing but again I just wanted I wanted Clarity on how to train for this thing and so instead of my weight going from 137 to 150 during that twoe period it went from 137 to like 130 flat and that was just I

[02:15:58] I started the training in a really depleted State my body wasn't in a good State I was mentally and spiritually I was in the best spot I'd ever been but my body wasn't ready to go at all it was it was needing a break after that you know but I began my training and came back and I was running pretty well initially and then it just kind of went downhill from there and it actually kind of became a miracle that even made it to the starting line um considering how poorly my training was going just nothing was working and this is what I tell myself in the wait room now all the time where I'm getting stale and training and not seeing growth um if I'm not eating enough food if I'm not taking enough calories it doesn't matter how

[02:16:39] I'm training it's not going to work and that's that's how it was for me in that buildup is like my body is depleted I didn't have enough calories on board so it didn't matter how I train it wasn't going to work so it was just a frustrating period of training leading up to that actually had to take my watch off for all my workouts because it was so discouraging to see what my workouts were and see how slow I was running them compared to what I was accustomed to so that was good for my mental health and I think there is a point that can be helpful for people out there sometimes just get away from the data take all that stuff off and just go off feel and that was helpful um but it wasn't enough to get my body back into the state it needed to be in so so what what did you feel at the at the start line in London um did you feel like was there any hope in you at that point or were you like look I'm here at this point out of an obligation to my country I'm representing my country I'm wearing the flag of my country but this is going to be the most difficult two hours of my life yeah you know there's I'm a very optimis optimistic person so I'm pretty good at generating hope so and it did help not time me my workouts so there was a little bit of mystery of thinking oh maybe I'm actually in a lot better shape than than I think and feel here you know so there was some genuine Hope on the starting line that hey and that's the thing with running that I've experienced sometimes like training can go really bad and you can just pop one have a big day so there's always that kind of thought in my head of like this you know like let's not think that something special couldn't happen today

[02:18:10] CU it could but it became obvious like really early on in the race the pace felt super hard super fast and then as is the case often times when I get too lean and too light I have all these injury issues right so like I had all this hip stuff going on before the race luckily like my Cairo guy John balls amazing had me in one piece on the starting line but then very early on in the race it was like then my right hamstring started hurting and that's ultimately what led me to drop out as I was in the middle of that race I was already starting to limp a little bit it wasn't even the middle it was early on it was like seven miles into the race and I was limping I was like all right like what do I do here what's the right call you're trying to kind of coach yourself through it not give up hope but then at the same time you want to be smart because this is my livelihood you know and I'm looking out for the long term and and I was like if if I I I'll

[02:19:01] I'm willing to be that guy who like comes limping in like seven hours after everyone and gets the the cheers and inspires people for just hanging in there but at the same time like I also want to be good to my body you know and I've been not good to my body a lot and uh that was just kind of like a moment where I I had a sense of Clarity that I needed to be good to myself and call it a day so that was actually the first race I ever dropped out of in my life was the London marathon and it felt so surreal I remember stepping off the because it's a loop course you know so you're going past the finish and the start um a number of times and I think it was the second loop I could be wrong on that but I think it was the second

[02:19:40] Loop when I dropped out and I remember stepping off and I almost started running again cuz it just felt so wrong it felt so weird it felt like I was in someone else's movie or something um and but then ultimately I just you know walked off the course and um then it began the long process of of working through that mentally and emotionally you know what was that like well it started with

[02:20:08] Cinnabon funny funny thing so the next day I'm like touring around with my family in London and uh Sarah knows like how I tend to go to food when I get emotionally low you know and uh yeah so we pop out of the subway onto the streets and it's like it's like Cinnabon is like heaven it's like right my eyesight's just like

[02:20:29] H and she sees me look at it she looks at me and she knows exactly where I'm going you know she's like don't do it don't do it but of course I went to Cinnabon got a big old cinnamon and I'm sitting out on the curb just eating it and I look up and like someone's like taking a picture of me eating my Cinnabon and I was like I felt like I was going to be on like Esquire magazine or something but uh no actually uh I've

[02:20:55] I've learned to pick myself up so many times I've gotten a lot better at it and for me it's kind of like I need this period of just being sad and just let myself be sad for however long that takes the period of kind of like mourning the loss you know because this was a big goal for me and then for me the next step then is like okay restore hope so what is the next thing I'm going after find that Target put it on the calendar that begins to restore my hope and then like I have a little meeting with myself of things I'm going to tweak diff do differently do better so that also gives me just way more hope that

[02:21:30] I'm not just going to repeat the same experiment I just did right so like I'm doing this right now with myself I'm going back after this sub five minute mile and sub five deadlift I'm like I'm going tweak this this and this and like I really believe it's going to work this time right so you got to you got to that's the starting ground you have to believe that your training is going to work that's why it's so important for athletes to believe in their coach like if you don't think it's going to work it doesn't matter what it's prescrib it's probably not going to work right so that that belief is so so important so you know I picked myself up and got going again but then the problem was and is common the case with Runners is then you have all these compensation issues right so I had that that issue in my upper

[02:22:10] High hamstring where attaches there and then just ran through that and that started by the way because I had planner fastis training for the 2012 Olympic trials I got that right before the trials had no choice had to run through it and then that persisted for like eight months and so little compensation get an injury on the other side and the upper hamstring in the games then I tore my left quad building up for New York I tore my right quad building up for

[02:22:36] Boston then I got a a sacral stress fracture on my left side after that training for my next marathon and is literally marathon after Marathon I'd sign up for it get the deal all worked out not be able to do it because I'd get some huge injury that would put me out for a long time and I didn't have a lot of injuries leading up to that I always considered myself to be super durable and uh yeah so it's just injury after injury and that's kind of that four-year

[02:23:02] Wild Ride of trying everything I could think to try and ultimately nothing was working but you know as I look back at it now I really think a big piece of it was the nutrition piece and I started to be in a better mental health point to where like I didn't have to use food as like a binging me mechanism for after these bad races um but that actually I still needed to put on the weight though right I still needed to get my body in a good spot and I wasn't doing that because I didn't need to do it from an emotional mental standpoint but then that was also killing me at the same time physically speaking right so if I you know looking back at it I would say that was a big big part of why I had so many struggles from 2012 up until my retirement in 2016 and if I could go back and do it differently I'd actually do something like my mom always wanted me to do and I never wanted to and that is to she's like you should just take like three months completely off and like not run at all and I was like you crazy like I'm never going to do that you know but that actually would have been super helpful just get away from it get my body back in a completely good spot and uh and now you know like I feel so much better in my current lifestyle focus on the lifting doing very minimal on the endurance end and even like my testosterone like I just got a testosterone uh blood test result recently and it came back at a thousand and like I didn't think that was possible for me but again the lifestyle shift lifting heavy eating more calories just having my body in a better State sleeping a ton is just allowed me to kind of like restore myself and that was exactly what my body was telling me it was like I've I felt like my body was saying to me I've given so much to you over the last 20 years like you've pounded me into the ground with 100 mile weeks after 100 mile weeks now it's to give back to me and so that's ultimately like why I got into the lifting I was like I want to give back to my body I want to build it back up I want to make it strong and there's this thing of like okay like I did something I was genetically gifted at now let me see what I can take something where I'm not genetically gifted it all the opposite of that and again I just love like the challenge I love lifting hard so every single day I'm in the weight room I go to failure and I know that's not recommended but that's just who I am that's what I love to do so that's that's what I do you know um so I feel like in a really good spot now um but

[02:25:24] I'm curious like if I would have allowed myself to get into a similar State as I'm now and then went back to the running how that could have went but um the ship has definitely sailed on that you know walking around it under 85 PBS now or even like I'll go for runs and it feels like a completely different sport at this body weight compared to you know 137 pounds yeah and it's even different from cycling I mean both Sports punish you for the weight but one of them you feel it much more than the other I mean in running it changes your gate I mean my wife um even though she weighs exactly what she weighed before having kids um she's she's tried to explain to me that the shape of her pelvis has changed since having three kids and she said she has ever since having the especially the boys because they were so big she's like I've never felt the same running again she's still you know W thin 110 lbs to looks like she has a nice stride but she's like it doesn't feel the same I don't have I don't float anymore like literally her pelvis is just in a different shape now so you know that's an example of something that I think women can experience and then of course just the change in weight um yeah it's huge it's huge so so what would you say to um you know someone who says you know

[02:26:46] I love exercise but cardio is the only thing that matters and they're not doing 100 mile weeks but they're you know they're they're they're doing something cardio every day and they're but they're they're sort of averse to strength training given that you've experienced both ends of this spectrum and at very extreme levels um how do you how do you think about this in terms of overall health Beyond performance yeah I mean I think you when you think of Health you have to think about all these different levels of

[02:27:14] Health right so like what is your hormonal Health like because that's going to really affect like your mental health how motivated you are um like your energy levels all that stuff right so I just know from myself my own experience like number one like you can run every single day and be healthy right but you do need something to especially as you're getting older to offset um how depleting of the body that can be right and that's where heavy lifting comes in and I think I I just say the word heavy and I can feel like all the runners being like H I don't want to do that and I was the same way I hated lifting heavy but I think there there's ways around that you know and like we're we mentioned bfr a little bit like I I love bfr for runners because like if you're not here's the thing with lifting like I've been lifting super heavy for six years and I've never gotten hurt lifting but that's just because I'm int and I have crap form when it comes to a lot of things too so it's not because my form is good but I I am intuitive in there right like if something's not feeling right like I don't put on the weight I don't go down like I'm very cautious in the weight room right um so there are ways to like lift heavy and healthy so like for runners for example um the the stuff that I love to prescribe to our Runners are hexar deadlift with the handles up so you're not going down as low you're not loading up the lower back as much um that's a much more running specific strength that is going to be great for for your power development I also love half squats you know for the same reason like a lot of running is just hip extension right it's like every time your foot contacts the ground your your hips have to extend to get out of that position so we need to do things that really focus on that so half squats great for that and your your liability of getting hurt half squatting is way less than butt to the ground so you can load up the bar super heavy with the half squat get all the hormonal benefits of lifting heavy get the the bone benefits of loading up a bar and having it on your back and avoid things like stress reactions your bone density up that way um and just feel really good coming out there's just no other feeling than like lift having a bunch of weight on your back and setting it down you just get this like huge rush of like I don't know what is endorphins energy but always just feel amazing coming out of the weight room energy-wise you know so there are ways to lift heavy in a healthy way and then again like if you don't even have access to heavy weights you can do things like bfr and uh I've

[02:29:40] I've been playing a lot with bfr and I really like the feel of that as well and I think it's a way for for runners you're maybe skinny more concerned about getting hurt to get the same benefits of of lifting heavy without having to put a bunch of weight on the bar do you ever have runners run in Blood Flow

[02:29:56] Restriction um I for the first time really like a couple weeks ago did um did some sets on the airbike so like you know those air dying bikes I did like two minute sets with heavy bfr on my upper thighs and I remember thinking well I remember not knowing what to expect right I remember thinking okay for two minutes I should be able to hold 300 watts or whatever and it's like no freaking way like I was struggling to hold 200 Watts for two minutes and it wasn't that my heart and lungs were blowing up it was like just the absolute pain in my legs so I thought that was kind of interesting and I was like huh I wonder if you know I was still cycling like if this would be an interesting form of cross trainining um I don't know if it would translate to running because

[02:30:44] I can't really walk when I'm in the full bfr so maybe maybe it just wouldn't work and maybe it would be maybe it's only amendable to being on a bike but um and I also think there's certain exercises like I once stupidly tried to deadlift with bfr it was was very lightweight but I also thought it was altering my form a little bit and I didn't think I didn't think that would be beneficial so right but but I love it I I do bfr every day that I lift I do at least one to two sets that's interesting I'm I'm definitely going to try the bfr on a run next time I go for run I'll be curious to try that yeah I don't you won't be able to go as heavy as you do for like at least on my device it allows me to select like low medium or high intensity um so maybe if you set it at a lower intensity but uh if anyone's going to experiment with it it's you so I'm curious to hear what you think yeah I'll try that something else I want to ask you about which is um you know we we talk about sports like cycling where drug use is just the norm it's there's never really been a clean era of cycling we're probably in the cleanest era now for the last 10 years um but there was just no way you were going to be able to compete and be one of the 10 best cyclists in the world if you weren't using a performance-enhancing drug non-negotiable um so if you didn't want to use those things you you you were free not to but you were not going to be in the top 100 or whatever how much well I guess it it doesn't seem to me that distance running has suffered the same thing right we see it in track and field all the time how much Buzz has there been about performance-enhancing drugs at the marathon level at the worldclass marathon level I I just I haven't been paying attention to it but I really don't remember hearing much about it and

[02:32:21] I'm curious as to whether or not that's been your experience and if so why why do you think that marathon runners which would certainly benefit from tons of peeds haven't traditionally used them yeah I think the thing that is the culture right so like for me I knew guys who 100% weren't on it and were winning races Meb for example he's he's winning in Boston he's winning New York he's winning medals dena's winning a medal at the Olympics and 100% no they're not on it right right so I think that's huge right if you can think of one person who's doing what you want to do and they're not on it you're like then I can too you know you look at like Lance and the cycling culture and it's like if that's not the case then it becomes very difficult like to me to be optimistic on the starting line right so like I always chose to believe everyone was innocent even if I heard Rumblings just because like I didn't want to be at a mental disadvantage like if I believe this person next to me is on something then they already got one on me CU I I think they're just going to be super human because they're on a PD you know so I always just believed everyone was innocent I never like concern myself with too much about it and also like honestly I've been around a lot of training groups in the US a lot of different athletes I've never heard of anyone talking about taking it about having access to it like I wouldn't even know the first step to even like how do you even find this stuff you know whereas there it's not like that everywhere though you know like I've been in Kenya and they talk about it a lot over there and I'm not saying like

[02:33:52] Kenyans are dirty or anything like that but the the culture there is one where um it's it's talked about more there and I think that alone makes you think more athletes are on it and and there have been like guys getting busted um not just from Kenya but from all over the world you know so it does happen What is the what are the drugs of choice is it

[02:34:11] EPO is it testosterone EPO yeah and then there's you know lots of like kind of grayline stuff too where people are just you know looking for Advantage they can get and maybe Crossing some of those lines and you know with Alberto and all that like stuff so it's but again like yeah that's right I forgot about that what what was the what was the controversy around Alberto Salazar so yeah I wouldn't even be able to like it was a large document of case thing of all the stuff that was supposedly going down honestly like I kind of stayed out of all that and didn't even follow it closely sh I wouldn't even be able to do a good job um but you're right I guess I there there has been some rumbling about it um right you obviously spent a lot of time in Africa I know you've adopted for girls from Ethiopia which probably speaks not just to your you know sort of

[02:35:03] Love of children but also like how much you've embraced that that that sort of um East African culture um having spent as much time there as you have do you have a sense of what makes them great how much of it is their genetics how much of it is the environment in which they're raised how much of it is the training the mindset um again I would imagine if you're born poor in Ethiopia or Kenya running as a way out would be viewed as you know playing in the NFL here or playing in the NBA or the major leagues like it's a it's it is their sport so when you think about all of these different factors what explains the absolute greatness of of this population in this really relatively small part of the world yeah I mean it's it's the perfect storm of kind of everything you mentioned right it's like highly motivated individuals who are highly genetically gifted um like you weren't talking about your wife's pelvis and it widening like there's like I think some theories about their pelvis being really small and not being helpful for distance running but I mean like I just I walk behind my kids on hike sometimes and just look at how narrow their shoulders are and how small their bone structure is right and I'm just like this is crazy like they're just so small and like I'd be running next to H gab sloy one of the greatest distance runers of all time and I remember the first time I ran with him at the London

[02:36:31] Marathon I caught up to his group and I was like I'm running next to Hy like this is insane and I just could not get over how small he was I was just staring at his back I was like this guy is Tiny so I mean there's like this whole huge like their their makeup their body and to be honest with you I think there's a lot more there actually I think they can run a lot faster than they're even running like as we I I'm I'm curious like like their approach to train versus our approach to training like who's doing it right not that it's one or the other you know it's probably like a blend of the two but you're thinking if they if they adopted some of what you've talked about and what others have talked about as far as more strength training more gap between intensities they might even be able to to be better yeah cooling down yeah you know things like that what makes Kip chogi so great in your mind and I think he really is the greatest marathon runner today and and I don't think that's just on the basis of doing this incredible you know feat of breaking two hours in a in a very controlled unofficial way but but also just his overall Marathon performance on the racetrack what is it about Kip chogi have you I don't suppose you ever ran with him right was he was he there in 16 no I don't think we ever we were we were coming up at the same time like we're very similar in age I don't know his exact age or if he even knows his exact age but we're right around the same so we cross paths a lot like I saw him at the London Marathon a couple years ago when I was there um but I think you know obviously like genetically gifted but also his like humbleness I think that's a huge thing it's like when you start to Think You're great and that you done all this great stuff it almost makes it harder to get back there right or to exceed it it's like when you buy into how great you are that I I feel like it kind of sets the limit on you it's like that's your that's your cap right and he is so like

[02:38:27] I've never seen anyone as successful as he is he's I mean he's got to be getting huge paydays to do these marathons right and yet living in super simple Place With It sharing a room with training Partners like come on like how many like multi multi-millionaires do you know that like do that right so like I think there's something about like his his mentality and humbleness and that's really what I've always found most inspiring about African Runners whether it's from Kenya or Ethiopia and why I enjoy being over there so much and have fallen in love with their culture is just this like Carefree Fearless mentality of just like I'm just going to put myself in it and go for it but Kip chogi also balances that with like being very um controlled it's like he controls his strength so so well and I think that kind of sets him apart like when you read about his training he's always talking about running like 80% Max and everything being super controlled and I don't know like I I have personally have not gotten results through that type of training but it's without a doubt it's working for him I mean he's by far in the way the greatest marathoner to ever walk the planet right so whatever he's doing is working but I honestly I feel like a big thing is just his mentality like his his mental approach to training and racing is the most composed I've ever seen and an athlete so I think that's a huge part of it do you think we will see a sub two-hour Marathon as an official marathon in our lifetime I think we will without a doubt I mean so a woman just ran 62 minutes 6250 or something for half marathon which is absolutely insane so that predicts that predicts 210 as a full yeah yeah so I mean she could potentially run be the first woman to break 210 for the marathon and we're just seeing huge perform performances like this and I think you know how much of it is the Sho yeah I was just about to say how much of it is the shoes yeah the shoe thing is really interesting because I don't think it's just the technology like the technology without a doubt like people are running two minutes faster over the marathon with these shoes on but I think it's affected the psyche a ton I think what people think is possible now has just been blown up right and so now like we're just getting people trying to do

[02:40:45] Insane stuff I mean like a sub 2hour Marathon like that would have never happen if we didn't have these shoes like I'm sure even Kip chog wouldn't have even tried right but now it's kind of opening the doors of like what's possible here and then you see a woman run 62 minutes for a half and you're like if she can run 62 minutes for a half like in an actual race that wasn't even a setup Kip chogi type situation that was actual race like people can do it in the marathon so I I am certain we will see it and who knows too like what other kind of technological advances will happen in the coming years but um you know the shoe thing has has been profound from technology standpoint but also from a mental standpoint for athletes speaking of a mental standpoint uh of all of the stunts you've done and

[02:41:30] I've followed many of them the seven marathons in seven days I.E seven consecutive marathons in seven days on Seven Continents um is in and of itself ridiculous but it's made only more Ridiculous by the fact that you didn't train for it so um tell people a little bit about this thing and and the extent to which you both got better during it and then kind of crashed at the end and how painful that last one was yeah so I was retired from Pro running and one of my pastor friends from La Matthew Barnett texted me he's like hey I'm doing this crazy challenge seven Marathon seven days seven continents and there's something just captured me about it similar actually to when I was uh 13 and went on that first run around Big Bear Lake it's like a similar kind of feeling where it's just like there's just something about this that like I just got to do it so I text him back I was like let me know if you want me to join you man I'd love to go and and again running zero at this point just in the weight room just focus on strength training and so uh you know he's like okay let's go it's on whatever so we end up doing it and I was I I started training for it so I was like okay like if I'm going to do this like I want to enjoy it but then I was hating the training for it wasn't enjoying it and I was starting to get a lot of those same fatigue issues that came when I was running professionally so I was like you know what either I can enjoy my life for like the nine months leading up to this thing and not run hardly at all or and have a really bad week or I can like train for it not really enjoy my life for nine months and then have a good week I was like I'll take the like the nine months of good living so decided not to train for I mean I did do I was running like three days a week like between five and eight miles eight miles was my long run leading up to to that and so I was taking on this challenge where we're going to have to run 183 miles I think it is in a week which is by far the most I'd ever done I think the most I'd ever done was 140 miles and you're hopping on airplanes it's like you run you get on the airplane you run you get on the airplane right so uh yeah it was quite the experience definitely like trip of a lifetime it was like a a group of people so there's like 30 of us

[02:43:44] Richard Donovan puts it on it's called The World Marathon Challenge and he just the the guy puts it on Richard is such an amazing dude this guy's taking 30 people around the world running marathons every day I never saw him stressed once I never even saw him close to how much does one pay for the privilege of doing this I believe it's like 40 Grand so it's a it's a bit of a you're also yeah because they're flying you privately obviously you're chartering a flight the only way you could make this work so the first one I think if I recall was South

[02:44:13] Africa Antarctica Antartica God yeah okay yeah that was the coolest Marathon you're running on snow it's like a 7mi loop course and I thought Antarctica was just going to be like flat and just white you know but there's all these mountains were on a glacier there's all these mountains going we had to take like a

[02:44:30] Russian airplane to like get down to there would looked like something out of a movie it was it was super cool so yeah we did that one hop on an airplane how did that one feel it felt pretty good actually um funny though I was so super into lifting right so my my great idea was to taking 50 grams of protein like every seven miles or something so I was like I don't want to lose my gains you so which is like the opposite of what I usually do right usually it's like simple sugar so

[02:45:02] I'm doing this and I get to like mile 203 of this race and I am so out of it like I'm like I need sugar like stat like right now cuz my protein bars like hardly had any carbs in it so they have this little ttin that's set up and they they put all this like dried fruit and candy and stuff in there and it's an unmanned tent so I crawl in there and I just grab like as much candy as I can eating

[02:45:26] Skittles God and I started feeling better immediately so like right after that I kind of learned my lesson I think I ran like 3:30 something on that one which is kind of amazing like 3:30 is still a fast Marathon for a yeah okay so then where do you guys go from the Antarctica where's the next one so then we went to Chile and uh we got to sleep in hotel room that night so that was nice CU there was only two nights during the week where we got to sleep in a hotel room and that was one of them so ran the next marathon and actually felt pretty good you know we're on concrete not snow so it felt a little bit better it warm what was the temperature in

[02:46:01] Antarctic when you were in that so it was supposedly really cold but it must be like a dry cold cuz it didn't feel that bad to me at all like I was in my regular run stuff that I would do if I'm doing a run here and Flag Staff in the winter time like I had full tights I had a long sleeve and I had like a like a shell jacket and gloves like mittens and a beanie and I was totally good I wasn't sweating at all cuz they say like you don't want to sweat cuz then it freezes on you and get hypothermia you know but uh I was I was totally good um so yeah so then so then so then South AF South

[02:46:33] America you ran how how how fast did you run that one I'm trying to remember what my time was I think it was a little bit faster than Antarctica but not a lot but I didn't it was nice cuz the Antarctica one doesn't beat up your legs cuz you're on uh snow so it's a little bit softer we always do all of our easy running on on soft surfaces to keep from beating up your legs and I was also in like the most cushy shoe I could find cuz I was like my legs are going to take a beating cuz I think at that time I was like 170

[02:46:58] PBS so I I was prepping myself for that a little bit then we flew to Miami and that was kind of fun as like a homecoming back to the States you know but also warm and uh I had a little bit more trouble in that one I think I was a little bit slower than I was in uh in Chile but not much like maybe I was like again 3:30 or something like that and then we flew over to Spain and I had the worst day ever in Spain luckily like one of my Dutch friends yed yop he came over and he was with me on the bike the whole time and I was just in the worst mood and having the worst day ever I was like running is the worst thing on the planet which I've said that many many times that's actually not a new thing for me to say even when it's running professionally running can be like your best friend and like your greatest enemy all at the same time all right so that's

[02:47:47] Europe so then which continent next Asia I'm guessing so then we head to to Morocco for Africa and uh we got a hotel room slept in that one I was like all right considering how bad I felt less than 24 hours ago I'm going to start out just super chill and just like make it through this right so I start that way and then again the mystery of running why you'd all of a sudden feel so good I have no idea but I just started feeling like a million bucks like I started charging like I felt like my old self I was like mentally super engaged and like just came home super quick like I went out really slow and then ended up running like 304 which for me off like zero training was like really good you know and so I then I was like pumped I was like all right now it's on like I'm

[02:48:34] GNA just get faster and faster every day from here you know so then is Dubai the next day so then yeah Dubai is the next day and the problem was though then after Morocco I'm walking to get food with my buddy and I just develop a little bit of a limp and he's like why you limping I was like yeah my hips kind of bother me a little bit uh whatever you know just shake it off like you usually do with most running things you know but then the next day in Dubai is like my hip was on fire and I was like this isn't good like something's really wrong here so I ended up walking like the back half of that Marathon a lot of it so I don't know what my time was there but it's probably up over four hours you know um and then we head on the airplane to Sydney for the last marathon in Australia and what was crazy this whole time yeah we're on a private jet with like you know food and everything and movies I didn't watch one movie the entire week whenever I was on the airplane I was asleep I was so tired um so we l in Sydney and I tried to stand up and I put weight on that leg where the hip was bothering me and it's that kind of like take your breath away wincing kind of pain that you get like super sharp and I was like oh I'm in trouble this is not good at all like I had a hard time putting any weight on it at all and also to you like I was so sick of all the little tiny things you do as a pro Runner like the mobility the stretching all that stuff that I wasn't doing any of that anymore so I didn't wear my compression socks the entire week so I got to Sydney and my ankles look like elephant ankles like they were so swollen but like to the point where it was painful I was like I didn't know you could actually get pain from this but like I could like barely like bend my ankles that was a mess so I I put on my same singlet that I wore my first marathon at the London Marathon 2006 2007 the same singlet I wore in that race I put it on cuz I was like this is my last marathon like this is my goodbye tour here you know the same way

[02:50:29] I went in with a big long run 15 mile run around Big Bear I'm going out with the bang too you know and I got never got to say goodbye to the sport it's like I just like kind of faded out and all of a sudden I was gone and my body wasn't able to run I never got to say goodbye to the sport that I loved so this was my chance to to say goodbye and so this last marathon uh manly Beach we did did a mile out mile back mile out mile back for the whole Marathon but it was it was sick though cuz it was lit up by the moon the stars all that stuff was just blazing we're running for some reason we started like 1:00 a.m. I was like why can't we get some more sleep we're running 1: a.m and uh was that because it was uh too hot to run during the day no I think I think Richard's thought process was just you wanted to give people enough time to get it done you know it'd be like such a sucky thing to like not finish it within the seven we period because you had a really bad last day I think he like yeah yeah yeah the sday period so so I think he's just trying to give people as much time as possible and so it could have been good like for me like I kind of needed it that day I I like got a massage in the middle of that but I went on to find out when I went home and got MRI that had a stress reaction in my hip so massages aren't aren't the best for stress reaction doesn't do a whole lot but uh yeah I'll never forget like coming across that Finish Line the sun was up at that Point took me five and a half hours was like the longest slowest most painful marathon it's like every time I put my leg down on that concrete is just like getting zinged with like that super sharp pain you know but I mean after you've run six marathons in a row you're like I'm do whatever it takes to get through this seventh one like I'm not stopping now and I'm never signing up for this trip again so I got to get it done you know so I came across the finish line and these are just like all like runs that are set up by volunteers so not like a ton of people there not like big production like major marathons but still super cool and I came across the finish line and I took off my shoes left them on the finish line and something I kind of stole from uh wrestlers Olympic wrestlers after they they wrestled their last match they leave their shoes on the mat it's just kind of the symbolic way of saying like

[02:52:34] I've given everything I have to give and now like this season's over I'm walking away leaving my shoes on the mat so I did that I walked away Barefoot from the finish line and I was actually even though I was just kind of like me and a couple other people got super emotional at that time I was like tearing up as I was walking back to the hotel just cuz you know running gave me so many gifts it was so life-altering for me and the most beautiful part of all of it was the people you know um meeting my wife my kids all the people I cross paths with continue like I wouldn't be chatting with you right now Peter if it wasn't for that you know like that that is what

[02:53:09] I hold most dear from from all of the experience you know and what's cool about that is like doesn't matter what level you run at like we all get to experience that you know sign up for any race and you're out there with a 50,000 amazing people that are on a journey with you and we get to do it together you know so that whole sentiment just like hit me super hard just saying goodbye to the sport I love but then uh you know it's been such a beautiful transition though of like realizing that that whole season it felt like it was for me you know like it was my thing that I was going after seeing how good I can get but I've since kind of realized like it wasn't just for me like everything I learned in that season was meant to be passed down and was meant to be shared and meant to help other people so it kind of launched me into the season of you know moving into the coaching space coaching my wife coaching other athletes in person um starting Run free training where we coach Runners of every single um discipline you know every level super slow people middle school kids like all the levels because like just it doesn't matter where you're at right it's a m we just want to be on the journey with you we want to guide you well and help you on your journey so um it it was really special to kind of like real realiz that even all the mistakes that I made they weren't for not you know I'm on this podcast I'm able to share it with your listeners and hopefully they won't make the same mistakes and they'll be better off for it you know and that's that's really kind of like my goal now is like how can

[02:54:32] I help people um take this thing living to the next not just running but living be happier people like I'm far more concerned with my athletes happiness than I am with how fast they are right like I want them to enter into the good life and I think running is a way to do that lifting can be way to do that it adds to that but more than anything like

[02:54:51] I just want them to find I want them to find joy you know well Ryan it's been it's been a joy sitting here talking with you about this and um I I hope we get to meet in person one day because there's I hope we get to work out in person one day actually that would be that would be a ton of fun uh to to to live together and and I'd love to try some of these crazy things you're doing not all of them but uh actually

[02:55:12] I'm really intrigued by the um the I wouldn't be able to do it with a fraction of the weight you just described but I the the farmers carries up the Grand Canyon that's something that like I could see wanting to do that one day um the Grand Canyon is such an amazing place to me I've only been there once but it it's still probably one of the most significant things I've ever done um you know just the season of my life in which I got to do it the manner and how we made it physical and I I sort of made it a a hiking swimming trip so I swam in the Colorado River and then in each of the waterfalls on the way up cuz you know you you you have like these four huge waterfalls that get progressively smaller as you go up and yeah it's just I mean it was just so I was actually just talking about it with one of my kids last night when I was reading him a story in the Grand Canyon came up and he's like is that a real place and I was like yeah like this is real man and when you get when you guys get a little older we're g to be going back there yeah you need to bring the kids up start doing 20 minutes every other day I'm sure you have 20 minutes and uh we we'll go do it together that would be so so fun awesome man well I really uh I really appreciate this time
