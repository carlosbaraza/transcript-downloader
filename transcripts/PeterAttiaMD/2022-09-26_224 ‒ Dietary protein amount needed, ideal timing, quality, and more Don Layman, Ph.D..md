Don Layman is a Professor of Food Science and Human Nutrition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He has spent the past 40 years investigating the role of dietary protein in muscle protein synthesis. In this episode, Don describes how his decades of research have shaped his thinking around protein, muscle, anabolic factors, metabolism, and more. He explains the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein: what it is, how it came about, and how it should serve only as a guide for the minimum protein necessary for survival rather than as an optimal level of protein intake. He provides an overview of the essential amino acids, explains the nuances of animal versus plant protein, and provides insights for determining protein quality, absorption rates, and how to best track your intake. He discusses the ideal timing of protein intake in relation to resistance exercise, how protein should be distributed among meals, and how limitations in protein utilization per sitting can impact those practicing time-restricted eating. Additionally, Don shares results from his clinical trials, including how a high-protein diet fared in terms of fat loss, and explains the differences in protein utilization between adolescents and adults and how the problem of reduced efficiency of protein utilization in older adults can be overcome.

## AI Summary

Here's my detailed analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Don Layman, a protein metabolism expert, discussing protein requirements, timing, and quality. The conversation covers the biochemistry of amino acids, muscle protein synthesis, and how protein needs change with age. Key focus areas include the importance of essential amino acids (particularly leucine, methionine, and lysine), protein distribution throughout the day, and the role of protein in weight loss and muscle preservation.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Body needs to make ~300g of new protein daily for various functions [02:12:01]
- Muscle and brain are the two critical tissues for nutritional focus [04:49]
- Leucine is a key trigger for mTOR and muscle protein synthesis [53:41]
- Protein efficiency decreases with age, requiring higher intake in older adults [1:07:30]
- First meal protein intake is crucial for breaking overnight catabolism [1:24:14]
- Optimal protein per meal is between 25-60g for muscle protein synthesis [1:22:10]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Aim for 1.6g/kg of protein daily for adults [1:08:57]
- Focus on first and last meals of day for protein intake [1:54:23]
- Consume at least 30g protein at breakfast to break catabolic state [1:24:14]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Older adults need higher protein intake to maintain muscle mass [1:07:30]
- Post-exercise protein timing matters more for untrained individuals [1:33:52]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Not extensively discussed in this episode.

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Post-exercise protein intake more important than pre-exercise [1:26:07]
- Training status affects protein timing requirements [1:34:21]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Protein should be viewed as absolute amounts, not percentage of calories [1:22:10]
- Animal proteins contain all essential amino acids in proper ratios [1:51:00]
- Plant proteins may require higher total intake due to lower quality [1:08:57]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Nitrogen balance testing discussed but noted as potentially inaccurate [1:37:41]
- Protein quality scores (PDCAAS, DIAAS) mentioned [1:47:19]

8. **References & Resources**:

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA hey Don thank you so much for making time to sit down today um I've heard a lot about you over the past couple of years from our mutual friend Lane Norton who suggested that you know we sit down and go even deeper down this nutrition pathway uh what you may not know about me is nutrition is my least favorite subject but I think I I say that only because I I I am so tired of sort of the uh religious aspect of nutrition um so

[00:00:34] I'm I enjoy talking about nutrition through the lens of biochemistry but thereafter my my patience for it has has dwindled over the past decade so I have a feeling we'll get along just fine because your entire background is based on nutritional biochemistry as opposed to nutrition religion um but well first of all it's great to uh meet you Peter and uh even Electronics and and uh my my interest was a little sort of the opposite I was interested in

[00:01:05] Biochemistry first and studying organic chemistry just seemed so boring and esoteric that nutrition I could actually apply my biochemistry to things people were interested in so I kind of like that split but I I totally get your aspect of the Zealot ends of the spectrum did you did you know you grew up on a farm if I'm not mistaken correct in

[00:01:28] Illinois yes that's correct and uh before we started recording this you mentioned to me that your parents your dad lived to 97 your mom to 102 so you're you're at the midpoint of your life right now essentially based on your good genes um but what was it like growing up on a farm you know 70 years ago it was a great experience um you know back in the 50s when I was born uh agriculture was very poor in the United

[00:01:58] States and so you sort of grew up in that background but I think some of the things I learned was I learned about animal growth I learned about reproduction I learned about growing corn and sty beans I learned about life cycle and I just got an interest in food uh you know we were we were growing it we were had it there on the farm and and so it just made me interested in it and then you know combined with that I always had an interest in science and sort of evolved to be kind of a natural marriage I guess so when you're going to college did you study biochemistry and organic chemistry first that was your undergrad yeah the the the background the Serendipity of how I got into nutrition it certainly wasn't anything I knew about I was in a small town uh went to a school that had like 400 people in it and and so certainly wasn't anything

[00:02:54] I knew about but I knew I like science so I went to first uh uh Illinois State University to study chemistry and I pretty quickly realized I had no aptitude for inorganic chemistry but I sort of understood biochemistry pretty well uh I got to the end of it and it was actually during the Vietnam War uh and I was scheduled to go into the military uh and so I was totally unemployable and the university said hey you're doing really good at this chemistry stuff we'll give you a graduate assistantship and you go and you go and all of a sudden I ended up with a deferment getting a master's degree in Biochemistry and my mentor at that time said you really have a knack for this nutrition part of it why don't you do a PhD and I sort of said oh really and so I ended up at University of Minnesota doing a PhD in nutritional biochemistry and fell in love with all of it so it certainly was no grand plan but it kind of fit my background of

[00:03:56] Agriculture Foods Sports Nutrition I fell into a group that was doing muscle metabolism and it just kind of all felt together for me now was anel keys at the University of Minnesota at that time he was not he had left but his legacy was there with George Blackburn uh and uh Ivan France and some of those individuals so I certainly got that background while I was there and and certainly invested a lot of how my early thinking of nutrition and you know I think Lane Norton who you've talked with before is uh has talked about how our thinking of nutrition evolves my certainly has evolved well tell me a little bit about what at least as far as you can remember what was your what was your underlying philosophy of nutrition

[00:04:49] Circa you know 1975 you know which is probably when you were doing your PhD I'm guessing yeah I I think sort of one of my earliest sort of thinking about nutrition again it sort of dates to my interest in animal growth and but also Sports Nutrition um I very early developed the philosophy that nutrition was really about two tissues two tissues the brain and skeletal muscle if those two tissues were healthy you were going to live a pretty good life everything else is regulatory the liver the heart uh the kidney the gut everything else adapts to your environment but you have to focus on those two and I think if you tailor your nutritional requirements around that thinking you end up with a much more sensible approach and I I sort of coined the concept that uh my colleague Dr Gabrielle lion and I always use of muscle Centric nutrition uh and you know if you keep muscle healthy you've got a good shot at avoiding obesity avoiding diabetes avoiding cancer Etc Etc well let's go into that a little bit I mean I want to get into some weeds on a whole bunch of other really new on stuff but let's let's let's follow this thread for a moment so when you say that I assume you're at least in part referring to the the following two facts one muscle is the largest snc for glucose uh so you know 75 to 80% of our glucose storage capacity exists within skeletal muscle and then there's another factor of muscle which is it's a very early Depot for excess adapost tissue so once we start to let little droplets of fat accumulate within muscle cells it leads to this process of insulin resistance that then creates a problem for the first point that I made which is you now make it harder for your carbohydrate storage unit to accept carbohydrates and of course that leads to hyperglycemia and ultimately diabetes is that part of why uh that formul your thesis or is there more to it more to it

[00:07:03] I I I mean I think what you stated is is correct but I do think about it differently I think about um Muscle really serves two functions one the obvious one is mobility uh most people uh get to the age of 65 uh beyond that most people actually die from some form of immobility Falls breaking something hospitalization so functional mobility is critical but the other aspect is metabolism and muscle is a primary site for insulin activity uh you mentioned glucose storage uh I look at it more as an issue of glucose utilization uh uh and also fat utilization so basically your blood glucose and your blood lipids are heavily I mean obviously the amount you eat makes a difference but the actual level is heavily dependent on your muscle metabolism and you sort of commented about insulin resistance being associated with fat actually insulin causes insulin resistance so if you chronically Elevate insulin too long uh that is the definition of type two diabetes is that basically insulin causes insulin resistance well say more about that I mean I it's hard to tangle some of the causality here right I mean you know I spoke with Jerry Schulman God probably it's been two years ago and you know in in his Paradigm right you have the accumulation of diog glycerides within the actual uh myosite so not in not not interstitially right or not between them but it's the it's the actual accumulation of lipid within and it's funny I'm blanking on which enzyme now that inhibits but it's basically down the pi3k pathway the pi3 kyes pathway where you basically render the muscle cell less sensitive to the signal of insulin telling the glut 4 transporter to come up and so yeah this hyper insulinemia is is effectively the first way that you can externally measure insulin resistance is that sort of in line with what you're saying yes and no so um J so is great uh

[00:09:30] I definitely followed his research a a lot um and the the thing to understand about the biochemistry is you can create the models to give you a negative feedback so he's absolutely correct that um that uh diog glycerol or ceramides will feed back to the insulin receptor the glute four transport and the insulin receptor and cause insulin resistance uh so that's that's true so that that is a philosophy of fat Centric that fat causes all the problems on the other hand you can do the exact same thing with glucose too much glucose will also inhibit the insulin receptor uh and cause that same exact feedback it doesn't accumulate the ceramides or the the diog glycerol I did some research with diog glycerol and if you sort of do it in the in the issues of high carb low carb you won't find those effects so the question then becomes which ones more likely to be physiological because people are eating um 350 grams of carbs per day or because they're eating 90 grams of fat per day which one's likely to cause it uh Bob wolf there's a philosophy called the

[00:10:54] Randall hypothesis I don't know if you've heard of it but basically the philosophy is uh the Randall hypothesis was that fatty acids the diog glycerol cause all the problems and what Bob wolf did was basically run that experiment with st stable isotopes and he showed it's actually the reverse that fatty acids are not inherently toxic but glucose is it has its own disease we call it diabetes and so when you eat excess carbs you H must get rid of them you absolutely have to dispose of them in the next two hours where fat basically can hang around for much longer it's just simply not that toxic to the body in fact the body the the body always wants a certain level of free fatty acids in the blood because that's the fuel for the heart okay so it's always high now what what about the idea issue is the bance yeah what what yeah sorry what about the um ability that that excess the ability to turn that excess glucose into fatty acid via denova lipogenesis are you saying that that doesn't happen quick enough to alleviate some of the toxicity of acute hyperglycemia it doesn't happen super quick I mean that's a great question uh there's a lot of people who argue how much denovo lipogenesis actually occurs but basically when you get into requiring high amounts of denimo lipogenesis now we start talking about fatty liver and so now you start seeing triglyceride problems and so people who are actually doing a lot of denovo lipogenesis typically have elevated triglycerides so that's one of the first signs that you're dis disrupting that flow triglycerides in general are there to recycle uh free fatty acids so the B the blood's the the adapost is always dumping free fatty acids out for the for the heart and other tissues the problem comes in is when you start blending that with too many carbs and too many fats so you know first and foremost calories are always the problem but when you have excess calories and then you start rebalancing these macronutrients is when you get into trouble yeah you know you're obviously intimately familiar with this maybe even some of the listeners are but there's a very famous paper by Mark helstein you know kind of

[00:13:18] Circa mid 90s 94 995 that demonstrated really a very small amount of denova lipogenesis taking place with carbohydrate feeding um I absolutely believe the results of the that paper uh but I also think it's a very narrow context and it's not necessarily the context of an overfed individual and therefore I think our capacity for denova lipogenesis Depends heavily on total energy content or total energy balance and therefore I think there is a scenario where in the helstein paper you can feed a high carbohydrate diet but within the overall composition of a low energy diet or a balanced Energy diet and DNL is actually quite low uh conversely you can feed you know a high carbohydrate diet in the context of a high energy diet and I think we would probably see a much greater amount of

[00:14:08] DNL um yeah totally and so yeah I think the context matters and I do think that the first if if we were describing this as a polinomial right like the first order term is energy the first order term is how many calories are coming in uh and and and that probably matters more than the ratio of carbon fat yeah go back to that that Randall hypothesis or wolf discussion um you you always want to think about it is that carbohydrates gluc excess glucose is toxic if the blood level is high you'll damage basically every tissue from your eyes to your toes and so you have to dispose of the glucose so helstein what he showed was that if you have a diet that say say the

[00:14:58] American diet 50 50% carbs 35% fat and you take in um 1,000 calorie meal uh or 800 calorie meal which one are you going to put into fat quickest you're going to put in the easiest one the one that's already fat and so the carbohydrates going to get burned and the Fat's going to go to fat it's just simply the body is selecting the easiest pathway but if you switch that and juules hirs did it and then and then Jeff volik did it later if you switch that to a 80% carb 10% then you'll see that denovo lipos synthesis and one of the interesting things out of it is when the body makes fat the only thing it can make is saturated fat P so we have a lot of saturated fat in the blood that actually doesn't come from eating fat it comes from eating carbs yeah again in the context of how much we're eating right yeah exactly all right so taking it back important to realize it's important for people to realize we burn around 100 calories per hour that would be 2400 calories per day so 100 calories per hour uh in a 2hour period you're only burning 200 calories so everything else has to be stored average American meal is 400 to 1,000 calories that means you have to store all of that yeah interesting I is that an argument you think for spreading out calories more over the course of the day that takes us into a protein discussion and I would say absolutely not um the two two angles to that one was there was a theory back when I was early in my career back in the mid 80s by Gil lvll and he was arguing that lots of small meals was good for uh less fat deposition and it was an artifact of how he did the study we ran he did it with animals and basically showed that when you made the adaptation to lots of small meals uh the animals didn't gain as much as if you uh adapted them to like two meals per day but the artifact was when you adapt an animal to two meals per day they go through a starvation period because they have to learn to do it and when you come out of a starvation period you're making more fat so we redid it with a longer adaptation period and what we found was that that um reducing the number of meals per day actually is thermogenically advantageous you actually waste more calories so we actually redid that and published it the other aspect we can get into is protein protein needs to be distributed at specific meals the distribution needs to be high and eating lots of small meals uh is a really bad choice for a lot of reasons and we can get into that but anyway well I yeah and I definitely want to get into that because if there's if there's one area I really want to double click on today it's everything from protein timing protein type animal versus plant protein efficiency amino acid variability all that kind of stuff we're GNA we're going to go deep on that but let's go pick it up back in

[00:18:13] University of Minnesota you've got the Legacy and I'm guessing at the time you know Keys is really famous for two things in the mid 70s right I think by that point he's probably already published his seven country study and the the hypothesis now is a very fat Centric view of you know the the negative consequences of dietary fat specifically dietary saturated fat in the American diet especially as it pertains to ascvd and then I suspect the second thing that he's probably still famous for is the starvation experiments um that were I'm guessing done in the 1950s

[00:18:49] I mean these were done on conscientious obur so they're probably in the 40s or 50s right yeah I I can't exactly date that but you're exactly right so those were I mean we learned a lot about starvation at that point for obvious reasons we can't Dukes experiments like that before but we learned a lot about body composition and how the body starve so those were good but certainly the Legacy was there and when I got to Minnesota you know I sort of bought into the cholesterol and the saturated fat and total fat and you know

[00:19:23] I I sort of okay this is what everybody's teaching and you know that's what I was forced to learn that's what they they were teaching uh and so I bought into it but you know as I slowly started doing experiments and early in my career we did a lot of fasting type of experiments with animals to look at composition changes and I did malnutrition work in in Northern Africa and I sort of got into all of that and I

[00:19:49] I I started realizing you know I don't really believe that and one seminar I will always remember at Minnesota was individual by their name of Fred Kumo came to Minnesota and gave a seminar about the dangers of cooking oils and specifically trans fats and Blackburn and France just ridiculed him basically said this is the craziest thing we've ever heard all these plant oils are great uh and basically you know 20 years later we banned trans fats from Foods literally as the most dangerous fat that you can encounter so I I always remember that just sort of thinking well you know people who have bought into this Dogma aren't necessarily right and we need to keep questioning it speaking of FR um obviously in 1973 he completes a study the Min

[00:20:46] Minnesota coronary experiment um I I actually find this to be one of the most difficult studies to interpret not so much the one that he published 16 years Years Later by the way in 1989 but the one that Chris Ramden republished just a couple of years ago based on all of the data from Fran's study Plus data he never published this to me is one of the most complicated stories and I I will tell you I have posed this question to every friend of mine who is more steeped in nutrition than I am and um I still don't have a great sense of how to explain these results so I I'll explain it for the for the listener and the viewer and

[00:21:30] I'm curious to your thoughts so the experiment was done um in basically institutionalized patients so again maybe not a study that could be done easily again today for ethical reasons but had the advantage of being so well controlled you you basically had patients that were randomized into two groups their total energy was identical their total split of macronutrients was identical the only thing that differed was that in one group it was high saturated fat and in the other group it was high polyunsaturated fat the hypothesis being tested was is saturated fat intake leading to increased major adverse cardiac events heart attacks and strokes the experiment that completed in

[00:22:20] I think it ran I I can't remember exactly think it ran about 5 years in 1973 showed no difference there was no difference in cardiac events despite the fact that the group that was on the higher polyunsaturated fat group did indeed have much lower cholesterol levels now this was this predated the subf fractionation so they weren't measuring LDL and HDL they were just measuring total cholesterol and at the time there was some correlation between cardiovascular disease and total cholesterol levels at the extremes that was certainly true again because I didn't think we'd be talking about this I don't have the numbers all in my mind but we'll link to it all but directionally I believe that the higher Pua group relative to the saturated fat group was about 30 mg per decil lower in total cholesterol and based on everything we know today we would assume that much of that was in

[00:23:12] LDL cholesterol indeed being lower and non-hdl cholesterol and yet there was no difference in events and of course it's become a very famous and unfortunate story in nutrition research and that France chose not to publish it because he didn't like the results it didn't match his hypothesis which was that the group on Lower saturated fat would have fewer events Ramden went and published all of these data plus a whole bunch of subdata as I said just a few years ago I believe in the British medical journal and actually found something that was that threw a wrench in my initial hypothesis my initial view of the

[00:23:49] Minnesota coronary experiment was it probably wasn't a long enough intervention it might be that 5 years was not long enough to appreciate a difference and so it was underpowered or Too Short in a duration to see a benefit if there was a benefit but in Ramon's analysis you actually saw the opposite because he now looked at some subgroups and you actually saw a higher incidence of coronary events in some of the people that were consuming the high polyunsaturated fat diet and I can't remember what the dominant oil was I'm blanking on it I don't remember if it was canola or safflower I think it was safflower so how much of that do you remember Don from your time there and can you can you shed any light on this or do you have any thoughts on you know how to interpret that experiment well first of all I am definitely not a lipid expert so um I you know I sort of remember the study but I can't put any more numbers to it than you did I actually did some research with Ivan France and Penny

[00:24:52] Chris Eon when I was at Minnesota so I you know I sort of was in the loop at the time but that's been a couple of years ago um yeah I think if one really looks at the literature on saturated fat and is fair about all of those studies you find a very mixed bag the women's health initiative and all of those kinds of things uh and unfortunately the people who believe the hypothesis have either delayed publishing it or said well it couldn't have been wrong and tried to you know it could have been wrong and they tried to find all kinds of excuses us Es as opposed to just believing it U you know there's an old theory in science that you know if the theory is correct it'll get stronger over time and if it's not it gets weaker and I think one would have to realize that a the cholesterol Theory the total cholesterol theory has definitely gotten weaker and the saturated fat hasn't held up very well um you know we still believe it but your comment a little bit ago it's first and foremost most calories if you put excess saturated fat on top of too many calories that's probably a problem but if you're at or below your calorie needs I don't see any data that suggests it is so you know my sort of joke or comment all the time is that if you're committed to being obese you probably ought to pay attention to the quality of your fats but if your goal if your goal is to be lean and healthy calories is what you're paying attention to in the macro distribution is sort of your personal preference so let's talk a little bit now about how your interest in protein came about because you know of all macronutrients this is the one I have to pay the most attention to um and it's honestly the one where I feel like I fall the shortest you know I I feel like I have some days when I nail it and I have too many days when I come up short I never go overboard I never go to bed at night thinking God I ate too much protein today but I do go to bed sometimes thinking I don't think I ate enough um for my goals right my goals are to sort of maximize muscle protein synthesis my goals are to preserve lean tissue as long as I can and frankly that's the goal for my patients so um how how did this become a strong interest of yours well the real interest started in my

[00:27:19] Master's Degree because I got interested in studying protein turnover protein synthesis and I was working with Aron Richardson who was a expert in aging and we were studying age related changes in protein synthesis and we actually discovered uh the changes in mRNA over time that the Poly tailes on mRNA get shorter uh your ability to put ribosomes on the message goes down and you have lower synthesis so that efficiency of change of protein synthesis over time is a theme that runs through all of my research and we'll get into efficiency and adults and things like that so that was sort of the beginning when I went to

[00:28:01] Minnesota then I sort of got a muscle focus on it and and one of the first things I learned in graduate school is we don't really have a protein requirement we have a requirement for nine essential amino acids and organic nitrogen organic amines which all translates into the fact that we can make 11 of amino acids and nine we have to have in the diet and one of my favorite uh quips I use when I'm talking to groups on stage is that you know protein we should think of as a vitamin pill we don't have a daily requirement for a vitamin pill we have a requirement for 12 vitamins inside the pill we don't actually have a daily requirement for protein we have a requirement for nine or 20 amino acids inside of it and so talking about a protein requirement just reflects ignorance we have a specific requirements for nine essential amino acids and that gets into the complexity then because these amino acids are essential for building blocks for new protein but every one of them has a metabolic role like Lucine and mour or

[00:29:14] Arginine and nitric oxide or lysine and carnitine or cysteine and glutathione and all of those rols are vastly above the minimum that is detected for nitrogen balance for the RDA and so that's where people fall apart is that we we think about vitamin C and we know there's a minimum RDA to prevent scurvy but people will take five or 10 times that during covid for immune response but we resist thinking that way about amino acids and it's exactly the same you know that's a great Point Don maybe we should spend a minute helping people understand what an amino acid is because you know I took biochemistry I have my little Q cards I can draw every one of the amino acids not anym by the way yeah I was going to say not anymore but but there was a day when I could draw all nine of them but but let's help people understand I think most people understand what glucose looks like if you've listened to this podcast you're no stranger to the idea that glucose is a six carbon ring and each one has a couple hydrogens on them and one of them's got an oxygen and a hydrogen on it as well I think most people who have listened to this podcast have a decent sense of what a fatty acid looks like long stretch of carbons if it's saturated there's no double bond so it's just littered with either two or three hydrogens depending on where it sits in the chain and then of course you store them by putting three of those onto a nice little three carbon glycerol backbone but I actually think most people uh understandably have less

[00:30:50] Clarity around what an amino acid is and you've already alluded to the fact that there were 20 of them and nine of them we can't even make I mean we're if we were deprived of these things we'd be dead so we got to eat them but um can you give folks a sense of the nomenclature what what what is an amino acid what do these things look like yeah so um a little bit like a fatty acid uh an amino acid has a carboxy end uh connected with a carbon and then it has a nitrogen end and when the body is making so when we eat protein we get these amino acids and in some sort of a string but we totally digest them down to probably individual amino acids maybe D or tripeptides and we absorb them that way they get to the blood uh as single amino acids for the most part and then the body begins to reconnect them based like on the messenger rnas our DNA tells us how to reconnect them and so we connect that carbon to a nitrogen and we string them together of these 20 amino acids though they all have that car that Aid and nitrogen part but they also have a side chain ranging from very simple one like glycine with just a hydrogen to ones like tryptophane that have a big aromatic part to them and so all of these are different and they go into proteins in different structures the the

[00:32:17] DNA tells us how we put them together and proteins can be simple like insulin with 51 amino acids or they could be like myosin with thousands uh and so there're Al and then every protein in the body has a different turnover rate some of them like insulin might last 15 minutes and some of them like mein or we'll just take collagen might last 250 days and so they turn over at different rates so that's sort of what they are um but beyond that building block structure then every amino acid has other kinds of structures uh it might be like lysine where part of it becomes the molecule known as carnitine which is for fatty acid metabolism or it might be the nitrogen off off uh Arginine that goes to nitric oxide for vasil restriction or it might be cysteine which goes to part of of creatinine or glutathione so we can get the Lucine which is sort of my favorite which is a signal uh which really got me interested in protein and metabolism is a signal for muscle protein synthesis so again they all have this building block structure they get strung together uh in different links uh but they also have other metabolic functions and that's what people don't recognize when they're talking about protein requirements so let's talk about that

[00:33:47] RDA right because when we look at our patients and evaluate them from a nutritional standpoint um almost without exception we come to the conclusion that they are not getting enough amino acids based on how much protein they're consuming now I don't know how much of that is the nature by which food is prepared these days the nature by which you know protein makes up a certain amount of the caloric uh uh intake based on various types of you know prepared foods and things like that and how much of that just based is based on a belief system of what people people need perhaps coming back to the RDA so um H how what so first of all let's tell people what the actual RDA is and and how it came to be so the RDA is a recommended dietary allowance so it's some people think it's daily but it's a dietary allowance so it's sort of a generic number and the argument is that for all rdas uh we sort of test a population and come up with an average number and then for a safety Factor which average would be 50% would be deficient and so we add a safety factor of two standard deviations which supposedly 97.5% of the people would be adequate to prevent any any signs of inadequacy at that point but that also means 2.5% of the people are actually deficient at that point so that that's sort of the definition um where does the Rd come from I think it's useful to go back in history just a little bit then on protein um how did we begin to evaluate protein needs well it all came out of animal

[00:35:33] Sciences uh back in the early 1900s before we even knew the essential all the essential amino acids uh farmers were trying to say how do I get animals to grow best you know and different kinds of proteins and things like that and they develop protein quality scores and things like that so how much growth did I get for what I fed uh how much

[00:35:57] Nitro that I deposit for how much I fed so these were all rapidly growing animals and we developed this concept really of nitrogen retention um that basically uh We've now translated into what's called nitrogen balance and that's how we determine the protein requirement basically what's important in all of that discussion that long- winded explanation is that all of the concepts were developed for growth where nitrogen balance was positive you could measure a change over time and as we've now tried to start applying that to non-growing adults it gets a lot more vague um so it's important to recognize that what we think about protein requirements is a developed from nitrogen balance where you measure all of the nitrogen you're eating which you can do pretty good but then you have to measure all of the nitrogen you're losing which were really bad at and we call that nitrogen balance can you explain how that's done Don that's this is I think we're going to talk so much about it that I think it's it's worth getting into the details of how nitrogen balance is calculated and let's do it in a human so if if I came into your lab how would you do this uhuh so so let's start with the front end let's start with nitrogen in so that's basically you just take a a bunch of food and you do an chemical analysis and you measure the nitrogen and you multiply it by a factor of 6. 25 so a you're measuring nitrogen it's not really protein it could be nucleic acids it could be anything with nitrogen you're calling it protein and then you're multiplying it by 6.25 which says

[00:37:41] I believe that protein contains 16% nitrogen which also isn't always true so now we've got this error on the front end and now on the back end we're going to try and measure losses so the primary loss of of nitrogen in the body is in the urine Ura so that's pretty easy to measure you can collect that second would be the stool uh so you can collect that but then you get into things like sweat and skin loss and hair loss and respiratory nitrogen ammonia and the breath and those are all incredibly vague so everyone who knows nitrogen balance says that nitrogen balance underestimates requirement everybody uniform but that is where the RDA comes from and it it when you do short-term studies what you find is most people young adult and again all these studies were done with college age students so they're kind of right at the end of their growth uh and basically in a short-term 7-Day study they look okay so that's s where we're at uh in the last 20 years those of us who study protein have gone beyond that and said well nitrogen balance is one outcome but it like the vitamin C argument there are other outcomes based on amino acid metabolism that may be more important than minimum nitrogen balance and and we now know that protein handling goes down the efficiency goes down as we get older so now we have much higher requirements that we that most of us talk about for adults so just to be clear Don going back to something you said the reason we all agree that that standard nitrogen balance underestimates the requirement is it's easier to measure the sum of the ins than the sum of the outs yeah exactly and and and the chances are you're significantly underestimating the outlets yeah especially if you do I mean when I was a surgical resident there were times we did nitrogen balance on patients who were on long-term tpn total parental

[00:39:57] Nutri in the ICU these were patients that um it wasn't clear how long it would take for their guts to start working again so they had to be fed all of their nutrition through a central line which is very complicated feeding to do and when we would have the nutrition team come and do a consult and do a nitrogen balance I mean they literally had to put a tent over that patient to that was you know they were doing the best that they could in the ICU to basically create a laboratory environment to calculate nitrogen balance which turns out as you're not surprised very important for a critically ill patient right I mean that is a hyper hyper catabolic State and if you're trying to create an anabolic state in that person to keep them alive it's imperative that you understand how much nitrogen they have uh or how much nitrogen that they require so um the the simple idea of I'm just going to tell you how much protein you're eating and I'm going to measure the nitrogen in that's coming out in your Ura that's that's just not going to cut it that's just too simple yeah and currently a lot of those studies are simply done with a factor so they don't put them in tents or buildings or whatever they just measure UA in the urine and everything else is just sort of it's a one yeah exactly exactly and so obviously we're perpetuating an error based on ignorance so then let's go one step further done um how do you use Isotopes to now really get into what's happening not just on the boundaries but like how that nitrogen and by the way I think there's one point we should make for The

[00:41:41] Listener who might be still lost as to why we're talking about nitrogen proteins have nitrogen amino acids all have nitrogen carbs and fats don't so this is where we we can really speak to the source of the nitrogen right now as you mentioned anything with a nucleic acid is going to have nitrogen as well but the majority of the nucleic acids come in proteins come in would be found in would be found in protein based foods yeah yeah right yeah right um yeah you're exactly right I mean car I mean fats and for the most part annoying essential fatty acids carbs and fats are basically energy sources they're carb carbon bonds that provide energy where amino acids have a very different purpose and structure and that nitrogen is part of what makes them different yeah in other words we consume carbohydrates virtually exclusively for their energy content fat mostly for its energy content there's some structural importance that comes with fat and cholesterol um but really you don't want to be consuming protein energy right I mean you know the only cavat I would say to that is that um there might be reasons that people are uh hyper sensitive to carbohydrates where uh taking in more protein beyond what you might actually need for protein metabolism might be a substitution for carb calories um and we can get into that conversion and things like that but um you know I I I talk with people and they say how well how much protein what's your highend and I sort of give them one number and I say but you know the caveat is you might want to take more if you're really trying to struggle with a carbohydrate issue so anyway but you're right so now let's talk about that measurement of what's actually happening with those amino acids actually only there's a question I want to ask even before that let's think about the normal when people think of protein they think of meat right that's going to be a great source of protein obviously there's there's protein in most foods have some protein in them but um if you if you were eating a piece of steak how many of those 20 amino acids are in there are they virtually all in there if you're looking at animal Source proteins whether it's meat or eggs or milk um basically all of the amino acids that a human would need are in those because they're basically you know obviously a chicken's not a mammal but the others are mammals and basically we have the same amino acids the same proteins so they're they're all there uh meat is a good example because they're all pretty much in the right balances but every protein has a little different balance of essential amino acids um you know you can look at Dairy proteins and dairy proteins are something we can fractionate because they're all water soluble so we know a lot about Alpha lactalbumin versus lacto Farin and lactoglobulin etc etc so we know that you know a lot of differences about amino acid compositions of individual proteins and so going back to what you just said then animal protein we typically think of as sort of meat mammals right you know beef Pig stuff like that then of course you've got sort of bird protein mostly chicken for folks and then fish protein and then you have eggs dairy we're saying B so of the first three the first three are exactly the same for a protein okay so whether it comes from a cow or a pig or a chicken or a fish muscle protein is still muscle protein and how do we think objectively about the quality of a protein this is a topic that uh you you've you've talked about extensively but and there's a there's a there's a way there's a numerical way to talk about that isn't there an efficiency of of that protein versus you know tofu versus you know soybean versus rice you know that all the way down to sort of lower and lower protein density Foods yeah protein quality is something that I think a lot about and I'm actually working with a group now to sort of reinvent how we think about that but I think you're referring to protein quality in a sense of PDC or Diaz or something like that basically we realize that when you look at a protein there are two there are two factors one is what's the composition of the those nine essential amino acids and the other is what's its bioavailability how well do we digest it and absorb it um with animal proteins uh and most isolated proteins you know even uh soy protein isolates uh the digestion absorption is pretty close to 100 it's usually 9 5% or higher uh for all animal proteins for plant proteins though it gets into uh you need to realize that in a plant the the protein is there for the purpose of the plant and so a lot of it is attached to fibers it's the structures you know we have that plants have proteins attached to the leaves and the stems and The

[00:47:19] Roots and the flowers and and uh the seeds and you know when you start to isolate that uh if you just eat it in a raw form uh it may only be 60 70% available uh because we can't digest the fiber so those are the two factors we can put those two together and get a protein quality score and we can uh determine that a whey protein isolate because of its essential amino acids is 20% better than a soy protein isolate just because of the amino acids or we can compare uh a wheat protein uh you know a a wheat brand and we realize that it's only 40% available you know so if you look at wheat brand on a cereal box and say it was a wheat flour uh and it says there's four grams per serving there's actually less than two that you can actually absorb and so you know that that's how we look at it um in my opinion um some of the problems with those right now is it's hard to compare across foods and it's hard to build a me that way we can say that weighs better than soy and so if you're only eating those two things that's okay but what happens when you start putting them together and so we I am working on a group with a group trying to build a printing quality score that really based on three amino acids uh lysine methionine and Lucine which in my opinion are the key markers for adult

[00:48:50] Health uh and so we're trying to resore it differently but you know that again long-winded story about protein quality but that's how it's measured no that's that's very interesting Don so what you're saying is if I'm understanding you correctly you could brute force your way through life by looking at every single thing you eat and trying to figure out the Dias score for its protein so okay

[00:49:13] I'm about to have a riye that's going to be about a 96% di uh I'm going to have my you know soybeans over here that's about an 80% Das I'm going to have my whey isolate that's 100% Das I'm going to have my shredded Wheats that's a 40% di that's a tough way to go through life because you can't just add up they not truly add yeah they're not truly additive you can't really figure that out and the and the average person doesn't even have that data I mean if you go into the USDA database with whatever 7,000 Foods uh there are 4,000 that actually have amino acid scores and of those there's probably less than 300 that have Dias scores and so you can't put it together uh there's no way and so we're trying to develop a system that allows people to get better than that if you if you look on a label on a package and you see again a wheat cereal that says it has four grams of protein well again that's a nitrogen analysis times 6.25 for all the problems I've said and then if you look over in another column it'll say daily value exactly and there almost no almost No Label have daily values for protein because they don't that would require a PD cast or di score and nobody has them and so that four grams really would translate into less than two but nobody's being told that that's right and by the way just for folks who are hearing us use the term di that's digestible indispensable amino acid score correct yeah right right okay so and I have a big problem the the the digestibility is where a lot of people have been focusing but I have a big problem with the amino acid scores because they're incredibly low they're way too low and so we have they're established by the World Health

[00:51:05] Organization by the FAO which is really designed to prevent malnutrition in Africa where we know from our Institute of medicine that the essential amino acid scores are much higher than that should be uh you mentioned stable isotopes a little bit ago or tracers we know from stable isotope studies that those fa FAO amino acid scores are too low and so that's part of the equation that we're not telling people either I want to come right back to that but I'll finish this one point which is what what you're offering as an alternative to people living in spreadsheets to calculate how much actable indispensable amino acid they're getting is hey what if we make this easier and you focus on the actual content of three amino acids so we're going to take a subset of essential amino acids and if I recall I remember Lucine was clearly one of them lysine was one of them was methionine the other one meth these the other one yeah so we're going to take methine

[00:52:06] Lucine lysine and we just want you Peter to walk around and make sure you get enough of those with each meal and if you do that the rest will take care of itself is that effectively what you're saying that's that's exactly what I'm saying if you look at di scores right now um the amino acid scoring a I've already said it's too low but if you look at how they're scored they're not scoring apples and apples they're scoring apples and oranges so if you look at the soy deficiency all all legumes like soy or PE are limiting or deficient in methionine and you score that against whey what you end up is the limiting amino acid in Whey is considered histadine and no one has ever shown histadine to actually be a limiting amino acid in an adult it's a liit amino acid in children and babies but nobody so now we're comparing apples and oranges they're not fair so if you compare methine to methionine it's not 20% higher it's 250% better in soy comparing soy way so so we we need to compare apples and apples we need to compare them across the three essential amino acids that are actually likely to be limiting where

[00:53:24] Hine phenol alanine to my knowledge no one has ever shown those to be limiting in an adult so why do we consider them limiting all right so you've already mentioned the importance of lucing and and listeners of this podcast are no stranger to Lucine because you know we've had David sabatini on we've had

[00:53:41] Matt cabrine on I mean we've gone Deep In The Weeds on mtor and in fact it was one of David's postdocs that actually discovered the Lucine sensor on M tour so we know now pretty unambiguously Lucine is an amazing trigger for mtor of course there's going to be a subset of people listening to this who are confused but wait a minute Peter if rapy is good and rapy inhibits mtor how can

[00:54:05] Lucine be good if Lucine turns it on and of course they're forgetting the chronicity of the state sometimes you need mtor off sometimes you want mtor off sometimes you want it on sometimes you want it off but when we're talking about eating we want it on right we want to be able to turn mtor on for muscle protein synthesis right so let's Circle back to our earlier com comment about how often you eat yeah uh so now we've got an issue of mtor and whether it needs to cycle on and off and not only does Lucine turn it on but so does insulin Y and so probably the worst case scenario and you can use a lot of animal studies to back this up would be people who eat a lot of small carbohydrate meals that continuously activate mtor uh what we want to do is use specific meals with the right amount of insulin to activate muscle Centric uh mtor mtor is in every tissue and what you don't want to do is continuously activate it in liver or some other tissue and so that's where the confusion gets into it is people ignore the fact that insulin is just a bigest trigger in other tissues where Lucine is a very unique trigger in muscle yep um so now let let's go back to the practical application of this so we T talk so we know why Lucine matters can you say a bit more about methionine and lysine and why um using you know raising them to the level of of um of of

[00:55:34] Lucine becomes a great proxy for overall protein load so if you look at if you look at limiting amino acids actually in food lysine is always limiting in grains and that has been shown in animal science over the years that's a that's a major limitation in how you feed what the minimum amount uh so that one is probably limiting for protein synthesis uh it's also in carnitine and some other things but lysine is probably mostly for protein synthesis methionine is one of the least so if we look at the amounts we need uh we need about 3.4 grams of Lysine per day we need probably a little less than one gram of methionine so they're not in the same proportion either uh but the methionine is what we call part of the one carbon pool and so basically for the body to make and repair DNA to make and repair

[00:56:37] RNA to make tarine Downstream to make the non-essential amino acid cysteine to make glutathione the oxiden methionine is the key to all of those Pathways and so uh we have methionine is one of the most limiting and it's limiting in all legumes so we think of soy and pea and a lot of you know and lentils and things of that nature is higher quality protein they are but they're still limiting in methionine what are some of the natural sources of food the that are that are high in methionine the classic one of quote sulfur amino acids is eggs eggs yeah that my eggs are are quite high in the sulfur amino acids which are methionine cine uh but all animal products are are adequate in them um and and basically all plant products are pretty low in them so don how when you know you grew up on a farm right so you you know we look at animals like cows which are quite muscular yeah eating basically just hay and grass for them to be able to be as catabolic as they are and produce so much muscle does that just speak to the incredible volume of that plant that they have to chew to make sure they're getting enough methionine enough lysine and enough Lucine I think you meant anabolic not sorry anabolic yeah in in such an anabolic State I mean what volume of total protein in the form of grass and hay and things like that do they need to get a sufficient amount of those muscle building amino acids that sort of wanders us into a sustainability argument which I really love to W weade into but cattle ruminant animals are a very important part of the food chain because of their stomach which is full of bacteria one of the things to think about for for essential amino acids is really the only place they come from in life is bacteria nothing else can make them uh and so our primary source of them in nature is the bacteria on roots of plants so the bacteria on the roots will take the nitrogen why do we fertilize our Gardens as nitrogen the the bacteria will take that inorganic nitrogen and form organic amines with it but and those organic amines then can be made into plant into proteins in the plants but as I said earlier the problem with plants is that they don't have the same balance as we need they have the plants to make roots and tree you know Limbs and roots and flowers and things like that the beauty of a ruminant is they can take that plant and they can digest it and the bacteria then will rebalance all of the amino acids they'll capture inorganic nitrogen and they make the essential amino acids that mammals need and they concentrate it for us so basically humans one of the arguments as humans evolved by being able to use more concentrated protein you know if we just ate you know if we just ate plants it's hard to get enough but if the the ruminant animal can actually digest all of that form it into it into uh into uh appropriate amino acids so basically for for every 60 grams of of protein an animal eat they will make a 100 grams of of essential amino acid you know balanc protein wait a minute yeah say that again so for so for every 60 gr of plant-based proteins uh and nitrogen that they'll take in they can upcycle that to 100 grams of amino acid balance protein so ruminates are called upcyclers so whether it's in dairy or meats or you know also you know goats and and sheep and and and deer all of those ruminant animals upcycle by eating grasses they produce great quality protein no other animal no other animal can do that and just to make sure I understand the mass balance of that the bacteria are obviously the engine of that upcycle but you can't make nitrogen out of nothing so you're saying the other four but they're making they're making protein out of nitr that's what I was going to say so they're getting the nitrogen from the fertilizer that went into the grass and not quite they're getting nitrogen that's inorganic in the plants but it's not actually in protein forms okay and so it's in the fibers and other kinds of things so they're able to upcycle that they're able to increase the value of non amino acid nitrogen plus they capture all of those other nitrogens so first of all that's f i i I had no idea that was happening I had I had never heard of that phenomenon so that's incredibly fascinating um secondly um are they also disproportionately creating acids that weren't NE necessarily there in the plant so in other words if you use the example you gave earlier which is you know you eat 100 gr of cow protein you're going to probably get quite an amount of methionine lysine and Lucine is it true that that amount of amino acid was not even present in the 60 grams of grass protein that they consumed exactly that's exactly what's happening so the the bacteria if you look at the Flora uh in the cow they have certain bacteria that will produce methionine or lysine so they can basically take a non you know an amine nitrogen or they can take glycine a non-essential amino acid and they can make it into uh into amino acids one of the one of the supplements that you can actually feed a cow is Ura so a human waste product type of thing we we excrete nitrogen waste as

[01:02:58] Ura in the urine uh you can actually feed Ura a nitrogen source to a cow and they can make it into methionine or Lucine or lysine unbelievable so the it's an interesting argument because you you know this gets now we're not now we're now we're venturing from nutrition into religion but right because there's certainly a group of people who would argue that we should not be eating any animal protein whatsoever we shouldn't eat you know we shouldn't eat meat shouldn't eat eggs we shouldn't eat dairy Etc um a counterargument to that would be it's awfully difficult without these animals to get adequate amino acids especially if you stop thinking of it in terms of an RDA and start thinking of it in terms of essential amino acids I try and stay away from the religious argument of it that's a that's a you know that's a personal preference as you said I grew up on a farm where we raised cattle and pigs we raised corn and soy beans and so you know I saw it as a life cycle type of thing uh I think of it as a biochemist uh and there's just no question that ruminant animals play a very important role in our food system and one we can't really replace uh we can't just idle millions of Acres of grassland and pretend that we can grow avocados on them or broccoli uh you know cattle uh basically spend a year of their their life on basically nothing but grass uh and that is an amaz you know that's and sheep are you know sheep and goats the same but those are amazing contributions to our food system yeah again I I was completely unaware of this capacity to concentrate and you know almost up produce um both in quantity and quality of amino acid that's that's a very interesting finding um so where were we before we went down that path because I was just trying to understand how it happened so so also didn't appreciate the role of the bacteria um I think we were about to get into oh I know where we can go back to you mentioned that you have spent some time studying the difference between call it 20 year olds and 60 year olds in terms of the efficiency of muscle protein synthesis so and this is where you probably have to get into the

[01:05:24] Isotopes right now you're getting into sort of nuanced stuffff but what do we know about a 20year old versus a 60-year-old who's under uh who puts their muscle under a progressive overload so they're they're now asking you know they're they're they're doing resistance training um they're being provided with adequate amino acids and let's assume they're being provided with not just the right uh quantity but the right quality of amino acid um what do we know about the assimilation of that amino acid into new muscle tissue across and and you pick any age you want I I just use 20 and 60 but I I know you've studied this at very specific age points piece of background before we get into that is important to recognize that whether you're 16 or 65 your body needs to make nearly 300 grams of new protein per day so there's a protein turnover every every tissue in the body is turning over uh some as fast as liver enzymes where you replace every hour muscle proteins where you replace with half lives of around 15 to 16 days so every 30 days collagen turns over at about halflife of a 100 days which is why if you hurt your knee it takes so long to repair it but basically if you put that into thinking the body replaces literally every protein in it about four times a year that's a pretty remarkable number uh and then if you think of we have to make 300 grams of new protein per day the average American intake is around 80 grams or less women 70 men 90 um that means that there's a recycling thing going on so of every new Protein that's getting made in the body about six out of seven amino acids are getting recycled all of that sort of feeds into this process of protein synthesis is protein turnover and what remember I said what I was doing with my Master's

[01:07:30] Degree we were studying the age related changes what we now know is that as you get older the efficiency of that protein turnover goes down so where a 16-year-old uh you give them a certain amount of protein they'll have a very good response a 65y old will have maybe no response at all or you know 10% or something but what we have learned sort of with the study of Lucine and initiation factors and all of that is that if you give an enriched source of essential amino acids more protein uh you can actually make the adult look just like the 16-year-old so what we know is that the efficiency goes down but the capacity to respond doesn't and so what we're now thinking is that what we now know is that if you have a requirement that's about twice the minimum RDA so instead of 08 is 1.6 G per kg uh we can get the adult the 65y old to respond just the same as the 20y old as far as muscle protein synthesis now you know a moment ago Don we talked about how it's a slippery slope if you just focus on total protein So when you say 1.6 grams per kilogram does this assume it's from a way like product and an animal-based product and if if that person says hey

[01:08:57] I'm 65 years old and I'm on a plant-based diet are you going to say that number is going to need to be higher so uh that's a great question a great way to ask it um what we know is that most people who go to a plant-based diet a vegetarian diet decrease both the quantity and the quality so your point is exactly right if you're on a plant-based diet you'll need more protein and that means you'll have to have more calories um but what's the threshold for that what we would probably argue is that if you have aund 120 gram of protein per day it probably doesn't matter the distribution between animal and plant because you probably have enough to cover it okay uh if you're only eating 50 grams of protein per day then it makes a big difference you'll never catch up to your essential amino acid needs so somewhere between 50 and 120 it depends on what you choose you know so you know if you're going to be plant-based you know have 125 grams of protein per day and you're probably fine but if you're going to be vegetarian and you think you're going to get along with 56 grams per day you're going to get in trouble going back to this difference earlier about the you know call it anabolic resistance right between the 65y old and the 16y old the obvious thing that comes to mind is there's a huge difference in Androgen level between those two right what are the other things that might explain this anabolic resistance that I think by the way I think it's very interesting that you can overcome that by a higher amount of protein but prior to that workaround what else do you think explains anabolic resistance clearly the hormone issues are first and foremost so you know I I I always make the comment that uh when you're growing hormones are your friend they're sort of driving it and you look at malnutrition in Africa and children will grow on really lousy diets they may not grow as healthy they may not live as long but there's a survival reproduction nature to that um now we switch to talking about healthy aging and I want to live to where my parents you know I want to get to that century mark now we talk about healthy aging and now we sort of change the uh we change the criteria that we're looking for um let's just think about M tour for a second and try and put that in framework uh there are four different signals that regulate mour uh We've mentioned

[01:11:40] Lucine we also mentioned insulin uh an enzyme a factor known as amp kinase which is carbohydrate sens is energy sensitive and then another molecule known as red one which is stress sensitive uh particularly resistance exercise so there are four different things the the individual balances when you're young and growing insulin and igf-1 dominates that and Insulin first and foremost is a growth hormone and when you stop growing at 25 it ceases to have an effect on protein synthesis and muscle and so now the shift the whole thing shifts the protein quality protein quality is not nearly as important when the systems dominant ated by hormones and so now what we know is as we get older we can buffer that loss of the hormones by higher quality protein mostly Lucine and resistance exercise those two factors will balance out the growth issue that young people have the benefit of the growth part so that's the the way you have to think about the change in efficiency with aging speaking of Aging at the front end of what you just said I want to I want to go into that a little bit more and um I think most people will recognize that this is an enormous problem in the developed world and we should talk about it through that lens because I think that's where it's most Stark but I'm curious as to whether or not you think this could become a problem or even plays a role in childhood obesity rate so let's talk about what happens to a child that is protein deficient at the beginning of their life what what is the implication of that later in life so when I got into protein um uh John waterlow and Joe milward and

[01:13:31] Peter garlic and burn and young were sort of the Godfathers out there that I learned from uh and I got involved with some International malnutrition with a US International agency for International Development usaid project in Morocco and so we looked at that and that that led us to doing some animal studies and basically we look you the animals to look at malnutrition and recovery and what we found was that malnutrition starvation insults early in life would stunt muscle development basically limited the DNA development limited the cellular development and basically they stunted lean mass in in the children and in the animals and if that was stunted basically uh what happened is the the

[01:14:22] IND the individual as an adult was always predestined to have low lean body mass and high body fat obesity and that was really the origins of how we started thinking about uh muscle Centric he if muscle didn't develop right if it wasn't metabolically correct you are predestined to some of these other things and I mentioned Gabriel Dr

[01:14:46] Gabrielle Lon and I that's sort of how we put that concept together is muscle Centric Health we've got to have the correct development and we have to have the correct protection as adults because that's kind of where both your mobility and your metabolic Health start Don what's the mechanism do we do we have a sense of why you know for example may maybe people are aware of this but when you look at children in places like Africa who are really malnourished um at first glance you almost pause and think well why are their bellies so big if they're malnourished right you know and yet they don't realize that's an actual that's an extreme and I don't even remember was quashi oror was that the name of the exactly yeah and what's the pathophysiology of that why is the extreme malnourishment lead to that protruded abdomen and things like that so there's sort of two function two terms two directions that childhood malnutrition goes one is called marasmus which is sort of the Skin and Bones look and the other is quashi oror which is that kind of inflated belly looking um the the the belief the belief of those two differences is that in quashi or cor there's disproportionately poor protein and that leads to changes in water balance and edema uh people have argued is it cortisol based you know is it stress based but it it appears to be an imbalance in the protein to energy relationship where in morma they're just short of total calories and total protein and everything but in in in uh uh in quashi oror it appears that the quality of the protein they're eating these starchy porridges and things like that totally deficient probably in lysine and methionine uh and that leads to water imbalances and other things and what is it about this critical window of development where this protein deficiency makes it very difficult ult for them to put on lean mass later in life and creates a propensity for osity so again we actually did some of that original research uh this was stuff we did way back in the late 7s early 80s uh muscle muscle is a very unique cell structure we have what are called muscle fibers and unlike a liver cell which has a a DNA a nucleus in each cell muscle cells are multinucleated they have what they're called satellite cells around them and so as the original fiber begins to develop the satellite cells will put DNA these nuclei into it and what we determined was that each DNA has a certain amount of protein it can handle and so what the DNA ultimately determines how big your muscle can get and so what we determined was that lat in pregnancy early in lactation if the insult occurs during that you stunt these satellite cells and you don't develop enough DNA so the muscle is always Limited in its potential size wow um I was aware of the propensity for osity later was not aware of the uh the limitation in lean growth so this is really the double whammy right it's effectively lifetime CC obesity yeah so so basically you're decreasing your lean mass you're decreasing your metabolically active tissue uh and and and so you're sort of stuck with minimal calories will deposit fat now look in the US it would be hard to imagine a child developing quashi oror but clearly there are kids in the United States that uh are disadvantaged enough that they're not going to be exposed to high enough protein in either quality or quantity do you think that this that there's to a lesser extent some of this problem that's going to happen in in developed

[01:18:54] Nations like the US I think it's possible um frankly these are the kinds of things I worry about with the advoca of plant-based diets you know we're starting to see New York City taking uh animal proteins out of school lunch um I mean what is that really going to do we're we're conducting a public health experiment without actually having any knowledge of that uh

[01:19:19] I think that's frightening and the the issue is public school lunches uh nursing homes dayc carees these are all under these federal guidelines where we're deluding out the quantity and quality of protein at the same time with no knowledge of what that's really going to mean so I think that's you know I think that's pretty frightening to be doing that kind of Public Health experiment without knowledge of it yeah

[01:19:46] I hadn't even considered it through that lens actually um let's talk about something else that we alluded to briefly but now I want get back to which is um maximum protein uh usability or assimilation in a given sitting so um I I'll I'll tell you where I come at this so so one of the challenges that I've observed in taking care of patients is when they get into a very heavy regimen of Tim restricted feeding so you're probably aware of this Don but you know there are ideas that say look if you can just limit the amount of time that you eat but not place any limits on what you eat or how much you eat or what you're eating from um into this sort of intermittent fasting window uh it produces some health benefits and uh it's certainly an effective way to reduce calories so if the goal of the exercise is to reduce total energy expenditure and you create a narrow enough window you will indeed do that but what we've seen repeatedly is people who after say 6 months of adop opting a very narrow feeding window say one meal a day we lose weight but disproportionately we'll lose lean tissue and um so so the the diagnosis here is pretty straightforward right they they clearly reduced energy intake but they probably reduced protein intake too much and so body composition actually got worse despite the fact that weight went down which then gets to a point which is well can't you just eat all of your protein in one meal so if a person says

[01:21:27] I'm just going to eat one meal a day and let's just say this is a very active person right so they're going to eat 3,000 calories in one sitting which I will raise my hand to saying I can do that quite easily I'm quite a glutton um even if I was able to eat 150 grams of protein in one sitting is it clear that my body will get the benefit from that that it would if I ate 50 gram three times a day yeah it's quite clear that you won't get a benefit you know that there is a limit um so so now we need to think about the body as muscle versus everything else um so we're going back to the muscle

[01:22:10] Centric view that I like yeah yeah you're probably sensing a theme with me at this point the uh the muscle there's a lot of data now that muscle can handle protein meals for an Optimum anabolic response between about 25 and maybe 60 gram okay so then you start getting into distribution if you think you're if you're going to have 150 grams per day how should you distribute it um one one of my pet peeves in nutrition uh I'm slightly getting off track here is people refer to protein as a percentage of calories prot protein is not a percentage of calories protein is an absolute number you need to decide on what you're going to build your diet around so right now we're building it on 150 uh the the the issue with protein is being an absolute number if your calories go down say you're now a 75y old woman and your calories per day is now um 1,200 calories you still have 100 gram per day protein requirement so now your protein needs are 35 to 40% of your calories uh if people are doing weight loss it's an absolute number so people should never talk about percentage of calories uh that's that's basically people who don't think protein is important and say well fat should be 30% carbohydrates should be 50% and that leaves 15% I mean you don't you have to think about protein first so so that was the issue um as far as distribution um from my research one of the things that we believe is that the most critical meal of the day is the first meal of the day when you have had an overnight fast your protein synthesis is down and that entour signal molecule is down regulated it's inhibited and until you have enough

[01:24:14] Lucine around three grams which translates to about 30 g of protein for most people until you have a a meal that has 30 or more grams of protein your muscle stays catabolic so you're continually breaking down protein we think that's a significant aspect of Aging that people have lower and lower protein they don't eat protein at breakfast and that and we know the efficiencies going down in the first place so we want a front load protein in the day so we want at least two meals that are well above 30 gram of protein so I always have people shooting for 4045 at their first meal another 4545 at their last meal and then in between um you know again if we're if we're talking with people who are um say an elderly woman trying to maintain minimum muscle I'll concentrate on those two meals if I'm talking with somebody who's trying to do weight loss

[01:25:19] I'll concentrate on three because I don't want them getting hungry if I'm talking with someone who's trying to be hypertrophy a muscle builder I'll concentrate on four so how many meals per day do I make anabolic and muscle and by anabolic I'm thinking 35 grams or more and the data that we know for absolute certain is the first and last meal are absolutely important the middle meal I'd be hardpressed to tell show you a single study that where anybody's everever show looked at lunch and so the reason that you're saying for the anabolic person we need four meals is we just simply need we know it we know we need it for positive nitrogen balance we're just going to have to get the yeah right so there's two there's two aspects there's one is mtor signaling muscle protein synthesis

[01:26:07] Lucine effects and the other is total protein per day so those two lead say well if I need more protein and I max out at 50 grams I need another meal and what about timing um so let's just talk about someone who's doing their strength training in the morning so let's say someone's going to do strength training from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. do you want them having that first bolus of protein before the workout there's some debate about that um you'll find some people and trainers who believe that we did some studies and most of them were with animals where we looked at different timing and we find that exhaustive exercis is C metabolic no matter what so having protein ahead of it doesn't make it so we we find the benefit is after the exercise when the system is now finally tuned we've stimulated red one actually we've inhibited red one the system mour is ready to go so we find the benefit is after exercise not before and just to be clear what you're saying is look you can take all those amino acids before but it's not going to prevent you from becoming catabolic during exercise because again exhaustive exercise is a catabolic activity so you are going to be breaking down muscle no matter how many amino acids are on board while lifting it's more important after the lift that you have a good meal you'll find some disagreement in that in the literature but I strongly believe that what you just saids correct and my research supports that and talk about the efficiency or the window in time post a workout in which you want to make sure you're getting that first big meal of protein is it one of those things we we I'll tell you a funny story so my my youngest son who's now five but when he was like three I mean I don't know for whatever reason he just fixated on protein probably because we kept telling him to eat this and eat that because there was protein in it hey eat your salmon it's got protein eat this because it's got protein and basically he has become the protein police of the preschool so he just he walks around and he looks at kids snacks and he's like that doesn't have protein that granola bar does not have protein that has protein and you can imagine what these people who work at the preschool say to my wife when she drops him off and picks him up she's like uh are you a nutritionist and she says no oh okay it's just you know your son really fixates on everybody's protein consumption so we joke about how he's going to be like that like one of those bro protein guys who's just going to be all obsessed with his protein and when he's eating it and stuff like that so

[01:29:05] I've lost our train of thought here for a minute but just to focus on the children for a moment so we're talking about adult protein needs and I don't want everybody to walk away thinking gee I need to get 50 grams of protein in my kid um children children will be very efficient at maintaining growth with small snacks of you know eight to 10 grams of protein where that will have virtually no impact for an older adult so you know a a protein bar that had um 10 grams of protein is a perfectly legitimate snack for a child where essentially the only thing it would do is probably increase liver enzymes in a 70y old so don't want all the mothers think they they're doing a Bad Thing by giving their child a 10 gram protein snack okay I want to go into I remember what we were going to come back to so

[01:29:54] I'll take us back there but let let's talk about that a bit more so um because that's actually news to me I didn't realize that there was minimal benefit in smaller quantities of protein so this is another argument for don't dribble out your protein commit to it it's binary you eat it when you eat it and then you don't when you don't yeah so again children versus adults and the adult if if if we have if we have uh every meal of the day uh let's say we have 100 gram of protein but we take it in in very small meals 15 grams trickled in all day long you will never stimulate muscle protein synthesis but your liver will be perfectly fine your gut will respond to that amount of protein your gut your liver your heart your kidney all of those organs will respond to the no the net protein per day no matter when you ate it but muscle doesn't muscle is specific uh muscle is such an energy you mentioned earlier there's so much mass to muscle muscle isn't triggered unless the diet is exactly right and we could get into teologicos at this point Branch chain amino acid why does the muscle sense that but basically the muscle senses energy insulin protein before it triggers and if all of those aren't balanced it won't trigger but your liver will yeah I mean I guess to your point theologically you might make the case that the liver has more concern for the brain than the skeletal muscle and and maybe it gets priority over being happy because it has to maintain glucose homeostasis and without glucose homeostasis the brain would literally die within you know 20 minutes so yeah I guess likewise you know your liver your heart those have to function you know middle of the night your liver still has to be making protein but your muscle doesn't while you're laying there in bed your muscle is catabolic and it's supplying amino acids so all those other organs work yeah so while I argue about muscle Centric Health the reality is moment the moment it's organ based yeah but longterm your overall health is determined on keeping the muscle healthy because it keeps everything else healthy and just because I want to keep talking about this before we go back to where we were before I distracted us um is the reason that it's okay for kids to be you know eating little bit much smaller amounts of protein is it simply just the mass that you know like I mean my youngest weighs 25 kilograms so is it basically just saying look he probably doesn't need more than 40 grams of protein a day so for him to have a 10 gram serving is 25% of his Protein that's that's like me having 40 grams and plus his protein synthesis as we mentioned earlier is driven by hormones where yours isn't so his growth his growth is highly efficient uh it's driven by hormones and he he'll he'll accommodate it in small doses and and you're right he probably only needs 45 for the day anyway okay so

[01:33:08] I'll take you back to where we were before I sidetracked us it was now asking about how big a window you have to refeed to maximize muscle growth so so we actually did that for first experiment in rats so Josh Anthony and Tracy Anthony were in my lab uh that was just before Lane came uh and what we were looking at was exhaustive exercise again at rodents we were looking at this catabolic State we were trying to look at how the muscle regulated recovery and so we were looking at what we called initiation factors and we discovered the link between Lucine and an initiation

[01:33:52] Factor called EI four and that is sort of the downstream effect of mtor mtor is the regulator and it stimulates eif4 and S6 and other initiation factors and so what we found was that when you came out of an exhaustive exercise muscle is catabolic until you took in enough Lucine to reverse it and so we started looking at feeding right after exercise and Stu Phillips and a number you know

[01:34:21] Doug Patton Jones and Luke Van a lot of people sort of picked up on that um okay so now the caveats um the biggest effect of feeding right afterwards is about a 2hour window but that's in untrained individuals um if you begin to look longer you can have about a resistance exercise and you'll detect the difference you'll begin to make them you'll start regulating that red one protein factor and you'll see an anabolic effect the next day 24 hours 36 hours later so when does your protein effect well it makes it more effective all the time um the more trained you get the less you're going to see a post exercise effect so if you're beginning training during the first four weeks post exercise protein probably makes sense if you're well trained you basically training the same way and you've been doing it for six months I don't see any effect difference between having protein within two hours after exercise versus just having your three or four meals per day you won't see any difference in either mass or strength yeah I remember having this discussion with Lane as well and and being very surprised by that right being but pleasantly surprised by the way because it says hey look once you get to a point where you're well trained enough you don't have to be so maniacal about meal timing you can just focus on the big picture which is total protein protein quality and spreading it out such that you don't exceed the metabolizable fraction of it at anyone sitting right exactly and people you'll hear trainers take that last statement metabolizable energy and you'll hear trainers say well you can't use more than 30 grams at a meal you won't digest it or whatever that's not true I mean you'll digest and absorb 100 grams of protein at a meal but muscle in particular only has a window of around 20 25 to 60 depending on protein qualtity where it can use it the liver will use all of it I mean it doesn't matter yeah we have what is known as first pass metabolism of protein which confuses the issue even more when you eat a meal of protein approximately 50% of the protein is is is is degraded to nitrogen and carbon before it ever gets to the blood almost 50% the one exceptions the exception to that are the branch amino acids Lucine isol leucine veine and over almost 75 80% of those get into the blood and we're back to that teleological argument why did muscle learn to sense that because that basically shows up in the blood in direct proportion to the meal and the muscle learned to sense that as a meal quality it says oh wow this meal has adequate quality for me to to trigger this very expensive process of protein synthesis protein turnover over and until it sees that signal it won't do it while we're on the topic of muscle

[01:37:29] Don another thing I've learned somewhat recently that surprised me um was the importance of Lucine in um fatty acid oxidation by the muscle so you know one of the things that is such an important pillar of our practice is um kind of lowend aerobic training we call it zone two so zone two mitochondrial efficiency so this is basically pushing your muscles to the maximum point at which you can keep lactate below 2 Millo and in a very fit individual that you can generate a lot of power while still keeping lactate below 2 Millo I mean the the best in the world can produce more than four watts per kilo while still keeping lactate below 2 Millo and they're doing so virtually exclusively with fatty acid so we will pair this type of analysis with

[01:38:27] CET testing and we will look at fat oxidation rates and again you will see the fittest of the fit have insanely high fat oxidation rates they're over a gram or you know roughly a gram per minute um so tell me uh so so another point of that is look a really good muscle doesn't just rely on glucose a really good muscle can oxidize fats very effectively what role does Lucine play in that that's a great question and I don't think it's been researched well enough but uh there's no question so Lucine I I mentioned earlier we're talking about amino acids and every amino acid has a different side chain well Lucine is one that's referred to as a branch chain amino acid and its side chain is purely carbons it's a carbon chain that looks a lot like a fatty acid and so Lucine is one of really two amino acids that are ketogenic it is metabolized as a fatty acid and what we know is that Lucine will also activate the cpt1 enzyme the carnal pettin transfer enzyme which is the link of bringing fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation so there's a benefit there um it gets a even more complicated in that when you have higher Lucine it also begins to inhibit pyruvate from going into the U into the mitochondria so when you oxidize a Lucine the nitrogen that comes off of it is put onto pyruvate generating an alanine and so the body begins to recycle glucose so it becomes kind of steady state on glucose and emphasizes fat oxidation so back when you were talking about Schulman studies early if you overload all of that basically you can make the Lucine inhibit carbohydrate oxidation so if you have huge amounts of carbs coming in and then you overload the system with Lucine you'll inhibit pyruvate oxidation and so that could look like insulin resistance but if you look at the physiology of how it's supposed to work under conditions where you'd be burning fat like you just described Lucine actually stimulates fat oxidation and Spares glucose for the brain and other tissues so again you really have to think about how the experiment set up and what is p you know what what's getting inhibited and what's getting pushed now you've recently um actually taken an interest in weight loss right so the dietary interventions that can be efficacious for for weight loss and and treating things like metabolic syndrome so let's build off this idea a little bit but how do you incorporate um the strategy around reducing energy intake right because because that's this is sort of how I think about weight loss right like you got to reduce the intake but I think of three broad ways that you can approach that so three strategies right one is you just reduce calories and that becomes the only focus so you you you pay attention to the total energy content of food without thinking about the timing of food or the macro distribution of food the next approach is you spend less time thinking about the total number of calories spend more time thinking about the macronutrients create I describ it as sort of create a boogeyman in the diet some things that you avoid and the Restriction of certain things becomes a roundabout way to restrict total energy and then we talked about time restriction as well as another strategy um so if how do you how do you think about manipulating that middle bucket of yeah you know changing macros to achieve energy deficit so I totally agree weight management is a calorie issue and it's not the same for every individual everybody's got a little different efficiency so you know we understand it's not you can't be an accountant and expect to just count calories all the time but um let me build it as a story of how we thought about it uh back in the late '90s uh the keto you know Atkins and the keto diet were out there and Berry Sears and uh protein you know the Zone diet and Michel Leeds and the protein power and I was looking at all of those things and we were doing those Lucine experiments and we had discovered this effect of Lucine on muscle protein turnover and some of these metabolic things with you know fat metabolism and

[01:43:17] I basically took the leap of faith and said you know I think the underpinning of all of these diets is really the protein carb ratio and how can we manipulate that and so I started thinking well you know if we're going to create diets one we know that from a satiety standpoint protein is probably the most satiating you know L's fat would be next carbohydrate the least um we were concerned about big insulin swings so we wanted to sort of balance out our carbs per meal we know that if people are overweight they tend to have big post carbo postmeal carbohydrate and Insulin swings where they get two hours later they'll have insulin low uh carbohydrate lows and so we started trying to think about that and we said okay so we think the first meal after an overnight fast is critical so we're going to correct that so we basically started saying how much protein do you need 30 40 grams of protein uh to get both satiety protein synthesis effects um we knew that protein had a higher thermogenic effect burns more calories more heat than either carb or fat so we wanted to frontload that effect people have argued that well that's because protein or the nitrogen it's harder to digest and absorb we don't think that's true at all we think the thermogenic effect is stimulating muscle protein synthesis we know that that is a massive ATP expenditure and so what we want to do is maximize that at every meal so our first meal we wanted to be 40 gram of protein we wanted to have a carb level that would not overstimulate insulin so we kept that under around 30 grams for what we created a carbohydrate threshold concept uh we can go into and then fat sort of to round out the calories and we basically develop three meals a day to distribute like that um we basically increase the protein to about 1.6 grams per kg and we ran the study comparing it to the food guide pyramid with point8 so as far as we could tell we did three different studies one a total feeding study where we fed everyone a second study with diet and exercise that was four months and a third study was multi- centered with 120 subjects that lasted 16 months and so we did three studies the last the last two were free living where they were they were responsible for the food but the first one they were fed the first one we fed them in the lab so we knew exactly what they were eating the second one we actually fed them for their first two weeks for a few meals so they really saw what it would look like and the last one was totally free living based on the diets and manuals that we developed and and each of these was two arms where the only difference was protein so in the first one it was two arms uh food guide p pyramid high carb low protein versus higher protein low carb the second one was 2x two so we basically had the diet treatment and then we had a resistance exercise treatment MH so high protein low exercise high protein Etc and then the last one was Diet uh with a generic recommendation for exercise but two by just a two treatment effect so what did the first experiment show the really well controlled one so the the well-rolled one what we found was that with the higher protein and as far as we could measure exactly the same calorie intake the people on the higher protein low carb lost more total weight more total fat and less lean and that stabilized their insulin and glycemic regulations and lowered their triglycerides across the board and what do you remember what the difference was in in weight and um fat mass and and and was it all explained by the thermodynamics of the um delt difference in protein it was close we we found that based on you know if you just if you assume that body fat is a you know 3500 calories and you can make that calculation we we found we figured out that uh the people on the higher protein diet were getting a benefit of a I think it was around 170 calories a day eating the same calories so that could be about the thermodynamic effect and so in other words that de that amount spread out over the duration of the study explained the difference in weight loss right so both groups lost weight they were both on weight loss diets but the protein people lost uh and I didn't look those numbers up but they lost around 8 lbs more and almost all of you know something like you know six and a half of it was fat and did they also um complain less of hunger or was there a difference subjectively between the groups yeah uh we did we did a satiety uh check in that uh really just a uh uh using an analog scale we just asked them to rate how they felt and stuff and one of the things that the dietitians who were running the study always came back is they said that the the protein people were never talking about food and snacks but the people on the high carb diet were always talking about being hungry and snacking and so yeah there's definitely a different satiety and compliance issue to it and and F was in that study in the longer term studies in the F first study which was only 12 weeks basically all subjects in both groups finished the study and the longer studies would got into four months and longer uh we found much higher Dropout rates in the high carb group too so did the results of all three studies point in the same direction which was a higher protein weight loss so a protein sparing weight loss diet which gets back to your point earlier stop thinking about protein as a percent of total calories protein should always be absolute and if you want to think about it that way it's actually it should as as you reduce calories protein should increase the total fraction of calories um right is going to preserve lean tissue better maintain satiety better and plus there's potentially this bonus of the thermogenic effect of protein right it definitely partitions the weight loss toward fat protects muscle the lean tissue definitely has higher satiety um you know and one of the things we know in in fact for a long time there's a lot of debate whether people over 60 should ever TR practice weight loss because they would lose bass and they can't gain it back um you know there Doug Paton Jones had the theory that uh sarcopenic aging isn't a gradual decline it's a series of acute effects that you injure yourself you're in bed you're you have a surgery whatever you acutely lose lean mass and you can never gain it back so we were concerned about that we want we want weight loss but we don't want people to lose any lean mass especially if they're adults if you're a 20 year old it probably doesn't matter so much but if you're older you know if you're beyond 40 it does matter it's a scary thought

[01:51:00] Don if you think about it right I mean 40 40 is not that old and yet yeah um you know I I recently had shoulder surgery uh so as the time that we're recording this I'm probably about five months out from that shoulder surgery and um I I still have not gained back all of the the the muscle mass now I think I will gain it back um but I look at how difficult it has been and how acutely I lost it I mean within 3 weeks

[01:51:31] I was 10 pounds lighter I lost 10 pounds of body weight yeah and it's obviously not just from the shoulder it's when you don't have an arm you can't squat you can't deadlift you can't do all of these other things so I I would bet that you know obviously some of that was water weight but look I think seven of those 10 pounds was lean tissue that I lost in in a in a span of three weeks there's some tremendous research by my colleague

[01:52:00] Doug Paton Jones who unfortunately passed away this last year um who did a lot of that kind of bed rest sort of study and looking at older adults versus younger and in the same period of time an older adult in bed rest will lose four times as much muscle as a younger adult it's it's frightening how fast you can lose it and you know to your point if you're diligent and do weight training you can begin to gain it back but it's hard to ever get back to Ground

[01:52:29] Zero if you lose it and aging and people ask me well all this loosing stuff when does it really come into play you know is it it's not as important for a 20 year old as it is for a 60 but where's the middle ground you know where does it change and I think it's a little like bone health I think once you're once you're 40 you're sort of on the back end of that and you need to be much more careful Doug and I ran a study which you know everybody quotes now where we took 90 grams of protein and looked at it distributed as three meals per day 30 30 30 versus 10 20 60 uh and we found that with the same amount of protein the same overall diet uh you would have higher net protein synthesis with the distri distribution to breakfast so that's kind of where all the distribution data came from was that study and uh we ran that study in 37 year olds the average age was 37 so we think that by mid-30s you can detect the distribution effects and just to be clear Don do you think that the reason 303030 was better than 10260 because you started the day at 30 or because you had three meals where you cleared the hepatic threshold that's a great question and one that I wish the Twitter world would understand I think the effect is moving at the breakfast the first meal I think that frankly we'd have been better off 60210 as the other arm right that would be their no I think it I think it should have been I think it should have been 40 what's the math 40140 I think the first and last meals are the key okay the and and I'll give you the reason for that we've done a number of studies in animals uh other people Mike renie and and uh Phil

[01:54:23] Atherton have done it in humans but when you trigger M tour at that first meal we know that it's still stimulated 5 hours later so why do you need Lucine for mour at lunch if it's still stimulated you don't so there's nobody has actually studied that at this point unless unless you're the person who just is so big you know like you're Lane right like if you're laying and you're you weigh 200 lb and you're a bodybuilder but the key to what you just said is now you're talking total protein per day not a Lucine effect yes exactly it's no it's not a Lucine mour effect toal substrate it's it's okay Lane needs 250 grams of protein per day he'd be better off putting that in four or five meals than putting in two so that's the difference that people need to understand is that Distributing across all the meals if it's for weight loss and appetite that's great but it's not an m effect so don this kind of brings me to to sort of uh you know something we've talked about before which is you know so much of this research that you've done has been funded by industry and a lot of people are going to say well we're going to Discount everything Don just said because you know so so so give us the names of some of the organizations that have have funded your work over the last four decades so so let me backdrop that for you um so I have the Lucine concept that

[01:55:53] Lucine was going to be key to protein synthesis in muscle we ran a study in the early 80s where we realized it was initiation stut effect and so we then started to realize we started looking for what those initiation factors were going to be and it's E4 so we sent that as a proposal to NIH National Institute of Health for 10 years and basically it was continuously turned down and they saidwell we only study disease and we don't know of any deficiencies of protein so it's not a priority to us and so basically I was left with what turned out to be a revolutionary idea of

[01:56:37] Reinventing protein that NIH wouldn't fund and basically I finally went to craft Foods the national Cattleman's beef Association the national Dairy Association uh the American egg board um and uh some of the other groups who were inherently interested in protein and they fun and we had some from the USDA from I I was at a land grant University so those were the funding sources that basically unlocked all of this knowledge about protein uh for adults Lucine mtor uh muscle Centric Health all of that was unlocked simply because we could get funding from Craft and beef and you know am I biased well you know everybody who eats is biased in some way and you know if you if you look at research and I think maybe Lane said this with you I never believe research when I read it until I see it in three more Labs so I don't mind if people look at my research and say I don't believe it but my research has been out there very clear theories for 20 years now and every test makes it stronger and so that's how you believe it the fact that craf or be funded it's irrelevant the issue is everybody who's ever run the study after me shows the exactly same thing and do you think NIH has or have you seen I know you've been you know semi-retired now you're kind of not really retired but you're you're you're retired from the grant cycle um exactly but do you have colleagues that are still in it or do you see any evidence that NIH has taken a broader person you to health uh if nothing else they should be able to look at the fact that 2third of Americans are you know have metabolic syndrome and that should at least give pause to think we might need to revisit the way we're approaching nutrition and and therefore maybe we should be funding quote unquote n diseased research in nutrition I I think they definitely have um Chris Lynch who's director of nutrition at NIH now uh that position didn't even exist is that within niddk where does that sit that's a great question I think it's across multiple institutes so which one actually funds the most I think niddk might be the one um the Cancer Institute

[01:59:10] I I think it I think his unit actually BR goes across multiple okay uh institutes but again that didn't exist back in the late 80s early 90s um so you know I think it may be a little broader but there is a general philosophy still at ni that uh NIH does not do applied food research that industry should fund it so that becomes a catch22 you know there you know if we're going to study the difference between whey and soy unless you can say well that's going to cure heart disease they're not going to S fund it um and so you have to then go to the dairy Council and say I want to do this study and then people say well you were funded by the dairy

[01:59:59] Council or I go to the soy board or whatever um so it's a catch 22 but basically the alternative is we put our head in the sand and we don't do the research so basically I look at people in nutrition right now um and literally I don't know anybody in nutrition who doesn't get industry funding that's just simply how you have to get funded yeah one of the things I'd also point out in this whole issue of biased it's important to recognize that the animal

[02:00:35] Commodities are all under the USDA supervision because they are uh animal Commodities and they're they have check off boards so that means everything they say in advertising has to be screened where the grain industry has big companies like Kelloggs and pillsberry and Coke and Pepsi and they can literally go out and say anything they want and so you'll see a product out there that pretends to be uh an egg and they'll claim that there's better than eggs but egg can't come back and and refute it they can't say so you've got two different Playing Fields one that's highly restricted and and supervised and the other which is is fair game you know F you know first amendment I can say anything I want on that topic Don what how closely have you paid attention to kind of uh both the plant-based meat and the synthetic Meats

[02:01:34] I've I've I've paid a little bit of attention because obviously there's two companies that are uh pretty popular I can never remember their names I think it's beyond meat and impossible meat or something like that exactly got it and and they're plant-based Meats right so they're making meat out of plant and then you have a whole host companies none of whom I can remember the names of that are actually trying to make synthetic meat um yeah the little bit that I've read about that which really amounts to reading like two scientific articles uh left me with the impression that that will not be technically feasible um that that just from an energetics cost mass balance um sanitation GMP standpoint that's not going to happen so it's um uh that that's my way of saying either I'll be proven wrong or that will turn out to be one of the biggest boondoggles um of industry in some time um do you have thoughts on either of those two uh including kind of nutritional composition and and how it feeds into an amino acid perspective first of an overview I think that as the world continues to expand in population we're probably going to need additional protein sources um we may be near our capacity for animal-based proteins I I mean we may not be a you know I I don't think we can double it again so we may be near so we're going to need other sources so you know I I accept that plant-based proteins are important to us uh I totally agree with your comment about synthetic proteins I don't think that will ever be economically or environmentally feasible I don't think that's true uh then we get into sort of the the the popular versions of plant-based you know beyond burgers and things like that and the reality is it looks like a flash in the pan I mean people tried it uh and basically if you go to a Burger King and look basically they had a good sales for a few months and basically and you track that it was all people who don't normally go to

[02:03:40] Burger King it was people who were interested in a plant-based Burger they went and tried at once and never came back um so basically we know the stock has fallen through the bottom now we know that nobody's using it um the problem with it is um let's take beond you know Beyond Burger uh basically it's a PE Protein that's produced in Canada it's shipped to in China because we can't process it in the United States there's no processing for the most part they're beginning to develop it but when it came out there was none ship to China

[02:04:14] China processes protein ships us back to the US uh we know transportation is a number one cause of greenhouse gas gas in the world uh and so now we've shipped it all over the country comes back to the US and they process it into something uh with like 25 ingredients probably five or six of them are not FDA approved uh I wasn't aware of that what why why why so they have multiple products they have multiple components and synthetics that have never really been studied and they're not FDA approved so they're basically relying on safety uh without ever proving it um you know will that ever come back to haunt them I don't know but you know in the in the spirit of having Natural Foods there certainly not anything natural about them um so anyway I you know I think that plant-based proteins have been around a long time um I think trying to pretend that it's meat uh or you know calling calling soy drink milk or almond

[02:05:21] Dr drink milk I think those are travesties I think those are standards of identity uh almond milk has uh what one gram of protein per eight ounces where cow's milk has eight calling that milk is is pure deception you know my wife my wife I love cashew milk by the way that's how I make all my smoothies and stuff my wife calls it nut juice she's like I do too you g to have some of your nut juice yeah I mean and and you know I'm not against using them but

[02:05:53] I think think theature needs to be correct yeah I mean if you look at one of the examples I like to use is that if you look at a wheat cereal won't pick any but take a wheat cereal that has four grams of protein per serving we always said that's only two probably on the label it says you mix it with uh 34 of a cup of milk so now we have 10 gam and if you look at the lysine balance of that it's exactly balanced but if you go to soy milk a uh soy milk only has six grams per uh 8 oz per cup instead of eight so now you already have less protein and it's also deficient in lysine so it takes almost a quart of milk takes almost 30 ounces of milk to balance that cereal so if you're a mother feeding this to your child and thinking well I'm doing a plant-based thing and I'm feeding them a totally deficient diet with uh you know 6 ounces of soy milk for breakfast I'm feeding them a totally deficient SCI diet how many mothers know that yeah yeah I I look if I don't know that I'm guessing a lot of mothers don't know that and so those are the kinds of things that we think need to come out about protein quality we want a system where we can show people an additive value and that at the end of it and I put that meal together and this this is a company called wise code that I'm working with uh we think that we can show with using

[02:07:27] QR codes and your phone will simply add them up and you can tell what your total meal looks like yeah that would be incredibly helpful I mean I I again as I alluded to earlier still something I trouble uh I have trouble with is um is is doing it especially on days when I don't have access to as much meat and what it comes down to for me is just how much did I have from leftovers the night before so you know I've got a meat based Meal which is my dinner uh you know Wild game is sort of our our routine right so elk and Venison and stuff like that and if

[02:08:01] I'm smart enough and thoughtful enough to make a lot extra then I get I can basically have it for breakfast and lunch the next day but sometimes I'm not and then I'm you know I'm making protein shakes I'm I'm you know eating a venison bar here and there but it gets a lot harder and yeah I've never even I'm having a hard enough time just making sure I hit the total grams per day of protein yeah and it's it's there's no attention on my end going into hey how much methionine is here how much Lucine is here how much lysine is here um and if you know as I said a while ago if if you've got5 grams of protein in your diet per day chances are you'll hit those numbers uh and where where Lucine is a meal to meal number lysine is a daily number it doesn't matter meal to meal it's a total and I guess for me that's probably okay but then I think about it for my wife or my female patient where it I mean it's like it's hard to get them up to 120 grams per day yeah we struggled with all of the adult women we had in our studies and you know we had whatever 3 400 uh it's a real struggle to keep a female at 100 grams of protein per day it's just a struggle uh and that then quality becomes an issue and you know that's my my concern with the whole plant-based movement is that do people have the resources to make that you know can you make that healthy sure you can but you a need a lot of knowledge you need a lot of food skills and you're going to have to eat synthetic products because you can't get it from eating you know Bean you know lentils and rice you just can't eat enough of them and so you're going to have to have shakes or supplements or something to get to that kind of level otherwise the the track record says that vegetarians will end up around somewhere in the 60s for their protein per day and quality does make a difference at that level well Don this has been really interesting I'm I'm so glad that we were introduced and um uh I can talk about protein all day because it's an eternal interest of mine personally but also in terms of helping as many of my patients as I can I think this is uh perhaps the you know it's not the macronutrient that gets the most debated on Twitter that's reserved for carbs and fat but this is this is the one that I think we need to be paying more attention to so uh I'm grateful for the work you've done and for uh the attention you've brought to it today in our discussion yeah I appreciate the opportunity to do that and I you know maybe one thought I'd leave you with that we haven't touched on is people talk about high protein uh and I think it's important to try and come to with what that means if you look at all of the epidemiology which I think is pretty bad science the definition of high protein is about 1.2 gram per kg and low protein is actually below 8 and so a lot of them will express it as percentage of calories and they'll say less than 10% and so when you look at the epidemiology you need to realize they're talking about very narrow ranges of protein intake uh and and it really is the

[02:11:21] Protein that's making a difference it's the calories and the other things that are going with it and I'll just one last thought when I was for four years I was director of research for the American egg board so I funded all of the research that basically got the chol uh Direction eliminated from our guidelines um one of the things we funded though was there was a lot of research suggesting that eggs had a high correlation with obesity and diabetes and heart disease and so we funded some research with with uh U Teresa Nichols and Vic foroni who are experts in the N

[02:12:01] Hanes data and what they looked at was that in the epidemiology the difference between the first quartile and the last quartile for egg consumption was three to three and a half so they were basically say saying that a half an egg per week or per week yeah per day uh I'm sorry per week half an egg per week was the difference in causing obesity heart disease and diabetes and so what they did was they went into the enhan data and they factored out all of the eggs that were eaten at fast food versus the eggs that were just eaten at home in a quote good nutrition setting and what they found is in every case eggs now became a positive they reduced obesity they reduced so basically it's not the egg it's the egg in the company it keeps and you can make anything a bad diet yeah and I think to your point it when we talk about epidemiology pointing at high protein being uh a problem you realize anybody who's tried to actually consume high protein realizes it ain't high protein it's high calorie that's the problem yeah and the protein is along for the ride because again 1.2 uh grams per kilo is actually kind of low protein in the context of a high calorie diet if you do if you look at epidemiology and you do any food service surve is what you realize right away is that the data for protein is pretty good if I ask you how many eggs you ate yesterday you'd give me the number if I ask you how many ounces of milk or how many grams of of meat you'd give because we sell those by ounces in weights but if I ask most people how many carbs they ate yesterday they'd miss it by 200 grams and so that's the problem with epidemiology is that the errors are are not homogenous they're they're not equal so anyway I ramble on but a great pleasure to chat with you pet thank you

[02:14:00] Don this was fantastic [Music]
