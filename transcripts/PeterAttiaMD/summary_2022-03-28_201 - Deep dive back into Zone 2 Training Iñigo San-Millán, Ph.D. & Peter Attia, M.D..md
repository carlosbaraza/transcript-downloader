Iñigo San-Millán is an internationally renowned applied physiologist and a previous guest on The Drive. His research and clinical work focuses on exercise-related metabolism, metabolic health, diabetes, cancer metabolism, nutrition, sports performance, and critical care. In this episode, Iñigo describes how his work with Tour de France winner Tadej Pogačar has provided insights into the amazing potential of elite athletes from a performance and metabolic perspective. He speaks specifically about lactate levels, fat oxidation, how carbohydrates in food can affect our lactate and how equal lactate outputs between an athlete and a metabolically unhealthy individual can mean different things. Next, he discusses how Zone 2 training boosts mitochondrial function and impacts longevity. He explains the different metrics for assessing one’s Zone 2 threshold and describes the optimal dose, frequency, duration, and type of exercise for Zone 2. Additionally, he offers his thoughts on how to incorporate high intensity training (Zone 5) to optimize health, as well as the potential of metformin and NAD to boost mitochondrial health. Finally, he discusses insights he’s gathered from studying the mitochondria of long COVID patients in the ICU.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features a deep dive into Zone 2 training with Dr. Iñigo San-Millán, focusing on mitochondrial function, metabolic health, and exercise physiology. The discussion covers the science behind Zone 2 training, its importance for health optimization, and practical implementation strategies. They also explore the relationship between exercise and cancer metabolism, long COVID impacts on mitochondrial function, and the role of lactate in various physiological processes.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Zone 2 training is defined as the exercise intensity where mitochondrial stress and oxidative capacity are maximized [00:35:54]
- Maximum fat oxidation occurs at different power outputs for different fitness levels [00:54:36]
- Lactate clearance capacity differs between elite athletes and recreational athletes [01:00:57]
- Long COVID patients show mitochondrial dysfunction similar to type 2 diabetes patients [02:46:48]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Aim for 3-4 days per week of Zone 2 training [02:02:16]
- Sessions should last 1-1.5 hours for optimal benefits [02:04:54]
- Use conversation test to gauge Zone 2 intensity [01:44:03]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Beginners can start with 20-30 minutes and progress gradually [02:04:54]
- Elite athletes may need longer duration sessions [02:03:28]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Zone 2 training should be done at an intensity where conversation is possible but slightly strained [01:44:03]
- Heart rate ranges for Zone 2: 70-80% of maximum heart rate [01:42:30]
- Recommended frequency: 3-4 sessions per week minimum [02:02:16]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Lactate levels during Zone 2 should be between 1.7-1.9 mmol/L [01:42:30]
- Fat oxidation measurements via indirect calorimetry [00:36:23]
- V̇O2 Max testing for overall fitness assessment [02:54:54]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"Exercise is the only medication we know that improves mitochondrial function" [02:14:12]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. Further investigation needed on metformin's impact on mitochondrial function
2. More research needed on the relationship between Zone 2 training and cancer metabolism
3. Long-term impacts of Zone 2 training on aging and longevity

This analysis captures the main points but there's much more detail in the transcript. Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect?
