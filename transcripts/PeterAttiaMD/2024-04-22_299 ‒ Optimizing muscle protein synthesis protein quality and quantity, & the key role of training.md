## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Luke van Loon, discussing protein metabolism, muscle protein synthesis, and aging. The conversation covers the science behind protein digestion, amino acid utilization, and how exercise influences protein synthesis. Key themes include anabolic resistance in aging populations, the importance of physical activity for muscle maintenance, and practical recommendations for protein consumption.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Muscle protein turnover is approximately 1-2% per day, meaning complete muscle renewal every 50-100 days [43:22]
- Anabolic resistance can be induced by just one week of inactivity, showing a 35% reduction in protein response [2:13:25]
- Brain protein turnover is approximately three times faster than muscle [1:30:50]
- 20g of protein per meal maximizes muscle protein synthesis in healthy adults [1:19:58]
- Physical activity can normalize anabolic response in elderly individuals to match younger people [2:15:44]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Consume 20g protein per main meal for optimal muscle protein synthesis [1:19:58]
- Include resistance training 2-3 times per week minimum [2:04:27]
- Consider protein intake before sleep to prevent overnight catabolism [2:19:40]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Higher protein needs (1.6-2.0g/kg/day) for active individuals [1:24:11]
- Increased protein requirements for elderly and hospitalized patients [1:24:11]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Whey protein: Rapidly digested, high leucine content [1:08:21]
- Casein protein: Slower digestion, sustained release [1:08:21]
- Collagen: Limited evidence for connective tissue benefits [2:25:38]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Resistance training can prevent muscle loss even during caloric restriction [1:57:15]
- Type II muscle fibers particularly important for maintaining function with age [1:27:13]
- Exercise increases muscle sensitivity to protein for up to 24-48 hours [1:47:21]

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Plant-based proteins may require higher quantities to achieve same effects as animal proteins [2:32:42]
- Protein quality matters more when total intake is lower [2:32:42]
- Mixed meals slow protein digestion compared to isolated proteins [1:44:22]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Muscle biopsies used to measure protein synthesis rates [1:39:02]
- Isotope-labeled amino acids used to track protein metabolism [1:00:14]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Study on protein synthesis with 100g protein intake [1:39:02]
- Research on hospital protein intake patterns [1:24:11]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"The muscle itself doesn't seem to get that old, it actually still responds completely normal and I can normalize for age by physical activity." [2:15:44]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Long-term effects of protein timing on muscle mass
- Mechanisms of brain protein turnover
- Role of specific amino acids in brain function
- Optimal protein strategies for various clinical populations

[00:00:00] you can take an aged individual who might have you know again 20 or 30% less anabolic response to protein than a young person but if you exercise them you can bring them up to the same level as a younger person these two factors suggest that activity might be the main determinant of anabolic resistance and an aging individual or age within an individual is simply a proxy for activity and so it's more difficult for older people to maybe do the same training loads but the muscle itself is still responsive so the good news is you don't have to start exercising when you're 40 to actually have good muscle when you're 80 you can still do it at 70 now it's better to do it at 40 as well but at any age and that's also 100 plus the muscle is still very responsive to physical activity hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:07] AA Luke thank you so much for being here I know it's evening time for you and as we were talking a moment ago uh uh I think there's a decent chance we're not going to get through all of this you uh you laughed when you saw my agenda of topics so uh maybe we will have a little Austin reunion and we'll we'll do the next one in in person here in

[00:01:26] Austin um but let let's give folks a little bit bit of a a bit of your background um you you have you have quite a storyed uh resume can you give us a little bit of the the Highlight um yeah I mean as many people I didn't know what to go and where to go to college um as most of us exercise physiologists we're all fi athletes so we want to know how our genetics can be actually just compensated for by uh science and so I wanted to do movement

[00:01:59] Sciences so I studied movement Sciences here in mastri the Netherlands after that I went to Austin Texas for my master internship to work with Jack Wilmore who people in exercise physiology will obviously know at UT after that I finished did my uh PhD in mastr again then after that I went to Melbourne to work with Mark Hargraves also well known to most people in this this field spent some time in Melbourne and then came back and actually did the rest of my career here in uh the

[00:02:29] Netherland so from assistant Prof to uh to associate and to Prof here and that's already been like I don't know 13 14 15 years ago and you know today we're going to not talk so much about the movement stuff although that would be obviously very interesting and our audience I think would appreciate that as much as what we're about to talk about but we're going to talk more on the uh on the nutrition side of things um we're going to talk specifically and in great detail about protein but that's if I'm reading your CV correctly not necessarily the first foray into nutrition that you took correct no that's correct so my main interest was in the beginning and also my PhD was in fuel selection so substrate selection during exercise and of course that most of that stuff is done during endurance type exercise and if you're thinking about substrates you of course are not thinking about protein which is from a quantitative point of view is not a very good substrate so it's carbohydrate fat metabolism and most important or most interesting thing for me that time was that they had set up a stabil isotope research facility here so you could track metabolites and one of the first things that that lab did is actually measuring carbohydrate oxidation rates so you would simply throw in some stabil isotope labeled carbohydrates in your drink and by simply the oxidation of those carbohydrates and you would actually expire exhale uh 13 CO2 because then if it's labeled with 13 C you get 13 CO2 after you oxidize it and by simply acquiring your expired breath you can actually calculate how much of your energy came from a sports drink now that was so cool for me at that time now just to be clear you you would also need to know the amount of oxygen consumption to be sure that that CO2 came from Ox came from glucose and not from fat correct yes so it's a combination of indirect kilometry so that's total oxygen uptake total carbon dioxide production combined gives you total energy expenditure and also total oxidation of carbohydrates and fats and then because you know what per per percentage of the carbohydrate derived CO2 was expired by 13 CO2 you could calculate back how much of the carbohydrate is coming from your drink and that is cool because then you see how much of the drink are you actually using now it's interesting Luke that there's a a method obviously that uses uh deuterated water in C13 doubly labeled water to measure energy expenditure in a free living environment over a long period of time um is the method you're referring to only using labeled carbon and therefore only suitable for a short period of time to evaluate uh glucose oxidation or do you also label oxygen and potentially get energy expenditure over a long period of time no that's that's that's if you use doubly labeled water you can actually do that over several days but then you also need to you need several days in order to do that yeah so this is really a way of your you're getting uh you're getting carbohydrates in you start oxidizing them that CO2 is also mixed in your blood so it takes a while before the expiration of labeled carbon is also um a good proxy for the amount of carbon carbohydrates that you're oxidizing so it takes about two hours then you have a nice steady state that's why we're measuring endurance atlet of course and then for one or two hours you can measure the oxidation rate so that's only for exercise trials for example and did this tend to be more accurate than the estimate you would get of carbohydrate oxidation rate just using the indirect calorimetry and the Weir equation or was the point here to determine not total carbohydrate metabolism but specifically how much is coming from the drink exactly exactly so the basis is still indir kilometry so respiratory exchange ratio um and then from the carbohydrate uh oxidation you can see how much of that carbohydrate is coming from your drink got it versus glycogen for example yes exactly so you have your glycogen coming from your liver you have your glycogen coming from your muscle you can actually detect that with an intravenous glucose Tracer with a different label and then you have your 13 C label in your drink so you can actually see all three substrates so you can see what is coming from the drink what is coming from your muscle glycogen uh and what is total coming from your gluc from your your plasma glucose which includes of course the drink but you can subtract that from Total and then you have all three three different sources and of course that was not enough for us so we also wanted to know what fatty acids are being used from your intramuscular triglycerides so the fat inside your muscle fibers and what has come actually from the fat tissue that is releasing fatty acids and then transported to the circulation and taken up in the muscle because that is also an important top topic for athletes but as we will probably touch upon later also for for example diabetes patients well it's not going to be possible for me to just leave that one alone Luke and jump into protein because I got to understand especially for my own selfish needs as

[00:07:46] I'm preparing for kind of a long-distance endurance thing I thought my long endurance days were behind me but I I do have one more very long endurance event that's going to take about 20 hours coming up in a few months and it's been so long since I've thought about how to prepare energetically for something like this and I really believe at least based on my history that nutrition can make or break you in these you know 20-hour Marathon events so tell me kind of some of the things that you learned in studying even though I know you only studying it only you know over two hours but but what did you learn about for example the rate of U carbohydrate metabolism muscle gly en liver glycogen in the steady state so I thought we already had it quite a list but I think just added something to it no so so one of the most important things is basically all the glucose that is extra coming in your circulation will be used for oxidation during exercise so a continuous supply of glucose coming from your gut is a good idea to save your your your your liver glycogen to keep your liver glycogen intact or at least not to deplete it too fast um and so if you can maximize that and of course we know that with glucose or glucose polymers that is about at a rate of 1 to 1.1 grams per minute so about 60 to 70 grams per hour however it can be a little bit higher if you actually add some fructose because fructose uh requires a different transporter so if you combine both glucose or glucose polymers with fructose you actually can get a little bit higher but that's only for really the high-end athletes that can actually uh gain that high uh energy expenditure they you can may be up go to 1.3 1.4 grams per per minute um and so that would be the ideal from the carbohydrate uh point of things but of course if you're doing a 20 20 hour endurance event um and you're well trained you'll actually be using quite a lot of fat because that's what what you're training for y and in that case you require your fat stores in your m as well as in your yeah I mean you already have enough fat stores in your in your fat tissue of course because theoretically if you're 70 kilogram weighing lean man you can run for almost

[00:10:11] I think so what so would it be probably like three three days or something like that 24 hours so of course that is that is only theoretical but the uh it's obvious that the amount of fat inside your scal muscle tissue is also very relevant because uh I mean you know you appreciate that your muscle glycogen storage increases as you become a better endurance athlete or better Athlete on itself same goes for intramuscular Tri triglycerides so when the muscle get sorry just to clarify One Thing Luke because people who listen to this

[00:10:47] Podcast May remember gosh it a couple of years ago I had Gerald Schulman on from Yale Jerry's one of the world's experts on insulin resistance and we spoke there about the mechanism by which intracellular fat or it was actually diol glyceride not Tri not triol glyceride within the cell was one of the

[00:11:08] Hallmarks of insulin resistance but I think you're talking about something different here um and are you not are you talking about uh triglyceride between the muscle cells and not in um or are you talking about no this this this is actually I mean and you will actually appreciate that as as a physician as well so a lot of the clinical work is done by clinicians and people that focus on the clinical work the exercise physiologist focus on the exercise work and sports or Sports supplements you you do notice that a lot of work that has been done in the two

[00:11:42] Fields does not get uh used by by either s right so when I was doing substrate uh substrate metabolism muscle and the selection and how that is that is organized and and and regulated first I was interested of course in carbohydrates because during moderate to high intens the exercise from a quantitative point of view that's the most important substrate source and so as exercise intensity increases you depend more on your endogenous carbohydrate stores but what you can see is during moderate intensity exercise and lower much of the fat is actually being used uh by athletes and that increases also during higher intensity exercise as you become a better athlete so as a good athletes you get the same exercise intensity even the same relative exercise intensity you can oxidize more fat and that is the benefit because then you KN you need less of your limited stores of carbohydrates now the body of an atlete or the muscle of an atlete adapts to store more glycogen but it also adapts to store more fat inside muscle fibers and that's intramyocellular lipid so that's really inside the cell lipid droplets that you see in a muscle fiber so in these days I was actually cutting muscle biopsies up looking under the microscope and if you actually see them you see those individual fibers a lot of Li lipid droplets it looks like you're looking at a soup from the top and you see those little droplets floating around now that is a storage that is ample used by athletes and hun hoppler and those days was one of the first to do electron microscopy uh pictures of that and if you then look inside one of those lipid droplets you see that on most of those lipid droplets there's a mitochondrian attached to it wow it's like a backpack it's like the the M con is wearing a backpack of a big lipid droplet and so we started and I think we were one of the first to start measuring how much of that lipid inside the muscle inside the muscle fibers is being used during exercise and we did that using those stabil Isotopes indirectly but also by taking muscle biopsies before and after exercise and looking at the number and the size of these small lipid droplets and that goes down so atlet use a lot of the intram myell lipid for their energy provision and particularly in the beginning of exercise and then you think like hey this makes sense so when you start exercising all your lip all your lipolysis in your fat tissue takes time to get that process going I mean perfusion uh lipolysis this almost this is like immediate access prime the pump yeah so so just to be clear I I was never aware of this um that that you could actually see mitochondria on the fat droplets within the cell of the muscle would this be a fundamental distinguishing feature between the muscle cell of an athlete and the muscle cell of somebody with type two diabetes which will also have fat within the muscle will it simply not have the mitochondria and therefore not be turning to it as an energy source out of the gate very likely I've never seen electromicroscopy pictures of that because it's different difficult to quantitate that because there's so many lipid droplets so you can't make it quantitatively but we actually and exactly what you said there were also other people in in our in our University and our department looking at diabetics and then I started to be interested in hey what's the difference because if you compare an an uran strain athlete and a diabetic they both have huge intermicellar lipids and the differences is the atlete uses it uses it depletes it builds it up again but the diabetic doesn't and if we actually exercise the diabetics they will not really using that inam myell lipid and that makes perfect sense because why because their blood is full with free free fatty acids so the muscle is not going to use those limited stores in the muscle because it's constantly getting free fatty acids from the circulation so in the diabetics it's a permanent storage with very little turnover while in the atlet it's a substrate source that is constantly being used and so the use the turnover of that that that substrate is the important factor driving towards insulin resistance or actually insulin sensitivity yeah I um I remember reading a paper 12 years ago that very erroneously uh came to the conclusion that uh athletes on a ketogenic diet who had high amounts of intramyocellular lipids were insulin resistant and I was shocked because I couldn't believe they could fail to look at turnover rate and actually differentiate a static from a dynamic process but this is obviously a more important example and a more relevant example yeah one of the fun things that we actually did is we saw that athletes in the beginning use a lot of interocellar lipids but in the second stage of their endurance exercise they stopped using them and then we thought like strange why is that but it actually happens when your free fatty acids in the circulation go up and it makes a sense of course by the time that your ose tissue is constantly actually feeding free fatty acids you're not using that storage Depot anymore in the muscle so as soon as free feses went up the use of iny lipids went down and then we thought like hey what would happen if we reduced the free fatty acids in diabetics during exercise yeah and we actually gave them a sepper marks so it's something that blocks adpost tissue uh lipolysis so in the diabetics the free fatty acids would not go up anymore they would actually go down and they suddenly started using interm cell lipids and that improved post exercise insulin sensitivity so it's a very nice way to to to to stimulate the turnover of the iny cell lipids and it's probably one of the mechanisms that makes insulin sensitivity improve after exercise what what role does insulin play in accessing uh the intramyocellular fat store so obviously insulin plays you know along with maybe hormone sensitive lipase the most important role in determining the rate of esterification versus lipolysis in the fat cell uh and obviously we know the role insulin plays for glucose into the muscle cell obviously there is also non-insulin dependent glucose uptake but where does insulin if at all factor into the both the athlete and the diabetic with respect to how uh fat is getting into and out of the muscle or into the muscle and then oxidized so insulin of course also stimulates fatty acid uptake but if we're talking in in an exercise setting insulin doesn't play a whole important role anymore during and immediately after exercise because the stimulation of your amk pathway also stimulates uh glucose uptake as you know that glute 4 Transporters are actually locating to the outer membrane in either insulin dependent or exercise dependence two separate Pathways um for fatty acids it's even a lot more difficult because the F Fe fatty acids a lot of it is actually facilitated diffusion yeah I was about to say because the membrane is fat soluble I was going to ask you how I assumed it was just going to diffuse through with a gradient a very uh chance finding or chance finding we were just a lucky finding on the side of the study when we were measuring depletion on of uh of iny cell lipids in the leg in a nonivasive way using Mr mrss magnetic resonance spectroscopy uh we did that in the in the leg but we just for fun we also measured the arm and of course you're not cycling with your arm so we did an M before and after exercise and of course the fat in the muscle went down in the legs but it actually increased in the arm so simply the greater turnover and the greater Flux Of free fatty acids in inactive muscle it actually increased the amount of inter cell lipids yeah so it is not regulated yeah um is not that that that intelligent the muscle just takes what it can get it's very opportunistic yeah um no it's it's this is incredibly fascinating what do we know about the endurance athletes capacity to consume fat in uh uring a steady state exercise so for example if a person is doing uh again I'll just be selfish and use my own example right if

[00:20:29] I'm you if I'm doing a 20-hour activity um and you know let's just say energy needs are going to be relatively low because the energy expenditure is you know the the energy output is not that let's just say we're requiring 500 K Cal per hour um so we could you know almost meet that through ingested glucose that would be 1.25 G per hour but you know truthfully that would be sort of punishing on a GI system for 20 hours so you'd want to sort of potentially maybe limit that to 30 G per hour of carbohydrate which would you know meet about half those needs would you say look you're very likely going to need nothing else because the remainder of that will be met through uh endogenous fat stores and a little bit of endogenous um uh glycogen or would you say no you know you could Prime that with a little bit of additional substrate that is is presumably fatty acid yeah I mean that's that's a difficult question of course because nobody's done a lot of work in long-term I mean that longterm and type activities but after

[00:21:39] I've done and this is always always fun if you do nutrition research first you start with carbohydrate related research because I thought the be and endol everything is is liver and muscle glycogen but then you start looking at oh the intramuscular triglycerides are an important substrate source as well what happens if you deplete them after a few hours of exercise and how fast do you replete them because if you were to do a next session with depleted intramuscular triglycerides you wouldn't have that Prime that you're referring to yeah so repleting that is also important and then we realize that only carbohydrates is not enough you also uh need fat and of course now that I'm actually doing a lot of research in protein we now know that we also need protein and then then we're back to food but that's another discussion well let's talk about that let's talk about your transition um because I I could sit here and pick your brain all day on on the carbon and fat issue but but um H how did your own interests sort of transition you towards protein metabolism just going slightly back to your last question because I think you asking also a practical question for yourself so when we saw that fat was important in the muscle we started also looking at post exercise fat repletion so you have enough fat to provide you enough fatty acids during that long the 20-hour endurance event but I think you should not start doing that with too low of an intramuscular fat level um and when we started talking with ultraendurance athletes they were actually proving me right but even though there's no data they were saying like look I can't really perform in several Day events so multi-day events if I don't eat enough fat and that's maybe because of the iny cell lipid storage that you want to repete between several days and that takes one or two days to repete it so if you do more of these 20-day events back to back then the fat repletion is important for a single event I would think it wouldn't be that important by the way do you have a sense we we we do tend to quantify glycogen capacity you know we would say maybe a you know a healthy athletic reasonably sized male would have 100 grams of glycogen storage capacity in the liver 3 to 350 grams in the muscle

[00:23:57] I'm sure there are athletes even higher do you have a sense of what those numbers are like in the muscle for uh how many grams of fat could be stored in a in the muscle of a of a healthy athlete no it's way way less than that so um I think there were estimates and now I have to really think because I'm going back 20 years um I think it was also around like 100 100 200 grams okay but that's still a lot because of yeah but the caloric density of fat being higher I mean that's functionally as many calories as you would have from glycogen yes but I think the calories are not important not the most important but the priming those to to actually cover from activating the uh the edpost tissue towards having enough free fatty acids in in the circulation and that takes about half an hour 45 minutes and that's where it's important yeah last question on this topic I know I said we would leave it but this just reminded me of something else which is um what does a window of time look like in which an athlete has the greatest opportunity to replenish intramuscular fat stores and intramuscular glycogen presumably it's a window following exercise but how long does that window remain open yeah so it remains so um the first I mean they don't know exactly but within about the first four four five hours we see that insulin that glucose uptake is less or almost not insulin dependent um so basically the more carbohydrates you ingest the more it goes into the muscle but then as your glycogen levels increase then you get a a break on on glycogen deposition so glycogen storage is inhibited simply by its content so it's a self-limiting uh self-limiting process which is great because if you don't you actually have a muscle disease um so the first few hours you all the GL glute four Transporters are in the calma so all the glucose that comes into circulation gets sucked into the muscle meaning just the contraction of the muscle alone during exercise is getting that glute 4 transporter into the membrane without the need of insulin and it's open field running for glucose coming into the cell exactly and that's one of the reasons why exercise is so good for maintaining um glucose homeostasis it's not only the total amount of muscle but especially the way you use the muscle I mean the easiest way to get to to actually cruise to your or glucos

[00:26:37] Torance test is before you go to your GP you actually run for two hours because then you'll have the lowest the lowest ogtt that you'll ever see yeah I did that I did that actually once um just as a test um I wanted to see how insulin sensitive I could make my muscles before a 2hour ogtt and I don't remember the exact results but it was astonishing how low you know your you know glucose at the start is maybe 80 milligrams per deciliter and an hour you know 30 minutes in an hour and 2 hours later it never went above 100 milligrams per deciliter in glucose but also to your point about the insulin Independence I don't think my insulin went above 11 right so it was like whereas a post PR you know even a fasting insulin for is above 11 is not common so um yeah that that's a very interesting experiment what about the fat window is that also about a 4-Hour window and for those of you interested in that that that insulin that insulin effect I mean that goes up to 24 to even people have shown 48 hours after and that is the reason why nowadays for exercise for diabetics they say 150 uh minutes of exercise throughout the week I would think that's a minimum but I mean that's the advice but then at least every other day and at least every other day is because every session improves your glucose homeostasis for up to 24 hours so if that exercise is actually every other day you maximize benefit from the exercise with each and every meal that you ingest afterwards yeah now for for for fatty acids it's much more or it's actually less difficult because it's not tightly doesn't seem to be tightly regulated because of the facilitated diffusion of your fatty acids but of course if you're an athlete and you're consuming huge load of carbohydrates

[00:28:28] Especial also during exercise of course you're not going you're going to uh limit your lipsis and then you have less free FR assets um so the only thing that we really did that doesn't seem to be a short frame it's just constantly going um it seemed like up to about 48 Hours the fatty acids so the interm cell lipid was almost at the same level again and just to be clear are you saying that most of the filling of the muscle with fat will come from endogenous fat stores via lipolysis or is there a role for exogenous I.E dietary fat in the post exercise phase to to boost that further and and I understand your point but I want to make sure the listener understands that the relationship between carbohydrate ingestion and lipolysis is very clear the more carbohydrate you ingest and the higher insulin goes the more you inhibit lipolysis which is the bra break down of fat from the stored fat cell but with with with that explanation out of the way um does my question make sense for you about the source of the fat yes so um about 50% in a well-trained atlete about 50% of the fat oxygenation during exercise comes from your intramuscular triglycerides and the other f f 50% comes from free fatty acids released from your adapost tissue transported through your blood taken up now we've um the only studies that we've done here was with fat supplements during exercise because there's not much reason to take fatty acids because there there's enough fatty acids being released from y post issue but we did play around and that was Oscar yoker actually playing around with medium chain triglycerides so medium chain triglycerides are actually smaller uh fatty acids so not as not as the tail is is is less less long and they can be actually transported directly into the mitochondria so they don't need the con cpt1 transport so uh we thought it was nice to get a faster oxidation and with labeled labeled substrates they show that the medium chain triglycerides even during high-intensity exercise are re really oxidized and the idea was that could save carbohydrate use so that you can maximize fat use during High int high intensity exercise and therefore

[00:30:53] Speare glycogen and improve performance now it basic Al it worked with MCTS but then we tried to see whether we could make it quantitatively interesting and then almost everybody got diarrhea yeah I was about to say um the big challenge with getting sufficient enough MCT volume is the gastrointestinal distress and I think for most people at least if consuming it in a pure oil form 30cc is is really pushing it I mean when

[00:31:26] I was hard on MCT oil back in the day this is 12 years ago I could do two tablespoons of MCT so whatever you know how many ever milliliters that is uh that said and I I haven't done this but I do see other products out there that are somehow lazing the MCT they're almost putting it into a powder form have you seen any of these things or heard I've seen suggestions that there's a lot of MCTS or MCT like products that

[00:31:56] U presum have less issues on the gastrointestinal tract um yeah I haven't used them and I haven't used them in in research yeah uh still I would contemplate like in what amounts do they actually contribute substantially so that it uh improves performance and I think as long as you can actually reach your goals with carbohydrates why would you play around but yeah is there a role is there a role for MCT oil immediately following exercise as a very quick rapid source of fatty acid in the muscle or are you saying no because right after exercise your insulin is so low just let the lipolysis fill the tank why would you bother adding I mean we all want to lose a little bit of adapost tissue anyway right yeah I I think so I I agree I I don't see I mean from a from I mean I'm a nerd of course so I love to see what is happening but I don't think it has any relevance in practice okay all right so uh with that very interesting detour out of the way uh let's talk about how your profession interests uh pivoted from this obviously interesting and relevant field to another yeah so I think one of the interesting things was when I saw they called that the atlet

[00:33:08] Paradox High inell F fatty acids in high high inell lipid stores in in diabetic and obese people and also in atlet so what is the difference between them so I started doing some diabetes related research and exercise exercise work in diabetics to improve insulin sensitivity and and improve substrate metabolism and then we were taking muscle biopsies and I remember my mentor back back then Dr

[00:33:36] Hans Kaiser um he was actually teaching me how to take muscle biopsies and he's a physician so he was taking biopsies and what we often saw is when you took a biopsy from an athlete it's like a chunk of muscle sitting there like a piece of of of good Stak but then if we took biopsies from the diabetics often sedent people it was like a blob it wasn't standing up it didn't have any structure it was just like like almost like liquid and then we always saw that and we were discussing that and it was obvious that diabetes or a less centry or more centry lifestyle comes with changes in muscle quality and of course if you start thinking about muscle quality you start thinking about protein synthesis and protein metabolism and because I was working with older people uh because the diabetics were older than my athletes and so I thought like hey this is much more interesting then uh than the athletes what is happening with that muscle and then you automatically go from only substrate to protein metabolism and yeah that's where I got stuck uh and still haven't figured everything out or actually I have more question than I ever had before well I think that's the mark of a a really fun place to be truthfully um so let's uh let's give folks some some basic background right I I um let's let's not say any more about carbs and fats for the moment because we could spend hours just defining them but I do think people at a high level clearly understand that if you include ethanol there are four major macronutrients um but let's talk about this one called protein what is protein what are the building blocks what's it's made up of what defines a protein uh which ones can we make which ones can we not I'll let you run with that in any way you fit and then then we're three hours further so protein is one of the three micronutrients uh protein consist of amino acids amino acids are the building blocks of protein and so they're also the building blocks of our cells because all our tissues is mainly protein of course um we have um yeah say about 20 or depends how you define it 20 22 amino acids of which nine are essential and uh the rest is non-essential the definition of essential is always confusing to my students because essential means we uh can't make ourselves so there's no endogenous synthesis in our bodies in humans whereas the non-essential um you can actually to some extent synthesize now I'm I'm probably mucking it up for everybody because what I always say to the students that doesn't mean that your non-essential amino acids are not essential in your diet and then they they they never differentiate between them anymore because as far as I know I reckon that it's almost impossible to synthesiz those non-essentials um but that that is something that is still a topic that I would like to address but that's difficult in humans of course because you can't simply just throw away all the protein and start feeding uh amino acids and maybe we'll just also just so people kind of get a sense of these things they're called amino acids because they have a very clear structure and and I have to be honest with you my biochemistry is so Rusty but

[00:37:01] I sort of remember them having was it did they have a carboxy head and a nitrous tail with a carbon in between and then organic acid yeah yeah so it's an organic acid with this nitrous tail so nitrogen is the big piece here that we don't see in carbohydrates and fat carbohydrates and fat are basically carbon hydrogen oxygen here you have carbon hydrogen oxygen but you also have this big piece of nitrogen so I'm sure we will talk talk about nitrogen balance um and then you have other things thrown in there like you know methionine has a little sulfur in it and things like that as well uh but but I guess the point is just biochemically they all have a similar backbone but the what differentiates the 20 or 22 of them is kind of the what's in the middle that's the special sauce for each one and that's what differentiates them yep so and then that's that what differentiates them and um yeah that also defines their their individual uh characteristics now we see that amino acids are important as our own building blocks of course and so that's why we need to consume protein because they provide us with those building blocks but what is interesting and we'll come to that later is that it's those amino acids are more than building blocks they're also signaling molecules that directly stimulate muscle protein synthesis so they directly activate um the empor pathway driving muscle protein synthesis and so it's interesting and I always explain it to first year students like you have a building site where you actually have bricks being delivered and the bricks themselves pick up the phone and call the the Brick Layers to come over so it's really amazing how that works so simply eating and I'll come to that later stimulates your muscle protein synthesis now um of course I'm a muscle physiologist so most of my work is on muscle we've been starting to work also on different organs because yeah this is of interest and there's not a lot of data there available but what we do need to know is that you are producing about you're synthesizing about 300 grams of protein on a daily basis that includes tissues that includes hormones that includes enzymes uh blood proteins everything together it's about average estimate about 300 grams as most of uh the listeners will will will will will consider is that they are consuming about say 70 to up to 100 grams of protein per day that means that going off for for 70 grams for one gram a day for 70 kilogram weighing man that would be you're recycling 230 grams and this is something that people don't realize so yes we consume foods and we need those building blocks but you're also con con constantly using amino acids that are that are being released from the breakdown of tissues and then you use them again so you're making 300 gram you're only ingesting 70 grams so that means I'm a 20 on a on a on a 24-hour basis you're recycling 230 grams of amino acids from your own body so you're very sustainable so what is it that um let let's talk a little bit about kind of the the use case for it right so um 300

[00:40:25] G being utilized per day let's talk about how that differs in an active person um a you know a person who strength training a person who's doing uh you know steady state cardio training a person who's not training uh let's just use those three examples so I would um I don't think anybody would have data on that because this is on a whole body level so uh organs tissues the guts everything and I think if we're asking these questions we have to we have to just move back to a muscle Centric uh perspective but for example do we actually you know what actually look there's a question I want to ask before all of this which is a technical question that explains to people the methods that you use to actually do these types of measurements so um you already talked a little bit about one isotope method with respect to carbohydrate metabolism can can you expect explain the technical tools that permit this type of study for amino acids yeah so um I'll keep it very simple you have um stable isotopes so everybody knows from high school or most of you will know from high school that in chemistry you have carbon 12 or carbon is is is a weight of 12 but there's in nature there's also carbon 30 and carbon 30 means it has an extra neutrient in its core it's stable doesn't fall apart you also have 14 carbon that's unstable falls apart and you're at radioactivity and that's why it's a radioactive isotope now you can actually purchase carbon 13 labeled metabolites and so you can also buy carbon 13 C carbon 13 labeled filine for example nowadays we often use filine as the Tracer because it's a it's a it's an essential amino acid that is hardly metabolized um in uh tissue in in muscle or not metabolized in muscle and it's not as volatile as for example Lucine and Lucine of course has a lot of other effects so you want to have a nice St amino acid that is a good representation of other essential amino acids so if you actually buy 13 C labeled vanilline you can dilute it in a in a in a in a bag of saline Infuse it in the body and then you actually have like 5% of all your

[00:42:45] Fila alanine floating around in your circulation and then you take a muscle biopsy then you take the muscle out of the biopsy you take the protein out of the biopsy you can even SE separate mitochondial protein or myi protein so that's eosine for example and then hydroly that protein back to its fre amino acids and I use Mass spectrometry to look at how many of those amino acids in the muscle protein are coming from the carbon 13 C lab labeled vanilla now a few hours later you take a new biopsy and you see how much more of that 13 C

[00:43:22] Filan is built into the muscle protein if you divide that by the availability in the circulation and the time between the two biopsies you have a fractional synthetic rate generally expressed in percent per hour now on a daily basis that's about 1 to 2% per day so it's always confusing to well confusing it's it's it's always magic to me that means if you take if all the proteins in your muscle are generic which they aren't of course but assume an average then they are actually completely refurbished in 50 to 100 days so I always ask people to look at their own arm and realize that in 50 to 100 days they have a new arm it's completely ref so the individual proteins in the muscle are broken down and buildt up again and we can measure that by infusing those labeled amino acids and simply measuring their synthesis rates first of all that is an absolutely amazing idea that is of course self-evident based on the nature of what we know about protein turnover but when phrased that way is simply remarkable right in other words we don't take it as so Earth shattering that every 3 months our entire hematopoetic system turns over right I mean we know this we know that every 90 days a red blood cell is gone and it's replaced with a new one effectively the the entire red blood cell architecture in my body today is completely new from what it was three months ago but when you talk about it through the lens of muscle it's much more complicated I mean it's just much more difficult to wrap your mind around um obviously one of the questions is but I don't notice any difference like what preserves the architecture this gets to what is being replaced and what is technically not being replaced how does the shape change so that we don't look different so that we're not a constantly morph creature yeah so you have more questions than than I can ever answer but that is also and we'll come back to that later I hope um so we started also measuring turnover rate of tissues other than muscle and then it gets even more freaky uh and then you start really thinking like how is this regulated how so let's not do that because it will be confusing but we've also measured protein turnover in the brain in the human brain and then if you see those turnover rates then you have different questions but let's not go there let's stay stick for the muscle for now um so it means that in order to keep the muscle and maintain muscle mass you need to stimulate it because the breakdown will continue and so in order to maintain your muscle as it is you actually have anabolic stimuli that stimulate the synthesis and then we come back to nutrition and exercise because it's food intake and particular Ally of course protein intake and exercise that stimulate muscle protein synthesis um how these two stimuli know which proteins to build and in what structure oh man that is that is just just an enigma um the fact that the I always show a picture of Lance Armstrong and um

[00:46:48] I don't know who am I showing as bodybuilder um actually that changes every so many years one of the Mr universes um and so I showed them that they these two guys have huge protein synthesis after an exercise session but the phenotypic response is completely different and so with resistance type exercise you build a lot of myi protein while the endurance atlete will build a lot of mitochondrial proteins so how the body Knows by The recruitment of your fibers which proteins should be synthesized I mean we know a lot of molecular Pathways of course but how it's directly regulated I mean that is still I mean first we had we thought we had everything by measuring mrnas then we thought we had everything by measuring westom blots uh protein content and then protein phosphorilation and then we went to transcriptomics and then we we suddenly knew that we had po transational modification and then we had Mr splicing so it's it's getting complexer complexer complexer complexer let's use that example right so we'll put up you know a a a worldclass endurance athlete against a worldclass bodybuilder and let's even simplify the equation and take drugs out of it so let's even suggest let's talk about not the best bodybuilder because obviously there they are using high amounts of anabolic steroids but you know a worldclass natural bodybuilder who still by any metric is enormous U and a worldclass uh endurance athlete um the question of course is how does the body know in the case of the bodybuilder to to build myofibril protein and meaning to disproportionately build that whereas in the endurance athlete You're disproportionately Building mitochondrial protein now the obvious answer to me seems to be the training stimulus right that that the bodybuilder is pushing enormous amounts of weight repeatedly you know within the confines of certain reps and certain sets and the endurance athlete is never ever stressing the muscle at a single rep you know if you think about it an endurance cyclist might be 80 to 100 80 to 100

[00:48:55] Cadence you know and they'll do that you they'll do hundreds of thousands of those repetitions but none of them are as hard as the Reps that the bodybuilder is doing for you know six to 12 reps um so so that's an obvious difference is the question that we don't understand how that is translating a signal into the

[00:49:18] MPS yes I mean we don't know and if I would actually POS this question to a a second or third year student they would actually just move away from the the real answer by going towards saying like hey it's different fibers and of course that's part of the the answer because a resistance type atlet will more likely recruit the type two fibers the type two fibers are more likely to build in Mass if we see people doing resistance training it's mainly the type two fibers that get bigger you see that with the bodybuilders as well huge type two fibers the opposite happens when we get older you get smaller type two fibers actually and that is where most of the muscle loss with age actually comes from while the endurance atlet we don't see much happening with the size of the fibers we just see um a greater capillary density we see more mitochondria higher density of mitochondria Sub sub subcy mitochondria so the Adaptive response is completely different and part of it is because of which fibers you recruit but it's not the complete answer because if you do for example and and you you probably noticed the discussion about High Reps low reps high low weight High weight there's now very nice studies that show if you do High Reps with a low weight if you do the to to exhaustion you also start using the type two fibers that's right and then you also get hypertrophy and that's a nice way especially in

[00:50:42] Rehabilitation that you can actually drive those type two fibers without putting too much effort on the uh just uh just operated the the hip or the the leg whatever just operated on so it's not the complete answer there's more going but what is exactly the signal um the molecular signal from the um the tension on the muscle towards the synthesis of the specific sets of proteins yeah there's a there there's enormous amounts of of Pathways involved and I'm not sure whether we'll ever completely know what is happening now and where that selection is going to be it's so interesting yeah I I mean it's just so fascinating that we can't understand the Cascade that goes from stimulus to muscle protein synthesis um would it be reasonable to assume um that the bodybuilder has more upregulation of mtor than the endurance athlete or is that even a stretch in terms of an assumption given that it's difficult to measure that I mean we know also now that a lot of the hypertrophy is actually EMP the stimulation muscle protein synthesis can be empor independent so there the there's so many parallel Pathways that are driving responses and like I said I mean if you for example if you ingest protein you stimulate uh empor signaling you stimulate M translation initiation um and you get greater protein synthesis but it actually stops or it actually is not continuously stimulated if you do not provide all the building blocks so if we for example after exercise or even at rest we provide people with the bran chain amino acid so mainly Lucine is driving that anabolic response it's the signaling response and you stimulate muscle protein synthesis and for up to two hours but if we give the same amount of Lucine or in this case Branch chain amino acids in a similar amount of milk protein so containing the same amount of branching amino acids plus all the other amino acids we see that that response is actually sustained over a more prolonged period of time so it's not only the stimulation it's the stimulation in combination with the right amount of building blocks at the right am am of time and how I always tell it to the students you have a uh I don't know a parking lot where you want to park as many cars as possible you can put the light on green to to to drive in but if there's no cars nothing's going to happen and so it's a combination of the right signaling responses plus the availability of your substrate I want to come back to this in detail because it's um it's it's very relevant it's also there was a recent study that came out that uh I believe you were an author on if I'm not mistaken uh but maybe maybe I am mistaken but the study looked at the uh duration of muscle protein synthesis following the digestion of different types of amino acids so we come to that but let's take a step back for a moment and make sure we at least cover the basics of how protein is even digested and I want to talk about um three types so one I want to talk about a whole meal so a meal of protein that often comes with fat so let's talk about eating a steak and I want to ask how that differs from uh two different types of milk-based proteins whey protein and casium so I want to understand what is actually happening from a digestive standpoint and how the thing that you actually consume and put in your mouth turns into building blocks that presumably are being absorbed somewhere in the ilium or gunum yep so I'll just First Take protein and then go to the specific protein sources or meals so protein is B basically ingested goes to your stomach a acid is added to it so you have the first basically um start of the digestion you actually can get clotting of your protein due to the acids we'll come to that later if if we compare Kine versus whey then it goes to the duodenum then you have all your enzymes being unloaded on your protein if they can get access to it you actually get the free amino acids a lot of people people have suggestions that also oligopeptides D and tripeptides so small proteins composed of a few amino acids there are Transporters in the gut that would allow them to actually enter the intestinal wall or the intestinal cells we think from a quantitative point of view it's it's hardly relevant but it's possible the amino acids are then part of them are actually incorporated into intestinal protein because the gut also has a very rapid protein much faster than muscle so part of it it actually remain in the intestinal tissues as protein some of it is released on the other side of the intestine in the portal vein the portal vein transports it to the liver the liver can do something with the amino acids if it wants to to make proteins but most of it is actually released in the circulation and there it can basically profund it to all those different tissues taken up and used for muscle protein synthesis we don't have a real storage Depo there's a small free amino acid pool if you compare it with the intact uh protein pool um they always say it's very small in muscle but acutely after a meal it can actually vary a lot so it's a buffer temporary buffer but we don't really have real storage sites for for amino acids so that's the whole pathway let's finish one thing there actually Luke because um that's an important point you raise which is unlike fat which can be stored in unlimited quantities and glucose which can initially be stored in glycogen although that's a relatively finite uh store and then eventually can be stored as fat uh through denovo lipogenesis what exactly happens to uh excess protein if we consume it um and let's just use an extreme example right like uh you know I I sit you down and and give you a 200 gram protein meal uh or make it whatever number you want such that the point is you clearly have excess amino acids once fully digested what do you do what does your body do with those yeah so first um the amino acids as we have no you said we have no storage like the glucose turns is stored as glycogen the fat fatty acids are stored as fat but the amino acids are stored as protein so but is it a real storage

[00:57:15] Depot now if you ask me and and yourself we hope we we're not losing muscle so we say we don't have a storage Depot but if we end up in a concentration camp then we actually quite happy that we have a storage Depo of amino acids in the form of muscle so it is a storage Depo but hope that we're not using it um so if we get excess protein we thought I mean in the literature A Lot say that everything that you can't immediately process is being oxidized now that study by y tra that you just referred to that we published a few weeks ago uh we showed that with 100 gram oxidation at least in the first 12 hours after ingestion is very overestimated but I mean over the long run if you keep continuing eating more protein in in a setting of over calories you simply store the the protein as fat what's the pathway that that happens because it's so funny when I think back to biochemistry classes more than 25 years ago what I vaguely remember was you could amino acids could undergo glucogenesis to become glucose and then either glycogen or fat is that is that what you're referring to yes okay and then it's different for all the for for different amino acids and of course it's a very in inefficient way so that is also one of the reasons why people tend to get uh less fat accumulation if they overeat in a form of protein besides the satiety effect right because there's a thermogenic and thermodynamic loss or use of energy just in the metabolism of protein that itself is obviously beneficial if your goal is to store less energy correct okay now I have to say something about the techniques that we use because we were interested I mean we've done protein synthesis measurements all the time but at some point exactly what you were were saying I wanted to know more about the digestion and and and the and the and the absorption prior to stimulating muscle protein synthesis and in order to understand that you need those stabil isotope tracers not only in an infusate but you would like to have those labeled amino acids in the food as protein now you can't purchase those so about 15 to 20 years ago we uh worked with II in France because they already made intrinsically labeled protein so what they did they infused a cow with those labeled amino acids and so the cow integrates those labeled amino acids in the milk and then you can actually use the milk in clinical experiments now we wanted to take it one step further because we wanted to have the the number of labeled amino acids in the milk so high which is very expensive to actually see the digestion and absorption but even the incorporation in the muscle so we spent more than 50,000

[01:00:14] EUR of Tracer and the first time that's pretty pretty uh pretty uh uh challenging because you actually put it in a cow you infuse it in the cow and you just hope you you're ever going to see that money back so we put labeled fil alanine in a cow the cow made milk we extracted the milk we got the protein powder and we used it in clinal experiments to assess digestion absorption uh release extraction over the leg and incorporation in the muscle now if you see this I mean we can now go into the quantitative measure because we actually did this to see the difference between gine and way we'll come to that later but simply that I bought races um Isotopes in the US they send it over I had it in a small jar on my desk then I went to barganing it to in or first in France actually and we've done it a few times since you actually Infuse it uh in a cow you actually get the milk you bring the milk to a factory to extract the milk protein about a year later that same fil alanine is now integrated in milk protein on my desk the same whole molecule that came from the US to my desk then from the US to

[01:01:32] France in a cow then from the cow's milk on my desk again then it went into an older subject in a in a study we took a muscle biopsy now year later I have a muscle biopsy on my desk that has that same full amino acids integrated in the muscle and I actually dissolve it bring it to the mass spec analysis and I have that same amino acid in my hand again that amino acid has been around for four years and went from a lab in the US through a cow through a cow's blood protein through the milk protein to my desk back into somebody else's like that's amazing and just give me a sense of yield when you made the casan or the whey protein from the cow's milk what fraction of the Fel phenyalanine was actually laed with the isotope we got 25% of the Tracer we found back in the milk wow and so you can imagine as a

[01:02:33] Dutch person I'm I'm supposed to be cheap so losing 75% of that money in a cow is not something that you can sleep sleep on so we butchered the cow and how much how how much of the fenel alanine did you find in the meat of the cow then exactly so uh so this was really funny because we actually butcher the cow so we got I mean of course it gets difficult because you have to multiply it by total amount of meat and if you butcher a cow you don't get all the meat of course you don't get all the organs but we sampled all the organs and that was a starting point for us to start measuring turnover of other organs in humans but what was interesting is that different muscles had different enrichment but it was all ballparked the same we never calculated whether we actually come came back to 75% but it must have be very close but we use that meat and that come back to to your other question to see whether there's a difference in the digestion and absorption when you ingest meat as a steak or if that same steak was first put in a meat grinder and you had basically minced meat huge difference same more and and then you actually get with minced meat you get more rapid digestion and absorption which should also expedite uh your muscle protein synthesis because the more rapid absorption the greater and faster the release of Lucine the greater the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis now that was a fun study for us to do and when you were writing it down I was trying to find in the literature some suggestion that uh the um minced meat versus steak that actually there was some data to suggest that it improves uh accelerates digestion and absorption potentially improves anabolic responses we came up of a study that was done in the 60s that showed that this was epidemiology and has its limitations that people that have their older people that still have their own teeth generally also have their muscle still intact so that was a nice link to say that your mom has been right on a lot of things because I mean I spent probably like 30 million euros of research money in the last 30 years to basically prove to provide clinical proof that my mom was right on a lot of things meaning when she said chew your food chew your food but even something as simple as sitting upright huge effect on that digestion and absorption so um all of these things come back so chewing is a factor that drives the anabolic response to feeding and so it's really funny then if you go to mixed meals what you just said if there's micronutrients coming together uh a lot of energy will actually um um um reduce gastric empty or slow down gastric emptying so uh that is one factor but the Matrix of food the chewing of the food all of these whether you cook it or not even that is an important one we'll come to that later as well I mean there's so many topics here we did a study with eating eggs that were raw or cooked huge effect on digestion and absorption I actually tried to have Sylvester loone on that paper but he never responded unfortunately you know rocky rocky is yeah rocky rocky prot rocky right he basically said was Rocky right or wrong because when the first movie we actually use part of his his his script um he's ingesting those those raw eggs wouldn't it not be better to actually cook those eggs because you have more rapid digestion and absorption and so I I think of how many raw eggs I consumed as a child because I watched Rocky it's it's insane how I didn't get salmonella it's a miracle but uh but anyway so it was um okay so let let's go back to the example of the steak versus the ground beef so uh ISO quantities so 50 50 g of protein in a steak that obviously will have some fat with it and 50 in fact let's make them not just isocaloric and isoprotein but everything about them is the same so same amount of fat same amount of whatever one is ground one is not talk me through the kinetics of those two in in an individual yeah so I think the most important factor is of course that all the enzymes that are being released in the duodenum and also part of it also the gastric emptying of course is accelerated with your minced meef with your ground beef so you have more rapid gastric emptying the acid has already had more um um space to actually have its effect faster uh gastric emptying then it gets into the duodenum you don't have those big chunks of meat but you actually have those enzymes that can actually attach everywhere much easier so you get rapid more rapid digestion and absorption it's a little bit similar to for example Kine and way um everybody knows now everybody I mean all the atlet that that that say we need whey protein um but that's because my celline the other 80% in milk 20% whey 80% cine that was actually the first study that's actually the study why we did the intrinsically labeled protein we got the milk processed the milk down to myel casine and down to whey because for all those years especially the companies was telling me that a d pre-digested protein like a hydrolyzed protein is more rapidly digested and absorbed and I said where's the proof and they said like yes this initro essay shows I said initro essay doesn't mean anything to me because those F fetro essays you have all these tubes and glass things and and then they screen for digestion and absorption but to me uh the human inv

[01:08:21] Vio system is much more complex because all those tubes and glass are actually alive in a human so I want to assess this in in a human in fivo setting and then they asked me like how would you want to do it and then I said like yeah I would Infuse a cow and this and that and then they they looked at me like I was completely crazy took me seven years until they funded it and then we got the milk processed meline and wayy and we also got the myeline and we pre-digested it with enzymes so so you get a a cine hydrolysate now we've all checked them for digestion and absorption and then you see that the hydrolyzed collagen uh sorry hydrolyzed cine and also the the whey protein are much more rapidly digested and absorbed than the meline because the meline in the acidity of the gut starts coagulating and you have these like like like spoiled milk or something like that and so the gastric is is is probably reduced or slowed down but also the capacity of the enzymes to to basically start digesting the food and so that's how we now know that um rapidly digestible protein U is more e or more likely to stimulate muscle protein synthesis to a greater extent so there's two characteristics of a protein that is the digestion of it and the rate of digestion but then you would expect that the pre digested gine would do exactly the same as a whey protein but it doesn't they're just as rapidly digested and absorbed but whey protein still has a greater anabolic response and of course that might have something to do with the amino acid composition and we know that whey protein has a higher Lucine content and so if we add for example free Lucine to cine we get a greater anabolic response so obviously the amount of Lucine is an important factor so in a nutshell two characteristics of a protein and their capacity to stimulate muscle protein synthesis is digestability the rate of digestion and the amino acid composition with particularly the amount of Lucine in the protein and anything that slows down the gastric emptying or the release of

[01:10:44] Lucine in circulation will likely also slow down the anabolic response so let's unpack that a bit because there's a lot there um we're kind of collap Ing digestibility and rate of digestion into one feature although can't they be disentangled a little bit because the example of the whole meat versus the minced meat presumably they have similar digestibility they have just as much senu they have just as much fat but one has been effectively broken down and it would have a higher rate of digestability correct no I think we've uh we've actually cooked meat the digestability is the same it will take a little bit longer for the uh for the steak than for the sorry I mean the rate of digestion wouldn't that be quicker yes yeah yes yes yes exactly okay and um so I mean if you're ever in for sabatical and you want to do a few years of research and mrict please come over because these are all the same questions that I had and there's so many more um we we I mean we as nutrition scientists we love to work with a single ingredient because otherwise we don't know what is going on so most of the work that we've done in the past is actually comparing protein x with protein Y and then with protein I mean Protein Isolate or protein concentrate so protein powers and that's why a lot of people in the public media just of course read or like to see our our studies because it's about the powders they eat but of course normal people don't eat protein powders protein isolates or concentrates we eat

[01:12:25] Foods now if you go back to the literature and looking at how many Studies have assessed the anabolic response to eating foods that is very slim yeah and because I mean nobody's interested in Foods I mean it's often like is protein X versus this because if you start having meals where everything comes together plant-based proteins animal based proteins the processing of the protein whether it's heated or not heated whether it's cut cut fine minced not minced doing well not whether it's combined how much on the plate how many fibers all of these things together actually uh determine the anabolic response to feeding and then the digestability becomes most important I think 99% of our studies the digestibility is not an issue because we use extracted proteins also when we go to plant-based proteins and that's I guess also a topic that you want to discuss most of the plant-based proteins that we have assessed are plant-based proteins and I prefer to call them plant derived proteins that have been extracted from the Whole Foods and then the digestability is it's often still little less than than animal derived proteins but it's not a major issue anymore it's a ma major issue if it comes in the form of

[01:13:44] Whole Foods all right let's let's go through this in some detail because this is super fascinating but before we do I want to really ask the question of how much does it clinically matter the rate at which muscle protein synthesis is stimuli because what I'm hearing so far um and I want to try to summarize this for both myself and The

[01:14:09] Listener is that you really have three factors that are going to determine the rate at which muscle protein synthesis takes place you have the digestibility of the thing that you are ingesting and this could be the difference between a plant- derived protein and an animal derived protein this could be the difference between um a cooked protein versus a not cooked protein and this could be the difference between two different types of proteins period you then have the rate at which this protein is digested um and and obviously that's you can picture a curve with the x-axis being time and the y- AIS being digestion the rate of digestion will speak to the the shape of that curve and again I think there are probably many things that impact that but the obvious examples you've given here would be how the food is cut and it could be you know ground beef versus whole beef how well the person chews all of those things impact the rate and then the third factor is the composition of the amino acids itself you've alluded to Lucine many times uh we talk a lot about Lucine on this podcast because of course it is the number one and the most potent mtor stimulator but obviously there are other proteins as well lysine methionine these are probably more pro-anabolic and therefore the the concentration of distribution of amino acids plays a role now let's go back to the macro question which is a person is looking to maximize optimize maintain increase lean body mass this should be a goal of everybody right it doesn't matter if you're a 75-year-old woman or a 25-year-old man the maintenance of lean body mass if not the increase in lean body mass is a very important pillar of living a long healthy life so if that is true then presumably anything we can do nutritionally we'll talk about training later but anything we can do nutritionally to maximize or increase muscle protein synthesis should be good but the one thing that we're missing is the window over which that happens so is the goal always to maximize that for the highest peak independent of the base or do we want more of a Time relased effect where we say look we'll take a lower rate or a lower Peak muscle protein synthesis but I'd like to sustain that for many many hours um so you're laughing so I've touched a nerve which means I'm probably asking a question you you asking but I'll I'll let you go from there no this this is awesome I mean these are all the questions that that the field has and that we all have so because it becomes much more uh difficult because one factor we didn't discuss is the amount of protein because the amount of protein also has an effect of course on the curve and you can compensate uh with with with the amount so getting back to we'll probably come back to that as well but so if you um yeah there estimations up to two to three grams of Lucine in a meal will actually induce a rapid increase in circulating Lucine and that will stimulate muscle protein synthesis and if you have enough building blocks available you have an anabolic response for at least up to five hours so this has led most of us in the field to believe that it's best to ingest at least now we're talking about healthy people if you become older you become less res resistant to the anabolic properties of amino acids anabolic resistance it's probably also something that we come back to later but if you're a healthy active male or a female you 20 grams of protein is assumed to be the optimal amount to maximize muscle protein synthesis for up to four to five hours after a meal and this is the reason why in so many packages you now see 20 grams every way see 20 gram now that comes from studies showing that 40 grams of protein ingestion of 40 g of protein does not result in Greater muscle protein synthesis rates than 20 gram of protein so it's assumed that 20 gram is the optimal amount in healthy people and of course we always have these discussions if you're 120 kilogram you probably need more if you're 50 kilogram you probably need less yes but you can't do a study with every individual in the in the world but so 20 grams now if you assume that you would have an anabolic response to each main meal then the advice is there to ingest 20 gam of protein with each main meal now if you're becoming older there's suggestions you need more to compensate for that but let's stick now with healthy people that's 20 2020 um possibly also an evening uh protein snack 20 and then you already have 80 grams of protein which for most people is already more than 1 to 1.1 gram of protein per day now we are people that believe that you actually could use more protein which automatically happens when you become active because when you become active you eat more and then you easily eat more than than 1.1 so it's a non-discussion but so the idea is distribution of protein that every meal is an anabolic response just one question before you go further this 20 grams is the maximum amount of protein you need to get maximum protein synthesis muscle protein synthesis was based on what type of protein that was based on milk and egg so there was a study on milk and there was a study on an egg okay so it's Whole

[01:19:58] Food it's not using just whey or just casan no it's not Whole Foods this is in protein concentrate so egg protein concentrate and not protein concentrate so that's a very important point because as I said if your digestibility is not 100% which in a meal is never of course and you have a delay in digestion and absorption then 20 grams could be suggested to be a minimum yeah so in other words what I'm hearing here is for people like me who don't really like shakes that much I prefer to eat food as opposed to drink shakes I do drink them because sometimes it's convenient um but if you're going to try to get this through food you're by definition you're going to be working with an inferior protein from the standpoint of speed in terms of digestibility and rate of digestion so you might need a protein meal that's 30 gr or more and then if you're you know 90 kilos uh you're probably on the bigger end of that anyway it might be 40 grams that you need per meal of real food is that kind of how you would think about that yes and so automatically also get to that because we always have those discussions of course because if I say that you need you need more protein you ingest more protein then they look at me like I'm advocating a high protein diet but these discussions are of course always a little bit weird if you have a 65 kilogram weighing to the France cyclist and he only consumes a very little amount of protein in the form of only 10% of his energy intake he's still ingesting probably more than two and a half grams of protein per in body mass per day even though he absolutely doesn't need it for his limited amount of muscle so uh the more active you become and the more healthy you are the more protein you consume we always have

[01:21:41] I mean World Health Organization says 08 grams per kilogram body mass per day but yes maybe you can survive on that that's fine but it's certainly in my beliefs not optimal but even whether it's optimal or not it's not it's a non disccussion every healthy relatively sedent person I mean if I I mean whether it's here or in England or the US people consume about healthy people and nothing nothing strange and not complete recreational atlet already consume 1.1 to 1 Point yeah between 1.1 and 1.3 grams of protein per Kil m m per day and they're not even trying to consume more protein yeah I mean we're we're we're typically pushing our patients to much higher than that like we're we we're asking patients to be be closer to 1.6 uh GRS per uh per per kilo pardon me grams yeah grams per kilo per day and truthfully if they're re if we're really trying to put muscle on people and their training volume is high we're closer to two grams per kilo it's great if you can reach that I mean um here in the hospital I mean we're doing a lot because I do a lot of clinical work so um we evaluated protein intake in the elective hip and knee surgery patients so the older population but these are not sick they're coming in for new knee or new hip so this is a new generation of patients that we get of course because in the past that was associated with a lot of P pain but these are patients that want to go go skiing with the grandchildren again so they want a new hip or new knee so they come in they're very healthy but in the four days that they're in the hospital so the advice to go back to the advice Aspen guidelines for example between 1.2 and 1.5 grams of protein perum body mass per day that's the clinical advice for recovering patients you know what they actually so in in our hospital so what they actually get what they're being delivered is 08 grams and how much lean mass how much lean mass do they lose in four days of inactivity now we come we'll come back to that so they get 0 eight and you would say like oh give them more they consume 0.5 so they only consume so the healthy patients in the hospital here the healthy patients go for elective surgery in those four days they consume 0.5 grams which is oneir of the uh clinical guidelines for the advised amount and they they lose about 1.4

[01:24:11] Kilograms wow so they'll lose more than three pounds of lean mass in four days um and I've I've talked about this extensively on the podcast about the a symmetry in how quickly you lose versus how long it takes to get back um and of course we talk about this a lot in the context of Falls that result in fractures because here it's an even more vulnerable population for many reasons first unlike the elective hip replacement in the elective knee replacement uh whose patients are generally very healthy and you know able to get back to PT quite quickly especially in the hips uh the people who are falling and fracturing femur and neck uh neck of femur hip um they're typically not as healthy and they're much longer to get back to recovery and they're potentially uh bedridden for much longer periods of time and often times they never make it back to the level of muscle mass strength and function prior to infect I'm not sure if you're aware of this statistic you you probably are but Adam Cohen on this podcast mentioned that you know we talk a lot about the 15 to 30% of people over 65 who will die within a year of a hip fracture what we don't talk a lot about is the 50 of the people who don't die call it the 70 to 85% who don't die within a year 50% of them never regain their same function preall in many ways I find that statistic even more uh profound I was giving lectures for a group of uh older older people general public here and I basically mentioned those numbers not thinking about uh basically what I was saying so half the audience turned white when I said that because of course a lot of people that actually broke their hip um but we took biopsies from patients coming in with a hip fracture after falling and we compared that muscle with aged matched people that didn't have a hip fracture didn't have a fall and we compared it with young women in these you know most most women are the ones with the hip fractures because the men have already passed away uh but you actually saw that the type the size of the type two fibers was tremendously smaller in the women with the hip fracture than the ones that didn't have the hip fracture even though we matched for almost everything lifestyle and everything although that's a what's very interesting there is the causality could be in Reverse I think you could also make a very compelling case that having smaller type two fibers which means having less power having less Force generating capacity um would make you more susceptible to a fall in fact I wouldn't be surprised if there's a bidirectional Association uh so lower type 2 muscle fiber size and density much more predisposition to a fall once you are inactive you now experience even greater atrophy which as you pointed out earlier atrophy of the type to a muscle fiber is I would argue it's should be described as one of the Hallmarks of

[01:27:13] Aging right up there with you know decreased mitochondrial functioning increase Cent cells all of the things we typically think of with aging we should really be adding atropy atrophy of type 2 fibers and that's why maintaining muscle or maintaining there is more than than maintaining muscle it's also especially maintaining the type two fiber sici because what we now often see with patients getting back and especially now with covid we are sending people home much more fast because we don't want them to get a bacteria or anything like and we don't want them to attract covid so we send them home earlier now what happens when a lot of older people go home even if it's not a hip fracture but itive KNE or hip surgery the I mean everybody means well so children grandchildren will ask the first thing that they will do while you're in the hospital they'll put your bed down down downstairs into the living room so those people will never walk stairs again first of all they're afraid of walking stairs they won't walk stairs again anymore because everything is put down so they never recruit their type two fibers anymore they might go for walks but you don't recruit those type two fibers so you need to stand up from the toilet several times in in a row you need to do or if possible resistance training you need to have have somebody do resistance training with you or walking stairs you need to recruit those type two fibers because otherwise it just goes down and I mean there's very nice I mean we now believe that age related muscle loss is not I mean it's a demographic but it's not a physiological process of a slow decline in muscle we now believe it's short successive periods of reduced physical activity that are actually experienced after which they don't fully regain their muscle and that adds up in the two last two decades of life and that seems to be contributing to the muscle loss that we see in those demographics let's talk about that again because I I think that is such an important point that I want to make sure not a single person listening to us missed that point let me restate it and I want you to clarify we have long looked at data these are all sorts of data these are anthropometric data these are functional data where we put activity monitors on people and there is an unambiguous and clear decline in spontaneous activity deliberate activity and lean mass in the

[01:29:47] Aging individual and the decline starts somewhat slowly and by about the seventh decade starts to accelerate by the seventh decade uh Pardon Me by the 8th decade when a person is in their 70s the decline is so rapid that it appears almost irreversible we would typically talk about this as an inevitability of Aging hey that's just the physiology of what happens to the muscle but a minute ago you said something entirely different which suggests that it is not inevitable and that it is not a continuous slope of decline that reflects some physiologic process within the atrophying muscle but instead it's a series of discret declines each one precipitated by a period of inactivity some of them perhaps deliberate meaning hey you know

[01:30:50] I'm going on vacation for a week and I'm just going to sit on the beach and do nothing and some of them forced Upon Us by injury or illness um first of all did I get it right is that what you basically said yes and I think everybody has that observation think of uh parents or grandparents that you saw uh in the last say 10 years before they died everybody will say it started with that um um urra infection yeah it started with that surgery on on the hip and then you actually have all these little episodes and then you saw that happening and that's exactly what is happening but this of course muscle Centric so I'm talking about muscle loss of course if we're talking about cardiovascular disease and progression that's a different story yeah but for the the muscle loss is not something we don't believe anymore that it's in an individual there's not a gradual loss over time because in the individual level it can be completely different the demographic show this because as we there are more people in that situation where they have Su short successive periods of reduced physical activity and I think one of the first per people to actually publish this was

[01:32:05] Douglas pen Jones who unfortunately passed away himself at a way too young age but he called that the catabolic crisis model what I find interesting about that is you mentioned that maybe this doesn't apply to a decline in cardiorespiratory Fitness or cardiovascular function all these other things maybe but I would argue that a muscle Centric view could potentially be the most important view because when your movement stops everything else deteriorates with it so you know people say well you know what would that have to do with heart health or brain health I would argue it has everything to do with heart health or brain health when a person becomes sedentary everything deteriorates in its wake of course of course your cardiovascular system will deteriorate at an accelerated rate of course we know unequivocally your brain will erode at an accelerated rate when you become inactive and of course we know that the quality of your life your happiness your well-being will deteriorate as you become inactive and so you could make a very compelling case I believe that a muscle Centric view might be the most important View

[01:33:24] I I agree and it's it's like sometimes it's like talking to a mirror when you respond so uh we've done bad rest studies in healthy people because we often use healthy young people as a model to see what what inactivity does and besides that 1.4 Kilograms of muscle that we see disappear in a week or if we immobilize a lag almost 220 grams of muscle that is lost in a week we also see a massive decline in oxidative capacity we see a decline in insulin sensitivity um so all of these markers that we have for cardiovascular moabe health go go down in a single week of inactivity so it's completely right but of course in one person it might be the cardiovascular decline that is driving the muscle loss while in the other person it's the muscle loss that's driving the cardiovasc decline well I

[01:34:16] I'll make another Shameless plug for an idea that we talk about a lot on this podcast which is this this idea of the centinary and de cathlon this idea a that um the best way to avoid this fate uh when you're in your middle age when you're young whenever is to be very deliberate and specific about the type of training and of course nutrition that is necessary to have the most physically robust final decade of Life what we call the marginal decade and so if you train with great specificity to be very active and very independent and free of pain and all of those things in the last decade of your life um by definition you're going to be doing a lot of varied forms of exercise and you're going to have to be supporting that nutritionally to get there I want to go back to kind of one last housekeeping issue on the on the protein side which was uh the difference between whey and casan protein in identical amounts relative to the parameters you've spoken about digestibility speed of digestion and Amo acid composition what are the differences and where do you see the use cases clinically between them so the digestability is the same it's it's 100% so there's no differences there but if you ingest uh Kine versus and that's myell casine versus whey protein the casine is much sorry the whey protein is much more rapidly digested and absorbed you see a greater spike in your uh free essential amino acid concentrations in your blood including Lucine and you get a greater stimulation of muscle protein synthesis as a result however the longer you measure the more the casine catches up on the way that's also something that you have to realize yeah tell us about that study that you that just came out a few weeks ago which seemed to challenge a lot of the conventional thinking around the amount of usable substrate that one could ingest so traditional thinking had been boy it's awfully hard to use more than 40 to 50 grams of protein in a meal for muscle protein synthesis and if I recall you had three groups in this study a group that was given zero protein 25 grams of protein and 100 grams of protein was that that was all casan correct that was milk protein concentrates it was a milk concentrate so that means equal parts casan and wey or what what was the breakdown yeah 8020 8020 in favor of which Kine is always 80 and we is 20 in milk okay so if you have milk about 80% is Casi and 20% is way got it and then tell us what you saw in that study over a long enough period of time so this was a study where we uh use that intrinsically labeled protein combined with intervenous infusions of amino acids and that allows us not only to measure muscle protein synthesis but also how much protein is actually released in the circulation from what you ingest and so we could make a full quantitative assessment of what is happening now previously like I said uh most of our studies people like to work on office hours so you have two hours of a runin period uh maybe an hour of an intervention and then four to six hours of postprandial so after a meal measuring of muscle protein synthesis so that's those are long days so most of the studies so far show that 20 grams of protein does not do better than 40 grams of protein to stimulate protein synthesis for up to 4 to 6 hours because that's typically what we do why do we always measure a four to six hours that's all the all the labs doing this kind of work is because that's the time between two meals so that makes sense so the 40 grams always in if you see the studies and a lot of other labs we it tends to to look more than the 20 looks like a greater response than the 20 G but it's not significantly different and what we saw with the intrinsic label Pro that a lot of that protein is not digested yet or at least not released in circulation and the longer you measure the more of that protein still is still coming in same with what I said the casine is catching up on the way because a lot of the casine is not absorbed yet so what Yan wanted to do and this was crazy because he wanted to ingest 100 grams of protein to be honest he's so crazy he actually wanted to have more treatments and I said it's not going to happen because that's way too expensive and this was already very expensive so we did a zero 25 is what is being advised give or take and then the 100 gram as an absolutely unpractical amount and so we actually measured um if

[01:39:02] I'm correct at 48 and 12 hours after the ingestion and so what you saw is that if you measure for an extended period of time that 100 gram is still increasing muscle protein synthesis for a longer period of time resulting in a greater response over time so the suggestion that you can't get a rate of response with more protein is biased it's biased because you don't measure long enough now the problem is this is a study that everybody at least in my field needed to see so to to better understand what is happening but it doesn't necessarily translates and of course that's the problem now with with papers people start calling me like interview this interview that like should I eat one meal a day no that's not what we're saying I still think that it's good to have a distribution of protein throughout the day that every meal has an anabolic response but it doesn't mean if you have small meals that you're going to disappear in three weeks so the body adapts and if the body has a huge meal it's still being hug used makes sense because if you have it we also wrote that in a discussion if you have a snake or a crocodile that once in so many days devours uh a goat or chicken or whatever then it can actually see that that animal actually stuck in the gut for for weeks and and he's actually consuming it now to some extent humans can also do that so it just shows you that response there's no limitation in the response and it can actually D range longer than what is previously expected do you think if you did that experiment but instead of using um a milk concentrate which was majority casan you used a pure way isolate do you believe that you would have still seen muscle protein synthesis at the 12h hour mark or do you think that the rapid digestibility of whey would have changed the kinetics significantly and you would have been largely done at the four to six hour mark yeah good good question but I think that um the differences I think the difference between the 25 and the 100 grams might have been smaller but it would still be evident because then the duration of the extension is is smaller of course with the way than with my cell casine but the compar with milk is very small because I mean milk still is very rapid I mean it's always funny that people say like this is slow or this is this is this is fast I mean it's all relative it's all relative it's all very fast it's all concentrated proteins yeah if you compare it with full meals you get a completely different picture and that's what Philip Philip pinkart in our group did he compared the real meal a vegan meal versus a typical Dutch you're not even allow no whe I still allowed to say that typical meal was actually in Holland vegetables potatoes and a piece of meat now we made those two plates having exactly the same energy and exactly the same amount of protein but now we also have that digestability factor in there because we weren't using powders in a drink we actually have a full meal a plate with all vegan Whole

[01:42:18] Foods and a plate with a piece of meat and and potatoes and and and some and was the vegan plate was it cooked protein or was it raw yes was cooked protein okay and but it has more a little bit more fiber y the plate is also a little bit bigger because the the the pro the the energy density is of course smaller and then everything comes together also with the digestability and then you actually saw no measurable anabolic response with the vegan meal and you saw a massive anabolic response muscle protein synthetic response with the um omnivorous meal and that shows you that I mean and that doesn't mean before everybody just stack us again that I say that you could shouldn't be eaten vegan but the point is that an omnivores meal with animal derived proteins has a greater response when you compare it in amount the same amount matter the same amount of protein so quality counts let's go back to what you talked about with respect to yeah we we completely talk about the relative speed between way and casan but let's put those in the context of a meal so how does what does the kinetics curve for aaan shake look like compared to ground beef or whole steak is it significantly faster no that's that's that's similar cooked beef is is is I mean it's still very fast so if you have cooked uh cooked uh meat or um concentrated

[01:43:48] Protein Isolate from an animal Source it's all very rapidly digested and absorbed with Peak amino acid levels I think between 30 and say 75 uh minutes if you have a a full meal with potatoes veggies fibers and in it it will take two to three hours longer got it um from a very selfish standpoint I want to ask you a question so I always do my strength training in the morning and um many days I just don't I

[01:44:22] I'm they not that hungry or I kind of run out of time before I need to jump into stuff and I'm not always diligent about eating or consuming protein right after that workout um now truthfully in part it's cuz well I want to ask you this question let's just assume two scenarios scenario one is finish exercising finish strength training consume nothing but water coffee for another 3 or 4 hours before consuming a high prot protein meal versus finish exercising and immediately consume 25 G of whey protein in a shake with nothing else in it just weigh protein in water you know you're getting 100 calories chug it down and then eat that you know protein Rich meal of 40 grams 4 hours later significant difference in muscle protein synthesis between these two over the course of days um or does it all come out in the wash where assuming you get ISO amounts of protein throughout the day does it matter um on 24 hours definitely uh there's a difference uh so um for example if you ingest protein immediately after exercise you get at least for the first five hours you definitely have a much greater response because exercise makes the muscle more sensitive to the anabolic response to food intake however what people forget is that your response to breakfast the next day is still increased and probably also Al your lunch and dinner the next day so if you do an exercise session today and you get all freaked out that you didn't get a milkshake after your after your session don't worry because the next day all your three meals are going to be greater responses because of the exercise so I get so many times the question like how important is the meal before or after the exercise and I say if you do an cons consistent training then there's always three meals before your session and after after your session because you train every day so then every meal is still responding to the previous exercise session now is there a benefit of immediately after exercise versus a few hours later we've done that study by so not sure whether we touch that that topic as well pre-sleep protein feeding that's a topic that we've been working a lot on also on patients so we gave people I think it was even 60 gr really proof principle study exercise in the evening and then 40 or 60 I don't remember um we gave protein then and then we measured the response the next morning after breakfast after 20 grams of protein in the morning so what I was thinking like if there is a window of opportunity then if you give 60 grams of protein immediately after exercise maybe you shorten the window of opportunity so if you already provided the exercise after after the session you don't respond as well to the the next dinner the next morning does that make sense yeah what

[01:47:21] I'm basically hearing you say is if you have a hundred units of response in you the timing of your meal might not impact the total amount of response it just determines when that response occurs so if you if I slug that 25 grams of whey protein as I'm walking out of the gym I will get more of my 100 units of response then but I will get less of it four or five hours later when I have a big protein lunch I think that's a much clearer explanation that that so that was basically the design of the study and it fits with what I've learned of course for glycogen because you ingest carbohydrates immediately after exercise so you expedite you accelerate glycogen resynthesis but if you don't have to exercise until two days later it doesn't make a difference because then you have a full 100% recovery of your glycogen which again is very different from the way I grew up right I mean when I grew up as an endurance athlete we were and again you know it could all be wives tales but the traditional thinking was you need to be mainlining carbohydrates the second you get off the bike or out of the water or whatever because you have this very small glycogen window where for an hour you're going to maximally assimilate and it might be the case that well that's true your maximum assimilation would occur in that window but you will still uh you will still incorporate carbohydrate into glycogen later it just might not occur at as higher rate is that kind of the same situation if you're exercising every Saturday it doesn't make a difference Luis Burke has clearly shown within 24 hours you Glen are back to normal if you are in the

[01:48:59] Tour of France and you have to uh Excel every day you're going to miss uh the second the third day of the tour if you don't start uh taking in carbohydrates after possession yeah now going back to um so that study protein ingestion after an exercise session before them in the evening does that impact your response the morning and so the other trial was no protein after the exercise and doing the same thing in the morning I thought that the response to breakfast would be reduced if you already ingested that 60 grams of protein in the evening it didn't H the responses were exactly the same to my surprise so the responses to breakfast exactly the same so net I must say that the people ingested the 60 G prior to sleep had a benefit in that time frame whether it's caught up later on 24 48 to 72 hours I don't know in other words I was going to ask you that you only did this for one breakfast and and one dinner breakfast and Bre uh sleep session yeah so so these studies so the studies with infusion of tracers are almost always limited to about 12 to 24 hours why because you have these turnover of the tissues so at some point your Tracer will become available from the breakdown and then you're measuring

[01:50:20] Tracer recycling yep so so you need different techniques and we can go into that with d2o um there's different techniques to to counter that but if there's acute Tracer infusion studies you're limited to 12 to up to 24 hours but so far long-term training studies basically have shown that protein supplementation can further increase gains in muscle mass and muscle strength

[01:50:42] I mean that that evidence is is is there it the the evidence become smaller when people eat more protein um and it gets stronger if you look at people that that do not consume enough protein I mean we had a black and white response to fre elderly 6 months of training if we didn't provide a additional protein they didn't gain more muscle so the the the more frill people are the more important the amount of protein gets but it's also because they're not consuming a lot I want to actually come back to the elderly uh in some detail but I do want to kind of put a bow on this topic here which is we don't really know over the long long term meaning over months and years if there is a benefit to consuming a very highly digestible rapidly absorbed good quality amino acid composition protein in the immediate aftermath following exercise it sounds like it's still unclear if there could be a net benefit so if a person listening to this says look I want everything in my favor to maximize my odds of you know optimism a and maximization of muscle mass I'm going to consume 25 G of whey protein following every workout again from a caloric perspective it's irrelevant it's 100 calories right it's like less than 5% of your daily intake but it would arguably be the most uh efficient way to deliver amino acids um is there any reason not to do that let's just start with that is there any is there any downside of of doing that um as opposed to going through the hassle of consuming a meal when you finish your training no on the individual absolutely not uh the only problem that I do have is that if you

[01:52:32] Advocate too much to to use like like protein supplements and stuff like that people stop thinking about their food yeah so we've had people coming in here saying like oh I I'm really really I I put a lot of interest in my nutrition and my diet and then I asked him so how do you do it yeah I take 29 supplements yeah that's I mean I want to just just first think about your nutrition and if every meal contains good solid foods and with Ample Ample protein if you then on top of that decide that it's easier and more practical to take away protein supplements after training session be my guest but if all the rest is crap then please do not even consider those whe protein supplements because first think about your nutrition and

[01:53:19] I've I've never I've never had so I had a lot of people in my life asking me like how important is it whether I take my protein shake before or after the training session but I had never somebody that came up to me like look how important is it if I'm if I skip one training session or I miss one training session consistent training is the benefit consistent training so that every meal is a greater impact on your muscle protein synthesis it's the same the questions I always get like like interviewers on the radio and they say um Luke uh what should we eat in order to lose weight and I have only one respon response is less yeah exactly but that's people people just want to it's easier to to to drink a away protein supplement than actually just uh leave the house at six o'clock in the morning and do an extra session of training yeah let's talk a little bit about eating less because again people who listen to this podcast are very familiar with the way I think about this but I'll I'll just sort of explain it to you very very quickly um I sort of break it down into three strategies to go about eating less so strategy one is a very deliberate strategy called caloric restriction so it's it's the only way that you directly go about eating less which is you know clearly what bodybuilders do where they're tracking every macronutrient every calorie they are counting them and they are uh shrinking that volume of calories lower and lower and lower to reach an energy imbalance that is sufficient for the amount of fat loss that they're trying to produce again you could argue that this is the most flexible way to go about weight loss because it is agnostic to when you eat or what the actual constitutive you know elements are of the of the diet um it's really just paying attention to the energy balance or imbalance the second way that you can go about doing this is indirectly through dietary restriction right so you just you talked about a vegan diet hey you're taking a lot of things out of the diet um and many of them are energy dense so there's a very good chance you're going to lose weight just on the basis of the Restriction similarly with a ketogenic diet or something of that nature you're going to really generally eat a lot less and it's that uh effect of the diet on perhaps your appetite and food choices that's going to result in lower energy intake and therefore energy imbalance the third technique also indirect is time restriction uh which people call intermittent fasting here you're going to make a larger and larger window of non-eating and by extension a smaller and smaller window of eating that eventually results in a caloric deficit now we have historically meaning in our practice cautioned people about excessive use of time restriction if people fit a certain demographic and that is you are obviously overnourished which is our way of describing you have excess at a Poss you have high visceral fat all of these things you're metabolically unhealthy so you're overnourished we need to make you less nourished but if you're also under muscled I get very worried about excessive time restriction because with calorie restriction comes protein restriction and with protein restriction comes not just a reduction in Mass which on some level is the goal but a disproportionate loss of lean mass and so I want to pause there does this resonate with you you the all of these the sort of trade-offs yeah yes I mean uh no I ful fully agree on that the the third one is of course the Tim restricted feeding or intermittent fasting um it works for people but it doesn't work in a scientific setting because now there's a lot of studies coming out we've also done a study in that that that uh in that that area so if you um standardize the nutrition so the caloric content of the diet you actually see exactly the same uh fat loss or weight loss with the intermittent or the Tim restricted feeding versus the same feeding but then x% of less caloric intake doesn't make any difference however so let's just make sure but let's just make sure people understand what you just said and I want to make sure I understand what you just said you're saying that if you normalize for calories across the course of the day versus in a shrunk window if it's the same number of calories there's no weight loss exactly there's no not less weight loss so if you have 25% energy restriction independent of the time frame you're going to lose the same the same the same the same amount of body mass or fat mass now for me uh intermittent feeding or time restricted feeding works because I go to the university spend most of my day here um have no time to eat running back and forth and then I come home I sit behind a computer doing all my emails and revisions of manuscripts and

[01:58:22] I start eating way too much and also crap food so I think more than 70% of my food intake energy intake is between 7 or 8 and 12:00 at night if I do Tim restricted feeding from say 10: to 6 I will lose weight because I wouldn't have time to eat that amount of calories in that time frame and that's good for a lot of people because they actually change their homeostasis and for a few weeks they lose a lot of uh lose a lot of fat moss and then they start eating differently and then they gain weight again so sometimes it's easy to change your routine and your bad nutritional nutritional habits but it the the time of feeding is not a Metabolic Effect to lose more weight yeah so what we like to do to try to get around the effect of people losing too much lean mass and again I find this to be particularly important in women who want to lose weight using a time-restricted feeding approach but who you know frankly already have an almi or an ffmi that's in the bottom 20% uh just for folks listening these are two different ways that we measure and quantify lean mass on people so this is people that are coming in with they're under muscled as we describe them um we will say look if you want to eat between you know 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. that's your feeding window you have a 5H hour window to eat so 19 hours of not eating 5 hours of eating we find that women can't again I say this because it is mostly women that experience this but I think it could be true for anybody it's very difficult to consume your total amount of protein if we're trying to get you to 1.6 or 1.8 gr per kilogram in a 5H hour period furthermore you have that 19-hour window where you're missing one of the major inputs to muscle protein synthesis so a workaround is hey during that period of time you're going to have two shakes that are virtually no calories but are going to give you 50 grams of protein a 25 you know you're going to have a 25 G whey protein uh shake you know again just mixed with water at 8:00 in the morning and again at 11:00 in the morning and then at 2:00 you're going to eat a meal and at 7:00 you're going to eat a meal so you're going to get your total amount of protein and yeah you've sort of cheated on your time restricted feeding because you've had 200 calories outside of it but let's be honest the purpose of this is caloric restriction that 200 is relatively small compared to what you would have consumed throughout the day so again long question I apologize but it's as much for the listener as it is for you would you take that approach as a better way to tackle two simultaneous goals lose fat Mass preserve or gain lean mass simultaneously that would be the main goal and I would completely agree but I I I miss one factor and I I'm 100% uh sure that you actually added the effect of course the training effect yes the resistance training so if you if even if you have I mean all studies show that if you have a caloric restriction you lose you lose fat-free Mass you lose muscle mass but if you do one uh two twice a week a resistance training session even in a caloric deficit you don't lose muscle mass so you can prevent the muscle mass with simply two sessions of resistance type exercise a week preferably more but of course that's that's the minimal yeah so besides that protein it's the exercise that makes you respond way more to the same or less amount of protein that you ingest and in the scenario I described where you're going to have that person have a protein shake at 8:00 in the morning and you know 11:00 in the morning and then eat two meals between say 2: and 7 um it's probably not that important where the training session goes within that day at this point I mean I think for many people it's just convenient to do the exercise in the morning um and and I agree of course that that's you know that's half the battle is you have to have the training stimulus to produce the effect yeah I mean that's why people always ask us like should we ingest the protein immediately after or an hour after exercise does it make a difference no not really because every meal following your training session will have a greater response and so so also before the next session there will again three meals or four meals so it's a continuous consistent effect of training to make you respond better to the same amount of protein and also in the hospital this is essential simply feeding people more protein because the deficient and losing muscle is not the only solution actually if you make them a little bit more active between meals every meal has more effect if we do a little bit of exercise more of the meal will actually be converted to muscle so using that intrinsic label protein I always have three uh different uh settings in my lectures the first one is this intrinsically protein shows you beyond any uh discussion you are what you eat in fact you are what you just ate now funny enough if you eat that same protein after you've done a little exercise more of that protein is converted to muscle so if you're physically active you you are more of what you just ate now every athlete is using this and every coach knows this but we hardly use it in medical care and so it gets worse because then you come to the third s part of the of the of a lecture where I show you that with physical inactivity you become anabolically resistance so if you become physically less active you are less of what you just ate now the problem is when you become sick or ill or you get surg surgery you have two issues you exercise less or you be become less

[02:04:27] Physically Active but you also eat less so it's a double Wy downwards and that's what makes us so susceptible and and and vulnerable uh to a short period of inactivity or sickness the term anabolic resistance is is intuitive because obviously people understand what insulin resistance is but with insulin resistance we we can actually really explain mechanistically what's happening I referred to Jerry

[02:04:53] Schulman he provided a very very uh elegant explanation of what's happening intracellularly right what the tri what the triglyceride or diog glyceride if I'm not mistaken is doing in the cell and how it's impeding the signal transduction to move the glute for transporter up to the translocated site to bring more glucose in ETC I haven't followed that description but I mean it's still as as I know as I believe it's still a discussion which fatty acid intermediate is actually causing the whole signaling is it the storage of the fat is the inflammation that you get from the storage of fat is it diil glycerol is it are the ceramides the fatti ailoa I mean yes but it's at least the inability to process that fat in the muscle is inducing insulin resistance so the question now is do we have the same level of detail around what is actually inducing anabolic resistance which is a topic that I don't think people are as familiar with but un fortunately need to be as familiar with given its prevalence under two conditions inactivity and aging I think that's that's that's the the million dooll question so um I think the first time that uh anabolic resistance was was published as the name was coined was by uh by the people in dunde Mike reny the late Micra so he did a study where he provided essential amino acids to people young and elderly and when they provided a greater amount of essential amino acids you saw in the young people a greater muscle protein synthetic response as we discussed before he got he got the greatest response the highest muscle protein synthesis following the provision of 10 grams of essential amino acids which is perfect because 10 grams of essential amino acid translates to about 20 grams of protein so it nicely fits with those other studies if he gave 20 grams of essential amino acids there was no significant further increase over the next few hours so that was normal response and in line with everything that we discussed before if he did the same thing with the older population he saw that that increase in muscle protein synthesis was less Steep and also leveled off more rapidly so that's how he coined anabolic resistance and that was I think 2005 now it took our lab almost 10 years to verify or to confirm those data because because we wanted to show the same thing with a less uh lab based approach not essenti with that 20 grams of intrinsically labeled protein and so when we actually finally managed to do that study over a long period of time we saw that basil protein synthesis is not different between young and elderly so if they're relatively active basil protein synthesis if there's a difference it's actually higher in elderly than in young but the response to the 20 gram of protein was much much is less in the older population so the same amount of protein that was ingested did not lead to the same amount of protein synthesis and with the intrinsic

[02:08:05] Lial protein we could show that less of the ingested protein was converted to muscle so that is also anabolic resistance in a more single meal like type of approach now the big question is and this is now a lot of people are focusing on anabolic resistance what is causing anabolic resistance that could be digestion that could be absorption that could could be and that's what they call Spang sequestration the uptake of amino acids and what happens between the taking up in the gut and releasing in the circulation and of course if scientists use difficult names always beware It generally means that they don't know what they're talking about so when we go say splank sequestration everybody says like okay but it's just simply means we don't know to what extent the amino acids that were actually going to the portal vein or actually being absorbed in the intestinal tissues and not being released in the circulation that's splenic sequestration where is it is it in the liver is it still in the intestin is it taken to other tissues in between the portal vein like lymphatic system we don't know exactly and then the release in the circulation but then insulin also plays a role because if there's not enough insulin and insulin is not atory but permissive is how much of the tissues are being punded so they get blood because if the blood doesn't peruse the muscle those free amino acids are never going to be seen by the muscle then we have the uptake in the muscle and then you have those signaling responses EMP the pathway in the muscle on all these levels anabolic resistance can reside so it's impossible to find it and so a lot of people are focusing on all these different areas and then the problem is and this is the problem with every study in where we actually look at aging we compare young and older people we don't follow the same person for 40 or 50 years because that doesn't work for studies and it takes too long that's why we use all those those those animal species or every any other any organisms like the calans or whatever so if we compare young and old we're not comparing the same person we're actually comparing LIF style comorbidity um pharmacological interventions that they have uh food intake um all of these things but I just said that physical activity makes the muscle more sensitive to the anabolic properties of amino acids does it make perfect sense to say that less physical activity makes the muscle less sensitive to uh amino acids so the only way to study this and this is what we do is we immobilize young people so we put one leg in a cost for a week and then if you didn't believe the story about 1 to two% turnover of muscle you know because even after a week when the cost comes off you don't need an MRI scan to see which lag had been in the cost because you actually see the muscle as the loss of muscle in that lag how much do you have to pay a young person to subject themselves to a week in a cast oh to be honest that that is actually so one week is I mean six week would be difficult especially here with

[02:11:23] Health Sciences and Medicine a lot of the students I mean are active but one one week they actually love the experiment um and and I mean now they can choose the the color of the of the cast as well so I think of some of the crazy experiments I got paid to do while I was in medical school you know at the time what I would do for $1,000 was I'm

[02:11:46] I won't admit it uh uh publicly um so the have you been able to study this longitudinally in a mouse for example where no no so so we only do animal stud human studies in VI I hardly do any I mean I do some animal work with collab is anybody studying this because again you raise a good point right which is without a longitudinal assessment which would not be possible in humans um we really are stuck without understanding the nuances of course in humans you can do a crossover between active and inactive and that might provide an answer to the question but as I listen to this list of differences in absorption circulation uh the splank circula sequestration which is I've never considered that um the perfusion related makes total sense uptake in the muscle lower mtor activity we know mtor activity is lower in the elderly I mean it could be any of the above it could be all of the above and what do I think that they really importance I don't think so yeah at the end of the day we know what we know what you need to do control what you can control be more active consume more protein but so if we take that previously immobilized leg and we give that person an amount of protein I see a 35% difference between the lag that was previously immobilized and the leg that was not immobilized so there's a 20 35% anabolic resistance after one week of inactivity that is much more than we see as a difference between The Young and the older so with one week of inactivity

[02:13:25] I can make a young leg or young muscle respond completely like a ccent muscle and out of fun thing if I actually take an older person and I do some exercise and I give protein I see a completely normal response if I take a biopsy of an older person I see smaller type two fibers if I train that person for three months the type two fibers bigger than the type one fiber and I don't see any difference in the response to a young younger person and I can say the same thing about satellite cells so muscle on itself is actually doesn't seem to get that old it actually still responds completely normal and I can normalize for age by physical activity yeah I was about to say that ex the two examples you gave there completely change the discussion again I think it's worth restating them because when you you're saying so many important things I just want to make sure people are not missing these right so you took a group of young healthy people who presumably have lots of anabolic capacity you put them in a cast for a week and you immediately demonstrate upon removing the cast that the the leg that has been immobile for a week is 35% less responsive to protein assimilation than the other leg that's an anabolic resistance Factor of 35% which you also pointed out is far less or pardon me far greater than what you see in an aged individual the other thing you said was dep depends whether that age IND an active older or a normal order if if that older person is lying in bed for three three weeks Co we're talking about other situation yeah but then the other thing you said was you can take an aged individual who might have you know again 20 or 30% less anabolic response to protein than a young person but if you exercise them you can bring them up to the same level as a younger person these two factors suggest that activity might be the main determinant of anabolic resistance an an aging individual or age within an individual is simply a proxy for activity and so it's more difficult for older people to maybe do the same training loads but the muscle itself is still responsive so the good news is you don't have to start exercising when you're 40 to actually have good muscle when you're 80 you can still do that at 70 now it's better to do it at 40 as well but at any age and that's also 100 plus the muscle is still very responsive to physical activity and it has nothing to do with hormones and that is also something that I get so fed up with we've just finished the study with prostate cancer patients now you know what happens when they get enogen deficiency therapy they lose a lot of muscle mass they gain a lot of fat Mass they have an increased risk of becoming diabetes developing cardiovascular disease besides the effects that they become a little bit lethargic we did training with them resistance training two to three times a week the ADT had no effect on the muscle mass they actually gained muscle mass so despite the fact that they had no testosterone they were basically chemically castrated two to three times week resistance training increased muscle mass increased muscle strength and attenuated fat Mass gain it's that easy it's ridiculous that people go on ADT and are not immediately getting resistance training in addition to it because it prevents all the negative side effects yeah I again I think it's a you've now hit on the second point that I think is really frustrating and difficult to hear and I

[02:17:16] I I really hope that there are that there are people out there um in a position to do something about this right which is look we there's such a disconnect in medicine when it comes from doing really wonderful things to then missing the boat on the support system that's needed so the two examples here is the one you just gave right you know does it make sense to put a man on Androgen deprivation therapy yes it does under certain circumstances if a man has metastatic or inoperable high-grade prostate cancer he needs to be on

[02:17:51] Androgen deprivation therapy and as you pointed out yeah as you pointed out he is being chemically curated and I have seen many of these men and they are quite miserable because they are losing lots of muscle mass they are gaining lots of fat and they are becoming metabolically profoundly unhealthy and yet you would think that for every oncologist that puts a patient or every urologist who manages a patient through

[02:18:20] Androgen deprivation therapy it should be as important that prescribed alongside that Androgen deprivation therapy is a resistance training program in a proper diet around high protein intake and I would say look you should be resistance trading four or five times a week I mean this is the most potent thing you have to counterbalance that and the other example you gave that's just infuriating is to think of all of these sedentary hospitalized patients who are basically being protein restricted again we talk so much in the

[02:18:56] United States and I'm sure it's true uh in Europe about you know the cost of Health Care and the burden of Health Care and the burden of the sick individual and how so many dollars of a person's healthc care allotment are spent at the end of life when the quality is so low and yet you know the system itself is broken in that it doesn't even understand the basic fundamentals of exercise and nutrition and the funny thing about this that isn't really funny is this is what I think gives much of the population a total lack of trust in the medical establishment because they see hey you guys don't know about exercise in nutrition so why should I believe you on these other things where you know you actually do have an authority and I and

[02:19:40] I I I feel like I've seen an acceleration of this over the past few years covid clearly didn't help um so I think you know that we can talk we we don't have to talk about why I think covid policy eroded a lot of trust but I think there's something even deeper than that which is just a general belief that the medical system doesn't communicate through a strong position of knowledge when it comes to the real way to use exercise and nutrition as medical interventions I think everybody knows that lifestyle is important but they sometimes just do not realize how relatively easy it is to do it and so we should have scientists and clinicians talk more and it's it's changing but it's very going very slow uh give you a nice example I mean so when you're in the hospital you get your last meal at around 5 or 6 o00 if you're lucky and then the next morning at say 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning so you spent almost like uh yeah nine and uh six so 15 hours of fasting 15 hours of fasting when you're at the risk of of losing muscle so and you're not eating in those 15 hours that's stupid not a single athlete in the world will do that MH so um we were wondering like if you provide protein prior to sleep does your gut actually process it while you sleep now that sounds easier than said and done so we called some of our subjects and actually they call us especially the elderly they're really great to work with it's amazing so they call us and say like look I haven't been to your lab in the last two years don't you have a study running that I can particip F in and then I I would say like oh the M yans come over uh what we'll do is we'll take a muscle biopsy then we'll take a nasogastric tube put a tube down your nose into your gut will make you sleep in the hospital overnight at 2 o'clock in the morning we will tiptoe into the lab push 40 grams of preheated intrinsic labeled protein in your gut without waking you up and in the morning I will wake you up with a muscle biopsy and then they say where can I sign up it's really these guys really amazing so but we did this and what happens if while they're sleeping and you provide the protein in the guts it's rapidly digested and absorbed just as easily as in the morning so there's no restriction there and they actually synthesize muscle protein at night and the next morning we see the incorporation in the muscle so when we published that study it was really weird I got phone calls from coaches all over the world asking me where they could buy those naso Gast juice God and then I had to explain I said this is a proof of principle study to show you that the gut functions while we sleep but if you want to do something just give people a protein Rich snack between dinner and going to bed because that will expedite uh reconditioning help you with your recovery from training and more importantly it will might help older people or people in the hospital to attenuate muscle loss while in the hospital now that's that's part one second part is you actually start doing that with a protein small protein snack in the evening done that as well then the next step is does it actually work in in in in hospital because if you provide a protein Rich snack do people still eat the same the next morning now that's already difficult because then in the hospital this is this is actually not the invasive work that we do I just wanted to have people uh bring around cheese cubes in the evening in the hospital and see how it Ed 24-hour food intake in patients it went up by 20% so that is stuff that we don't even manage with supplements because people don't eat them they get a supplement of the meal it it's just thrown away so bring people nice protein Rich snack in the evening they increase protein intake by 20% it's that easy want to talk a little bit more about protein supplements okay um we've talked extensively about the milk protein isolates way in case um I get I get asked questions all the time about this and unlike you I don't know the anwers so I'm kind of like you know my answer is I don't think that matters but for example my wife's friends always ask me about collagen hey should I be consuming this collagen or that collagen or this collagen and I and my response is I don't think that matters I frankly think you're just better off consuming a high quality protein that has a balance of all of the amino acids but uh tell folks for first of all what collagen is um and then maybe answer my question about whether or not there's a unique benefit to consuming collagen um as a supplement joh was thinking like I should do less research so I I don't get all these questions so collagen is a protein uh that is very I mean it's pretty prevalent in your body because it's the it's the main protein that is uh used for uh structural uh protein it's a structure protein so collagen is in your cartilage your bone your tendons your ligaments um and all of that and it's also in muscle very small amount relatively in order to and it's important to transfer the force of your connect of your muscle towards your tendons so even in the muscle all of your contractile proteins need to be uh linked to collagen in order or connective tissue proteins in order to transfer the force now um a lot of lot of people are in the market you see now ingest collagen supplements because it helps you with uh strength Force skin bone ligaments and stuff like that so we're interested in because um it's a very nice source of glycine and

[02:25:38] Proline about 50% of your collagen is glycine and Proline so it's a poor protein from a total perspective is not as balanced as as an animal- derived uh meat protein or milk protein so but it contains a lot of glycine and Proline so what you could say is that hey your ligaments your cartilage your bone also contains a lot of glycine and Proline and so it's a good source of these two amino acids um makes perfect sense so the story is uh makes sense but it's a little bit like um yeah if you eat something that you need it's going to be better for you but the question is do we already get enough gly and protein in our diet and is additional via collagen of additional value now that is something that we don't know and we have been starting to look at this and so we've been ingesting collagen and whe protein after exercise and then we look at myop fial protein synthesis but also muscle connective protein synthesis and I hope that doesn't go too fast exercise stimulates both bii as well as Conn muscle connective protein synthesis so the Adaptive response in muscle is both connective proteins as well as my fi proteins now if you ingest protein it further increases the response to exerise and you see greater myoi protein synthesis however the ingestion of dairy protein or protein does not seem to increase muscle connective protein synthesis rates so so far at least for up to six hours after exercise your contractile muscle responds to protein in addition to exercise but your muscle connective does not now we've tried that also with collagen and we do not see a greater increase in connective tissue protein synthesis rates in muscle so either it is not happening in the first five hours and the exercise is already a stimulus enough and the response is later on or there's enough Glycine and proline in

[02:27:55] Dairy protein how much are you seeing in the muscle connective tissue response to Dairy I I was under the impression based on what you said that it was virtually none is it some but just pales in comparison to the exercise it pales to in comparison to the exercise exactly okay no significant increase in muscle connective protein synthesis uh in addition to the exercise effect have you done this activity or this experiment without exercise so you can because obviously exercise is such a potent stimulus that as you said it might be dwarfing what we see and and what is that have you done that experiment let me look what uh so you're saying without exercise yes we also done it without exercise and it does not seem to be responsive to nutrition but I have to uh make an exception in that study by urine that huge amount of protein that 100 grams we suddenly see it uh interesting so in that study where you gave the massive dose of protein and those were not exercising patients over a longer period of time yeah but that was exercise as well I see but that oh that was exercise okay and that but that was also yeah okay so it seems that based on those data there is no benefit in both myof fibular or muscle connective tissue protein synthesis using collagen versus using whey or casian so if a person is taking a collagen protein because they believe that it will disproportionately help them increase the strength of their connective tissue the data would say that that is not correct at least in the presence of an exercising individual yes over over five hours I guess to be fully complete okay and I how and so what I hold so from a practice translation um I still hold an option open for ligaments tendons bone cartilage because when I look at muscle connective protein the fraction that we actually take out of the muscle contains only a few percent of collagen so the muscle doesn't contain a lot of collagen so the question is is it not more important for tendons ligaments bone and cartilage I wouldn't say say that it's not working there so again we are also atlet we're also patients and also scientist so as as a scientist I haven't seen evidence that it actually leads to Greater connective tissue protein synthesis rates but if I would actually break my hip or I would actually have a major issue with my knee and I'm recovering rehabilitating I think I would take uh both a protein supplement that also has a little bit of collagen in order to be sure that I get enough Glycine and Proline yeah but meid but but I would say that the the the you know the other point to consider is if there are people listening to this who are just using collagen as their supplemental protein Source they're undoubtedly compromising myofibrillar muscle protein synthesis because as you said they're basically just getting a lot of Proline and Glycine and they're probably really missing out on Lucine lysine methionine and the other amino acids that are far more potent it's a very low quality protein from the perspective amino acid balance yes yeah but it's a nice source of glycine and

[02:31:22] Prine but if you take enough protein probably the Glycine and Proline is already sufficiently available in your diet however if you have major issues with ligaments tendons or other almost purely collagen based structures it might be a benefit I'm not throwing that away that is something that we still want to look at for the next few years but the jury is still out on that let's talk a little bit about something you said earlier which was um you know what some targets might be for a meal right so you mentioned two to three grams of Lucine in a meal if you really really want to kick uh muscle protein synthesis into overdrive do you have any other rules of thumb around specific amino acids um one of the things we do try to talk to our patients about especially patients who are plant-based is rather than just have them worry about the different bioavailability of this protein versus that protein it's just sort of focus on how much Lucine lysine methionine you're getting across the course of a day or even in the course of a meal but I'd like to hear your guidelines around that so many of the plant derived proteins are low in lysine and or methionine so that is always a discussion of course U now if you eat a lot of uh meat

[02:32:42] Alternatives uh often these meat Alternatives um lack or have a low amount of lyso methionine so a lot of of these project are spiked or fortified with those individual amino acids um however if you eat a well balanced meal you typically have different plant-based proteins in your meal that often compensate low lysine or low methionine for example one protein has high lysine and the other one has relatively High methionine so they compensate so that's why also your mom would say have a a diet that is balanced with a lot of different sources then the problems become smaller and you don't have to expect huge issues certainly not if you're consuming enough protein because uh you can compensate for lesser quality by greater quantity and that's also the confusion with for example the game changers documentary that you everybody seems to have seen if you have a huge football player and is consuming a massive amount of food I couldn't even care less where the protein comes from because simply by the mass of protein he or she already compensates for lesser quality by the the simple Mass the large amount of protein um but if you yeah if you actually so we I mean the hype is also here I got a phone call from somebody in the hospital saying like look what do you think should we actually get only uh plant-based foods for our patients and I'm thinking like oh no uh because quality becomes important when you actually have low quantity of food so people that due to cancer or pain eat less don't give them high plant-based Foods it sounds like you're doing a good thing but you're not helping them at that stage in life yeah that's that's very interesting right you would think that the most vulnerable people the smallest people the people eating the least the people who are in this case the greatest at risk for loss of lean mass need to disproportionately focus on the highest quality sources of protein and and and so everybody means well and especially that's also the communication between clinical care and science that often you think like oh a plantbased diet is healthier yes it's healthier if you're overc consuming energy and so if you need more plant-based diet will allow you to eat less energy become less obese or less overweight but it doesn't mean it's good for everybody necessarily Luke I want to sort of before we wrap up ask you one more question to think about until we we meet again hopefully in person here in a over the next 12 to 24 months what is the single most interesting question you would like to explore in your lab um I don't think I G to answer it in a in a in a year um we I'll give this as a kickoff we'll start over with that one we measured protein synthesis in brain tissue in humans so people that have severe epilepsy they get surgery in the brain so the skill is lift lifted and we these people were great they actually wanted to participate in research so we infused labeled amino acid Tracer and we actually got part of their neocortex and we measured the synthesis rate of these amino acids incorporation in the human brain throughout surgery turnover rate of the human brain is almost three times as high as muscle so if and of course there's slowly turning over proteins and fast turning proteins in your brain but generically on a on an average level you can actually translate that into you have a new brain in about three weeks why do you still think you're you I mean that's question yeah I like do do all amino acids cross the bloodb brain barrier um to be honest I think so but uh there might be differences on the large neutral amino acid transport is basically for all amino acids so do you have any sense of which amino acids are disproportionately used by the cortex uh no um so you're asking now I mean I'm not a brain physiologist so and certainly so but we we did measure I mean we published this in brain I think about two two years ago and I think the amino acid composition if I remember correctly of the brain was not that much different from muscle wow but the turnover of your brain and of course we know this the brain has plasticity as well just as your liver just as now we're also looking at tumors so everything is growing and breaking down at an immense rate and I can't grasp my hat around it because it means that everything is just just doing this and you don't notice it everything seems solid but it's constantly broken down and build up again the amino acids in your brain now might be in your in your toe uh tomorrow morning how does the body do this and how do do all these organs communicate it's it's really amazing well I think it is safe to say we won't have an answer to that question the next time we meet but I think what we will have are some more questions and a deeper dive on this so so Luke thanks very much for staying up late um to to talk with us this evening your time and uh look forward to uh hopefully seeing you in person and maybe you'll wear some orange for me next time in support of your amazing Countryman Max for stappen I will do so thanks for having me was fun talking [Music]
