## Description

Original release date: 2/11/19

In this episode, Tom Catena, a missionary physician who runs Mother of Mercy Hospital in the Nuba Mountains in Sudan, describes some of his extraordinary work as the only doctor in a remote, war-torn region of Africa. In terms of individual lives saved, you could argue that there is no other person on the front lines doing more than Tom. Additionally, we explore the manner in which the Nuba people die, which is in striking contrast to the ubiquity of chronic disease and self-harm in the west, despite the extreme poverty and unimaginable suffering experienced by the Nuba people. Lastly, we discuss the lessons to be gleaned from the Nuba people, who despite their suffering, live so harmoniously, happily, and resiliently.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription my guest this week is dr. Tom Katina now I want to preface this by saying something that you don't know one hand is a little bit embarrassing to admit but I think it also speaks to sort of the significance of Tom I've been very privileged over my life to have met many quote/unquote important people people who are very rich or people who are very famous or people who have accomplished great things athletically or otherwise for whatever reason I've never been nervous going into the first meeting with somebody who is quote-unquote special not sure why maybe just deep down and kind of get that we're all kind of the same and just because one person smarter or runs faster or you know made more money you know in the end it doesn't really matter that much and we're all the same but I gotta say I've known about Tom for about three years we've exchanged emails in the past but this interview was the first time I met Tom in person and I only know how to say this just bluntly it's the first time in my life I've ever been nervous to meet a human being which of course is ironic when you meet Tom and this will come across in this episode because he is quite simply the most humble human being you could ever meet but I I suppose I see in Tom what I consider to be the greatest of any qualities or characteristics of any human being and so it humbled me and intimidated me to meet him since about the year 2000 tom has been a missionary physician in Africa initially working in

[00:05:35] Kenya and then in about 2008 he moved to a region of South Sudan called the Nuba hills or nuba mountains where he continues to take care of about three-quarters of a million people he's the only physician in the area and there's a single hospital there that he runs with a it's hard to describe how few resources he has to run it and I don't want to get into that because the episode will cover that in detail but I can only say that it is nothing short of a miracle what he and his very limited staff are able to do his accolades are so numerous that I don't even think it's worth getting into them I will say he is the recipient of the Aurora prize for awakening humanity this is a prize that

[00:06:17] Awards 1 million dollars to the charities of Toms choice and needless to say that is about as high in honor as anybody could receive for the type of work that he does he's been described by one Muslim man as Jesus Christ which I think also speaks to the impact that he has had on the community that he serves no in this episode we talk about a lot of things and obviously talking about kind of the unimaginable suffering that he sees and how he himself copes with death and how he himself copes with being in a situation that I don't think any of us can understand and certainly no physician can understand because none of us really practice medicine alone and yet in many ways that's what Tom is doing we talk about a crisis of purpose so it's easy I think to look at what Tom does and feel sorry for him or feel sorry for the people he serves but I must admit I came away from this interview actually feeling more sorry for us and Tom so eloquently without judgment explains some of the differences between people with all the privilege in the world like most of us listening to this and the people that he serves and talk about the sense of community that exists in nuba and what you start to realize is that the way that we die in this country and the way that we live in this country is so different from the way that people live and die in that part of the world and it's not just on the obvious things it's not surprising that people there don't die from complications of type 2 diabetes but they die from infectious diseases and trauma but there's a more subtle point here which is we in many ways are prisoners of our own world our own minds our own possessions these things and to see the way Tom describes the freedom from that it gives me hope that if someone like me can realign the way I think about these things that in many ways enslaved me perhaps I could even capture a fraction of the satisfaction the happiness the purpose that someone like Tom has Thomas work is so important to me and I want to be sure that anybody listening to this can get access to all of the notes we're going to put together on this and so normally our notes are only available to subscribers but for this episode they're available to everyone I don't want anyone to not be able to see this under any circumstance so I really do recommend that everybody take a moment and look at some of the videos that we link to if you don't make time for that but you are still sort of interested I can't wreck enough that you watched the documentary at the heart of nuba which is based on the work that Tom does there I think you'll come away from this episode understanding why I could feel so nervous meeting Tom for the first time and so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with dr. Tom container hey Tom thank you so much for making the time to come over here today sure my pleasure yeah yeah there are a few people that would be giving up more that they deem important work than you so I know I know your time is tight how often do you come to the u.s. well this is my first time out in more than three years so last time I was in the US was November 2015 I was here for about five days I was in my hometown of Amsterdam New York and it wasn't much of a trip I was you asked about malaria I was sick as a dog of malaria sounds like in bed with me the whole time the last I felt a bit better just in time to go back to Africa so it's been it's been a long time since

[00:09:44] I've been back you grew up in upstate New York yep your pedigree is like the star right you went to brown you played football you went to Duke Medical School right at what point did you realize you wanted to do something a little different visa vie working you know outside of the US for example this desire to do this kind of work really was planted and when I was in college when I was at Brown and I always want to do some kind of mission work and that term has several connotations but I you know I wanted to be a missionary whatever that meant I was in question with him at the time but I just had this idea and when they working on the cultures on a society do mission work but I was as you a mechanical engineering major and that didn't really fit with doing mission work this was in the 1980s and most of the jobs then were in the defense industry they were you know they were good jobs but I didn't really want to do that kind of work so I graduated college and kind of floating around for a while I was offered a job by GE working with a work on nuclear submarine program it would been a really good job but I just wasn't interested in that kind of work and number one day it was kind of odd I was coming back from my great aunt's funeral I was with my brother Felix idea just kind of popped in my head I should go into medicine because I could if I do that then I could do mission work and you know I'd like the sciences like I stay the sciences Domitian work help people just kind of a general idea and ended up going to medical school and

[00:11:06] I've kind of kept that desired to mission work and that kind of evolved into wanting to work in Africa work with people that don't have a lot of options for healthcare you know 15 years later ended up in Sudan so you started out in Kenya is that right right so we don't when I finished in medical school then I did five years in the u.s. Navy I didn't even ask Oliver for medical school said

[00:11:26] I'd pay that time back then went do my residency I did Family Practice in Terre Haute Indiana no it was time to kind of be free and do what I wanted so I thought well let me just code and let me do this thing that's been kind of a niche for so many years so I teamed up with Catholic medical Mission Board nice and they said okay we have a knot opening in Kenya at this Mission

[00:11:46] Hospital maybe go there okay I'll go for one year I'll see how it goes if I like it maybe I'll stay longer otherwise I mean I'll just come back and start a practice and went on the Kenyan and fell in love with the place and decided this day what was the first thing that you remember when you got there as far as how different this was from the way you had trained because you did your residence in the United States right right did my residency in the US and I did family practice and the program I went to was kind of geared towards rural health so I thought what K if I want to do admission medicine I bet

[00:12:15] I'd be doing more than just kind of outpatient office stuff I need to do something a little more a little more meat to it so you know a little bit of obstetrics we did a bit of surgery mostly just c-sections so when I first got there I think what struck me was just the volume of patients I mean it was a resident and you know in clinic days we'd see like five or six patients you know and get all every little detailed out of each one and now yeah I mean in this rural hospital in Kenya and

[00:12:41] I mean just seeing 5060 patients you know huge numbers the clinic the the wards are full you go do order around I was in charge of the adult ward and there were you know at the time I thought was a huge and we'd like 3040 patients there and I was responsible for all them it's just this year volume of patients you had to go through every day in the variety of diseases so not only the tropical stuff which I I didn't know much about I mean here's malaria TB leishmaniasis all this kind of stuff I had no idea about I didn't learn about when I was there you know learned the word thank God some couple more senior doctors they're like I learned from but just a volume of patients and the variety of diseases you had a face so what year did you get to Kenya I arrived in Kenya

[00:13:23] January 17th mm that's so interesting I I arrived at NIH when I was in medical school on January 17th mm no way yeah yeah which was NIH being at NIH where I was in medical school was one of the sort of more formative parts of my experience mm-hmm so how long before you went to Sudan and what led to that transition I'm trying to think of my geography right Kenya is south of Sudan correct sort of south east of Sioux

[00:13:51] South right South in a bit east exactly okay and and much more stable right I mean Kenya's a relatively safe place to be right Sudan is not right it's divided into these provinces and my the one that got all the attention was Darfur which is the farthest west correct exactly and that basically was a war zone right I mean a killing field right so Bashar was basically killing his own people there wasn't he right so to go from Kenya to Sudan what were you thinking I think maybe the modus operandi in my life was always looking for what's the opposite of greener pastures I'm looking for browner pastures when I was there in Kenya this was as I said I got there generally mm the civil war in Sudan was really raging at that time and I was in Kenya learning a ton of stuff really enjoyed the work and I kept hearing about Sudan the civil war in Sudan and how it was so terrible and the conditions there were were terrible in the you know it's such a lack of any kind of health services I thought man I'd really like to get involved in that in that struggle just to go and work with the help the people there just because it was so health facilities were so limited but that's kind of the place I want to go to so I had this general thought this is two thousand thousand one thousand two now this woman June of 2002 I left my first posting which was in a rural place called mutombos there for two and half years I went up to northern Kenya it's called Turkana I was at the calculation hospital which is up and then Turkana desert and here the refugee camp woman named Dedra burns so did he it was there

[00:15:19] I think a first time up in Turkana and I was talking to her she's an American she was no she's kind of short to her mission there she's a a surgeon and a family practice doctor she did both was doing primarily surgery and she said look there's a bishop I know he's a bishop nichrome Garces was building a hospital in Sudan and I think he might be interested in going there and that say whoa that's exactly what I've been thinking about doing you know for the past couple years it's effective doesn't - so she said look he's got an office in Nairobi he's living there in exile maybe you can make contact with his office because I was due to go to

[00:15:47] Nairobi and start working there anyway to make a long story short I ended up working on that Robi linked up with his office and we started kind of making plans for the hospital and I would run staff we would need all that kind of stuff and then took six years but six years later who funded the hospital he's all funded through the Catholic Diocese

[00:16:04] I see so his Catholic Diocese of El Obeid Bishop cassis was the Bishop of the El Obeid diocese and he and his officer able to get funding through the through the church mechanism to fund the hospital so now it's Oh 809 and that's when you go through I so I went to the mountains arrived there March 10th 2008 was they ever landed there in the months tell the listener a little bit about where nuba is I mean I know it's in the southern part of Sudan it's to the east of Darfur but it's pretty rugged country isn't it right so the Nuba Mountains is probably one of the most remote places in the world it's a region which for many years and sedan was kind of kept off limits before when sodium was a kind of a colony was under the called the anglo-egyptian condominium partly kind of administered by UK and by Britain by by Egypt they decided to kind of keep the nubes separately so look these people have a unique culture in our New York people they didn't really allow a lot of open tourism or people to go in there was kind of a closed area so they really kind of have maintained this separateness and this isolation over over centuries is difficult to reach it's semi-arid it's got it's got this thing of rainy season it's got a dry season but more hills they are real high mountains but sort of you know 3,000 foot hills that kind of like kind of range my history is not great but I sort of remember that basically Sudan was granted sort of I forget the term but when you're given your independence for lack of a better word that would've been in the 50s right right 56 okay and then what was the religious sort of map of Sudan and did that figure into how it was divided and it was that partly why nuba was was it religiously diverse was it mostly Muslim mostly Christian yeah you know Sudan is a it's a very interesting place you've got it was one country up until 2011 when they divided

[00:17:54] North and South now they will just make it as in the north so north of Nuba Mountains it's promoting Muslim almost all Muslim in the north the South is primarily Christian nuba is right in the middle and interesting enough nuba is a mix it's about let's say half Christian half Muslim and everybody's animus but half our Christian half our Muslim and the Nuba are unique I think a unique tribe in the world where you have families which are mixed of nuba you have nuba Muslims and the Christians and they there's no conflict amongst them for instance my wife is Anubha her father both her parents when they were born they were just followed the traditional religions the the

[00:18:34] Christianity and Islam had not been introduced yet to the area now as they got older her father became Muslim mother became Christian they married her father's a polygamist so two eyes both wiser Christian they're all his son is a Muslim the rest the children a Christian and nobody's really bothered by this that's in nuba now the country itself this difference between Muslim and

[00:18:55] Christian was was really a big issue in the previous civil war you know we had sort of the southern African people that were mostly Christian against the northern air people there were all Muslim fighting each other and there was very much religious context to that previous civil war and also in nuba mountains the pneuma mountain but people join the southerners they're all African and new but they joined the Southerners fighting the northern sort of Arab

[00:19:18] Muslim people in the north and in the 1990s there was a jihad against the Nuba people so there was a real genocide in the 1990s against the who issued this jihad the ideologue behind us is a guy who just died last year his name is hassan al Torabi and Torabi was remember the Muslim Brotherhood very bright guy went to Sorbonne in Paris and was kind of intellectual but really kind of a have an evil genius if I can use that word he was a real ideologue and the Muslim brother and he managed to convince some of the

[00:19:52] Imams in the north to sign off a fatwa to allow jihad against the Nuba many Imams rejected it they say what you can't you can't do that it's you know even though he'd be killing Muslims within new but right exactly his response this was ok you can have a jihad because the Christians are our fair game in the jihad and then the

[00:20:09] Muslims are Abba States from the religion because they associated Christians some of them eat pork some of them drink the local beer they're not real Muslims like this thing with the new bar very much communal and to have Muslims and Christians together at functions it was a nothing but to him the fact who could have Christians and

[00:20:26] Muslims in the same family was a huge scandal to him he just couldn't tolerate that kind of stuff so he said no these guys are also fair game because they're not real Muslim so what year was that fatwa issued that was in the I think in the early 90s of in 93 so abso Bashir was already in power right his coup was like late 80s right he took power in 89 okay and this guy Torabi helped him win this coup he was kind of the brains behind the coup and to Robbie I mean he was you know he was kind of power-hungry guy he said okay his figure he figured if he helped but he or getting a power but he was a military guy and we thought kay if I help Bashir getting the power I'm much more intelligent that much here I'll just kind of find a way to get rid of him and

[00:21:06] I'll take over and by sure he said look I'm the one in power you're not you're not taking over so he kind of always kept Torabi at a distance and they're always these he were always he was always throwing at Robbie in prison afterwards cuz probably started speaking out against him put him in a quote unquote president maybe you know I believe doing some luxury apartment in Khartoum but they kind of were at odds with each other but

[00:21:24] Robbie was the ideologue behind a lot of this moment he's the one that invited Osama bin Laden to Sudan in the early 90s so bin Laden lived in when bin Laden was exiled from Saudi Arabia which says yeah in the early 2000 right well that was before then he invited what's his name he invited bin Laden to Khartoum hmm so he lived in Sudan for a while and a lot of you know al Qaeda had a lot of training camps in the desert in the north of Sudan I had totally forgotten that fact that the chapter of al Qaeda that I'd forgotten so you basically have a bunch of incredibly evil people who are deciding to kill their own citizens effectively right you got there in oh wait you said her oh nine oh eight so arrived March 2008 so historically that was the interim peace period so since they got independence in 1956 Sudan's been a civil war various parts of have been a civil war for almost the entire history that's it has 60 that's how many years 60 to 63 years most of the history they've been a civil war so this was one of the brief periods actually wasn't even priest them because their forest started 2003 therefore-- rebels started their fighting us to govern 2003 so this wasn't the whole country is not a piece of the time but the big war between the south and north the peace agreement signed 2005 so when we arrived 2008 the peace groom was still in effect and there was no active fighting and then we were kind of waiting for this referendum to take place referendum the way the peace of room was signed up was southerners so

[00:22:50] South Sudan would have the choice for self-determination and that would be done by referendum so that people actually vote straight up vote if the majority vote to secede they secede more majority vote this day as they as one country they stay now 2011 they have the vote in like 99.99% vote to secede from the north so South Sudan separates in the peace agreement I'm sorry is nuba considered south or north in this cessation right this is part of the problem because in the peace agreement nuba was separate okay and what they said was okay South Sudan will have a referendum the Nuba Mountains was not included as part of South Sudan nuba and

[00:23:26] Blue Nile were separate regions and they said in these two regions they're called the two areas they'll have what's called a popular consultation which was a very vague system where there be committee set up they would go and they would talk to people in the villages and kind of get their opinions on things and see what they want to do if they want this separate stay it was very vague and I think it was purposely vague because the government knew it was kind of bargaining chip for the north to allow South Sudan to have this referendum that's okay and that because they knew in the end they would keep the mountains because this thing was too vague you know they would be able to admit manipulate it enough they but keeping them on their side so South

[00:24:04] Sudan separates there are elections in nuba mountains in 2011 in May the candidate for Bashir's party of course wins the governorship in the Parliament yes as a side note before that election the guy's name is Ahmed I'm at Haroon who was running against the onion Abdul Aziz anyway Helmut Haroon was the candidate for Bashir his party National

[00:24:24] Congress party and before his election by sure said I mean Haroon is our candidate and he will win this election whether by the ballot or by the bullet so going into it it doesn't look like it's gonna be a free and fair election right and Bashir at this point does he already have basically a warrant out for his arrest right so he's got the warrant for his arrest that was I think 2009 I think I'm at Haroon also is indicted by the ICC for crimes he was one of the architects of the genocide in Darfur so I'm in everyone who was our governor mez under is indicted by the ICC by sheer Zanetti by the ICC it also was the defense minister wasn't added by the ICC someone who wins they go and say okay now our party is there in South Kordofan State

[00:25:06] Duma mountains there are still SPLA soldiers like southern soldiers living in this region the northern army came who said you know did a forced disarmament of these SPI soldiers and that's when violence broke out so June 2011 June 6 2011 civil war breaks out in nuba mountains against the government now I've heard you speak about this in the past it was overnight that most most of the staff in your hospital left so prior to that leading up to that the referendum in that the breakout of war you've got this three-year period where you're in the hospital you're working there as far as new but can be tranquil this is the greatest tranquility you've seen the staff is what it's you it's what else right so at this time you know we started the hospital March 2008 we went there with about 8 expatriates including myself Allison Lee doctor we had a few nurses anesthetist the lab person we had those 8 expatriates they were mostly from there off in Kenya or

[00:26:04] Uganda those 8 expatriates myself we had 15 local staff Anubha and the Nuba I think the most educated person had finished primary school they were not nurses they were just kind of local people that could read and write a bit of English and could speak English so they had to be taught everything we first started they couldn't way a patient they couldn't take a temperature let alone give an injection nursed and I be anyway with time we got these guys trained up a bits they had some pretty good skills a lot most of that was done by these expatriate nurses now we still kept expatriates but over time we added more and more on-the-job training people we kept adding more

[00:26:41] Primary School graduates or eventually got a few secondary school people started training him on the job we didn't have any trained numr nurses nuba nurses by the time the war started in 2011 so now were starts June 6 to 11 by June 16th is 10 days into the fighting things are getting pretty hairy there's a lot of fighting within nuba Arab bombardments all the time and the diocese and this is all from the north north north ok fighting within Duma moans the resistance is posed by whom is it former southern who have not seceded or are trying to basically are the north and the south now fighting for nuba right so what happens the South Sudan is totally separate content so within nuba mountains you've got a lot of soldiers that were southern soldiers as pillow soldiers a lot of whom were nuba most of our nuba which also had other southern tribes in the mountains kind of left over from the previous conflict and they were there in the barracks so that all those kind of trapped SPLA soldiers are fighting the sudan army now they call themselves instead of ice plate called

[00:27:44] SP like north ok so from that point forward these guys are called let's play north they have kind of a new identity as a separate military force from this pillar which is a South Sudan so Fighting's going on air bombardments June 16th the diocese says look we're having were setting a plane in and this plane is gonna come in to evacuate anybody who wants to get out of there ok because they said the plane was gonna go to Uganda or to Sudan the plane was flying into nuba mountains ok to pick up whoever wanted to get out and they would get out and leave now this was a bit dicey because at this time there were few flights coming through the mountains mostly getting people out but they have to change the airstrip there are a few air strips around but they had a they would give the location the airstrip at the last moment and we have like a code name for it because if there were a lot of spies around and if the North found out they would come with their bombers they come and bomb the airstrip they were try to bond the plane on the ground or bomb the people that were trying to get in the plane to escape so all the stuff was top-secret a plane comes in and this look we come in we get we land we have we're taking off in ten minutes you better be at the airstrip waiting get your get your butts on the airplane we have to be out by ten ten minutes or else these guys look coming by and they do this at night I'm assuming no they did it early early in the morning okay cuz you can't you know there's no lights or anything from the nice tool and so it's it's all just by it by sight they've come early in the morning land and they were get out so you know all of our expats that were there with us they had all the knowledge

[00:29:08] I mean our anesthetist our lab person pharmacist the the nurses that were ward in charges the ones that were doing most of the work and doing the leadership they all decided to leave now did you all sit down together and have this sort of heart-to-heart which is each of you had to make a very difficult decision which is you feel committed to this work you're doing but now your life is it exponentially greater danger right so yeah we met with everybody we had a group talked we met individually and say look this plane is coming in this is the last plane that the diocese can send in this is it you know once once this plane comes and once it leaves you might never get out of here you know cuz you have no idea what's gonna happen the next day you don't know if the they're sitting armies going to overrun us this is last chance how did you think about that I mean was there a moment when you thought maybe I should leave and go back to Kenya or go to

[00:30:00] Uganda or go somewhere else I mean what was that thought process like right so you know I was encouraged to leave by some different people to look why don't you come out you stay in Kenya for a while then when things blow over then you can go back when it's safer I thought and I thought jeez you know first let me have no I just total chaos you have no idea what's gonna happen what I did know is that we were getting people wounded or all destruction was ever coming in all the time you know so

[00:30:27] I knew if I leave it's not like they can go somewhere else there were no other Hospital surgical capability okay there wasn't a single one there was no small husband nearby run by a German group they could do some impatient stuff and outpatient and some minor stuff but really if somebody needs a c-section or something more serious they they would just die okay and that says nothing of the casualties that are going to start coming in as a result of this right so all these people that came in that were wounded would just would just die a miserable death and I knew that so for me it was a very easy decision I thought you know there's no way I can in good conscience leave this place and go out it was a very very stark reality and to be honest where there was not a difficult decision I think the sisters that were there the two companies sisters I stayed the priests test day we all were of the same mind we all thought the same thing let's just stick it out we're here as missionaries let's do we're supposed to do and take care of the people the best we can and come what may we have faith in God we'll see what happens and it wasn't you know we didn't feel like it was some big thing it was just like well no it can't go you know we got we have stuff to do hearing and you know the other expat said look I've got a family I've got this I've got that and we said look we are not gonna hold it against anybody this has to be very individual decision if you guys want to go we'll find a way to keep going don't worry about it so I want to give them full latitude to leave in peace and not feel they're abandoning people there so I think everybody's pretty much at peace with decision next pass left and I mean sure enough they left June 16th and morning

[00:31:58] June 16th they left around 6:00 in the morning had to get out there early because they had to get the you know get this planning just get out of the place and we had to keep everything secret so all of our staff didn't know these guys were leaving we had to keep it a secret from everybody and they have been left and then the staff came to work at 7:30 and so you you had an anesthesiologist there was one of the people that left right so talk to me about 10 o'clock on that morning the first time or whatever the first surgical case comes in who's running anesthesia that was the biggest problem so these guys leave around 6:00 8:00 o'clock casuals you start rolling in people that were there's a bombing from one of the soviet air force plants called an Antonov that has barrel bombs they bombed in a location near us maybe an hour couple hours away we hear these in the film the heart of nuba right which we'll talk about in there in a few minutes but right so like two hours later all these mangled bodies start coming yeah we did describe what this try me so I did my training at in

[00:32:54] Baltimore in many ways trauma was a feature of the training program because if you're training in surgery you know one of my mentors said you know to be able to train in a place Hopkins is a great honor because you really get to understand surgical Anatomy in trauma and it's penetrating trauma in the United States is mostly gunshot wound and stab wounds mm-hmm but

[00:33:13] I have no idea what you were seeing so what explained to me what things you actually saw what types of injuries are you seeing right as this was very start because when Antonov bombs there are huge shards of metal I mean weighing you know ten pounds I've got a bunch of the scraps I have them as a souvenir

[00:33:33] Megan nuba so imagine a scrap of mail it weighs ten pounds red-hot just going through your body so it slices off legs slices up arms cuts through people with just massive tissue loss and massive trauma so I'm here one young lady she was 16 her name was a shelling which means Jerusalem in the Arabic and and her arm was just totally mangled I mean just shattered she came in her cousin came in his hand was his whole hand was blown off by the antonov shrapnel so these guys both need amputations the the girl we did a disarticulation on their shoulders so we had a couple of our on-the-job training IRS's there and they had done something they taught how to do spinal anesthetic by the in Estes so this moans they couldn't do GA further listener GA general anaesthetic meaning they couldn't intubate and put the patient fully too slowly and I I had never intubated a patient before I remember when I was in the military we intubated heading to make goats first part of our a TLS training I think if I remember but I never done it either it's like what the heck so I'm it was so afraid like I what I might do with these people you know so I remember reading the book we have a book they're kind of basic anesthesia book so I burn you through the protocols okay first give some ketamine you knock them out with that they go to sleep give it about your pain you give her succinylcholine to paralyze some intubate and you give pancuronium you have health estiga put the tubing's Baba this I intimated like okay okay let's let's do it so we took some his guys back and you know I would go and give the drug I had a nurse there yes okay give the ketamine you would push it in push the succinylcholine oh it intubate and I guess I should explain for the person listening this because we use these terms so commonly so intubation is a very important step where if you screw this up you're gonna kill a person litter you will kill them but you have to put a breathing tube into the endotracheal space so this is now to allow a machine to breathe for someone while they're under anesthesia and we do these things in medical school we did them in residency a lot of our critical care training required that but I have to tell you and I was not trained as an anesthesiologist I never intubated somebody without being incredibly nervous because it's so easy to put that tube accidentally into the esophagus and you think you're doing it right and all of a sudden you you know you get the tube in you hook it up to the ventilator you think everything's going well and but by the time you realize you're providing oxygen to their stomach instead of their lungs it can be too late right and then of course the panic that ensues is often what kills the patient right because you're getting you're getting nervous and then you can't do it you're starting to shake you know the problems my guy said before my training was Family Practice I did an internal medicine internship you know they feel me practice I never intubated somebody I never did ask these rotation in medical school that was not part of our training at all so I was very green with this anyway by the grace of God managed to get the patient intubated connected the help we have a really primitive the structure had called an om

[00:36:29] V Oxford miniature ventilator it's got a set of bellows it's like turn-of-the-century kind of stuff it's one of the 20th century so you know intubating sew it to manual ventilation for the patient we wear throughout the whole surgery yeah for the whole surgery as long as I paralyze you got like you've gotta ventilate manually usually with the hell of thing after you manually ventilate for about 20 minutes they can breathe on their own and it's a bit of an art to try to keep them under enough where they can breathe in their own but they're not in pain so it's a big art to this kind of a work but it's all manual I just have to go off on a tangent for a moment which perhaps only the people listening to this who have medical training will appreciate what you're saying I'm guessing you don't have blood gases no okay so you can't measure a patient's pao2 or paco2 and yet your anesthetist has to figure out how to ventilate which again means how much oxygen the person needs and how much co2 you take off and if you screw either of those two up you will kill someone right and if you told me to walk into Mass

[00:37:32] General or NYU or pick your favorite Hospital and said Peter we're gonna do everything for you we're gonna intubate the patient we're gonna do this all you have to do is be the guy that manually ventilates them I wouldn't be able to do that like I would I would overdo it or under do it there's no way you'd hit that sweet spot yeah you'd cause an alkalosis acid oh you would just and then to be able to not have the laboratory tools to know when you're off the rails yeah those days we didn't have a pulse ox now we have a pulse oximeter which can measure the procedure oxygen saturation alliterations blood that time we had no pulse ox some of the stuff maybe ignorance is bliss because you can't measure it so you just hope and pray that things are going okay but manage to get the guy in today I mean you couldn't do veterinary medicine like this in the United States right you know you know it was pretty hairy we managed to get through and this one out we eventually got in a nest has to come this was after about a month or two well in and in that month or two what types of casualties did you see oh

[00:38:29] I mean everything abdominal trauma lots of electrum we did a number of general anesthetics during that time we had a baby that came in with interception this was the worst case was a nine month old baby who came in who had an interception which is kind of an intestinal yeah explain what that looks like the telescoping right so an interception is when the intestine telescopes on itself and basically causes a blockage of the intestine and then when the longer you delay that intestine can die and the person will die of the baby will die from from an infection and we made the diagnosis I'm just like oh God you know we supposed to do with this kid you know so anyway we we take the baby that were him I said we got to try something so I mean to baiting an adult is hard baby is really really hard can we manage to get the kid intubated so I didn't pay the baby started on the ventilated telothane went out scrubbed for the case came back we opened the baby up did a bowel resection put it back together close baby up and he did great he's how does it baby now he's like baby he's eight years old now eight nine years old species cruising but that's kind of one of the many miracles and when using bits of shrapnel are going through people I mean you're seeing liver lacerations you're seeing bowel injuries right he new authorities head trauma I mean give me a sense of the mortality there are some cases that obviously just can't be saved right well you know tell you Peter well I think what happens sometimes people say why do you have so many extremity traumas because they're the ones that make it in and let's survive yeah so you know the ones that get a really terrible trapping with the chest they bleed out in the field there's were you know we're six hours sometimes these patients come a day we've had people with penetrating abdominal trauma with multiple holes their intestines come three four days afterwards and survive so imagine that you're making feces into the abdomen for three or four days so imagine how strong these people are and they come and it's just a mess and you open them up and and some of them pull through you know anemic dehydrated they haven't eaten in several days and these guys can survive so some of it is that people are just tough as nails but we had a lot of penetrating I mean kidneys get torn to shreds liver lacks massive kidney trauma

[00:40:40] Liberto mer one guy had we counted he had 23 holes in his intestines that we had a you know resect here respect their stitch this one just took forever how did you learn surgery right so you know I trained in Family Practice and when I went to Kenya we're doing a lot of you know tons of Tropical Medicine a lot of obstetric care that a lot of c-sections but I realized a lot of the disease burden in Africa was surgically related a lot of it I mean a lot of it courses tropical medicine like okay do all those things and say well a good team like half of what we were saying was surgically related either just wound care miscarriages laparotomies imputations kind of run-of-the-mill kind of surgical stuff there's a lot of it so

[00:41:24] I thought I really need to learn how to do this stuff how about if I'm gonna stay here long term so luckily where I've been made both rural Kenya and I Roby I met up with people that were willing to teach me things so really I was like doing another residency I mean I would throws in there we had a whole day in the operating room and we do tons of cases and there was an American missionary doctor there they might

[00:41:43] Johnson so I'm like we just sit there and teach me stuff you know I would do it just like you did in residency I would do the case he would assist me and just kind of walk me through it there was a Kenyan surgeon there dr. Rocha was a vent like who's like a magician he was not so hands-on but if he was always so he was there in the operating room he would say go ahead inside the case I forgot a little bit of experience we start the case if it problems call me so I start open up look around a bit say okay I'm stuck what am I knew he'd come in look around say I do this do that I do this and that and things would go ahead before you know what you're doing thyroids and laparotomies and resecting bowel and stitching liver and taking kidneys about doing amputations and I mean you know it is you just kind of once you learn a few you have a few skills you can add the next case the next one the next one then I mean it took I was there for seven half years in

[00:42:29] Kenya it was like doing other residency I mean at some point though you have to be making mistakes that are harming patients because even in our and I say that not being critical right but just saying like that's the nature of medicine I mean I I think of every time I hurt somebody even you know I once causing a hemopneumothorax in a patient when I put a central line in them it was my 500th central line so at this point you'd think I could do it blindfolded and yet - cause that complication which in my case I'm lucky enough to have an x-ray to see that I've caused this complication you don't even I mean you're missing so many of the basic tools that could act as sort of a safety net so what was that process like I think what I wanted to make sure of when I was in Kenya I think those whole seven half years I was in

[00:43:14] Kenya I always had either somebody assisting me in the case or somebody in the room or in the next room over so I think I was pretty well covered during that time and by the time I was finished seven half years I felt pretty confident I gonna do a new surgery I think it's this concept you know better than I do about 10,000 hours you know and I think in residency act like a thousand cases this was like a thousand cases at least like that's like a minimum maybe 1200 or something yeah so I did you know but time I finished my time in Kenya I'd been bit for you it's harder because you're doing a breadth of cases that I like even if you took something as broad as general surgery I mean you were still doing basically orthopedic surgery as well and obstetrics right yeah this looks a lot of urology there's a mix and

[00:44:00] I think maybe the trade-off is the surgery in Africa is much broader but less depth like we don't have any leper scopic stuff so have any of the DaVinci yeah it's an OLED and all this high-tech stuff you trade off kind of depth of surgery for breath I felt after doing around 2000 c-sections in over a thousand other major cases I felt okay I think I can do whatever we're doing in that Roby I can do that I think safely in Sudan I mean obviously you know we have complications and other problems and there are a lot of limitations in terms of going into the case so you tend to do more laparotomies because you don't have a

[00:44:38] Doug you don't have a CT scanner right no CT scanner you don't exactly what's going on to get a tissue diagnosis might take you six months so you say go hey let's do a laparotomy and see what that thing is that's that's your CT scan in the end but that's about the best you can do so I think what I always what I try to do when I approach a case is you know the premium no known chariot first do no harm so if you think you'll make the patient worse by doing this like okay I'm not an expert at doing this case and sometimes I say I'm not gonna do it you know I won't I won't do it up if I think I really cannot improve this patient's health I think okay this is too much of a risk sometimes hey look I just I'm not really a couple of doing this but usually Alphaeus okay I think it's better if we try do this operation

[00:45:19] I think we can repay she can improve and we'll go ahead and it works I mean normally works out pretty well I was talking with my wife and my daughter a couple days ago and about how we were gonna be speaking today and they had so many questions you know we all watched the heart of nuba together and one of the questions my wife had was how do you deal with exactly that type of situation you described which is what we would consider quote unquote end of life here in the United States or palliative care what do you do in a situation where somebody comes in and your judgement says this person is not an operative candidate mm-hmm but also by not operating they need to be palliated I mean they're not going to they're not selling you know they're gonna walk home how do you deal with that and more importantly I guess then medically how you deal with that it's emotionally and how is that communicated to the community because you're still a foreigner right right right I'm still a foreign and will always be one so I would say we first started 10 years ago people did not trust us and it was incredibly nerve-racking something we just got here people to kind of have this because they've been these people have been traumatized and oppressed for so many years then I can trust some foreigner showing up saying he's there to help him so you kind of prove yourself something well you know what I'm doing these operations what if we have better outcomes you know what happens so it was really nerve-wracking for all of us and you know thank God things went pretty well we went ahead so the issue with palliative care you know we try to just talk to the family talk to the patient's they look think we can't do much for you and a certificate home will take care of the pain and other things we can do one good thing there is the people their expectations are extremely are low and I must say that negative I'm saying in a positive way they don't expect they don't really expect miracles they want to be treated as a human they want that human touch they want to talk to us and talk to you and say okay what can we do if you tell them look like we can't do much they're not they're not saying they're not like if demand they're not very demanding saying no you got to forget it send me to Nairobi for a second opinion they're very accepting I think that's just because of their lives are very hard they're not used to good outcomes so I think first off they're very accepting so when you tell them look I think there's not much what we can do we often will talk to the relatives culturally relatives will say well just you know they don't they don't like telling the patient which is very different from here in the US so we just talked with relatives they're usually very accepting they say okay we you know if we see a dumped you can well thing we'll take them home become comfortable there they have some of their local traditional things they might try with the person at home but usually very accepting of negative outcomes or bad news when you're kind of at the edge of survival all the time when you get this kind of bad news it's not so shocking who it's like well yeah that's what happens people die you know and people have been outcomes bad things happen to you so it's not so unusual for them you know in the u.s. work of anesthetize that everything has to be perfect and we're not supposed to die we're supposed to you know I have this kind of outlook on life it's it's a very different way of doing things so they're fairly easy in that respect they understand this stuff you know most people have some level of faith whether Christian or

[00:48:27] Muslim they can accept this stuff in a theological sense also it's not so difficult when you showed up how primitive was is the extent to which people were receiving I don't know what how to describe the type of care but there must have been local traditions and shaman and stuff like that right right and at some point you're showing up and you're coming from a place of science as sort of simple as you described your work in medicine it is still grounded in the fundamental principles of Western medicine and you use antibiotics for example you wash your hands before you operate what was the landscape like as far as the other types of Medicine being practiced and are they still being practiced now yeah they're still being practiced so their scope of Medicine you have kind of the local level in the home and what they'll do is almost any febrile illness so some kids got a favor someone's got a fever they burn the person so that everybody there my wife included they have burn marks they look like cigarette burns they're not cigarettes but they take a rounded thing it's putting the fire and they burned on the back of the wrist back of the neck and the elbows there are certain points where they burn that burn the person to try to release the the whatever it is the spirit or the spirit of evil humors that are causing the problem when they see that kind of smoke and they see the fat and reduce skin burning they feel relief okay the other thing is gone now I'm better so they burned they cut a lot of people have cut marks in their arms or in abdomens where they think that there's I think that also release things they cut down to have caused some blood loss that'll relieve some of the release some of the problem and that's what you'd done in the home usually by the father or the mother of the grandparents we'll do that kind of thing that's kind of a local treatment that is still still practice less so than when we came I would say I mean everybody all of our staff have burn marks from that when they were kids now we still see patients come with the burn marks um it comes with with a symbol area they'd been at home for days they've been roasting the kid it's like why you know just give us a chance anyway so burning cutting this one level they do have some herbal remedies that don't seem that prevalent they were there I think traditionally some people still use those and I don't know you know some day they still swear by it if you use the name tree or this

[00:50:37] Kayla this plant that they use for malaria they still swear that that thing works for the for that a lot of kind of local fruits and vegetables they use for for GI problems other things and those seem to work okay and the third level is the what's called the code your code your is like a conical shaman and the code your is like the priest for the for the village the traditional legendary is ancestor kind of ancestor worship this gives communion with the with the ancestors so if you're sick if you have a problem whether it's physical psychological whatever you go to the core or you have a little ceremony with the family I'll get together kajoor will talk with your ancestors and then kind of give a report back saying well your kid is sick because you your ghosts wandered on this guy's land innate his crops so you need to make up with this guy when you go and give him something and then you pay the code you or something and then this thing is kind of lifted child should get better those three things are kind of traditional treatment the coder is still very very prevalent in the society and they still often go to the kajoor and they still will often delay treatment when they go to court so how many people does your hospital serve catchment area is roughly a million anywhere from seventy five thousand to a million people is in our catchment area and the physical region is around the size of Austria somewhere and that in that range the people there

[00:51:59] I for example how many of the people that you serve would understand what you meant if you were going to New York like how big is their world well it's it's interesting you ask that I mean even the ones that have finished secondary school wouldn't have an idea look if they ended up here or I mean it'd be it would blow their mind maybe

[00:52:21] I'll give an example my mother-in-law is probably her 70s so we went to talk to my wife was talking about writing a book actually she started writing her book and we went to my mother-in-law and we said let's go and interview her mother as part of your book you know I can write on it about her life my wife didn't actually know a lot of facts about her mother cuz they don't have that you know mothers and daughters there are not like buddy-buddy you know the girls are you know once they once they get weaned from the breasts they start working carrying water and firewood everything else in cooking for the family so we went to talk to her mom and my wife asked her mother her mother only spaced the tribal language he doesn't speak Arabic or English or anything else so we talked see she's talking on the tribal language saying do you know where tom is from and she said she thought for me she says he's from Kenya and she said the furthest place we can imagine right because she's heard of Kenya so in her mind anybody was not from nuuma mountains must be from Kenya doesn't matter who we are you know so that's the outside world and we say well now he's from America I ever heard of America no she never heard of it had no concept of

[00:53:23] America ever you know what an ocean is no cost of an ocean no concept of a lake no concept of Africa she didn't know she was in Africa so what she knew was her local area it's just a few of the villages there she'd been to Khartoum once she's my wife's mother has leprosy we've treated her for leprosy and have amputated I think Oliver fingers at one point other she's really quite disabled she owned the Khartoum some years previously to get treatment there and end up not getting treated but besides that brief trip to Khartoum she'd never been out of that local area a lot of my wife siblings have never been out of this 15 square mile radius you can't imagine the worldview presumably your wife also hadn't experienced things outside of that until she met you and what was the first time she left or traveled with you or the first time you've been especially that you don't travel much right so the first time we travel was after we met was just this past June we went to Armenia so I was really her first time out of rural Africa she been in g1 nursing school but that was the South Sudan in a while which is I mean for for South

[00:54:26] Sudanese that they call it a city but it's it's a village you know it's a big village so imagine we went from went from your FGM camp down to Juba which is the capital I mean you was more or less a city but it's really not very nice then we fly from Juba to Dubai and we were in the Dubai Airport I mean which which I was just there a month ago even for someone who's from the United States the Dubai Airport is an overwhelming yeah it's I mean it's it's terrifyingly huge it's a city

[00:54:54] I'm yes it's a major city so we get there and her eyes are the size of saucers has she seen that much electricity in one place no I mean not even close not even close has she seen fresh water to that extent I know I mean I predict if she's ever seen it a tap no we had taps in the hospital we have a pump that pumps water up we have some taps in the hospital but you know flush toilets or you should never seen before but all this stuff's elevators elevator so that was one of things we get in there we're at the airport we get in this you know pressure button this door opens you get this thing and pressing the button then the thing goes up and we got off she's like what was that so no concept an elevator we got in the escalator and she's like fallen over the place we go to get off the escalator she's like what it the house I was this thing moving I think where she was a nurse is going wow I think they had one set of stairs there might have been a second floor but just the concept of walking up stairs is something strange little moving staircase so all these things were very new to her now we get to Armenia and I mean just being in a city I mean the Irvine has a couple of Armenians not like New York but very different experience for her now she came to the US for the first time just this past October and I mean she was in Time Square I saw the ocean for the first time she went to my brother lives in near Boston a North

[00:56:12] Shore of Boston so that was the first place we went the first place she went to went to Boston and our hospital was getting an award by a group called medicines for Humanity which supports us and they were giving us award for the work that our outreach team is doing so nobody could make it you know I couldn't go my you know other staff couldn't go so my wife went to accept the award on behalf of the staff so she lands in

[00:56:35] Boston and the first thing she does is goes to the Harvard club think at this ward it's very opulent place right because my brother's place he's up in Rockport Massachusetts this is the ocean for the first time he's a train for the first time goes to malls to Walmart you know she loved the dollar store and you know my family just went went crazy with her they had so much fun being with her you know seeing all these things for the first time through her eyes and I mean she's very has a very common fetes joy to her and they really kind of tapped into that and it was really and the flip side of that is we can sit here and have this discussion and of course most of us would be thinking how amazing and all the things that they don't have but I'll share with you a story that I suspect will resonate and you will understand it this past Christmas my daughter's school each grade picks something they're going to do and that grade decided that they were going to buy Christmas presents for all of the kids at the Sudanese Community

[00:57:38] Center in San Diego and so they're basically all refugees and this was very interesting because we had already watched the heart of nuba which was her first time even she didn't know what Sudan was and she certainly didn't understand why there would be refugees leaving this place so on the day that we take all the presents there and the kids have done an amazing job right they've bought like four or five presents for each and every kid there and we spend the whole day there so we go it's um it's my whole family so it's me my wife three kids and our youngest is like a year and a half old so there's another little kid there a Sudanese girl who's also about the same age so the two of them are playing together but you know you feel like you got to sort of keep an eye on them because they can fall off the stairs or hurt themselves so there's a woman that's holding the Sudanese girl and she's sort of keeping an eye on our son as well and so that gives us time to go and do these other things and see the other kids and do all the other stuff and about four or five hours later when we're leaving my wife goes over to the woman who's has been holding this little

[00:58:40] Sudanese girl the whole time and says um what's your daughter's name and she says oh I don't know this is not my daughter I don't I don't even know whose kid this is basically and and we couldn't stop talking about that right which was talk about a different sense of community yeah right there was nothing odd to this woman who was probably 22 just say hey there's like this little 18 month old running around I'm gonna take care of her and and by the way like she's taking care of our kid right and so for as many things as they lack right they have something we don't have right that that types in the Peter is something you always hear about the negative side of place like stirred and people think of sitting where the images war poverty disease starving kids the positive side is not shown and something's always stick in my mind one is will have patients that will come to us that it's a seven or eight day walk to reach us and on the way like they'll start their journey you start walking now the night time comes in the society there you can stop in somebody's Hut and it's not you know just kind of knocking the whatever or just show up and say like I'm going you know I've got a long journey would you mind a place if I kind of spend the night with you I don't know we're state so that family would take this person in total stranger even place to sleep give him food get some water for them to wash take care of that night the next day he'll continue his journey next day stop it at the total strangers place that strange will take this person in give him some food hang out this next day same thing until they reached the hospital and this is the normal way of doing things there the concept of community and what stuff belongs to you what is a stranger totally different and our outlook here so when you're there like well jeez who's really really has it all you know who's doing the right thing which society is on the right track you know it's really it's really mind-blowing well especially for you because I guess it's one thing to know nothing that but but you've seen both worlds and I've read enough about you to know I've seen enough interviews to know

[01:00:47] I mean correct me if I'm wrong but you've described being more at home there than anywhere else right which I have to admit you know Tom when I watch the videos of that the first thought that comes to my mind is not I wish I was there I realize that probably just speaks to me being sort of a vapid shallow person but if I'm gonna be brutally honest right I don't look at that and think I want to be there right

[01:01:13] I think I would never want to give up my family I would never want to give up my comfort my safety my whatever you couldn't fake it I mean so it's it's obviously so genuine for you and and any you know the other people like John who are serving as missionaries there I know that on some level you'll say the answer is faith but there must be more to it than than simply your faith well you know some of it Peter I think is just I think everybody is kind of geared a bit differently so you know we grew up in a big family and you know my brothers could never could ever be there at the same time I could not do what they're doing so I think I think all of us are really were kind of wired a bit differently even people in the same family so I think I'm very comfortable there but maybe fit working in New York you know but I think the good thing is I don't attach of value till this like everybody has something to contribute I really I really believe that it's not just kind of blowing smoke my thing is is being there to a mountains you know what's up it's part of the puzzle somebody else might be in New York but you're doing a podcast you're helping us in new book tremendously like helping get the message out you know if you're in Sudan doing the same work I'm doing we don't have this you know so I think everybody has something to offer and if we try to get in this thinking like gosh I'm not doing what he's doing I should be doing he's doing I think we missed the point we miss out on our shared abilities you've got unbelievable talents and a brain twice the size of mine and you're using it in an area that you are comfortable with that is probably maximizing your abilities I think it's good to be aware of what's going on in the world and everybody should think about their brothers and sisters elsewhere and contribute and do something to help other people at the same time don't don't spend too much time stressing that you're not doing enough for anything do something but it shouldn't be something which is agonizingly painful you know I think just the way I'm geared that kind of life is a pretty comfortable fit for me you know so I don't see it yeah it's a sacrifice it is and I miss the family like crazy and I'm missing a lot not being with my spend more than three years I've come here missing my parents my nieces nephews my brothers my sister

[01:03:27] I do I miss all this stuff but I'm pretty comfortable in that and that weird remote setting any of the mountains so I learned about you through my really dear friend Rick curse and his brother Mark Gerson and ultimately met John and and and I think they learned about you through a piece that Nick Kristof wrote in The New York Times in 2015 how did Nick come to find you because that story we're gonna link to that story the story is amazing right it leads off with about a ten minute video that I watched over and over and over again and I came home and I made my family watch it and I sent it to my family back home and there's a part in it that just says everything about it I mean first of all I think Christoph did an amazing job framing the story and he was there which is in and of itself I want to actually understand how someone actually gets there because that's that's that strikes me as quite a challenge logistically but he ends the article with a story of a Muslim man who proclaims that you are Jesus Christ and

[01:04:35] I always that the title of the article if I'm not mistaken he's Jesus Christ which coming from a Muslim man also speaks to the religious harmony that you've described right and for people like me who aren't especially religious it makes you think well I guess that's what religion should be about right it shouldn't be about most of what we think of religion as religion has its taboos here but I think the point Christophe makes and makes it beautifully is if you want to be critical of all of the religious hypocrisy by all means do so but you can't then fail to acknowledge the times when in the name of religion people are doing these incredible things in the name of all religions by the way it's not just your religion I mean as you know it's it's people of all faiths that are doing these things but in many ways I think that story brought amazing attention to your work that it breaks my heart to think are there other Tom's out there whose stories are not being told so how did

[01:05:28] Krista find you or how did you guys find each other he has an interest in Sudan I think he's had it for a number of years and I think for him he saw this what he was doing as such an egregious affront to humanity then he felt obligated to go and see firsthand what's happening so he made a couple trips into the mountains you could fly into Juba then he got a flight up the refugee camp and either then managed to come into new bones you know you don't come in with official permission of the student government so you're sneaking in to risk he's sneaking and you get a permit from the rebel government and they allow you to come in and I think he just has an interest in that in that part of the world and really wanted to do something that shed light on the situation there against

[01:06:07] Bashir and he bent it to nuba I think one previous time and heard about the hospital when they come and see us there and see what kind of work we were doing to see for himself and was here for a few days he's he's a Romney's a really intrepid traveler an incredible journalist I mean he's unbelievable and what I respect about him the most is he can disagree with you like you know whether it whatever religiously politically not agree with your beliefs but he can realize what you're doing has benefit you can look at it objectively and say okay you know I don't believe in this religion but I see what these guys are doing and highlight that you know not many people are willing to do that I thought it was very elegant how he framed that in in that piece in the New

[01:06:47] York Times and that video though it's only about 10 minutes that was really my first introduction to you god it's about three and a half years ago now right so the world's a better place certainly the Nuba Mountains are a better place because of Nicholas's work right and he tends to highlight people that are kind of not not well-known and there are others that are out there it's actually part of what we're trying to now with Aurora

[01:07:10] I'm always focuses on is on highlighting what they say is unsung heroes but people that are kind of operating in the weeds that nobody knows about so try a bit a spotlight on them not so much for publicity but to help them both in their in their work and to raise by raising their profile you raise the issues that they're involved with so tell people a little bit about what the Aurora prize is and what it means for you to now be your the 2018 recipient is that right 2017 2017 recipient so what is the Aurora prize I know it's based on I know a few things about it so I'll fill in the little bits that I know it's a prize that has a finite life correct it was I began in 2015 or 16 and it will run until about 20 22 23 and that duration if I recall is meant to commemorate the length of the Armenian Genocide in 1911 ish 1915 well it's a hundred years onward the genocide went on for about eight years okay 1915 in 1923 so this is honey hundred years henceforth those eight years that's the those eight years there were prize will be given out yes and it's a it's a substantial prize you were selected and my understanding is first of all it takes an act of Congress to get you out of nuba be doing this other work but it speaks to I think your understanding of how valuable this will be to the broader mission that you're serving right what I saw was I'm very comfortable being in nuba and doing the everyday medical work and I definitely want to go back to that environment longer-term and get involved more with teaching the local people and when these guys once these guys come back from medical school that we have out there really working with them to get their skills up but I thought maybe using or as a vehicle it was time to come out to kind of see what was out there with Aurora to try to expand the model that we have into the mountains so find a way to bridge the gap between say big donors or people that have resources and small organizations small people on the ground that are kind of doing a lot of the grassroots work and doing it very efficiently because I think there are a lot of other people that are doing the work nobody knows about and there should be a way to try to connect them to resources so through Aurora that's one of my main goals I wanted to come out and try to explain were doing I felt that was we're in Dubai doing our thing but maybe a little bit pigeon-holed how do we expand that and get outside of

[01:09:30] Nome but get into South Sudan to Center up from Republic to Chad Tunisia or other places which are really neglected parts of the world hopefully into some conflict zones that was my main thinking coming out and my time now I've got three months out of the mountains I'm traveling all over the place speaking on behalf of Aurora kind of doing some basic assumption for them but also meeting a lot of people trying to formulate which direction we need to go in Aurora so me physically out for these three months there'll be three months later in the year from September through

[01:10:00] November besides those two or three-month periods I'll be back in the mountains do my usual work at the hospital what does more money solve in this problem I remember recently mark sent us an update about sort of where the dollars were going and it was sort of hard to believe that so much could be done with so little and I I don't think the stats are I think they're so overwhelming that it's almost hard to put it in context but it's worth trying for about a million dollars as an annual budget what what have you been able to do and they've in the past year a million dollars is is pretty generous that's probably more than we need for the basic work but let's save as a million dollars we can we can see about 130,000 outpatients 130,000 or 30,000 now patients do close to 2,000 operations see maybe five six thousand inpatients let me vaccinate tens of thousands of children see had a guy I'm not sure what numbers of Maternity anti no clinic patients but a lot several thousand eternity patients for that a lot of that million dollars I mean most of that what gosh I think it I mean the number that comes that I used is about 750 thousand but somewhere between seventy thousand a million if I'm be conservative if someone gave us two million bucks we could easily run the hospital for a year and probably expand expand quite a bit what we're already doing that we very a very generous amount of money for us for one year which is very interesting anyone listening to this who has some understanding of the economics of the US healthcare system would find everything you just said to be sort of comical because of just the costs here are so artificial and so inflated and so ridiculous yeah now when you think about where those dollars go I mean how do you get these supplies how I mean where do these things come from I I remember once asking I knew somebody who was I think on the board of Doctors Without Borders and I said hey how come you guys aren't in Sudan you know cuz I remember once reading you guys couldn't even get certain vaccines and antibiotics you just physically couldn't get the supplies right so you're really doing the work that nobody else can do here yeah it's it's tricky I mean our number one problem when people say what's your biggest problem there is a logistics it's the hardest thing because you don't have infrastructure infrastructure is not there and if we want anything you want chemotherapy drugs you want antibiotics you want a roll of gauze you've got to buy that in Nairobi there were these two countries away it's South

[01:12:26] Sudan and Kenya so it's got to come from Nairobi like this past shipment of drugs came from there we biked by a truck up to actually three Uganda up to the border with South Sudan where they just harassed the heck out of the other drivers and all kinds of ride the guards you've got to bribe the guards and they give you a hard time and they won't like they don't want you going through and they say no it's so they're always changing the rules you know see I know there's a duty you gotta have all this paperwork I mean just reams of paperwork to get this stuff through so we've got some people that are in Juba don't I should work for us but work for the church the through all this process to get this truck through now from there there are I don't know 30 or 40 checkpoints from the border of Uganda and South Sudan up to the refugee camp Anita and it takes a few weeks think about three weeks to get up there just because of the checkpoints and the delays and everything else you can take three weeks to get up to this

[01:13:19] Rivage you can't Bonita then from there it's offloaded we've got to go and pick it up we've got to find a way to get it from eda up to our place wait wait not you personally no not me personally but we've got to get some trucks or something to go down there and pick it up or find someone that can carry it up and carry it for us from and that's that's about six I feel most six hours it's not really a road it's a dirt track

[01:13:42] I mean there are roads there is these terrible dirt tracks you get from eat up to where we are that's about six hours in the best day just through the dry season so rainy season which runs from about June through October you can't go with the trucks you can't really even go with the like a Land Cruiser usually we don't we don't move at all if you really had to get in or out at that time you've got to go with a quad bike and that can use you get you in route but sometimes even then if it's a flesh it was a heavy rainfall you have a flash flooding the be some dry riverbeds that fills up with water you gotta wait maybe it the way today a few hours so in the hospital on any given day how much do you have in terms of IV fluids gauze antibiotics soap right I mean things that we just we can't even imagine not taking for granted in an American Hospital right I mean if we have if this truck makes it through because make our order and we make it fairly generous order just cuz we know it's so difficult to get stuff out there if that stuff makes it all through we're in pretty good shape for how long for a year so we try to make it one full year on that supply that gets sent in and the problem comes because sometimes you order stuff in that Roby and it's not in stock and you know you just can't you can't order one-off things there's no there's no system to get stuff up to us that's really hard if you can't load everything on that truck for this one go we're a bit stuck we've got to really be creative trying to get these other smaller things oh is there like a chief logistics officer that is in charge of the ordering and the procurement and the management of this prop because that sounds like a

[01:15:15] I mean that's a that's a bottleneck yeah it's it's a terrible job so John Fielder through F Commission health care has a woman who's in his all he's gotten off as small of us in I probably got a few staff so she did all of our procurement so we sent her the list of things we needed it's it's it's a lot of items a lot so she does go out and source all this stuff and get it in Nairobi hmm a few different vendors get the trucks or or less stuff get it through we've got a couple people in Juba that help us with logistics and uh employees of ours but they're just kind of they're helping us out just kind of random people and they can help Shepherd that stuff through but it's is it's really really difficult it's a lot of work for those people what does the pattern of mortality look like in no but my guess is infant mortality must still be quite high right how much of that is due to challenges with prenatal care versus the actual deliveries and then postnatal care I think a lot of the neonatal deaths are just from difficult deliveries you know that there may be ice has fixated babies born and dies there is a stillborn or died soon after birth and there very few deliveries done I mean 99% of women there's deliver at home deliver in a clinic with maybe attritional birth attendant is rare let alone in a hospital so I think a lot of it is just due to you know most of those people probably end up in a season with a c-section if they are at a hospital the

[01:16:41] US or even in Kenya if it access to care or they wouldn't the c-section here's you know we have one place to ensue sections are actually two now that's how many how many babies do you deliver in a typical year I think there are maybe three or four hundred in our hospital somewhere on there like we came with the exact number so it's it's you know it's really it's not it's a very small number compared to number of deliveries so the vast majority of women still deliver at home and but you're doing presumably more of the high-risk ones I mean if a child is breached is there can you deliver a breech baby at home that's saying the risk would be enormous right some make it out but a lot of those babies are gonna die yeah because they just get they get stuck they gets fixated and maybe dies so I mean when we do our antenatal clinic you know these women will come and they the midwife there fills the card out for him so okay they've had 10 deliveries and for living children you know this one died at birth this one's out at birth this one die from diarrhea has been died from fever you know this kind of thing so there's a lot of and what about the mothers what what is the maternal mortality like I don't know and that's something I really wish I could have a grip on because you hear occasionally you know we don't it's not it's not that often we hear about it but what's my hurry yeah this woman died from she bled to death you know after you giving birth to the baby at some remote village there's not really where it's so remote and people are so spread out there's not really a system to collect that kind of information so I don't really know it's got to be it's got to happen because you know we have a lot of women that we end up doing c-sections on that would have died without that yeah you know they've you know how many times the baby is stuck well there's already septic and you know we have to do a c-section or something and this says nothing of preeclampsia and all of the other things that would just show up even under the most normal you know circumstance right and getting one with eclampsia is not uncommon so if you get clamps you at home especially young muslim are primates that are very young they're not gonna survive when they start convulsing and to get to us is a chore and it's really hard to reach us what are the patterns of diseases like there I mean when we're watching and again I keep mentioning this because it's just such an important film the heart of nuba you see these things that you're doing Tom that just I mean they blow my mind and maybe because I know enough about medicine that I can watch what you're doing and appreciate you know the partial nephrectomy as you're doing on kids with you know tumors in their kidneys and like how did you even learn to do that operation even within the realm of surgery that's not a trivial operation to do on a child that size yeah I'd done some the freken's before totally rectum is on for tumors or for trauma or for whatever so it meaning removed the whole kit we whole kidney so I wasn't so worried about that but I was worried about was the other it's harder to take part of the kidney out because you have to be able to preserve the blood flow to the part that remains right and you know they can bleed that so if it was just a a tumor was partially involved in the kidney and say you're doing the operation and you can't stop the bleeding your backup is just take the whole thing out but you couldn't do that in this case cuz this child had one kidney that had to fully come out and then there was a partial note so you basically kid would die if you couldn't save half of the remaining kidney right exactly so it was a lower the tumor was in the lower Pole that kidney so we had to take out half the kidney so there's a visiting actually a visiting as the front who was visiting he's a family practice doctor Cory Chapman was there and we're talking with this case and going back and forth and he said let's look on youtube if there's something I read reading about it everything I was reading was talking about all these fancy things you know there's some kind of a slush like a nice slush that you have to bathe the kidney in to get the metabolism way down so you do the operation just different things we didn't have so we looked on YouTube and

[01:20:18] I'm just when I think about it now I wonder how we did it because don't we can't watch YouTube there because we have internet we have a satellite dish Internet but the speed is very very slow so nobody can't watch any videos because it's just too it's just too slow but for some reason you were able to see this video and it was this group of Polish surgeons that were doing a partial nephrectomy and with a fairly low tech approach so we watched that so okay I think I think I can do it phone what these guys are advising we kind of followed their system managed to put these sort of buttresses like on the lower poll that kid need the kind of staunch the bleeding and it worked in the the kinda child is very well that was helped by YouTube he's I think they really helped us out like the Khan

[01:20:59] Academy of surgery that's right how long do you spend rounding I mean how many inpatient beds do you have in this hospital it has 435 beds and and what's your typical capacity I mean your typical utilization how many patients are in there I mean it's it's about a hundred percent occupancy it's it's a bit less now than it was saying the peak of the fighting when the peak of the fighting it was crazy be five five hundred people there 550 so there were several children were settle to a bed we had wounded all over the place I mean not even in beds just wherever we could we could fit him it looks like when you see movies in war zones yeah and you see the tents that are serving as you know hospitals and you just see amputation nose completely missing you know sort of the most gruesome things that's what it looks like you're in I mean you are literally in a war zone right I'm thinking back to residency if we head to round on 20 patience in the morning we were moaning and groaning like it was gonna be the end of the oh my god I'm not gonna have time for breakfast today before the ORR

[01:22:04] I've got around on 24 patients yeah so you're rounding on 300 patients I mean how do you know how you do that now probably 300 those days was more I mean I remember one time we had this measles epidemic and just on Children's Ward we had 225 patients so 100 or more cases malarious bowel obstructions you don't have vaccines I'm guessing is that the reason they don't get the measles we were the first three years of the fighting we didn't have them so the usual provider stopped providing them usual big organization that provides them stop providing the vaccines why I mean just logistically couldn't get them in logistical e and they we were in rebel-held territory and a lot of these people big organizations don't want to violate the sovereignty of the of the host government by providing as something as symbols of vaccines this is just how it is which we really shocked me the sovereignty of a government that kills its own people it needs to be respected it's the theater of the absurd it's crazy so yummy runts were just it would take hours and we started a 7:30 in the morning and two o'clock I'd be finishing up and just try to get through all those people but then you're being interrupted every hour by some trauma that comes in because right there's stuff coming in there's stuff there's other emergencies I mean the other stuff was still coming I mean somebody comes into a woman comes in who's having miscarriages bleeding we have to break into a c-section on somebody who can't deliver so all this stuff was still going on it was it was pretty crazy I mean it was it really had to just go as fast as you could and it was a lot of just putting out fires more we weren't able to spend a lot of time with each patient obviously it was really got to go pretty rapid-fire through all those cases it was exhausting psychologically it was it was rough one of the other questions my daughter wanted me to ask you is what's the most afraid you've ever been there you know she was sort of taken aback and we told her before the movie I said look Olivia this is this isn't a Disney movie you're gonna see people getting killed you're gonna see bombs dropping on innocent people and it's not a movie it's real right so are there times when you are just afraid for your own safety yeah you know I think every time they bombed the hospital twice and they bombed our local region come within 1/2 kilometer several times so the first time area was bombed or we were at church and the church was just outdoors it's not relators kind of outdoors thing and we're finishing up and the the catechist was up there talking to people and we heard they are plane overhead we were used to it cuz every day the airplane came overhead but we've never been or immediate vicinity everybody ever bumped so we just got yet because overhead it's gonna bomb somewhere and is that because you had this belief that said even these people as wicked as they are wouldn't actually bomb a hospital or is there some sort of you of will respect at least one sanctity of life so that was that was the bending back of our minds and we had him in Bamiyan this was this was a couple years into it all right we had him in bomb directly there weren't commercial flight so anytime you heard an airplane it was going to bomb somewhere and then we hear the we heard they're playing then invariably a few hours later one day would show up a bomb somewhere and people were wounded in the when they show up this day it was a bit different we heard they open overhead and the mass was over and kind of standing there Elsa and somebody says everybody get down so we we just dive on the ground there was lying flat and I heard their airplane droning overhead

[01:25:19] Antonov sound and I heard the the pitch changes her as high pitched like a whirring sound almost like a jet engine noise and then boom this incredibly loud explosion felt like it was two feet away I mean it was like half a kilometer way it wasn't writing it but it was so loud and it circled again then I realized that what that whirring sound was was a sound at the bomb falling through the air so then I know so now I know what that sounds like then this happened six eight bombs six times they kept hearing this thing comes around again bombs and you're lying there terrified thinking you just you feel like you want to burrow yourself into the ground and disappear you know we just lying flat exposed thinking what you know what happens and the thinking is not even so much being killed but what if what if my you know what my leg is blown off or my arm gets blown off you have no control over this you're totally at the at the mercy of these people and you feel like you're like you're just in it like a hunted animal that's the that's what I felt like I felt like I'm a hunted animal and at that time since we

[01:26:22] I'm bummed we didn't have the the foxholes dug around so humanely a fter that we went and we look foxholes all over the hospital grounds that's what you see in the film there's actually one point when you're being interviewed and the bombs start coming and you guys have to jump into these foxhole right right and another time we were bombed those in the hospital and just down on the on the floor of the hospital you know you're thinking well you know we just you're just thinking this this might be it but this thing might could you can't tell where it's gonna fall you hear that whirring sound and we hear that whirring sound you don't know if that's gonna fall on top of you it's gonna fall right next to you and and just then shatter your body you have no idea so it's really it's it's really terrifying I mean there's no other way to describe it and I mean you know when you see this stuff that's happened in Syria people living in these cities

[01:27:11] I mean nuke you can imagine what that is like and the kids that were in that situation that some people never never outgrow that fear and that feeling of being bombed you really you feel like you're a hunted animal I think it's a closest thing I can not that I've ever been hunted I'm an animal but you just feel like it I remember thinking to myself we were down this is after this is a few bombings later it down in the foxhole and there was a Sukhoi 24 jet going overhead Sukhoi 24 is a supersonic jet bomber you know bombing villages you know Hut's at the gate what are these people doing I were thinking to these guys I say how can they bomb us don't they know there are people down here that's what I felt you know like it was some exercise when they made a mistake and of course they know exactly there are people tell me that's what they're bombing you know but I I really hope some day I will meet these pilots not that I don't even feel any animosity towards them the feeling is never estranged you don't feel anger you don't feel animosity towards these people just kind of wonderment like what are they doing like why they doing this so I would love to meet these guys someday and say what what were you thinking you know what would they tell you before you did your mission you know as a flight surgeon the Navy so I know you have a briefing before the pilots fly out they discussed the mission today everyone the fly here we're gonna bomb this target this is our objective what were you told in the briefing room they say okay today guys are going to bomb a hospital there are much Assyrians there I mean you know Zuma bleah if you're if you're trying to put your psychology hat on you have to believe that they are being told that the people that they are bombing are somehow a threat to them or their sovereignty and supporting rebel I mean you'd have to concoct a story that's so orthogonal to the truth right maybe that might be it because I mean after one of the times the US was bombed one of our staff heard a radio broadcast from elevated which is a city in the north and the way they portrayed it on this radio was they admitted they bombed a hospital they said we bombed an

[01:29:16] American Church Hospital in Kota which is the kind of capital the rebel-held territory possible taking care of the rebel soldiers that's how it's portrayed so your American Hospital in America of course is a great enemy is a Christian hospital therefore they're no good and it's they're taking care of rebel taking care revels so you're you're justified in this in this act and my guess to me that's what these guys were fed who knows that the pellets were true believers I know work with a lot of pilots in the US military and they would they would not go along with the mission that they say you're going to bomb a hospital with civilians they wouldn't do it it was hey look man we're not doing this I know these guys they were not these guys that they loved to fly and they loved the country but they were not interested in killing civilians and I who still hope someday I can meet these guys and just have a talk with them and just to know what they were thinking and what went on in their brains like whether they know this how they feel about it I'm just interested what they would what they would say how do you cope with what I could only imagine is stress and anxiety aren't the right words but just sort of the gravity of it like when you describe a day in your life you know getting up at 5:30 in the morning making rounds at 7:00 operating if you said Peter you got to go do this for a month I mean first of all I could provide no assistance to you that's the unfortunate reality despite my medical training oh I would I mean I could you know put IVs in patients and that's about I mean I thought think I could provide any benefit but let's assume I could even magically provide benefit I can't imagine how physically but more so emotionally exhausted I would be at the end of 30 days right even thinking back to my training where you know you'd have every other night call but on one of the nights in between you didn't get to go home and so you've been in the hospital for three and a half days and it's been one trauma after another like even that feeling is just is physically tired as you are there something different going on which is just an emotional depletion right so to imagine that you're now eight no more you're coming up to 11 years into this and this is just in

[01:31:33] Sudan right I don't understand how you can do that I think you hit the nail on the head I think probably the emotional trauma and upset is probably worse than the physical degradation your body takes by just always being on call and just even when you're not called at night it's hard to sleep you know always there's a lot of kind of fear and worry about things but there's always that less so now cuz you're not bombing but there's always that sense of worry about there being physical danger but even when you're out of that when the physical the risk of physical danger is not there it's just the the psychological thought I've always been responsible for the for the patients and not having a psychological rest like I can't refer these people somewhere there aren't other colleagues we can talk to or get an advice on or have somebody else see these patients it is very draining and I don't know I just you know a couple things is one of course is

[01:32:25] I do draw on my faith all the time and I think that does help me keep centered a lot you know I go to church every day and that's I think helps put things in a better perspective that's just how it is and besides that I think you see the people there they see the strength and resilience of the Nuba people you say well okay if they can put up with this environment and keep function and keep going ahead let me just try to keep taking care of them as best I can so I definitely get a lot of strength from the people there and their attitudes they've been in this for their whole lives and they're they're not giving up they're pushing it with things so let me see if I can also just keep going it's not easy by any stretch both physically and mentally and emotionally it's it's it's very very draining but I don't know it's weird yeah I mean you get up in the morning and you you know have this huge number of patience to get through and you kind of say man I'm sure biking so I'm tired already kind of see the first view and then you before he know you're finished with the Children's Ward thinking the breasts okay got thrilled at children and now we go to the female ward you get through there you pick up pace a bit you get to the male war you go through them see the maternity patients now it's one o'clock you okay I finished the rounds we got a clinic of a clinic and there's big a lot of people how many patients would you see in clinic typically maybe 40 50 again I don't even know what that means I mean I think most us physicians would have a hard time seeing that many patients in a week in a clinic do you have any blood tests you can do can you do CBC's or UAE's even I mean what what's the extent to your diagnostic tool kit so until recently you had nothing I mean now you have an ultrasound right we've had the ultrasound from there from the beginning okay so we've had that the whole time that's been hugely helpful you don't have an x-ray machine x-ray we do now okay so we just got that about a year ago so you can do a chest x-ray at least if you want some assistance with business person I've pneumonia or a pneumothorax or something like right so prior to year ago we didn't have the x-ray now we do it's it's been a help lab has been difficult we can do a urine leakage a cow stool we can do a hemoglobin sometimes we can do a CBC but the the Machine always seems to be broken you know getting the machine working for a while then it just stops working can't do a CBC chemistry tests we can sometimes do a creatinine but then that machine breaks and you know we can't do a curette name sometimes you can do alts tea machine breaks can't do anything but with those things matter in other words if someone's listening to this and says well gosh if it's $50,000 to buy a new lab piece of laboratory equipment can we have one of those you know brought in with next year's supplies would that change would that make life easier for the care you guys provide it would help and you know like there's a just so this chemistry analyzer what's called a piccolo which is supposed to be kind of built for these remote locations is pretty dr. proof I mean you kind of have this thing that's pretty Hardy you slip in a disc you put a drop of blood on it and it gives you a results so our guys in lab could do that nut or less or guys lab can do the other test but the machines are just very it's less about the human it's more about them you need a robust machine a very robust machine so this is kind of a thing and that's about 14 grand if we had one of those and some of the disks which have the reagents I'm embedded in them so if you had a year's supply of test strips or reagent discs and then the machine right you could do a CBC and a chem seven or a metabolic panel of some sort right that would yeah that would definitely help we're pretty limited we can do a peripheral blood film so taking blood you know guys can do the film we could look at that so you're a pathologist now - yeah and a very high metrologist I'm terrible at it but I can pick up like a chronic leukemia chronic my largest chronic lymphocytic or an acute leukemia those are if it's pretty obvious we can pick those up but a lot of blood films aren't baffled and when you have a child that has leukemia

[01:36:13] I assume you send them to Kenya it's impossible why it's too far it's too expensive it's too difficult like this the administrative stuff to get them there and the chance in Kenya of them being I mean maybe at a higher in hospital they could get decent care but they're just we just can't do it so what do you can you treat with chemotherapy a child and that with leukemia if a child is okay Mia we often will give steroids to try to you know I'm a bit valued of care yeah for leukemias for chronic leukemias these are again are usually adults if it's a chronic lymphocytic leukemia we'll treat them with cyclophosphamide we'd have tablets we'll get periodic injections and I can kind of boil in a bit

[01:36:50] CML chronic myeloid leukemia we don't have treatment for I would like to have at least at least some hydroxyurea which is kind of an older drug for it you don't strike Glee back yeah it's just about to say cleave act would cure most cases of CML right I mean it's a very expensive drug in the United States of course that's the problem so wiggly bag

[01:37:08] I was so excited like a month or two ago I'm reading the Klee vac is now in generic oh my god maybe we can buy Gleevec cuz we get a few year we've got a huge number of CML patients we did a few thinking man we wouldn't need a huge amount I was so I'll look it up and it's okay gleevec's go on a generic so the price went from eight thousand a month to seven thousand yeah this is another one of these ridiculous systems and you know problems which is a lot of times when drugs go from being branded to generic there's virtually no change in price right we just can't do that you know a lot of things that are just beyond our scope of being on the pay for it that's something that to me is it's really difficult to consider I mean if you're you know we can be as critical as we wanted the US healthcare system for all of its buffoonery but in large part it's because we can be buffoons right right it's because we have infinite resources though we don't right but right in the short term we have infinite resources and so we never have to ask the question of what are we optimizing for and how do we triage expenses on the other hand you were faced with that decision every single day right so you would look at a patient with CML and say we're not gonna spend eighty thousand dollars a year to save this person's life because as much as we believe every life is equal we sort of know that eighty thousand dollars can save a hundred lives in another way and are you the one that has to make that decision by yourself yeah it's agonizing it's absolutely agonizing that's that's um that's just one example of money I've got a woman that comes all the time with CML and she's got a huge spleen that hurts she's anemic and she got a bunch of kids I gotta talk to her clinic and trying to figure something out with her she walks I don't know how long how far she walks to reach us I mean it's absolutely agonizing I cannot send her anywhere this just is totally impossible just can't do it so if we had what we wouldn't need mountains of Gleevec I mean a small amount would be enough to at least get her through er there a few people that have CML it's a few it's not a huge number if someone's listening to this and they say I'm gonna tell you a story in a moment called the starfish story but I want to save one starfish that's that they'll tell you this story logistical II would it even be possible for someone to provide one year's worth of Gleevec to a patient in your hospital is that something that they could do through the American of the African mission how would someone even logistically go about providing specific or project based funding to your mission if they could get the drug so they had access the physical drug here in the US may if they sent it to say a Catholic medical mission board which is my sponsoring lay sending agency and they also helped us a lot with logistics and within the overall mmm managing the hospital they might be able to find a way to get it down to us at least get it to Juba and then we could figure out a way to get it up to us if they could get the physical drug there was a program when I was on our meeting of the time before last we met some guys there's a I suppose there's some Gleevec program that you can register like the patient can't register and they can get drugs at either low cost or no cost so I went through I was saying kind of the person she said okay all I have to do is take these forms have the patient go to

[01:40:18] Khartoum to give the drugs that's absolutely impossible we can't get the cart to him that's on the other side of the enemy lines and you just can't reach there so which gets back to your point of providing the money is half the battle but logistically getting it in there and I mean just spitballing you can't have these things air dropped or airlifted in because the enemy fighters will obliterate anything that's trying to you thought you can fly the Cessna in there to get this stuff in there there's been no non bombing aircraft in our airspace for it's been since November 2011 so so even foundations like the

[01:40:54] Gates Foundation's which do a ton of great stuff in Africa I mean Sudan's basically off limits you know Sydney were able to provide money for a bunch of Gleevec one of the problems and one of the problems I've decided to go through is a lot of these funds are kind of unassailable if you're like I'm an individual or even a small organization is trying to apply doing these big organizations they just get through that application process to get funds and then to account for it and do monitoring evaluation and follow-up it's a very daunting task you need you need people who are trained in this area of writing proposals and Monica valuation all this sort of stuff to really follow through with all this it's very difficult to access some of these big funds and big organizations you know a lot of these bigger groups are set up to do that kind of work at the administrative size has grown exponentially because in order to get these this funding you need a big administrative staff to apply for the funds and follow-up and accountability and the counting right and you I mean you've got tons of extra time I'm sure to do that right yeah do it I just can't do it unless it can be made fairly simple worse ones okay I got the drug I'll send it to

[01:42:07] Catholic medical Mission Board and then Catholic mission Board will send it down and we get the drug you know at least as far as Juba then we can try to figure out a way to get it up but it's just it's really there's a problem with access and just getting through the administrative things you have to do it to get some of this stuff there's some so there are several kind of different levels of difficulty so going back to the sort of state of diseases you see if a person makes it out of there sort of the young life right if a person sort of your age or my age what are they gonna die from middle aged people we have a lot of cirrhosis liver cancers and that's there's a huge at hepatitis phase

[01:42:48] B yeah huge like we do we screen all of our pregnant women for Hep B do you guys have a Hep B vaccination program we do we do the reason we started screening the the pregnant women is just to get an idea about the basic rate and it's about close to 20% hepatitis B positive just in general populations or people who are not sick they're pregnant with children so what we're doing is we encourage mother when the baby's born we give them a B hepatitis B vaccine immediately after birth and we hope with that that will stop prevent this may be forgiven hepatitis B as I get older and prevent all the complications from that we haven't really scaled up to the point where we have so many happy positive people and can you only vaccinate the women who are coming in for deliveries or are you able to get the vaccine into the community for the women who are still delivering at home no we haven't we haven't reached that point yet so you're only scratching the surface thing because the majority of these birds are outside of your Hospital right exactly I mean eventually we like to have kind of minimized these places and have the testing capability to test all these people for hepatitis B or if people delivered in these clinics you look we can't do the test thing but we just give the vaccine will assume the kid has hepatitis B good the vaccine because they have to get Hep B anyway as part of the pentavalent series so after that first shot we continue a pentavalent which is DPT diphtheria pertussis tetanus hepatitis B and I'm all those influenza B

[01:44:08] I've heard that kids actually can get diphtheria in Africa yeah has there been a case of diphtheria in the United States since the 40s no I think that I think I don't even know what diphtheria is I mean like I mean sounds stupid to say that but I remember learning about it in medical school and I know we all get the vaccine for it what what is the disease what is how does it manifest we've only had from what I remember one case and I think she had that there is was it was in an adult but it's a granny back to here in your theory ie it's a bacterial infection it affects the throat and yet like a it looks almost like a thick scab that forms in the throat they kind of died from airway problems you know I just think it's thick and they can't they swallow they can't really breathe well and they can die from airway problems it's a horrible really a terrible disease and you mentioned your mother-in-law has leprosy right again

[01:44:56] I've never seen that in my life it's a bacteria as well it's is it in the tuberculosis family or something like exactly it's Mycobacterium leprae it's a micro bacterium and it's transmitted by respiratory droplets oh it's not by touch I thought leprosy was sort of contagious through touch yeah that's that's at our wives tale yeah it's really transmitted by respiratory droplets and it should be prolonged close contact so some of some of the TB it's not a real it's a very slow growing organism but prolonged close contact respiratory droplets you can affect it as affects the nerves in the skin and by that nerve infection people lose sensation they they get cuts or wounds they don't take care of things they burn themselves they don't pay attention to it gets infected fungus in fact that you have to amputate the digit are these people prior to your arrival that were kind of outcasts and they would be not touched or anything like that yeah there was definitely discrimination against them they didn't have like separate places where they would make them outcasts but people would kind of avoid them like my mother-in-law still I think a lot of it was the people themselves were kind of withdraw due to shame and due to fear of us giving it to somebody else like my mother-in-law kind of withdrew she stays by herself she doesn't eat with the other family they keep telling her look come and eat with us is okay but she will not come and eat with other people she always insisted kind of by herself she does it herself she's kind of a self isolation from society she's pulled herself out so she'll talk to you in chat interact with you but then with eating with more social interactions she'll kind of pull back and eat by herself and how prevalent is tuberculosis very very prevalent and for our place our HIV rate is quite low which is what it's less than much less than 1% oh wow points something maybe 0.1% and is that an artifact of where you are geographically or is that as part of the benefit of some of the aid relief that made its way in the early part of 2000 yeah I think the main reason is our isolation is their drug use their prostitution I mean which I assume would be the two most dominant modes of transmission now prostitution is not really part of that society drug IV drug use is unheard of it's all through like with most of

[01:47:09] Africa's through heterosexual transmission and I think just the it's starting to get a little bit of a toehold in new but but still on rate is very low I'm worried that if if peace comes and the place opens up and you got more movement of people in and out the race gonna skyrocket that's what happened in South Sudan the nidus is there because we have a lot of STDs gonorrhea is a very common syphilis some we do you see tertiary syphilis and really advanced cases or I don't think so but maybe some of this stuff we're saying is just undiagnosed through ourselves I don't know we I don't think we see it what I see is syphilis is we have we do VDRL tests and we've a lot of video positives which are not you know sign of very accurate tests we have a lot of false positives we have a lot of

[01:47:50] VDRL or are PR positive people we do that the screening where the screening now with the pregnant mothers for meteor l and we have a lot of positivity we don't see the Shanker's or the secondary syphilis as press really really rare but the VTOL positives are very common so we talked about liver cancer do you see heart disease no heart failure so in the older population will see a you know a fair bit of heart failure somebody maybe in their 60s 70s that's in heart failure and it's like bacterial or I remember there was some bacteria like shag as something or other that when we can the heart muscle is it that type of a heart failure yeah no we don't have failures disease in our area is just old age do you think it's atherosclerosis

[01:48:32] I don't think so I've never seen anybody if I could say I think this person had an mi just not a single one in ten half years some has hypertension just kind of untreated hypertension and will let people come in with blood pressure of 250 over 180 really yeah how prevalent is obesity overweight type-2 diabetes obesity about 0.0001 percent almost almost non-existent an occasional person is a bit overweight but really really rare and how often do you see type-2 diabetes will see it not so prevalent but it's definitely there somebody see older you know other people come in and just new diagnosis of diabetes that's maybe someone who's 40s or 50s do you ever see fatty liver like when you're operating on a patient do you ever see that the liver is fatty and no no I think no never i Cameron Bure single case well I've seen fatty liver what kind of cancer is I mean you do so much cancer surgery especially in children but their cancers we don't see that much here right what types of cancers do the people in nuba get versus basically not getting me in the United

[01:49:39] States of course you'd have lung breast colon prostate are the lion's share of cancers followed by pancreas so those are the big five how prevalent are those cancers in nuba not so I mean like in if we go to kids first or burkas lymphoma is fairly common that's an e bv related if I recall right I've seen Barr virus is Epstein Barr virus in you only you really just see that in Larry a hollow endemic regions so we're in that it's called a Burkitt's zone and that's a great cancer cause it's curable with with just like lefaucheux might six courses cycle fossa might and you cure a cancer it's great for a satisfying but it's rare to have a cancer can cure obviously for adults liver cancer is probably probably the most common in this think about a cellular carcinoma how so a carcinoma and probably already attempt is be positivity they drink a fair bit this local local beer they make them sorghum but the alcohol content is not very very high it's fully weak so Hep B related cancer of the liver we have a fair bit of cancer of the cervix so for females probably cancer the cervix is the most common and can use screen for

[01:50:46] HPV are your the local gynecologists as well right can you do a pap smear no perhaps me would be a little bit impractical we have to do a swab and get that sent off and do it high level you know get it out to a pathologist er is there any way I mean again if someone we're listening to this and said oh my god like if I could have an impact on eradicating cervical cancer for these women right is that even feasible to have the equipment there to after you do the swab assess for HPV no for cancer cervix two approaches one would be this

[01:51:19] Gardasil the HPV vaccine were made available either very low-cost or just giving us part of I think it's like actually just heard today as part of the BHO package so they can be integrated into the system where HPV has given to young girls even young boys but then we're back to the logistics problem right it's hard even if the w-h-o or any of the Foundation's came along and said we want to provide

[01:51:42] HPV vaccination on mass to Africa you're still somewhat excluded right we give other vaccines if they can be lumped into your annual supplies right and just do it to get stuff out there but if you do it one big push yeah get it out there it's gotta be all coaching it's really it's really hard but it's doable get this stuff out there one big push that will make a huge difference so start with that the tree cancer the surface treat early reversions they call it a see and treat technique I've not done it but it's not probably a YouTube video on there probably is I think I think there has actually you paint the cervix with something I can't beside down or some substance and you look for real era T's in the cervix and then you freeze it you have the little liquid nitrogen cylinder with some probes put that in the cervix and you freeze it make a nice ball of the cervix that you you you kill those precancerous cells and hopefully those people not go on to develop invasive cancer the cervix you would need some personnel for that because that would be pretty labor intensive that's more of a preventive medicine thing would come in examine them because you're not treating people with the cancers yeah I'll get the precancerous lesions see the screen I'm do a lot of these screening things we paint the cervix with some substance look and see belly you don't even need a culpa scope it's something even more simple that and I know they're doing it in

[01:53:00] Uganda and they have this equipment so that might be coming in between thing before Gardasil becomes available at least we do a screening of young women check the cervix see what what it looks like when you paint this stuff and then treat with liquid nitrogen we don't have the equipment like the nest stuff is there northern knowledge to do it what about breast cancer how prevalent is that it's definitely there the promo breast cancer is by the time we we diagnosed the only we only diagnosed so we can feel a lump no one's getting a mammogram right no mammograms or we don't you know do other stuff too the diagnosis had memorized where we have so woman's present with a palpable mass that they're feeling and they show up right so usually they come with a palpable mess and they already have nose and things alone so so you in that situation you still do modified radical mastectomies we do we use you in life I wrote the mastectomy and then follow with adriamycin so go fasta my chemo and do that sort of every month for about six cycles and I mean it's still the results are pretty dismal I mean usually they they get a couple years but two years on two and a half years on they come back and they've got another lump that lump and exilic isn't the tumor in the in the chest so it's the chemotherapy almost assuredly isn't helping is it no I really don't think is doing much so it's really frustrating would getting a mammogram machine add value I mean of course there's all the futility and the controversy around mammography per se but I'm just sort of thinking of like what are some finite resources that could be added to I mean you're serving a million people basically that live in a world we can't even imagine as far as even the simplest acts of prevention right the problem with that to do the screening to scale up to that level yeah you need a whole new staff to write get people through right and the same thing with cancer surgery screening it's may be possible so it's not just a matter of supplying the Machine you need the radio you need someone who's dedicated to reading mammograms all day long all right I mean

[01:54:56] I guess the other option is I mean AI should actually make mammography this is probably one of the most important applications of machine learning is actually reading x-rays and you don't eat you wouldn't even need a radiologist at some point you know there will be a day when you could run a million women through a mammogram in a year and there's a machine that's reading it and basically giving you the answer and now you still need the logistics of a person taking the patients through the machine and operating the machine but anyway we got to think big Tom we gotta we gotta think these are areas where technology and medicine and developing or there's not always a good marriage but there are some areas where you have technological leaps like for instance our x-ray machine part of it the reason when we waited eight years to get one the first all they were expensive as heck how much did is a I don't even know how much an extra machine would cost this one cost thirty three thousand which of course in the United States that's the cost of like getting your gallbladder removed but I mean literally that's about my cost of a cholecystectomy yeah so was something for us was a big expense but we do it a lot quite a few x-rays now or operating the I was actually taken the or x-ray techs are the operating room guys with the guys the opportunistic seen operating room are the ones we taught how to take x-rays they do a pretty good job we waited that long because we wanted a model that we could use it was a very small lightweight simple or you didn't have to use the chemicals and developers and all s sort of stuff and we just waited and now we have a model where is it digital is digital so it's a tiny little device mounted on this little thing and actually select the size of a small like a tiny box that has the x-ray tube in it and it's a laptop and the screen is a operates by bluetooth between an x-ray machine in the computer take the x-ray that shows up on the computer screen and it's all there and you can take that x-ray and adjust you can darken it lighten it you can focus in a certain areas I mean it takes a beautiful x-ray and you can just play around with this you really get a nice picture and there's very little variable cost at this point it's no it gets it's all a fixed cost that you've covered and now it you can the more you use it the better you're getting more absolutely and it's you know the the power is also the other thing was the power needed because we're 100% on solar we've got a backup generator it's 12 and 1/2 kilowatts how long does 12 and 1/2 kilowatts last the hospital if the panels were to go out we could run things on it the problem the rate limiting factor there is the fuel like right now I think we do they were left with maybe Oh so you if you have enough fuel for the generator you could run indefinitely off it if you needed to yeah by me we have to give probably big breaks of time you know it's it's a pretty it's a fairly good-sized thing and the hospital is the only thing that has electricity but you don't have electricity in your home no there's no grid so it's just just the hospital has power that's you know we run on the solar I mean pretty much 24/7 we really don't need as long as the batteries are there everything's functioning we don't need the generator at all and we try to we try to find the time when it's these batters are going to order new set and new panels wherever you need to re-up that so we're I think three years into this set of batteries what about colon cancer do you see that pretty rare we've had well maybe two or three cases in ten years I mean it's really really rare the folks who were the the most elderly within the community live to what age I mean what is considered old there you know nobody there knows the rage you know they don't have any birth records even my wife doesn't know her age she's somewhere in her 30s probably so they don't really know their exact age but I would guess they're probably another person they were probably in the 70s understand his or her 70s I don't think they they live much beyond that and do you see cognitive impairment in that population really rare you rarely is somebody say I think this person has Alzheimer's really really rare to see that I mean I think they should die of something else before they reach that stage you just don't see it the point you just made that reminds me there's a MU movie which you may have seen it I think it's called a good lie yes it stars Reese Witherspoon it's a beautiful story yes after we saw the heart of nubo we watched that because I wanted my daughter to sort of understand the history of the Sudanese refugees and that that's one of the points from the movie that I remember being very sort of moved by they were all assigned the same birthday because nobody knew their birthday like even something like that that we would take for granted do they celebrate birthdays no nobody does I mean you know my wife we have invented a birthday or she might think one of

[01:59:26] November 21st so and that that comes around will usually do something I mean she's always surprised like what what's what he doing Oh so she doesn't give me a hard time for not buying flour if we could live flowers so it's pretty huh it's pretty easy to be married to noble lady doesn't expectations were very low how has your life changed since you've been married I mean do you have a greater sense of obligation to not die to put it bluntly yeah I would say yeah definitely so I'm like you know you can't be so cavalier with things because

[02:00:01] I've got a wife and I wanted to kind of look after her and make sure she's okay there's been a little bit of a change in perspective with that and I think if and when we get children I think that'll change another degree up for sure you think you could do what you do if you had children I think we could stay there and if things get really hairy we'd have to see how to proceed but just in terms of I mean your wife is a nurse so you have the luxury of working together so as focused as you are on your work she is there with you right when you have children they will not work with you for quite some time I just wonder would it be challenging to sort of now be torn between two obligations that for many years will not overlap at all it'll be difficult you know I think one thing and one thing I remind my wife of is that you know I finished work late that I'm always you know often preoccupied with things and things with the hospital and all that sort of stuff but at least I'm there every evening the weekends we have a little bit of time on a Sunday be together and even though the work is is very much all-encompassing there's no commute and there no distractions you know we don't have there's no TV there's no radio we don't have other things that kind of occupy our minds so when we work together at home we really can be present to each other and I would hope that if we have children I'll be able to use that to really spend time with the kids and not be always in work you know if luck continues like that Anubha there's not any travel involved I'm just there yeah I'm just don't you know it's funny when you say it that way it's actually you may actually spend more time with your kids than many of us do right here because of our distractions and our travel and our this yeah life here is is much more hectic I mean it seems almost ironic this you feel out of place here even though you grew up here I mean when you walk down

[02:01:52] Park Avenue or Madison Avenue are you sort of like what in the hell is this place I do I do feel a bit in a place in a sense I do enjoy it look i-i've never even when I was like groping upstate New York I never spent time in New York City so this is really kind of it's exciting I like it but I don't think I could I could stay long term and I love people

[02:02:11] I'm sure say about in New York but I do feel much more at home in the mountains where it's it's very quiet and kind of sedate and your time is your own when you're off what possessions do you value I mean I I know you have some textbooks and things but I mean your home is very modest obviously by the standards of someone living in the United States it would not really you wouldn't even really call it a home in the same way right but you don't give the impression that you're wanting no I really don't I think that was my character since I was a kid I'm very much I think I'm very much a minimalist since I was born all these clothes you see me wearing that from that well the socks the trousers both these shirts I bought when I came out of new but last month so I have scrubs scrubs I won pair of trousers I had a suit a few t-shirts and that was it and they're like hey look you got to go and meet people you can't be previous crumbs around excited I'll describe when

[02:03:08] I came out it was painful for me to buy clothes like I don't I just don't like when I go back I said look when I go back to mountains the Elvis is winter coats and his stuff I'm not taking a stuff back with me I'll keep it in Armenia Lupe's someone ever use it I don't know what I wanted my suit I do have one suit that I wore to the ceremony in our meeting at work prior ceremony but I bought that suit in 1985 so heaven probably when you were interviewing for medical school or something well I was interviewing for jobs like for engineering jobs that's reason I bought it so it was when I say what he was Fred moved for for medical school and then I've used it I come out for the essaouira price ceremonial they'll take it out and see what the blue shirt and a tie but a bollock rep 1985 and I know that you it's absolutely against your nature to sort of be critical of anyone but do you spend any time thinking about the way the world works here and how most of us are somewhat attached to our possessions yeah and the more possessions we have the more complicated our lives get I mean you certainly hear people talk about minimalism few people can apply it to the extent that you can of course but I mean what have you learned about this and how could you speak to somebody like me who you know loves his possessions as much as the next person and can't imagine giving up these comforts I mean help me understand because you don't look like you're miserable and you look even happier in these videos in nuba I'm sure that this is about the hardest thing you've had to do all year yeah it is a schlep around New York and talked to idiots like me no you know I'll tell you Peter I really do believe that the more detached you become not like in this Buddhist kind of Nirvana sense but the more detached you are from from things the easier life is it just simplifies your life I mean for me I look at all a lot of possessions and things and attachments just adding more complications you know like become so complicated it's much harder here in the

[02:05:10] US yeah I see my sister and how she's interacting with the kids you know as a reason why advertisers are good at what they do you know what they want to do is convince you to buy something you really don't need and they're very good at it what is medicine having you exist why is there a huge building some medicine

[02:05:24] Avenue these guys are very good with what they have what they do they're convincing they've managed to convince all of us to get things that really don't need and convince us that we'll be only happy and fulfilled and satisfied if we have those things so you got all this tsunami pushing against you for me I think just because I'm in an in place where you can't have anything that kind of realized well geez I don't have any of this stuff and I kind of like it it just makes things much easier for me I've always been a bit of a minimalist II when I was when I was younger but I've come to kind of feel that that's really

[02:05:56] I do feel better with less and I think everybody is looking for some kind of meaning in life you know this book this man's search for meaning this Victor Franco Franco that was something that was only my favorite books and this idea of logo therapy but we all really do need a sense of meaning in our lives that's extremely important for our psychiatric makeup whatever that is it's different for each person whether it's kids whether sure pets whether it's your job but trying to get something in your life that's meaningful and if you're looking for it this would be philosophizing it certainly I think if you're looking for in material possessions I don't think you'll find it there so if I can make a bit of an aside something I talked about earlier with a talk with the Catholic medical mission board volunteer is my favorite Bible passage I came over the book and the verses but the basic story is there's a guy the guy's a very wealthy young man and he goes to Jesus they says they try to justify his help and says look what do I have to do to get eternal life and Jesus says well follow the prophets you've got all this stuff there follow the 10 commandments follow the laws of the prophets and you'll you'll be okay and the guy says well I do all those things what do we need to do to really become perfect and

[02:07:10] Christ said you know sell everything you have it could be a cross and follow me and it says something very which i think is very beautiful it says the man went away very sad because he had many possessions he couldn't do it he couldn't he one thing I think he want to justify himself see I'm doing I'm good

[02:07:28] I'm doing all the things they need to do I should be okay and Christ kind of turned that on his head and said okay if you want to be perfect so everything you have and come and follow me and I think I think what he's saying is look if you really want to be perfect really want to be happy you know get rid of you know it's a bit of pie in the sky stuff in a way and not proud to gofer for people but in some way get rid of your baggage and coming father because it could be metaphorically get rid of your stuff right I don't think it's a surly literal right right this may throw your couches out but ask me it means don't be Wed to these things the way that I think we are exactly and the theological meaning is exactly that it's not that you can't have things but what's your attachment to those things you know is this thing where you put your values you know is your value in the car you drive and the what kind of beer you drank or whatever or is your value more in people and what you're doing and I helping people there was a bit of values in that and I think I'm sure some people can do it very well they're very wealthy they have a lot of stuff but they're they do have a sense of detachment from that I just think it's more difficult you know it talks about this passage about it's more difficult for rich man that throw the communit of heaven than it is for a camel to go through the eye of the needle that's kind of something

[02:08:40] I've been Adel it's supposed to where the camels were and they keep him out of the city and I think it looked like an eye of a needle the camel can go through there it's not saying being rich is bad rich people are bad people that's totally that's nothing it's missing the point it's just very difficult because it's very difficult to be detached from things when you have a lot of possessions you know I'm trying to say that without coming across as being judgment I don't mean that but certainly for me so much better having less I really really think that well it's funny at the outset you talked about this idea that even in ecology were sort of struck by this idea if you want to be a missionary and you even said something with the effective whatever that meant and it's sort of funny like if you say to me Peter picture a missionary I don't actually picture you mmm I picture someone going into a remote part of the world and hitting people with Bibles right like that's sort of the image we have of a missionary but in the reality of it I think what you're doing is far more aligned with in as much as one believes in in sort of religious values

[02:09:43] I guess I think what people like you do that is regardless of one's religious views they can't help but respect it is you're not preaching it to anybody you're not hitting anybody over the head of the Bible you're just sort of saying look I'm here to serve you and your example is what's actually doing the talking as opposed to your words whereas

[02:10:02] I think most of us myself included are far too quick to use our words to speak as opposed to our actions well you're tapping into my favorite quote which has been attributed the st. Francis I don't know if Saint Francis is like many people is my favorite Saint the Francis of Assisi who lived in the 12th early 12 hundreds he said preach always sometimes use words and I think that's that's exactly what I think we try to do a mission show the love of

[02:10:31] Christ by who you are in what you're doing close and don't don't get too wrapped around the axle about how it's gonna play out remember if you're there as a missionary you know God is the one that changes hearts not not me I'm not smart enough to do that I don't have the I'm not a guy that's can have just the right thing to say and you know school somebody on something I can't do that you know but I can do my best to show the love of Christ to these people and that's what I feel come from with you know if you ask me why I'm a

[02:11:01] Christian I can I can talk to you about it and my words might be a big jumble then goofy but preach always sometimes use words are there any cases of suicide and nuba we have one guy who's the husband of one of our staff and yeah he shot himself that really shocked everybody he seemed to have some kind of a psychiatric problem he was kind of acting a bit strange a few days they didn't tell us but he he'd been one of them one of the refugee camps was acting a bit odd there came back to nuba and was acting a bit out at home and then the night he was acting a bit odd he went he shot himself it's the only case

[02:11:38] I know of it's extremely rare extremely rare I mean to me there are so many amazing contrasts between nuba and America I mean they're so obvious they're not worth stating it's these subtle ones that are interesting right there must be a different sense of fulfilment contentment happiness sense of purpose they are verses here I mean as you know I'm sure you're not paying close attention to statistics in the

[02:12:05] United States but suicide is among the top 10 causes of death in every may be incorrect on this but I'm not far off in every age demographic except for 0 to 10 so once you get above you know 10 to 20 20 to 30 suicide is always in the top 10 as a cause of a disease and that doesn't include that's what we call fast suicide right when you kill yourself immediately with it clear but then you have all the slow suicide so the alcohol related you know basically people to kill themselves with alcohol and drugs yeah so when you include all of those

[02:12:38] I've heard analyses that would suggest that self-harm would be sort of top five causes of death across the board what does that say to you given that you live in a world that has one one-thousandth of the privileged and for all intents and purposes like shouldn't everybody be killing themselves in Nuba so to avoid being a you know ripped apart by shrapnel yeah it's very interesting in you know my the initial thought that comes to me is the people are when you're really gripped in this struggle to survive so your your life is based on you know every day is you're just trying to survive when you have that sort of primal instinct of survival you don't your mind doesn't drift off to other things you don't think about so much about your life is hard life as this your life is miserable i think you become less inward-looking suicide is so inward looking so focused on your own misery but you can't come out of it I mean it's such a miserable thing I mean it breaks my heart when I hear about these things it really does because I think man to get to that point when you just life is so miserable for you and you were so miserable you kill yourself it for me is heartbreak does that break your heart more than the tragedy that you see every day I mean I and not to compare miseries but like what you see breaks my heart maybe I'm numb I mean it's not to say that I'm not heartbroken by anybody who hurts themself but what you see is so staggering do you see this as an even greater source of tragedy for me I would

[02:14:11] I would equate that with the five year old girl who's got the shrapnel ripping her mama I would I would see I would feel the same sense of pain and heartbreak with that suicide as a similar effect where you know if a child dies from this kind of thing the effect you have on the whole family is devastating the grief suicide the grief you leave behind I think that's really tough and that really really breaks my heart not only for the person who was so miserable if they decided to take their own life but for the people rip alive I could talk gosh and that's terrible man

[02:14:43] I would just never wish that on anybody and yet it's almost impossible in the United States to not have your life touched by suicide I think it would be very rare that someone listening to this in America wouldn't know somebody first or second hand who hasn't taken their life either clearly and deliberately or sort of slowly and maybe less delivery oh yeah I think it's wrapped up in that struggle for survival there is a will you know a natural will to survive and when you're in this kind of daily grip even when there's when there's not fighting just to survive there the amount of work it takes to get up in the morning to you know make food to cultivate crops to keep the animals out of your garden I mean it's it's a it's a tremendous struggle there's a book think the book is called tribe Sebastian Junger have you heard yes I have heard of it yeah I can give you a copy actually I have a copy here so I'll give it to you it as one more possession to have it but he writes about how post 9/11 suicide rates went down in New York and he talks much more eloquently about this than I ever could but I guess it speaks to what you're saying which is when there's a real struggle when there's something and something that can bring people together in a common goal or there's something that unites people it can presumably distract from some of that pain that can otherwise hurt us right it's interesting because I fairly recently was hearing about this PTSD and and I mean how many veterans have killed themselves it's it's that's another heartbreaking thing somebody's fighting in Iraq or

[02:16:11] Afghanistan they survived all that they come back home they get despondent they kill themselves what kept them alive during the fighting was a sense of camaraderie togetherness fighting for you know a for a common goal I mean no matter what you think about warfare and the horrible things that happen in warfare at least they had some kind of a common bond they come back home to the

[02:16:29] US and people are indifferent to them nobody pays attention to them they've lost their the common bond with their with their comrades and friends and what ensues is despondency before I know it we had this huge brain of suicide amongst veterans that come back not so much from the trauma they had during the fighting it wasn't like flashbacks to the horrible things that happened there but a sense of loss of any bonds that human contact with other people a sense of purpose is gone so I found that quite interesting that that thought that's what just makes you wonder if there was if there is a way to you know we have these dating apps here in the United States right you probably don't have a lot of an idea what dating is totally illegal hear the word aliens even exist in it how did you meet your wife well we have what she calls secret love that's not like in a scandalous sense for anybody but you know there you can't openly date somebody you know if somebody like I could never be alone with her somewhere like just chatting out in the public people would tell her brothers hey this guy is talking your sister we can do about it they come they beat me up they beat her up and then this big scandal and they say oh you know you were because gonna get married or what's going on here this can't you can't be doing this so you have to do it we did it very quietly you know it's got that you it's it's difficult we got to know each other kind of on the side and our marriage is normally arranged is that why this dating process is unnecessary yet traditionally they were arranged now they're not so much arranged but the families will meet together somebody you know someone might show interest in somebody else then they have to approach the family but there's not really a dating they can't go through a public dating thing if you if you're interested in marrying girl you've got to go and approach the family right away silica I want to marry this woman then they have to start negotiations with dowry you know like

[02:18:09] I'll have sort of stuff you can't be seen together in public sphere it's just and I just totally not allowed so not so much arranged as there's some attraction between the two but they have to really make them move fairly early so they don't you know were the problems you don't really get to know the other person very well it's really difficult you know they're good they're bad points because you can't really allowed to go through that that that process of dating if they know somebody unless were to think another family okay so there's definitely no nuba version of tinder so

[02:18:38] I think where I was going with that was in the same way that we have these dating apps it's which are basically trying to pair people right similar interest at a meta level it's it would be interesting if if there would be a way to pair a void that exists here in this country and then for much of the civilized world right the void of purpose with a part of the world where purpose is not lacking but resource is lacking and in many ways I think that's what philanthropy sort of tries to do but of course the question is it's more than just that right I mean I don't think it's just giving I think there's more to it right I mean I I and I was sort of thinking about this knowing we were gonna speak today that because my daughter asked me another question she said you know she said well can you ask dr. Tom like what could a ten year old girl in San Diego do to help year old girl in nuba mm-hmm and I thought and I thought and I thought and

[02:19:32] I was like I don't know mmm cuz it's not like you going there is gonna you know be a practical solution and or even provide value I mean even meek even if I decided Tom please I'm gonna come for a year and work at your side I would slow you down I mean I would be a waste of like you'd spend a year just teaching me how to get out of my own way so how can people help I mean giving is of course the most obvious you've you've outlined so many clear tangible examples of where even modest resources by the standards of our health care system would have profound step function changes there is there something else people can do to help yeah first of all never underestimate the value of a donation to to someone you trust there are a group you trust or an organization you trust the amount of the impact that has is tremendous we can't do anything and I work without financial resources beyond that I think one is just becoming aware of the situations somehow in this environment trying to understand how these people how they live what their lives are like that these really are individuals that have their own thoughts and aspirations and everything else trying to get it into their skulls a bit and understand what their life is like and who they are if you have the combat knack for advocacy or through governments in this kind of thing be aware of the political situations there advocate on behalf of some of these people that are oppressed they're having difficult lives whether it's working in issues of poverty or poor health poor education I think people have a voice to offer and people do have an influence over governments so government policies government funding is a reflection of the constituents and

[02:21:18] I just came to realize this full well in this trip because some of these people say well the government funding a lot of these administrative requirements these beneficiary organizations have become more stringent more difficult because governments require these things because they're accountable to their constituents their customers are saying are you saying so much money to Africa they're wasting it or it's waste of money so to give the money out the constituents are holding the politicians feet to the fire if the constituents were a little more open said look let's help out let's let's be aware of what's going on and try to help some of these people get other misery so they can eventually help themselves through education better health all these sort of things that would free the politicians up a but a bit too a lot more resources to go out into more more aid and other things more benefit to give them I mean the goal and all this stuff has eventually let these people who are beneficiaries now staying in their own two feet maybe in the next generation and those go around this cycle of aid I mean everybody knows a cycle of aid and dependency is a bad thing great but how do you get out of that so what are some creative ways we can do that but you can't do anything without some help at this point but geared towards getting these people to stand on two feet talk to me about food I heard a funny story once that is there a word for food and about like that it it's like it gumo so you know nobody has like 99 different languages amongst it with people so does everybody speak Arabic pretty much most was me go speak Arabic yeah I speak about Estrella yeah Shui Shui Adria the thought of my wife's language is Tara and this came from her look word for food is Momo and you know I would say what did you have for supper last night and she's hide food I said what kind of food she you know food what do what he talking about hide food okay so well had Necedah you know I see this the kind of the it's like a cake made out of sorghum kind of ground sorghum boiled just totally tasteless she loves it so I have my name is Sita so for them the word food and the Cecina is synonymous the South little varieties only little variety of foods so what do you eat well first of all what did you weigh because you were a nose guard in college right I've seen pictures of you you were huge what did you weigh in college and college I was 230 and this was 1985 my weight to 30s what did you yeah what did you weigh when you arrived in Kenya in 2000 probably around 190 oh I guess and what did you weigh by the time you got nuba oh the other way then maybe 170 and

[02:23:58] I got down I was down about 150 up until recently now when I've come out for the past month I think I've gained about 20 pounds was Dinamo getting 20 pounds in the United States in a month yeah so you were down to a hundred and fifty pounds a month ago yeah talk to me about what you eat well that's the thing I'm I eat but my wife makes the food there so is this food this is the what did you eat before you got married then I was living on the hospital compound so we'd have a lot of they would send them food in from

[02:24:26] Kenya normally like once a year they're sent food in so usually rice kidney beans some kind of lentils so we'd have that every day once while I'd have chicken but usually was just kind of rice and beans kind of stuff so now when I got married and moved off the compound my wife makes necesita I show some sauce on top of it so the main sauce is this okra okra grows pretty well I think okra they dry it and they pulverize it in the powder they mix that in with water and some other stuff and it makes like a really slimy sauce that you pour over the sorghum paste and it takes about as good as it sounds I mean it's really pretty bland where is the protein you know I think the sorghum actually has a high protein lip like this is a grain and I'm saying that because the people are pretty are pretty muscular like that's what they eat they that and they'll have maybe some sorghum porridge in the morning that's pretty much it for the day and I'm in a few peanuts they have peanuts too but not huge numbers of peanuts what about fruits or other vegetables for fruits there are seasonal so you can get mangoes for maybe two or three months out of the year you know may go season is there there tons of mangoes then they when they're gone they're gone you don't see a mango for several more months then there's the two seasons for mangoes usually but they'd varies quite a bit here to here so mangoes are there periodically lemons you get for fruits that's about it oranges are not there you know pineapples are there tomatoes and tomatoes are there for a couple months sort of towards the end of the rainy season you can get tomatoes and you can get some some greens they grew a few kind of greens there and I'll put that on top of that like even the tomatoes will kind of cook up a bit in the make the ogre slime to it and put that over the heceta that's not bad actually we'll have that quite a bit or the other thing we'll have during the rainy season is milk also milk is only there for a couple months the cows will only give birth during the rainy season and that there further only lacked hitting during the rainy season so to get milk sort of towards in the race he's in those last couple months and since there's no refrigeration most times we'll have it sour sour milk so I'll get the milk out let it sit for a while become sour and that'll also decontaminate it a bit there's a lot of brucellosis there and he'd take the sour milk which is kind of curdled and you know I think people test our remote before and you pour that over the heceta over the sorghum paste that just doesn't sound tasty not very good it's really it's kind of eating like man you know promise you eat it you're kind of hungry a bit but there's no way of going back for seconds I guess it's enough it's kind of go to bed you know go back to work that's like okay I guess

[02:27:07] I'm finished my wife really she does a great job cooking with limited resources we have but it's pretty stark if there are food that you particularly looked forward to having when you knew you were coming to the United States yeah like so pizza eggplant parmesan is my favorite food in the world so my sister made that when I was down there hamburgers I just crave cheese bursts like just a good sandwich you know missing chicken sandwich or something is this really nice with a good bread you know this kind of stuff you've been sick when you're there I mean how many times have you had malaria well I've been to ten and half years I've gotten malaria every year except for 2080 how bad is malaria it sounds awful it's pretty bad I mean you sometimes you're wishing somebody comes in and just shoots you which other your misery is it's you're pretty sick with it it's worse than influenza right yeah an influenza anybody who's actually had the flu will they test that's ten days of really bad living yeah Larry's pretty miserable I mean real bad headache nausea vomiting you can't sleep just high fevers body aches terrible body aches and sometimes you get a bit lucky you take medicine you're over in a few days but you know a lot of times it'll drag on for a month but you don't take prophylaxis throughout you're just during the rainy season which I'm assuming is when it's endemic right I don't I don't take prophylaxis just because of the cost and yeah I just don't want that the druggist want to say okay let me just not taking take it once you get it right once I get it sometimes it'll drag on a bit longer I mean sometimes you get it just for a month you take the medicine you feel a bit better for a couple days then next evening you start feeling the chills and shaking and the headache comes again and just like oh gosh still with me it can really drag on for a long time so every year you've got it every year that was in a coma for years ago just uh I was a strange noise started feeling sick the night before is on a Tuesday night I started taking I took some oral drugs I think a quartum which is a scene in derivative took that at night come went to bed just kinda had a kind of fitful sleep and then I woke up next morning and all these staff were in my room I have an IV in my arm and I be quitting like what what's going on here the doctor needed treatment that's right but

[02:29:21] I was really out of it there was like 11 o'clock when I woke up and I was really you know they tried to get me up in the morning some of the staff because I was in the operating room day on Wednesday and a guy that's our assistant there I didn't show up I held for the I was even he's done there by 7:30 and I didn't show up so he came up to the room he tried to wake me up and I couldn't get up like I didn't respond to him he thought I was dead he was I hate running it anyway had to die so I just the that was out of it for quite a while but then I recovered pretty quickly I can't even imagine I just I can't when you think back Tom about all of the people you've taken care of in the last 10 or 11 years so just even just limiting it to the time in nuba is there any one particular patient that just stays with you that haunts you one case one story one child one envelop I mean I have those stories I've got one or two three probably three stories that have stayed with me from my training right that if I even think about these patients I'll tear up I mean just you know they're unfortunately they're all bad outcomes is there anything but they're also they're not like the only bad outcomes I've seen but there's just something was some emotional connection that happened and then it's maybe it's sometimes you're projecting what's happening there to your own life or something but do you have those cases yeah probably like you the ones you really remember are the ones that have better outcomes or ones that didn't go well gosh we had one kid

[02:30:45] I remember he came in in a Sunday morning and he had been the antonov bombed in the trap and wet in his face and just tore his face to shreds and he went to some clinic somewhere and they put a few stitches in it like chromic stitches and he came a couple days after that and his face was just mangled so we took the stitches out his all just pus and they were coming out I mean just hidden but clean the wound out so it took at least two just I'll clean the wound out well put on my seventh abadox a couple days later we go on he's got high fever any can swallow like no crap he's got he's got tetanus so it could get tetanus I remember why the day before then over the antenna off came overhead the atop is the airplane that bombs and we saw the kid it was like a maybe ten years old he was thin against the wall just shivering when he heard the airplane just shaking loose oh trauma there's no traumatized he was shaking like this then like the next day he gets a real high fever he can't swallow put him in isolation put ng to down to feed him and he just died from tetanus like overnight he died from tetanus

[02:31:42] I remember this kid's face and how and I said what the heck it's the 10 year old kid with this thing we had another kid there's a childhood as few years ago he was it was bombed he and his aunt and it was an incendiary bomb from the Antonov I don't know what they had napalm or whatever but it bombed him and just he had I don't know he had third-degree burns on probably 60 70 percent of his body that's it's not even survivable now he lived like two months with this in both Hina's and with the same and I mean we tried everything with these kids the amount of work the nurses did every day just to try to address him an agony he went through before he died remember he did you know this has they had would have these scabs and remember they were the were her I was was burned with this thing and I remember there were maggots coming out of her I you know I think what what the heck are we doing you know this is crazy what what who are these are civilians burn to death you know there were other six other kids that were in an area that was being shelled so the city never would shell their village like all night and then they were bombed during the day so they were at nighttime they would sleep in the foxholes for protection so right next to them was a straw rock kuba kind of straw the Wilson structures so their artillery shell fired and hit the rock kuba think burst Rekha was just like a kind of lean-to with made of grass and wood it said this thing I fire and it fell into the foxhole and there were I think nine people in the foxhole all sleeping three were burned to death immediately six of them came to the hospital with very degrees of burns and a couple were just like 80% full thickness burns I mean just they lived for quite a while before they died two of them one girl started improving they developed tetanus and died from the tetanus so these ones that really kind of stick out maybe one of the soldiers I remember best is a guy that he was guy he I told you before he had twenty three or four holes in his intestine him up and we just dummies we powers we operating this guy post-op he was doing great I mean it was cruising and started feeding him except in bed the next time called down to see him he's changed condition as they say anyone down here he's already dead he was that he was that he was a Darfur he was fighting with the Nuba rebels and I just remember thinking you know what what would this life for his like this guy's got a family you know he's fighting in this place his family somewhere in Darfur what's happening the baby idea what's happening here so many terrible things you know there was a young one young kid he was about 16 and he this city was encroaching on her area so the rebels were not there to can't repulse them and then people just kind of jumped on the vehicles to go out and fight you know so his kid just jumped on the vehicle you didn't have a gun their weapon and everything you just thought it was a civilian he goes out there he gets shot in the head with with you know machine gun or something he comes in with with you know part of his skull missing and there's brain tissue kind of pulsating out I mean he survived for two or three weeks like that we haven't steroids and different things in antibiotics try to calm things down ended up just kind of going self and dying so these are all all people I'll never forget and there are many many that he'd be on that if people want to get involved in any way shape or form would you recommend they they look to as a resource I think in like an Africa mission health care or foundation there was something on their website and one the hospital that's one source to go to

[02:35:11] Catholic on their website is this AM H F dot u s yeah w no doubt AM H F dot u s that's a pretty good source to start there's a group called take heart foundation which was set up to kind of to harness the whatever support could be through the heart of nuba movie which was made by my friend Ken Carlson which

[02:35:32] I recommend everybody watch it I think it's a I'm sure it was done on a shoestring budget but it's so well done yeah you know it just sort of speaks for itself so anything raised through them goes to F Commission health care which comes to us without anything taking out Catholic medical Mission Board is another good source that's my sponsoring organization they're here in New York they've been here for over a hundred years and their semen bead orga think is their website these are probably the main sources for our work Anubha you know i'll close with a story tom that i think in many ways kind of defines you I remember when I decided I wanted to go to medical school

[02:36:10] I was applying for this scholarship and in the end I didn't get the scholarship but I remember during the interview this guy asked me a question he said you know what do you want to be at the time when I went to medical school I wanted to be a pediatric oncologist and I know what the guy was doing in retrospect I mean I think he was just trying to push me mm-hmm and he basically said like why would you want to do that you can't possibly make a difference you know without dedicating your life to research you're not going to have a difference saving one kid's life at a time etc etc and you know I remember thinking of a story after which in many ways exemplifies you to an extent that probably no one else which is you know in medicine you can do two things right you can you can do something very scalable through research you know you can devote yourself to to working on you know treatments for cancer or developing a new drug to treat this disease or that disease or you can be on the frontlines trying to save one life at a time so the story is there's these two guys walking down the beach and it's after a really high tide and the beach is covered in starfish and the starfish are gonna die pretty soon if they don't get back in the water which means they're pretty much all gonna die the two guys are walking and every few steps one of the guys bends down as he picks up a starfish and he throws it back in the water five steps later he does it again and again again after like the tenth one the one guy says to me goes what are you doing and he says well you know if these starfish don't get back in the water you know they're gonna die and he goes have you looked and seen how many of them there are you can't possibly make a difference yeah and he throws another one in the water and he says well it made a difference to that one right and I think for doctors that don't have the privilege of being able to affect the larger through research or policy changes whatever for people on the frontlines I don't think there's a human being on this planet who throws more starfish back in the water than you in the end medicine is individual it's the beauty of our profession and it's a huge privilege to have the opportunity to affect one person and in the end you close the door and it's you and the patient whether you're nuba mountains whether you're here in New York and that's an incredible privilege and I think if we keep that focus just one person at a time I think people can kind of relax a bit you can see that what you're doing for that one person you know I think people look at Africa and say you know what you're doing is a drop in the ocean I really like that story because when you're there you don't see a drop in the ocean you see a person you see a life want to see life and you see somebody that that can laugh and can cry and can play and can you know has aspirations and is a living breathing human being you think men we hope this one person that's a huge thing you know and I think that helps to stave off some of the burnout in the cynicism the fact that you are this is a very individual thing so one person is really a big deal is everything to that one person that one person's family and I think we really have to keep that in mind especially with this growing realm of cynicism and sort of negativity that we see now Tom I have been wanting to meet you for three years I didn't know that

[02:39:25] I'd ever get a chance to so it's it's sort of beyond a prayer which and I know that for you being outside of nuba is the toughest thing imaginable which is of course the irony sitting here in the plush New York City and yet all you're doing is pining to go back to a place where your own life is in danger but you know I remember thinking God I really just I'd love to be able to interview Tom and I remember thinking there's no way he could justify making the time to do this when his time in the u.s. is so short so when I asked

[02:39:56] Rick and Mark and John and they said that Tom would be happy to sit down I just I couldn't believe it and then I might make the case that of all the interviews I've ever done or will do this is the one I feel most privileged to so thank you thank you so much yeah thanks Peter this has been a real privilege for me to be here with you and thanks for giving us the platform to spread the word of it thank you so much you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at
