## Transcript

[00:00:00] whether you're saving money for your kids college if you wait till they're a junior in high school it's tough not much time if you want to save for retirement if you wait until your 60s it's really tough if you want to start being grateful and you want to wait till your 80s it's really tough but if you can build that which I hope I'm building in millions of young people this awareness and expression of gratitude it's not just awareness it's expression of gratitude because they will be enriched by expressing it and the person receiving it will be so I actually think and my dream and my hope is when I say the word Pay It

[00:00:45] Forward most people know what I'm talking about they know the concept of Pay It Forward means if somebody does something nice for you you in turn will do something nice for three people not necessarily have to do something for the person who was nice to you I want say it now to become as ubiquitous as common as that hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:14] AA hey Walter thank you so much for making the trip out to Austin from San Diego uh it's been two years or about a year and a half since we met right um for folks listening we met at uh the the the home slarty of a very close mutual friend to both of us Rick Elias who's also been a guest on this podcast uh and

[00:01:37] Rick did something very special for that two-day event which was really not a celebration of anything it wasn't a birthday or anything like that it was simply uh Rick deciding he wanted to bring a handful of his closest friends together for no reason other than to let us meet each other uh which I thought was a very beautiful um expression of friendship and I suppose exactly as he planned I am still in very close touch with a number of the people I met there which I think means it was mission accomplished uh did you have a similar experience so uh first I thought that's perhaps one's greatest gift if you can give the gift of a special relationship to people you care about there is no more beautiful gift and he structured that in an incredible way providing entertainment but mostly the opportunity where there was no introduction needed everybody knew each other because we all new Rick and I've uh heard about the impact of uh some of the words that I shared and so uh Rick has also shared what's going on with others so um I've been in touch with a few and uh it's it's very special when you can at this stage of my life to connect with people that have been qualified discriminated selected and with very high standards so it was a real treat it wasn't that we got to sit with everybody in an intimate setting because we were only there for basically 30 hours so I don't know how many meals that turned into but clearly the most interesting discussions or at least the closest discussions took place over meals and so by by Fortune you and I happened to be seated next to each other and maybe it wasn't an accident cuz if my my recollection is they were assigned seating for every meal so for one of the meals you and I sat next to each other which led to the inevitable hey what's your relationship to Rick because that was I think the way we all started our discussion and your son and Rick's son went to business school together actually your son and Rick I'm sorry went to business school together yeah let's not make Rick older than he is um but somehow we pivoted quickly from that into your story and what you're passionate about which is really what we're here to talk about today um but again my recollection Walter is that it wasn't you talking about your current project as much as it was an evolution of your life story I probably in my usual way just started pestering you with questions where did you grow up and you know tell me about your childhood and what brought you to where you are and U I was really riveted by the discussion so I think maybe for the of

[00:04:29] The Listener I'd like to reproduce as much of that as possible um so tell me tell us where did you grow up yeah so first of all I consider that the ultimate compliment when someone shows the interest in someone else so uh it's never pestering to me it's always uh for uh very satisfying so you know I was thinking about uh my life basically you know I'm in a very reflective mood at this age and it's basically been three stages

[00:05:00] I probably would call the first St and they've been running around 28 years in their 28 29 seems to be my staging haven't quite completed my well pretty much completed the third stage how old are you Walter I'll be 85 next month okay so the first 29 28 29 years were pretty much finding myself um just big picture the next 29 were making myself and the last 29 have been becoming myself so what would you like to know more of well I feel like so much of what defined the second and third because we're going to we're talking probably a lot about the insights that have come in the third phase but I suspect the seeds of those were sown in the in the first phase so if you're 85 it means that you were born uh at the tail end of the depression right you're you're born in the late 1930s 1938 yeah and so you're born before the war you come of age in the uh you know when the Baby Boomers baby boomers are coming alive um what was your childhood like and and where was it

[00:06:16] I know you were on the East Coast but I can't remember where yeah so the you know I basically when I think about it I think kind of what doesn't break you makes you uh the the childhood was for me challenging uh my father was uh a dreamer and he uh when I was one year old and my brother was two uh he found a place that he thought in the ader rondex would make a great dude ranch and he had been relatively successful he had saved I think $4,000 wow back then which was a lot of money and so he actually it was a chicken farm that didn't work out as a chicken farm converted it to a dude ranch and the third year after it opened there was a big flood wiped out the bridge and we went essentially bankrupt so my father at the time was in his 40s um and so we had to move back into Bronx in New York in a two-bedroom with his parents who didn't speak

[00:07:28] English and really that first stage I think I lived in 16 different cities so I won't go into all the details except to say that it really did set the stage for my life um but it wasn't just the movement from you know the adoric to the Bronx to Elizabeth New Jersey to Albany New York connected New York Coral Gables Florida

[00:07:52] Jackson Florida it wasn't the cities it was uh that my mother got cancer when I was nine and uh we went on our first vacation as a family she recovered back then they were doing major mctoy for breast cancer and our first vacation to Florida when we were living in Albany New York my father was coming a couple days later it was our first family vacation the four of us and my mother got a call that he had a heart attack so she had a fly home which was never easy from Florida New

[00:08:35] York as it is today um and so began a very different way of life I was 11 years old uh and we were reminded that we needed to make sure our dad was okay he was 47 at the time so that was a game changer and um the two things I remember specifically where all this movement preempted any chance to have a relationship I didn't have any friends there made no sense to have a friend I was going to be moving in a year or two so this absence of a relationship and

[00:09:15] I've always found in life that I think people who are really motivated are people who haven't had it when you have had it I think it's a little bit more difficult to be motivated so not ever having a friend really until I was I had a few in high school but prior to that none so the combination of no relationships and a fear that back then with breast cancer 5 years was a long time I got very lucky with my mother uh she lived a long life had cancer again but survived that as well um I went off to school at uh University of michig Michigan and uh two months later I got that phone call that my father had died from a fatal heart attack and he was in his 50s he 53 yeah and his brother died at 53 so um my dad was a little older than I was as a father and so we didn't have much in common and most of my concern was his welfare and his concern was his welfare and trying to provide for the family um but the gift that I got was this incredible branding that life is short it's unpredictable you never know and from then on I've been walking up escalators I just that's the way I live I'm very intentional I don't take anything for granted and so that was my major uh gift for my father um so those that was a tough period I graduated from University of Michigan which was a struggle because academically uh that was really tough for me but I managed to get through and after a short stint in the

[00:11:17] Army took a job with a fraternity brother I had no place to go uh I wasn't going to go back to Jacksonville Florida his father was in the industrial textile business and I got assigned to Pittsburgh industrial textiles is another word for shop towels or Rags depends on how glamorous you want to make it but the uh that was probably my 11th or 12th job I was selling women's shoes when I was a teenager I had been working ever since I could get qualified to get a job I was always afraid that

[00:11:52] I'd be on my own in any case I didn't have many options so I went to sell rags in Pittsburgh um two months after I started I came back to Ohio at the corporate offices and I was told I was doing a really good job and the man who had been training me who was an older man I thought was a really nice guy and at that sales meeting I got this message uh Walder you're doing so well just as soon as you could learn that job we're going to let that man go and I went back to

[00:12:30] Pittsburgh and I couldn't get out of my bed and so um uh there was no mental illness in our family nobody really understood cuz they couldn't see it so I ended up being hospitalized and uh didn't talk about that for 40 years because back then it was a real stigma I thought it would influence getting into a profession relationships uh being in a mental hospital was not something that you told people about tell me a little bit more about how how that happened so you're obviously in your mid-20s at this point 22 22 you you you hear this news it obviously upsets you you go back home when you say you couldn't get out of bed

[00:13:21] I assume you mean the the feeling of Damia and helplessness was so great that you had no desire to do anything yeah so when I said go back home I want to clarify home for me at that time was an apartment with three guys I had moved into a YMCA for a couple nights trying to figure out where I was going to live and so I was in a room with three strangers that's who I had been living with for two months so I came back from the corporate meeting from Ohio and went to where I was living I didn't call it home it was a rental apartment with three other guys um and never had it before never had it since but what happened was that I essentially I don't know I would say I became catatonic I just froze I could not move and so I literally somehow they got me on a plane to Florida and got me to Miami and then they said you'd be best off in a hospital in Massachusetts so I flew up and spent and what was the length of time from when you returned to

[00:14:25] Pittsburgh to when you wound up in that Institute in Massachusetts less than two weeks and what did you know your mom was obviously still alive what was her reaction and what did you say to her they had no idea they just knew that this young boy who was president of his high school fraternity and president of his college fraternity and his a very mature young man was incapable of moving and to show you how things were at that time I had an uncle who was very close to our family and and he saw me in bed and he said

[00:15:00] Walter just get up just just get up you're fine he had no comprehension of what being mentally sick was and what what happened when you got to the hospital so it was um a series of treatments um mostly dialogue and medication and when I arrived there it was it was very difficult cuz when I saw others I thought wow they they really look SI but I really couldn't do anything on my own so went from there to moving to Cambridge which I always have to laugh about because when I tell people I graduated from University of

[00:15:42] Michigan and then spent some time in Cambridge they always thought how this guy is really smart and he's really modest man went to that little school back East just outside of Boston right yeah so really that wasn't what brought me to Cambridge but uh it was on a terrific experience for me I learned so much about myself I was so afraid of failing and I failed and I survived so it was a great experience I spent two years in therapy learned a lot about myself how long were you hospitalized uh two three months again um you mentioned that there was medications involved do you remember what types of medications of the era I don't have a a deep enough knowledge of what the sort of Psy but presumably some sort of era appropriate anti-depressants apparently oh yeah I really did they use uh uh shock therapy I didn't have any shock therapy okay so um it was a great learning opportunity for me it was fantastic uh how did you know you were ready to leave oh that's the funny story actually I was seeing a therapist and it was inconvenient I was seeing him a couple times a week and I'm thinking this is like cut at the time I I was in public accounting I was selling mutual funds on the weekends I was really busy in having to go to this therapist that wasn't convenient I finally said to him after two years I said uh listen when when do

[00:17:11] I finish he said I think you're done that was it but I mean when did you leave the actual hospital after two to three months what prompted that oh what prompted leaving the hospital what prompted the leaving of the therapy U my guess I felt I was okay to return to society and how frightening was that you know Peter I can't actually say that uh it was frightening I felt like I was in a pretty good place I had always been in a good place it was like just this two or three months I just completely lost it and it might have been an accumulation of losing my dad in the freshman year never really dealing with that feeling the pressure of oh my God what am I going to do then finally getting a job and now I my job is to if

[00:18:00] I'm successful I'll let this guy go and I think it was just more than I could handle yeah it's interesting it seems that one of the real challenges of getting over an episode so uh traumatic would be the fear of not knowing if it could happen again did did you feel that the that through the experience of speaking with the therapists while you were an inpatient you had sufficient resolution of that such that you you weren't worried that you were kind of an accident waiting to happen an emotional train wreck that you couldn't anticipate I'm sure that was present but it I was sufficiently back to who I was this is this is a guy who had been in pretty good place for all but three months of his life and he had dealt with a lot of challenges along the way a lot of moving a lot of unknowns and parents health and challeng Es at school that were really tough for me so you can't say it'll never happen again because that's just I'm being a little naive but I never feared that it would happen again so you mentioned insurance so I assume when you got out of the hospital you did not go back to the textile company oh for sure uh actually

[00:19:20] I I was I mentioned a public accounting so I was in public accounting for three years so I got certified as a public accountant in the evenings I was selling mutual funds cuz I wasn't paid enough in public accounting at that time to survive on my own so uh I had two jobs all right so continue with the story I love it my brother called actually my brother Ray called from Florida and he said he had just made $1,000 in his part-time and I said that's that's more money than I'm making for my other two jobs what' you do he described he was involved in a multi-level marketing for a fellow by name of Bob Cummings and uh you'd be impressed because it had to do with health there were nutrition through biochemistry it was a sale of vitamins and minerals and Bob Cummings I think he had like seven kids and he looked half his age so I was anxious to make $1,000 so I became a distributor that was my third job uh I put an artic a little card up in the laundry mat where I was near where I was living and and uh the first person it said if you want to earn money in your part-time please give me a call you wouldn't get away with that today but back then that was okay so um person answered the phone um actually I answered the phone the person on the phone said I'll come over and I had my little audio visual kit and the slides and everything and she seemed really interested in selling the vitamins and uh as it turned out Bob

[00:20:54] Cummings said it solved arthritis and they shut him down three weeks later so I lost my $500 which is all I had but my first salesperson became my wife so it was the best thing that ever happened to me and that was at 22 we were married at 24 so what did you continue to do professionally okay sorry for this long uh list of activities but I then went into the hotel field um and actually we moved to New

[00:21:28] Orleans another move and really decided hotels weren't for me a search firm called and said there's a large Food Service Company in New York would I like to be the vice president of administration so uh Lola my wife and I were I call ourselves single we didn't have any children at the time um um but right prior to the move she became pregnant and delivered twins when we moved to New York for for my other job and I decided really the restaurant field wasn't for me either so now I'm with uh twin boys and in a field that still didn't work for me and I I had really developed a lot of competencies and when I Mentor people and Mentor young people as I do today those competencies I knew were transferable and then I I was contacted by someone who had a startup company in a new IND industry a new niche of an existing industry which is the development of high-end executive

[00:22:34] Conference Centers for corporations mainly Fortune 500 companies as an alternative to meeting in hotels so there were specially designed facilities with guest rooms and fitness and dining and and Recreation instead of the folding walls and the bad Acoustics and all the things and so that was a startup company uh I put my $10,000 that I had into a very very very small percentage of the company and uh it was funny it wasn't until I did that and I began to think with more compassion about my dad who had taken his 40,000 and put his life savings when he had a one and twoyear old and I had twin

[00:23:19] Oney olds and I was doing the same thing as he did in a very uh unestablished brand new niche of the hospitality business as it turned out the company almost went bankrupt in 3 years same pattern and um the founders were asked to leave and I was given the opportunity to become president I was 32 years old had 400 employees and over the next 25 years became the major shareholder we had 10 centers ran about 6,000 conferences a year with 150,000 Executives and that was my main event became a company that was owned by myself and some key

[00:24:00] Executives where in this journey does the thesis emerge for what became you know your 50th birthday if I recall right something you did something special at your 50th birthday which in many ways became kind of the the central theme of of what we're talking about right so now I'm into act two uh the second 29 years and so what I never really had as I described in act one were good friends and so now I was in my same home and I was going to live there for an extended period of time and so I began to make friends I'm not talking acquaintances I'm talking about people who I had authentic conversations with and I was so joyful that when I had my 50th birthday that I wanted to celebrate those friends and so I invited invited the five of them with their spouses and my family there were 17 of us I remember it like it was yesterday it was just the opening weekend of Phantom of the Opera and I really spoiled these people for a whole weekend and I really at that time was still Limited in my cash but

[00:25:19] I I knew I was coming close to 53 so it was important for me to celebrate those friends and so uh at the reception I paid tribute to each one of them in front of everybody about how they enriched my life what they had meant to me and um like Rick's Affair some of these people didn't even know each other but they became connected through me and so that was really my first iteration of this paying profound tribute to people while I was alive yeah

[00:26:00] I want I want to talk a little bit more about that I mean a lot of people would say sure I could invite some friends over for my birthday and I'll I'll make a toast to my friends but this isn't exactly what we're talking about here uh this is this is a bit more profound than that um how deliberate were you in this first rendition or manifestation of say it now and how much preparation did you put into what you would do with your five closest friends for that celebration yes well it began with the invitation and I mailed out a carton of apples and in each apple I planted a flag and each flag was a representation of another activity during that weekend and everybody appreciated the invitation except my son who was going to school at dartman and he said it was quite something carrying that crate of apples in the snow but everybody else seemed to like the idea in any case we had uh our twin Sons played the role of the Phantom they came in off of the the platform outside the room before with the smoke in the prior to the reception we had some wonderful dinners wonderful show rides on the carriage it was it was a life event that everybody really thought was extra special I also created for each of them a momento of a picture and then a summary which I still have to this day of two lines two sentences what each one present had meant to me and I distributed that momento at the end how surprised do you think they were by what you said and how much you made this day which look for most people when they're celebrating their 50th birthday it's all about them you seem to make this more about your friends do you think that caught them off guard and and can you tell how moved they were by that U well it was my first experience seeing how much people appreciate being appreciated and made more so when you knew it publicly and I received within a couple months I think a leatherbound book that I still read to this day of what that weekend meant to them meaning they collectively put this together as a gift back to you right so did you did you think at that point that this was a movement that could be larger than just something you did at your birthday no this was at the time just you know thinking about my life

[00:29:11] I I've never won any academic Awards ever and yet when I look back on it I seem to lead most groups and I began to wonder why is that I'm never the smartest in the room and I think I began to realize that I am a kind of like an experiential learner I kind of watch what's going on and I learned from that experience so for me though that that left an indelible impression but for me that was still locked into this fear that 53 may be done for me yeah so it had no longer term view than that I never had a longer term view of my life I remember attending a seminar when I was in a young president's organization the woman had an experience where she said I'd like you to close your eyes I was I don't know must have been less than 50 maybe L late 40s and they said Just Close Your

[00:30:13] Eyes picture what an ideal future would look like I closed my eyes and it was Black Tears ran down my face I went up to her cuz she was a psychologist as I don't understand I assume this was a positive experience for everybody this was painful she said does that have anything to do with how long you think you might live man of course that was what it was related to so to your question Peter this was never the beginning of what happened later on there were two more it seems like things happen in threes that was the First Act there was a second act when I was 70 that was a different story before we talk about that you you alluded to the idea that a part of the magic of this experience was that you didn't just tell these five people how much they meant to you you did it publicly why did you decide to do that even at the time was that just intuition um or did you have a a stronger belief set that it was more meaningful to do it that way as opposed to tell each of them privately the exact same things that you would have said oh I love that question

[00:31:33] I had spent by that time 20 years in the conference business and one of the focus that I had that was transferable was that I always saw the power of expressing something in a group so that if 10 people told you individually something it was not as powerful as 10 people Gathering to tell that person and so for in the positive and the negative both for sure for me it's always generally been the positive and it's so once again the life experience is Walter there's power in a group there's power there and so it seemed quite natural to me is there anything between 50 and 70 that I mean aside from the obvious which is at some point you're 54 and you realize you did it at what Point does the fear of you know well you know it's funny right mortality is 100% guaranteed right so so this idea that like you know we're afraid of dying is is a bit misguided in some ways it's we're afraid we don't know when we're going to die there's probably some fear of not existing as well and and understanding that life is finite but how did you come to grips with that as with each passing year you found yourself alive well it was a gift that kept on giving uh because I always had my foot down on the pedal not to the metal but down on the pedal uh

[00:33:16] I acquired a an innate intentionality that when people to this day say how do you do what you do and said one of the big reasons is I'm really good at deciding what I don't do and I've it's guided my life so I knew however long I would have I was just going to make the most of it and um I was very grateful for every year that's a really important Point

[00:33:49] Walter at what stage in your career did you go from kind of always incoming receiving taking every opportunity that comes your way to this more deliberate focus on saying no because I'm sure that the day you graduated from college you would have done anything I mean you did anything right um but at some point as a person matures and becomes more successful and they have more and more obligations the the no uh button becomes a very important button right how did you discover that and what were your guiding principles I would say that the fine tuning of that for for examp I always was concerned how much time but that doesn't give you focus that gives you just a concern for time but I attended a program at the center for constructive change um when I was in my 30s it was taught by Fred Jervis a may he rest in peace and it was a process of thinking that has has changed every day of my life I do not think in traditional ways that I thought before that I always think in Reverse so when I'm thinking

[00:35:10] I'm going to have the pleasure of spending time with you I don't think I never would ask you what will we do I would specifically said if this conversation is really successful what would have happened by the end of it for us to know that our time was well spent I ask that question for everything important that I do every day including personal interactions including personal interactions H I want to talk about that a little bit because that makes a lot of sense in some contexts right it makes a lot of sense at a meeting right if if you have your senior leadership in for a meeting it's it's really important to say what is the desired outcome of this meeting how do I want Behavior to change how do

[00:36:05] I you know how do I want people to feel whatever on the other hand I have a hard time wrapping my head around that in uh you know and I'm not saying I'm not pushing back on the idea I'm just sort of thinking through it which is you know I'm going away with my one of my kids for the weekend and you're saying instead of thinking through the activities you're going to do walk me through what you're thinking yeah so I'll give you a real life example uh was actually doing mentoring with one of Jason's friends he came to see me and he said you know I

[00:36:38] Jason's one of your sons yes y sorry so one of his friends he was I think in his 30s at the time and uh he he just came down to see if he could get some coaching uh and so I said well give me some situations you're dealing with he said Walter I work so so hard during the day and then I go home and I spend all my energy with my kids from morning to night at the end of it they don't seem very fulfilled and I'm exhausted and then I start all over again wow that's a tough life I have a question you might want to ask them they're now I think 9 and 11 years old I said when you get home Friday night why don't you ask him the question uh teacher to them if this were a really a fantastic weekend what would you like to have happen over the weekend they obviously gave them specifics he was able to do it in like a third of the time the kids had a fantastic time and he had two-thirds of his time to relax now do you always need the input of someone else when you're thinking through that no sometimes sometimes not no I would ask myself so if I were even meeting a friend or meeting a mentee I'd say well well do If This Were

[00:38:00] A really successful experience what would have happened by the end of it uh it's just I mean to me it's like saying good morning it's just so intuitive that it's there's not a formality it's a freeing Peter it's a freeing it is not a limitation it may sound like too much structure it's the ult ultimate of bring free cuz I don't ask myself what will I do I ask what is it that I'd like to have happen if I'm meeting with a friend who's going through a difficult time when I'm done I would like to figure out sometime during that time that I will help him lighten that load I'm not sure when but when I leave I want to be able to do that to me it's very natural very powerful very intentional very focused and very gratifying say a little bit more about what you learned or how you developed your pallet around saying no to things oh well that's a larger that's a larger question uh so this process of asking about what success would be for an individual one for probably over 40 years I asked myself the question if my life is successful over the next three years it used to be five now it's down to one but it's far enough out that I'm not thinking about what I did last year if I had an ideal life in the next three years how would I know it what would be happening and I would go from my personal relationships my family relationships my financial relationships um my health every key area of my life would have an indicator and that would be like my ideal outcomes and then I would kind of what I think think backwards well if I want to be you know uh my cholesterol at under 100 and I'm at 110 what would it be each six-month period so each one of them have benchmarks I may be getting into too much detail here for you Peter but each

[00:40:14] Benchmark is to me powerful because it says to me at six-month intervals if I make it I'm on track if I don't I haven't failed I just tell myself well whatever you're doing isn't sufficient so what are you going to do differently wow is that powerful so that's how I've been leading my life so to your question it is so easy for me to say no when it isn't consistent with the outcomes and the indicators that I've been committed to yeah that takes a bit of discipline doesn't it uh the first time it'll seem awkward after 44 years it's awkward not to do it yeah but I mean the discipline is in the ability to contemplate something that in the moment seems enticing you know people talk and are familiar with this idea of fear are missing out someone comes to you and says Walter I've got this great opportunity for you and D D D D D and on the surface it sounds pretty interesting but then you have to say wait how is that aligned with the goals that I have um you know one of the tools that I've learned for that and it's been very helpful for me I've been in a very concerted effort for the past five years approximately of trying to be more disciplined about that is um forcing myself to never say yes to anything when asked so even if I'm really leaning towards doing it just asking for a couple of days to think about it and um and if I just commit to that one rule that's like literally the Only Rule that

[00:41:54] I is is absolutely black and white which is this sounds very interesting Walter let me think about it for a couple of days and get back to you and then it just buys me the time to to try to do my own version of that um I still think I probably say yes to more than I should but I I think that that uh you know that one step has probably saved me 80% yeah that's great we all have our own techniques for me uh I have to say when you say it's a lot of structure my structure provides

[00:42:30] Freedom uh it it provides a built-in discipline and it allows for a lot of creativity because I never never talk about how I'm going to do it so I am completely free to figure out how so you mentioned something at 70 the second sort of phase of of insight say a little more about that yeah so now I had this experience when I was 50 and so still being sensitized to the 50s thinking well my father never worked out and I've been working out since I've been 30 so

[00:43:06] I've got a few more years over him so my adjusted age is 58 59 60 so it's still present so um well they have these moments it was Tim russert's funeral that I saw Tim russer yeah died at about what 2007 yeah 2007 in 2008 20 he was in his early 50s I thought he was brilliant with meet de press never been a moderator in my view this has been better and at his funeral with former presidents and astronauts and celebrities the tributes were unbelievable and it occurred to me he never got to hear it he's never going to hear a word of it that registered I thought that doesn't make sense and then I I I briefly mentioned

[00:44:02] I'm reading challenge So reading books are are very difficult unless they can be done in small chapters with no recall of the previous chapter so I I was able to uh read what Tuesdays with Mory that had been written where in his final years he got very authentic and very deliberate and I remember Reading part of the last lecture which a professor at Carnegie melon I think and and he wanted to do one last lecture cuz he was dying from cancer and he wanted to leave a message for his kids yeah I think wow and then the KPMG chairman in his 50s got brain cancer I believe it was brain cancer had four months to live and he wrote a book called chasing daylight about what he wanted to do in the last four months experiences experiences

[00:45:03] experiences it's either too late or it's almost too late I don't want that to be my life that may be customary but sometimes customary is not good it's just usual and common but not smart and I made a commitment and it was in my late 50s when I had those four or more impact that I was going to do it differently and I was coming on 70 and I thought oh said I did my 50 now my 70 and I asked Lola I said you know I have an idea for a gift for my 70th she said what is it I said I want to spend as much time as I need in the coming year to sit down with everybody had been important in my life I wanted to go visit with them I want to sit with them I want to have an experience with them after I talk with them and I want each one of them to know how important they've been in my life

[00:46:12] Lola has been either the Creator or the supporter of everything important in my life said if that's the gift you want you should take it and that's what I did for the following 11 months so after I was 70 I visited with 44 people brought me to Kenya to Mexico to Canada many places in the United States it was a remarkable moment of my life give me an example of of what such a meeting was like or what you know you obviously if you're seeing 44 people across the globe in 11 months we're we're talking about only days that you're spending with each person right right oh literally a day yeah so you would fly into Mexico

[00:47:02] City yeah so most of them were domestic that and in fact some of them I was able to do two in one trip or three in one trip I had a few in Florida so I would combine them so it wasn't like I had 44 trips some were from Southern California which is where I live it didn't require traveling so I don't I don't want to make this seem like this was a extensive travel whatever but I want to highlight the Simplicity of it first of all I hesitate to typically tell the story about 44 people because people and your listeners will probably say oh I don't have 44 people you have one at least and that's all I'm trying to inspire so for me the journey was my personal Journey had nothing to do with inspiring anybody for anything it was my personal journey and I said well what process will I use took out a legal pad and I wrote the question what difference did this person make in my life and I would put bullet points down underneath it sometimes it could be two pages but typically one I've got to go see him or her by the product of that process I took that legal pad with me and it was I had four bases that I covered in every conversation so yeah there's some systemization to this but each one was so different but they followed a similar pattern and what was that pattern well the first phas was just how did I have the Good Fortune of meeting you how did that happen then we talked about next base with all these shared experiences we had wow amazing Third Base was the major one I had my pad and I said this is for me to express to you how important you've been in my life and I want to tell you why because to me the spe specifity I never do say that word too easily uh was where the richness of the conversation it wasn't I love you it wasn't although I did tell them I love them it wasn't a general remark it was a specific remark so Third Base was the big one the fourth one was kind of for me which is that I had known these people over a thousand years and I said this is my only opportunity incidentally I recorded every conversation and because it's so hard to take in acknow knowledgement and appreciation at the end of this year I mailed to each one of them a picture 120w letter summarizing it and the CD which summarized our conversation and framed them and mailed it to 44 people but the last piece of it was that I wanted to learn something about myself and so I said listen I would appreciate if if you could give me one piece I'd like to create a mosaic about who I am would you be good enough to share with me what would that piece have been from your perspective and that was my fourth base that's the whole experience that's the whole process what was the most interesting you learned interesting thing you learned in that year about life not necessarily about yourself but just about life and the richness of it well uh first thing was how blessed I was you know relationships are interesting in the sense that I equate it like I put a flashlight in a dark room that those qualities of the friends were always there but I just brought them to light and when you bring them to light it's an extraordinary feeling I mean if you had one or two or three it matters not um so I would say that was the I mean here's a guy who never had a friend until he went to high school come on so I felt such a richness from The

[00:51:39] Experience actually towards the end I was in Kenya uh on actually another mission um actually building a school over there and the founder of this nonprofit heard what I was doing and in fact was on the journey and he said well would you tell the story at dinner about what you're doing and they all broke into an

[00:52:03] Applause at the end I said you know maybe this story has to be told more maybe it shouldn't just be a personal story and so once again lus I guess it was about really right in right during this time had lunch with an acquaintance told the acquaintance about what I was doing acquaintance said I'd like to hear the story turns out she was the editorial director of Hay House and three days later I had a contract to write the book and that became another platform called it's called This is the moment um how one man's year-long

[00:52:45] Journey captured the extraordinary power of gratitude you know it's interesting you talked about how some people might hear that you know 44 people made this list and this a pretty selective list right you you were very deliberate in saying these are not acquaintances these are very close friends these are people who you could have these I mean these are Big questions not how did we meet not you know what are the shared experiences but the telling them with great specificity the impact they've had on your life that's not a big group of people the fact that it's 44 for you is probably not surprising to anyone who's listening to this conversation uh or to anybody who knows you and it probably speaks to how deliberate you are at cultivating relationships I think it's a cliche but it's a cliche for a reason that you know richness in life is much more about relationships than other successes whether it be you know success in

[00:53:51] Victory success in material uh you know or monetary means um do you find that one can realize that without some suffering in other words how much of a role did the pain that you experienced in the first 29 years of your life paradoxically become the greatest asset to allow the second and third 29-year periods to have this degree of richness that's a wonderful question uh clearly I was at an advantage because of my deprivation but I think there's a level of Consciousness and that I have oh there have been thousands of people who have since acted on this message and there have been remember I knew it was going to be good because I it wasn't even he was an acquaintance and he's a motorcycle cigar smoking really tough dude he said that's a hell of a message he said there are some people I need to speak to and so the wide range of people that realize we are not self-made everybody really knows that the question is are we going to acknowledge those people that help make us while they're here it's not complicated it's not complicated what I find incredible and why I'm kind of really excited about this latest movement and we can maybe get into more of that in the discussion but I think my contemporaries and either and even people in their 40s and 50s they've been so focused on the traditional measures of success that relationships are not um don't have the focus and at the end of of the day you know I was another couple chapters I read of a book called How do you measure life or something like that written by a professor at Harvard now these are all these bright guys who graduate from the business school go out and become

[00:56:09] Financial who was and and in five or 10 years they've made a fortune they come back for a reunion and they're miserable he said there's something wrong with this picture and he changed his Focus to have them look at what successful life looks like not how much success you may have in business and I think there is an enormous opportunity missed opportunity in really placing education around what's really important and I don't know about you but to me there's nothing more important than my marriage I have 60 years over 20,000 days my children they're grown twins uh my good friends what did they ever teach me about that where did I ever learn about what it is to be a compassionate loving caring husband or father or a friend what do you do when your friends are struggling how are you helpful how do you show compassion show me a school and that's where I'll go one of the things that I want to understand a bit better Walter is I know a lot of people who are surrounded by people that are supposedly friends and they have worldclass experiences constantly but deep down they don't seem particularly enriched by them and I don't want to sound judgmental because one can never know from the outside but my appearance is that both these so-called friendships seem superficial and the experiences maybe seem too honic and not not relationally rich it's also clear that when you talk about these 44 people that that's not what it was about right it wasn't I suspect that when you talked about the experiences you shared with them it wasn't you know you know when we when when we you know when we went to Vegas that weekend and you know gambled all this money away and you know I mean like or or you know just got you know partied really hard or something like I I suspect that some of the experiences you talked about sharing were very subtle um how do you think that you naturally gravitated towards that and why do you think that is not necessarily a natural thing for people to do yeah wonderful I uh I think it a lot has to do with our life experiences I don't have much time to waste um I really this urgency from your literally the fear of death I don't know if it's a fear of death it's the realization somebody wasted an hour of my time this week it was a pure waste

[00:59:25] I really resented it and they didn't do it intentionally it just turned out to be a wasted hour I would have rather written out a check I can't get that hour back so I tend to not have a lot of time it was I have to laugh because one of the fellows I've been in these uh what we call forums there groups of 10 or 12 presidents one I've been in for 37 years one for 20 years another one for 22 years I've been to like 800 of these sessions well they're all authentic they're all about life I've spent probably 4,000 hours talking about

[01:00:06] President's issues as deep as you could be so that's where I spend a fair amount of time all my mentoring my mentoring is about real life issues uh it's not about entertainment and friends that I hang with are typically ones where I can have meaningful conversations so I really think it's how you normally relate in your life I think it's getting to the point where people are more comfortable being open I also find when people get older they're getting a little bit more comfortable I myself was very secretive in my 20s I'm not secretive now they're all lessons so uh it's kind of interesting in the group I would not in these men's group groups I would not be the smartest for sure I would not be the first one I would call to go have a beer with I don't drink it but they wouldn't ask me anyway I'm not that kind of that's you're not the bantering kind of person but the moderator of the group said

[01:01:12] Weller I don't know if you know it but this is the person who was on The Journey he said of all the members of the group you'd either be the first or second person that everyone would come to if they had an issue why do you think that is is that that innate is that deliberate meaning is that is that a skill you are cultivating is it simply part of your personality me let's be clear I think it's interesting to me that the the the straw that broke the camels back in your own mental breakdown was one born of empathy I mean it was that you couldn't stand to take this older man's job um and while I'm sure many people would be disheartened by that proposition and even if someone just chose to say well I'm not going to go back to work it impacted you in a way that was so much deeper right if someone's listening to this thinking I would like to be a person that at a minimum my friends could come to when there's a problem not necessarily everyone would feel that way who knew me but those who know me well but it's not happening you know I can't tell you the last time someone came to me uh because they have a problem what do they need to do to cultivate that skill and let me ask you a follow-up question in a moment uh which is why should one want to have that well first the question is how do you develop that skill I think it I think it's based on authenticity and empathy and compassion and I think we all have it I don't know that we all use it but I think deep relationships you mentioned earlier the people who have these wide range of friendships and in I want to correct these were not all good friends of mine that were on the list I don't want to these are all people who had significantly impacted my life that doesn't necessarily mean that they were my good friends I see many of them were the primary selection criteria was these people altered the course of your life and some of them might have been a professor in college well the the blind man in New Hampshire who me how to think

[01:03:25] I might have seen him 30 times in my life he would not be someone who's a friend yep I got it okay um in terms of why would someone want to be more authentic

[01:03:42] um that's an individual Choice um I think there's a natural aptitude to show and tell and for me authenticity transcends Show and Tell um I find it very rich I find a lot of these apparent friendships were really just we were in the same organization together and they were very friendly you leave the organization and you don't see them again that's not a friend that's just an association and I think sometimes it gets confusing and sometimes as you elate yourself in the world people will befriend you in ways that you actually think they're a friend but they're really in some cases just because of an association so let's go back to to Tim russert's death Circa 2008 this has a profound effect on you right you see all of these people coming to say the most amazing things to him that he never got to hear so what what else crystallizes for you there well the um that was one of three or four that came right at me and it followed a real rememory of my 50th and the fact that oh my God I'm going to make 70 um I think those compounded it the 70th experience in which I wrote the book I spoke about the book people wrote me about what the message had meant to them because the book was structured in three ways one is how did I come up with this idea where did it come from it's absolutely unbelievable to me and now

[01:05:29] I'm seeing more research come out because mental health is becoming so much more of an issue they're now coming out with studies that are done five and 10 years ago about the power of gratitude makes you feel better it's less depressed and I none of mine was based on any study it was all experiences so the feedback I got from the speaking on the subject matter really elevated my appreciation of the power of the message and it has been gaining and then really a decade after the book was published it still had legs I heard uh uh from a girl in the Philippines who had picked the book up in a library and she wrote me an email and she said I just wanted you to know I was thinking of killing myself first of all I had no idea how the book was in a library in the

[01:06:28] Philippines but she said I i' had been abused in my family and I was so angry I wanted to end it she said but I saw it and I read your book and I realized there are a number of people who have actually helped me in my life and how can I forget that at this moment we had one or two exchanges a decade later I heard from her she's married living in I think Denmark or

[01:06:55] Sweden and there are many of these stories but it it elevated to me the importance of thinking about maybe there's a more powerful way to do it most of my life has been spent oneon-one in small groups all my mentoring is oneon-one all my small groups is 12 people or less my conference business was 25 people or less typically the book was the first time that I have influenced thousands of people and during the pandemic I thought oh this is going to make this group get together end and I actually was having a conversation with my son he said you know you could do it by

[01:07:38] Zoom I said really and so three days later we did the first of the living tributes he insisted on using me and brought my mentees together and that evolved into what became the Sayan now move movement today and uh this may be my biggest Legacy how does a person go about doing this well uh first of all this is not a business of mine I'm I invest in it there's no there's no royalties there's no rewards there's nothing so this is uh I want to make it really simple this is not complicated uh once again I will tell you of the thousands of stories that I've heard over the years I've never heard one that the person said I'm sorry I just got a card from someone this past week he sent me he said I just want you to know you inspired this the card was printed 70 for 70 and he proceeds to say he has written to 70 people on a 70th birthday he outdid me so I dropped him a note asked him what the experience was like very similar experience oh my God it was so easy to do it felt so good it reconnected me with people at levels I haven't been at it's not complicated there were short notes to each of those people and I say it doesn't matter how but it does matter now I recently came across the book it was an interview wasn't a book an interview by Hadley

[01:09:25] Vos veos I believe is uh she is a hospice nurse she just wrote a book called in between and in it they asked her the question if you had an ideal death what would it be like after you see these people who have had these for months before they die and she said well for me I would want people to come to me and tell me that they uh that I mattered before I died right when I was dying I'd like to hear that she said I was with these people for six month before they died their Central word was

[01:10:04] I don't matter to anybody then she would go to the funerals of these people and hear the tributes that are paid to the person who's dying who feels unloved unappreciated unacknowledged so so what I decided was in some ways we have to unlearn this idea that what is customary you have to unlearn celebrations of Life are great for some things Memorial services are great but they're not for paying tribute to somebody who's been important in your life those are not the moments for that why do you think we do that Walter custom cust but is there some level of discomfort we have I mean when you say it this way it's so obvious right like there's nothing you're saying right now that anybody listening to this would go no that doesn't make any sense we should absolutely let those people in hospice die thinking that they didn't matter and wait till they die to tell a bunch of other people how important they were you know again when you state it that way it sounds ridiculous but there must be some reason that this custom has stuck and it's wonderful that you're going to sh matter that but as I even examine my own life and I think of these people in high school in college in at all stages of my life who mattered it's very it's it's clear to me that most of them might not realize it now right I was with a limousine driver and he was asking me we started he said what do you do so I told him the story he said oh my

[01:11:58] God my immediate thought goes to my basketball coach now he must have been in his 40s That Guy taught me so much about life and about playing it wasn't about the game I said well is he still alive yeah maybe you should connect with him the next time he picked me up to go to the airport he said I got to tell you something I met with my basketball coach

[01:12:21] I said what was that like I always loved this I get psychic income out of all these stories right he said I called him I said coach I haven't seen you in a long time i' like to come see you sure come on so he comes and he's he's i'll see on the basketball court so the young fellow says a coach I didn't come to play basketball what' you come for I said I need to have you sit down on the bench I want to tell you what you mean to me change their lives so the the reason that I think it's a little hard is cuz not too many people are modeling that this is the way to do it so I thought strategically what we should really do is teach younger people about doing it they don't have to unlearn anything so my major thrust this past year has been to educate young people and they are teaching materials now I think we're in 38,000 ,500 classrooms around the world and so 75 different countries so it is a global this is what type of classrooms

[01:13:33] High School uh they're primarily fifth through the 12th grades and they all have materials on practicing say it now and so that's where it's starting because they're going to go home tell their parents I got a note from Joanne in Ontario Canada our fellow Canadian and kindergarten teacher who had been so committed to her profession but during the pandemic it was so tough and then when she went back to school with these kindergartens where it was their first experience she introduced say it now to kindergartens and she writes and she said they one child chose to express what I meant to her by doing a drawing and she told me what the drawing meant and why she appreciated me in the drawing and how she helped me learn how to sing and why that made a difference this is a kindergarten so my hope I set a goal for a million expressions of gratitude by my 85th birthday which is next month we crossed a million

[01:14:48] four and we're just beginning what does finishing strong mean to you well you'll see the pattern so uh I had a recent medical scare that I thought H maybe this is 53 after all except this 83 or 84 and so I asked myself the question Peter I think you could probably ask it right now you've heard it for our conversation I said to myself if you could ideally finish strong now in this case it was end of life what would be happening how would you know and I detailed key results and for the last year I achieved all of those results what were some of those things one is we we have two homes uh and when something happened to me I think it'd be a lot for my wife and so I said I need to find an environment for her that would provide a lifestyle and so last week we moved into a place that would provide that lifestyle we still have our primary home but this place would be a place we're already starting to transition so she would feel comfortable uh um

[01:16:25] I I am very current I talk about currency you know I'm very current with my relationships really current um I make sure I've circled the block with all my mentees that have been important they all came to my tedex talk or most of them came to my tedex talk which gave me a chance once again to publicly acknowledge how they each had changed my life now is that counterintuitive not for me because I had so as much as I enjoyed my tedex talk this year the dinner following was so significant for me so in terms of additional things there was one investment that would require some work uh it's not an operating company but just an little involved investment I don't want my wife to have to think about that so I'm just finishing liquidating that so everything is very easy my wife has a list of here are 15 things to do from a financial point of view if something happens to me this is exactly what you do 15 Steps up to date my financial affairs are up to date my friendships are up to date still working out still hoping for the best and I got some good news uh cancer that I had a year ago is in remission and uh somebody up there thinks I got some more work to do when do you think people should be thinking about this I mean in some ways you could argue given you know that we have no idea when we're going to die and um obviously being 85 versus being 45 the odds are much longer you know but what um you know how should a person operationalize that because that's a very tactical list of things some of those are at least right like the financial planning the consolidation all of that stuff is is is do you have a sense of how many people I'm assuming it's men typically dying before their female spouse um are are are kind of leaving their spouse I don't know ill suited to deal with the chaos of their demise yeah I've been doing this for 35 years Peter um so this one was a little grander before I always had my estate in order and provided life insurance and homes and the things that are for their comfort this one was really a little this one had a different tone to it um I also want to say that that I think we wait too long to give it now and I part of what I accelerated was was um I've been spending the last 30 years in philanthropy I accelerated that program and not just for nonprofits but for people who have been important to me but haven't been as successful I accelerate it is it normal no are you worried about giving people money a little but I'm worried more about not same thing it's not customary I understand and one person said it's difficult of all the people one person said I just can't do it and I said well meaning one person could money and I said to them I really understand and I appreciate you being so honest about it but let me tell you a little story and that is you're keeping me from the pleasure of giving a gift so give some thought to it she said

[01:20:17] I can't keep you from that pleasure and I gave it to her how much of this do you think your twins have naturally been infused with through the osmosis of your example well I I I have had evidence that they the modeling is more important than the speaking and um I'm very proud of them and I think they get the message and they'll do it in their own way uh with their own approach and how much of this is something that you think happens between parents and children as well in other words do you find yourself also having the same discussion with your kids and with your wife and um I I mean I I I can't imagine you don't feel that way about them I know how much I do right I mean I I sort of look at my my wife and my kids and acknowledge that without them I'd be in a pretty rough situation um I wouldn't be the person I am including whatever external you know successes I've had um so do you have a different way in which you communicate that to family you know one of the things

[01:21:41] I I recall is uh and perhaps this isn't an exact answer to your question but what I heard the question being is how do they model some of what they may have learned from you and how do you learn that they in fact get it uh that may not have been the precise question but I remember one of our sons writing he used Father's Day for the occasion and he said you know when I think back over our life together he always gave me footsteps to follow when I needed someone to lead you always walk behind me when I needed encouragement and you always have been by my side when I needed a friend I've read that a thousand times that was from my son

[01:22:49] Jonathan from my son Jason he is written both on the occasion of my 80th birthday and most recent Father's Day all of the messages that he got from me over the years in his own way so um means a lot to me as a matter of fact one thing I wanted to highlight was when I was going through this and this is really what I've learn learned in the last year that I never knew beforehand when I was kind of thinking that this could be the final year for sure and there were some other issues going on that I was also preoccupied with at the end of the day I have a a portrait of the 44 people on my journey in my office I have next to that pictures of my mentees and I turn on Brooks violin conero which

[01:23:58] I love and I go one to one there are probably almost 60 lives that I touch during it reminding myself of what they had given me I feel so blessed I have so much oxygen I have never been in a better place than in the toughest year of my life this past year I mean that's just amazing Walter um and I I certainly don't doubt the sincerity of of how you say that but again that's a very counterintuitive way to describe what could easily be the last days of your life the last year of your life um what I I want to understand a little bit more more what you think is driving that sense of Peace because it can only be described as a sense of

[01:25:01] Peace um I I I I have to say I don't personally feel peace in that way right if I if I try to imagine this being the last year of my life there's no there's I wouldn't take a positive thought from it I mean I I I would be I'd be very sad and you could say well Peter that's because you're 50 and Walter's 85 maybe but I would bet that there are a lot of 85y olds who also wouldn't have much peace knowing that they're at the end and how do you reconcile the peace that you can have at the end of your life with the fact that you undoubtedly have more to do cuz to me that's the struggle MH oh I love that question first of all I think there is a difference between being 50 and being 85 uh I was on the island of

[01:26:03] Corsica and I literally was on a cruise taking off the cruise and had to be operated on immediately in a clinic if they didn't I would have died and I said in my 60s just give me a little more time I promise I'll be of service I had already been of service had no intention of doing else haven't done any business in the last 30 years all I've been is been so that was not a big commitment it was a natural commitment and I bought more time I think if we don't turn on the flashlight to bring light on what we've been blessed with there is no opportunity to get much fulfillment at the end for the gratitude that these blessings have provided so in a sense it's to your point which is whether and it relates to whether you're saving money for your kids's

[01:27:05] College if you wait till they're a junior in high school it's tough not much time if you want to save your retirement if you wait until your 60s it's really tough if you want to start being grateful and you want to wait till your 80s it's really tough but if you can build that which I hope I'm building in millions of young people this awareness and expression of gratitude it's not just awareness it's expression of gratitude because they will be enriched by expressing it and the person receiving it will be so I actually think in my dream and my hope is when I say the word Pay It

[01:27:48] Forward most people know what I'm talking about they know know the concept of Pay It Forward means if somebody does something nice for you you in turn will do something nice for three people not necessarily have to do something for the person who was nice to you I want say it now to become as ubiquitous as common as that and someone says you know I need to do a say it now for

[01:28:13] Jean I need to do a say it now for Peter I believe that will Elevate our own sense of value you I want to make the other point it may be helpful to you and others I always want to get done with this project before I go but I came to two conclusions during this last finishing strong exercise one was that I never wanted to leave my wife a widow we've been married 60 years never wanted her I work out every day almost every every day most every day cuz I wanted to outlive my wife I came to the realization that is not for me to decide that's going to just be what it is you can do the best but if she's a widow just take care of her as you would want her taken care of and relax have peace have peace so the other thing was I got to finish the project and I said

[01:29:24] Walder you've been doing projects for the last 30 years and you're not going to stop doing projects so you by definition will die with an unfinished Symphony that is the nature of your life and don't stop just so you could finish yeah I I think back to one of the other friends that Rick introduced us to at the the event um which was the gentleman who was a little over hundred years old and who who's still who's still working on deals he's still talking to

[01:30:05] Rick about business ideas and just he's it's like he it's like he's 50 years old yeah um and I really think you know it's it's impossible to to prove these things scientifically because you can't do randomized controlled experiments so we'll never truly know the causitive nature of having a purpose in longevity right but it's very hard for me to believe that there isn't causality there meaning that the people who continue to have a purpose in life and again your purpose for the past 30 years has hasn't been to make a dime it's been in this say it now movement uh for some people their purpose in life is public service through politics for some people it is indeed working in the private sector the point is I think the people who continue to have some sense of purpose that is far beyond their themselves and their own joy and pleasure um undoubtedly seem to live longer yeah I I wouldn't be surprised if people you know I was thinking today of the word pasttime well Pastime you know well it helps past time and I it takes my breath away when somebody says that past time wow for me it's purpose time you give me time it's purpose time um and and I I can't imagine not not living that way but I don't suggest that everybody will live that way I can only suggest that for me it's given me an extraordinary life and it didn't start

[01:32:04] When I Was 80 it didn't start when I was 70 started when I was in my 20s yeah and I and I and I don't want to suggest that that the purpose of a person's life needs to be as Grand as your ambition or you know starting a new business um it can be simply taking care of another person I'm constantly struck you know one of the things I do with all of our patients is take a detailed family history before we start I can't tell you the number of times I go through the family history and we're talking about their grandparents and they'll say you know one of them died from some disease and the other one died very shortly thereafter despite being completely healthy they just lost interest in life and they would they describe it to me as they died of a broken heart or they just stopped thriving um and I think that's an extension of this as well I think having having that other person there is is part of purpose yeah so Peter you really not only are you making these keen and important observations I just want to take a moment to say you know you work really hard at this and you need to know just on behalf of those people who have read your book unfortunately I had to choose just one chapter cuz I'm only a one chapter guy of course I choose the one on emotional health that I thought was to me it was the door to you it was the one that proved to me you're really authentic and the person that I wanted to connect with and I think your conversations that you're having carry that chapter 17 with you in all that you do and that you are enriching lives of millions of people through your right writings and through your podcast and through your good work and um I personally just wanted to acknowledge you for that and I wanted to just piggyback the thing um you know after 60 years of marriage best decision I ever made and nobody ever helped us being a good husband nobody ever helped us and for sure we didn't have great models my father died as I've described so I didn't have a good model so where do you learn it from the most important decision in our life we have no training for as I mentioned earlier nor with kids but one of the things that is amazing to me and I'm getting very respectful of why so many marriages don't last and that is there are so many stages I describe three stages of my life but in marriage you've got the dating you've got the marriage with no kids then you got the kids and then the kids leave the house and then you retire and then the last chapter is one of them slows down a little bit so I am married to an

[01:34:55] Energizer Bunny who's slowing down a little and during the pandemic I got a chance to love her in a way that I never did before and that's another thing you never know you always know you love the person you married the question is can you always love the person equally or more when they're not quite the same person you married and I want to suggest that

[01:35:25] Lola is still super active but she's not as active as she used to be so um this is to your point is I love caring for her when she needs it I love it and I do think that story that you just mentioned is to the extent to which we are so self-focused I don't know if you can die from it but you won't live from it you won't live a long life from it and I think it's the focus on others that provides me with my energy I said to myself during this recent challenge don't take anything away from me that'll prevent me from helping others I refuse that treatment I'll take as long as I have as long as I could be helpful to others so Walter folks are well first I want to thank you by the way for what you said a moment earlier uh that means a lot to me um um so thank you well deserved if someone's listening to this conversation and hearing about this idea of saying it now for the first time and it resonates with them where do you recommend they start well it's going to sound self-promotional but I have nothing to promote so there's no business here I would go to justs sayit now.org

[01:36:51] MH and it'll give you the concept you'll also have my Ted Talk on it you'll also have I have a theme song for for say it now so there's a song uh in the coming months there'll be a book but for a person who says you know that makes sense but I I don't know how to do that uh there are tools right on that website that could help and and whether it's a note a phone call it is very uncomplicated and I've never seen anybody uh you know I I I come back to the story of the fellow who I had a few years ago had dinner with and he he said to me what do you do the same kind of qu what do you do I said it doesn't really matter you can call him you can do all these things and so the website will help you with that he called me about a month later and he said I I I want to come tell you what happened I said I love these stories I always encourage people tell me tell me about him because that is my psychic income in this transaction and so he said Walder I want you to know I wrote 17 letters I said oh that's great and he said one I wrote to my sister that I haven't spoken to in 10 years I realized she was a great sister what she did that ended the relationship always bothered me but when

[01:38:15] I looked at our life I realized she'd made a real difference and it rekindled our relationship H it's easy to do the outcomes are sometimes very surprising and always rewarding Walter thank you very much for coming all the way over here um I wanted to do this in person and I know it's been hard to for us to get together and we could have done this a year ago uh remotely but but I I I really believed and I and I believe now that it it's it's this is a discussion I wanted to have with you sitting a few feet away for me so thanks for for trusting me to uh take take time which is precious and

[01:38:57] I know it's taken you away from something else and someone else but um I think sharing this story with with a lot of people here through this podcast is um is a great way to continue your legacy so thank you I appreciate the opportunity you know I when I'm committed to something I do it when it's inconvenient when I'm interested in something I only do it when it's convenient and I have no interest I only have commitments and I was committed to having this moment happen with you so thank you for the [Music] opportunity
