-Nir’s background and interest in aging and endocrinology [3:30];
-History of metformin, and understanding the mechanism [11:15];
-Attempting to define insulin resistance [21:15];
-Metformin as a possible anti-aging drug [48:45];
-The TAME trial: Targeting Aging with metformin [57:45];
-Why Nir believes metformin can slow aging [1:16:30];

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD comm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive and happy New Year to everyone we took a week off as you probably noticed so hopefully everybody's ready to jump back into this fun stuff my guest this week is NIR Barzilai and if you're at all into the space of longevity he'll be no stranger to you nir is the founding director of the institute for aging research the nathan shocked centre of excellence in basic biology at Albert Einstein he's completed two fellowships one in metabolism at Yale the other in endocrinology and molecular biology at

[00:01:15] Cornell he directs the longevity genes project and in my estimate near is probably the most knowledgeable person ever on the genetics of longevity and we talk a ton about that during this episode he also is leading the effort to test metformin in a prospective clinical trial for non diabetics with respect to aging and this is referred to as the tame trial we get into that obviously in detail here and also will use a lot of the data for that in the show notes this is in many ways I think an ear is probably one of the most insightful people when it comes to understanding the clinical benefits of metformin and we talk about that a ton we also talk about insulin resistance I can't resist the urge no pun intended I guess to get into sort of a detailed discussion on what IR is with sort of people who are really deep in this space we talk a lot about IGF and growth hormone and I got to tell you this is a topic that you've probably heard me waffle on a little bit because I'm still really kind of on the fence about this relationship of IGF GH i think the centenarian data point in one direction

[00:02:24] I think the epidemiology outside of centenarians point in a different direction and of course none of this really speaks to the question I get asked constantly which is do you think administration of growth hormone is beneficial from a lifespan or healthspan perspective or do you think it's harmful and you know truthfully I've always leaned towards the harmful side but we get into this in detail and near offers some great insights certainly for me I was I was really helped by this process we do go back and talk about the centenarians and because I'm in the midst as some of you know writing this book I'm knee-deep on health literature and so it was really great to kind of clarify a few things that I think even if you're not steeped in this stuff what you'll find very interesting and of course we talk about all of my other favorite topics like at Hoffa G caloric restriction we even get into a little bit of the stuff around nad and nicotinamide ride beside and things like that so overall I think this is a bit of a technical episode but not that technical we've certainly done more technical stuff the show notes will be valuable as always especially for the show of this nature so with nothing else to add please welcome to the show NIR

[00:03:29] Barzilai in here how are you I'm terrific how are you I'm good I can't believe not only did you make it down here on time but you made it down here ahead of me and my own place nice to stay young yeah this is yeah I don't know these these days is this weather so unpleasant but yeah you beat me here I was a bit unpleasant for you because you're in California most of the time yeah yeah I think that's part of it but you're from Israel so this has to be unpleasant for you too Israel it was too warm for me I'm okay got it well speaking of which so you were born in Israel you spent how long there were you in the bid you served military time there yes I served military time I was a nurse and a medical student I went to the Technion medical school I went then to Hadassah Hospital for residency which

[00:04:23] I and only then I came to the United States I was at Yale with Ralph de Franz Oh doing metabolism actually I was looking at the mechanism of action of metformin in 1987 before it was approved for use in the United States there's a serendipitous connection to that later and then I went to Cornell for an endocrine fellowship and then I was recruited to Einstein and so my first part of my life was metabolism but then

[00:04:56] I started doing what I really was interested in and this is Aging in the biology of Aging and I remember reading a quote once from you that said maybe paraphrasing but metformin is the reason I came to the United States well in a way it was but this is life in retrospect right I wasn't really expecting I was done with metformin in 1988 that was done with metformin until it started again about you know three four years ago well I can't wait to talk about metformin because there probably

[00:05:28] I'm trying to think if I think of four or five eggs on Janus molecules which is just the terminology I use to describe anything that you ingest or take that comes from outside the body so I would include drugs supplements hormones anything in there but when you lump all of these things together if I were to say what are the three or four of these that I am asked about the most frequently from patients or frankly anybody if I'm at I'm at a party and I let it slide what I do for a living the first question is should I be taking metformin and there's usually a handful of others that they want to know about should I be taking nicotinamide ride beside although they usually don't say that they usually say should I be taking nad or something to that effect so it's wonderful that we will be able to speak today because few people can speak about metformin the way you kept and so I'm really looking forward to that but before we go down that path I do still want to kind of understand a little bit more about your journey and your interest in endocrinology did you know from day one when you entered the field of medicine that this was the area that you wanted to study yes I was interested in aging from the time I was pretty much thirteen and spend weakens with my grandfather who was telling me his life story and his life story wasn't easy and he did lots of physical things and he dried the swamp and he did this and that and I'm looking at the man who was then 68 years old that walks slowly he's obese white hair and he just didn't look like somebody who did everything he told me to do and you know they say that children have imagination but most kids don't see their grandparents as what they will be right they see them as I don't know how they got there and this really stuck with me and I started to be interested in the biology of Aging when I was for example when I did my residency I always was interested in how not what's the age of the patient but does he look older or younger than his age I kind of realized intuitively that there's a chronological age and a biological age and what is these differences between the biological and chronological age and of course is a physician it looked like endocrine is a good place to start because you knew that there's a lot of endocrinology in aging and you assumed that hormones are going down or some are going up but if you could fix that maybe you could fix a lot of aging now everything that happened in my life was fascinating from the biology of Aging replacing the hormones wasn't really part of it but we'll get to it going back to the hormone thread the most obvious example of changes in hormones with aging of course occur in women where you know they have this very abrupt change in one of their endocrine systems this androgen system did you think about it even more broadly than that for example like what was happening in thyroid hormone and what was happening in fuel partitioning hormones and other things like that oh absolutely absolutely but I'll tell you to the point when there was a discussion whether to do the women Health

[00:08:48] Initiative you know many people thought this is a waste of time you know we know the test region is good for women there's lots of studies like that of course it's major in aging and I didn't look at it this simply for maybe two reasons one is men are also aging and in several ways similar to women and that's not an estrogen story and it wasn't the testosterone decrease wasn't really as dramatic as estrogen decrease so I I didn't I thought that there's a lot of aging that's done without estrogen let's start with that and also you're replacing just one hormone with lots of

[00:09:28] Verona's are changing it didn't look like a good study to me well especially at the time and I try to be temper my criticism for that study by trying to have some empathy for the fact that the investigators were dealing with what the treatment protocols were at the time but to use oral estrogen that's you know conjugated aquaian to use synthetic progestin and not even actual progesterone and there you could come up with a list of 18 things that in retrospect are so obvious why that study was a failure absolutely true but the other part of that is that the way to show effect of estrogen in animal models was to take their ovaries out and give them estrogen and then you could show you could do lots of provocation it was good so estrogen is a good hormone on a young body but then there were studies that were hardly published but I was aware of them of taking all the animal you know so you could take the young animals in just one Center in Houston they did it you took the young animal you took their ovaries out you gave them a sturgeon and you employed a stroke model okay and when you give estrogen the stroke was smaller and everything when you did the same in older animals the stroke became worse okay and they couldn't publish it for a while because they said well it's old animals so they have other diseases or other things but every experiment that had estrogen in old model wasn't was the opposite not only that he didn't affect it was the opposite which what happened you know to the WHI in a certain ways yeah although I still think that the it was probably the breast cancer that garnered the most headline in the WHI and and actually that's an interesting topic which I'll be going into in great depth on another episode there's a great book that just came out that tackles this that goes through the history of the WHI at what point well let's go back to the metformin thing actually so it's 1987 and you're thinking like okay metformin is the next line of agent we will use to treat Type 2 diabetes so metformin was already in in clinical practice in

[00:11:41] Europe is that correct oh correct for many years how many years like 20 or 30 years so metformin few years ago was 60 years so we are talking about you know 1950 or something 1950 1960 when I was in Israel i prescribed meat for me you know that was the first line for type 2 diabetes what took so long for it to come to the u.s. that's a terrible story that that still continues you know the FDA said we don't know we don't know that that for me is going to be effective in the population in the United States so you have to do the studies and it was bristol-myers really that got to do the studies and basically they had to do a face restart again to show that metformin is effective as sulfonylureas as an indication for type 2 division if even then the idea was that it will be good only in obese people which happened not to matter much because all the types of everything it's a it's where obese but it was really a matter of regulation and part of having regulation was that the FDA asked more studies to understand the mechanism of aging and metformin and in a certain way maybe they are right because metformin mechanism action is really complicated and I'm not sure that today as a new drug it would be approved interesting why D where do you think it would fail in safety or efficacy no it's not in mechanism in the in the inability to elucidate the Mac why when you come to that day and you say you know we've done that and we've done this in animal and we've done this in sales and you're trying to show what is the major mechanism of action you you would have failed so what I showed in humans is that metformin targets hepatic glucose production or the insulin sensitivity of the liver and that's the major mechanism of action unlike for example sulfonylureas that increase insulin secretion right or tea CDs that increase the insulin sensitivity in the muscle more than in the liver so this was a mechanism that you could pack to the FDA but it's really not the intracellular mechanism of metformin so at the time was it understood what metformin x' activity was on complex one of the mitochondria now not really this came later I don't know what year but it came later it came when the seahorse's essays were developed to show really which mitochondria in which pathway of mitochondria you have changes maybe for the listener it helped explain where the seahorse assay is seahorse essay is an essay to look at mitochondrial action whether you extract mitochondria or even tissues it really shows some relationship between oxygen consumption in relationship to polarity and it's very sensitive to look at some of the effects of drugs that are interfering with mitochondria action or decrease mitochondrial activity it's almost like the indirect calorimetry of the might occur right right indirect because it's a provocative tests generally so yes metformin was discovered from a plant as well correct right it's a French Lilly and it was first Lily obviously and this was discovered in the 40s or 50s correct the first thing that happened there was a drug by the name of informing a cousin of metformin which apparently is much more potent it's much more potent because unlike metformin he doesn't need a transporter to get into the cells on the other hand it was associated with a lot of lactic acidosis and it was considered unsafe eventually and then metformin was a safer part with much less of a lactic acidosis side-effects what is the mechanism by which metformin cause lactic acidosis because in all the use I've seen if metformin clinically I've never seen a case of it which is not to say it doesn't happen I'm sure it does and you could stack risks by taking someone with renal insufficiency giving them contrast and tons of metformin but in medical school this was like the board question you got asked every single test what do you have to worry about lactic acidosis what's the putative mechanism by which that happens so first of all I would tell you that in my study in the 80s every patient that we gave metformin had an increase in lactic acid from what - what in millimolar within the normal range so if it's - was the cutoff the cutoff so it was you know between went from wine 1.5 towards the two and sometimes even went over the two but it wasn't really anything associated with oxytocin and there was no change in pH no no no onion gap not anything like that and it probably has to do I I don't know that I can tell you for sure but it has to do with what happens when complex one part of the metabolic effect when complex one is inhibited but there's lots of speculation and I don't really care it to comment on that but I think what became clear there is a all we call it endocrinologist call it mala it's metformin associated lactic acidosis in other words we moved away from metformin causing lactic acid to the Association because it's if anywhere it described more in people that have kidney failures or have heart attacks or something and had lactic acidosis and we're on route forming - and that was kind of the

[00:17:57] Association but it's not clear to me that there are truly people who developed lactic acidosis from it forming that is just because of metformin and not associated with something else I'm glad to hear you say that that sort of generally been my bias but I'm I'm happy to be corrected if that biases is incorrect but but yeah

[00:18:19] I've always thought that frankly so many of the drugs that we're really interested in now as we look back from an aging perspective whether it be metformin or rapamycin so many of the negative side effects that people typically associate with those drugs are very difficult to isolate from the patients in whom those drugs have historically been given and so it's nice to hear that that mala is now being generally recognized as a an alternative viewpoint to that you know metformin is to me an interesting drug from a diabetic standpoint because and I don't think I don't know that this was appreciated in the 80s in fact I would suspect it was not because there's really two macro score strategies for improving type-2 diabetes you can obviously the highest goal is to control glucose levels so - to regulate the degree of glucose in the blood but you can do that through at the highest level two ways you could increase insulin either exogenously or through increased insulin production pharmacologically or you could reduce glucose and of course metformin falls into the latter category of that or increasing muscle insulin sensitivity for to enhance glucose disposal today it's generally regarded that while both strategies will have an equal benefit on the microvasculature the glucose lowering by insulin lowering so the less glucose production strategy has a superior effect on the macro vasculature and therefore metformin would be a better alternative to for example a drug that's going to increase insulin production under the pancreas was it appreciated at the time meaning when you were doing this in the late 80s how potentially beneficial this drug was well at that time in the United

[00:20:03] States it was all about insulin resistance you know people like Gerry Rivlin Ralph de Franz oh the people at the NIH rongkhun we're all you know discovering the insulin receptor discovering insulin resistance discovering the association of insulin resistant with the metabolic syndrome so it was all we all had the bias that the major problem with type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance and you know we know now that it's a total collaboration yeah you increase insulin resistance and the pancreas have to secrete more insulin and we humans at least in the condition of our environment obesity everything many of us I would say 40% cannot deal with it and we become diabetic there is this Starlin curve of the pancreas you know like like for the heart that you increase insulin secretion and at some point you cannot increase the insulin secretion you become diabetic and then insulin secretion the create decrease and so insulin resistance was a major way and that's why metformin was a good place to come with you know at least it it affects mainly is the hepatic glucose production rather than the muscle although I have to tell you in vitro on muscle specimen it's an insulin sensitizer in the muscle - let's talk about this idea of insulin resistance I think there are a few terms that leave me scratching my head more than that one so this is an example of something where maybe five years ago I thought I really knew what insulin resistance was and I think today I'm pretty sure I don't know what it is in the sense that when you take the typical phenotype of someone whose insulin resistant what do they look like biochemically and n-type or more falada Klee right so they're hyperinsulinemic they have elevated levels of glucose they probably have some degree of obesity or adiposity so what does that mean because clearly their fat cell is quite sensitive to insulin if a fat cell ever became resistant to insulin you could not yes terrify fatty acids and you would have an endless stream of lipolysis exiting fatty acids from the fat cell so you'd actually be quite lean there's something going on in the muscle that clearly is resistant to the effective insulin but of course there are both insulin dependent and insulin independent means by which we can dispose of glucose and this is we're coming back to what you said a moment ago I actually wanted to ask you that question which is it will Park it but the question was does metformin participate in the AMPK driven insulin independent modality of glucose disposal you're nodding so I think that's a yes and we'll come back to it and then there's the liver and this is the one to me that is the most complicated and the one I'd like to begin with so before I ask you to elaborate on the specifically what is meant by insulin resistance in the liver am i a complete for not understanding this no but can I make it a little bit more interesting even because I need to bring it to aging yes

[00:23:09] I would love to talk about diabetes but let me just put up front I I don't I'm not sure that the bit is property of metformin are really the aging properties of metformin mmm okay this is my provocation but let me go back to insulin resistance because in in 1997 a science paper appeared that made it the best day of my life and the worst day of my life okay Wow what was the paper the paper was taking in nematode okay so a primitive model decreasing the insulin sensitivity this is known as the daf-2 model and when you do that the nematode accumulates fat in their intestinal cell so they are becoming visceral obese and they leave several times longer so why is it making the best day in my life because you could with one genetic manipulation extends lifespan significantly that meant going from hope actually from nothing from as this

[00:24:21] Cynthia's paper you know that's but at the same time Cynthia had their adopt 16 Tom Johnson has had the h1 model there are several papers that came in all of them said hey we can change a life span and the example was always insensitive and this mutation to be clear because between daf-2 daf-16 and the dietary manipulations there are several permutations of that C elegans model but just to make sure I know which paper we're talking about this was only attenuation of Taff - nothing - daf-16 and nothing - dietary change right right can you just add for the listener defined what is the analog of DAF to deaf 16 in us DAF 2 is the insulin receptor and daf-16 is the fo'c'sle the fo'c'sle transcription factor but the point is at that time yeah you took a worm that normally lives 2 weeks and you turned down its insulin receptor slightly not off correct right but you made it insulin resistant and it was accumulating fat and what was i bringing in to the field I was saying the major reason for Aging is this incidence in resistance syndrome and the main part of the insulin resistant is accumulation of visceral fat and so the premise was good the example was disaster to me I had a

[00:25:51] JCI paper at that time in press really showing with MRI pictures how caloric restriction decreases the visceral fat I was talking about the biology of those fat and stuff and it was a major paradox for us in the field and how we continue if we're saying insulin resistant is good for longevity and everybody in diabetes knew that this is a disaster why am I telling you that because I learned later I was thinking later on experiments that I've done also first of all the experiment that I've done that was very conclusive was I took a bunch of Reds 150 actually and all of them underwent surgery after puberty in some of them I removed their visceral fat teapots by surgery and in the other it was a sham procedure just moved it but didn't remove it and we had three groups in the experiment one was ad libitum feeding the second was caloric restriction this is the control they would leave 40% better and the third group was ad libitum feeding of the rats that their visceral fat was removed and

[00:27:06] I said you know without the visceral fat even with nutrients they live longer and they actually lived significantly longer than they'd libitum by 20% but not as much as the caloric restriction just to make sure I understand you had a two-to-one ratio of your animals because you had no I had three groups three groups but one of the other ones all ad lib feeding of the visceral fat removed that was right and then of the ones that had sham surgery they were randomized to ad libbed versus CR correct it really showed that visceral fat the removal of visceral fat had major effect and when the animals who had the visceral fat removed were autopsy door whatever the word is for rat autopsies had they refigured out a way to react Yuma late mr. o fat or where had they accumulated no in fact when you do this procedure after puberty if you do it before puberty they accumulate visceral fat otherwise they don't accumulate much visceral fat did they have changes in subcutaneous fat that's a good question mice have it when you do it and rats do not what did they ultimately succumb to they all died from the same thing only at different times which is what cancer yeah it was Sprague Dawley so kidney disease and cancers were the leading cause of death so you basically got half the benefit of CR by doing this by eating Italy badoom but without visceral fat yeah so you understand it's very sorry one other question near was there any change in their health span or their spry Ness yes there was a helpin in fact what happened to the idli badoom that libby doom starts losing weight at the end of their life and the ad libitum with

[00:28:50] Servette have still gained weight after the others you know it was a significant change in weight and then there's a hole he'll spend there insulin levels and other things that we've did you know we've done in parallel so they were they were healthy and they were healthier for longer which is kind of the experiments that we do with is it possible to take one of those rats and either through caloric restriction or other dietary restriction get it to puberty to the point at where you did the surgery but without any visceral fat and then ask the question if they've gone through that period of development without developing visceral fat do they have somehow protection from the diseases that come even if you feed them ad libitum thereafter so we we did this experiment in zuker fat animal zoo cure diabetes animal and we took their visceral fat to help people what the soccer rat looks like so the zoo Koretz are rats that are really really really obese hungry all the time so they have hyper fascia they can't stop you right because they don't have the leptin receptor so they are hungry all the time and they're nasty because you try to come close to them they think your finger is food so they're eating it all the time and we did surgery on them before puberty because they became obese really much before puberty and what happened is by six months they all become diabetics our animals up to four months did not become diabetic and then between four and six they became diabetic although we took their visceral fit but what we found out that 80% of the visceral fat grew back so we actually had the perfect experiment as long as they didn't have visceral fat they didn't develop diabetes once they got the visceral fat they developed diabetes but I want to make I'm sorry one other thing if you took that group and who already developed diabetes with visceral fat and you just removed the visceral fat can you reverse the diabetes no I we've never done this experiment don't know because we're interested in aging but I'm telling you all that to make one point because so far the paradox just got worse right the nematodes with the insert system visceral fat leaves longer and we showed that mammalians live longer if you take this visceral fat and make them into insensitive whenever we take visceral fat we make them more insulin sensitive okay until I realized one thing it takes me a few hours to make Red's insulin resistant I give them glucose

[00:31:29] I give them free fatty acid I give them some other things I can make them insulin resistance very rapidly so at first I used it as you see we can do the chronic insulin resistant in few hours okay you just load them with nutrients you become insulin resistant but then I thought of the aging part when you get glucose to the muscle the glucose goes into the muscle if you're not moving the muscle it's not going to turn more glucose to energy it will switch from free fatty acid to glucose but that but there's no more glucose burning so it goes to glycogen right and it goes to glycogen but you keep on putting glucose in the muscle and there's just so much glycogen that the muscle can store so the muscle has to become insulin resistance okay it's a protective mechanism there's no evidence that the muscle can in any way shape or form undergo to Nova lipogenesis and create any of the fatty acid is there to create any of the fatty Lessie yeah finally from there not there any evidence that muscle can under can can can carry I don't think so III don't think so I'll have to think because I have a different

[00:32:42] I have to think about it but but the point is okay I but I understand your point yeah I don't think if anything there's no match the glucose the muscle tells the glucose you go somewhere else you know you go to fat ok so the only organ that can take in completely excess amount of glucose in the end has to be the liver because it at least has the capacity to turn excess glucose into fat whereas all of the other organs are going to be saturated that's true and that's part of I think where the glucose is going okay to fatten too okay so what am i telling you I'm saying that insulin-resistant is a protective mechanism it's a modulator it's a stress response it's something so now I understand why a stress response mechanism in one animal cause them to live longer and in another animal it's a pain in a but so I went and I wrote this review with with Luigi

[00:33:40] Ferrucci I wrote this review where we took all the animals that had problems with their insulin sensitivity the animals that are insulin resistance and live longer and the animals with insulin sensitivity that leaves shorter and there's a huge list of it rep amaizing is an example right rep amazing causes insulin resistance the animals the best intervention in an in in rodents there is a PT p1 a transgenic animals it's very insulin sensitivity and he's half the life splitsville they i've the lifespan of a wild when you say insulin resistant or insulin sensitive are you always referring to muscle are you referring to liver how are you defining them well in this sense it was everything it was IRS for example iris one iris to knock out some of them only in the brain so it was really insulin resistance everywhere it's IRS one found in the muscle hey not the liver no IRS Juan and iris two are everywhere but iris two is more in liver yeah there's like they sort of have selective san expression right yeah so just translate IRS one insulin receptor substrate substrate so let's talk about exactly how the muscle takes in glucose so we are walking around if I bolus you with glucose right now and your blood glucose rises from wherever it is right now ninety to two-hundred let's say I give you an enormous bolus of glucose I double it so you're up to a hundred and eighty milligrams per deciliter this is a very high screaming high level which by the way only amounts to an extra few grams of glucose but nevertheless what is the chain of events that leads to insulin being secreted and the muscle ultimately disposing of that glucose both actively or passively well there will be obviously a secretion to insulin that's relative to your glucose level and so then so the beta cell is the sensor right and out comes insulin and now what is insulin doing to the muscle an insulin through the insulin receptor will get translocation of the glute for those are the glucose transporters that are the major glucose transporters in muscle it will go from an intracellular pool into the plasma membrane integrate it and starts getting Lucas like crazy into the sit and that happens quite passively meaning once the glute for transporter is translocated across the cell membrane glucose can passively rush and correct it doesn't require ATP to bring it in against a gradient of any sort correct and and in fact it has its own intrinsic activity that's not the energy dependent so it can go faster or slower by by different ways now is there another method by which without insulin we can get glucose into a cell that somehow relies on a MP kinase not an MP kinase but there's non-insulin mediated glucose uptake in other words there's a way for glucose to get up without the insulin and we know that from hyperglycemic clamp and from other things that when we can move the insulin or keep insulin level at basil and still there's a substantial glucose uptake that's happening so yeah we know what's the mechanism of that I'm not sure I know it also seems to be enhanced by exercise that's true that's true this ninja is the non insulin mediated glucose uptake is something that his exercise dependent to and it's that's why now I understand your question is a

[00:37:17] MP kinase yes part of the Dana and I I don't know that yeah I only have one patient in my practice who has type 1 diabetes but he is such an interesting patient because of his incredibly strict dietary control and his unbelievable appetite for exercise and he I've never seen a higher level of adiponectin in a human I've never seen a higher level of sex hormone-binding globulin in a human which are basically and we know how much insulin he has because he injects it and he injects so little insulin into himself and yet can seem to you know he has a hemoglobin a1c below six using six to eight at units of insulin a day and so what got me it got that's what got me very interested in this non insulin-dependent glucose uptake yeah I'm not doing this research anymore I used to be in front of that i glucose itself can modulate gluco kinase activity in the liver there's a lot of things that happening and of course there's coordination between the fat and and the liver and then I started being interested because we can do things to the hypothalamus and take over this insulin and muscle and fat and liver we can do it all from the brain isn't that amazing well just because I'm so fascinated by this and I think it will help the listener to understand the complexity of what you just said if I took an animal and put a lesion into the ventral part of the hypothalamus a normal animal what could that do what would that change about its metabolism well that would increase basically food intake and change a lot of the peripheral physiology but we do basically the opposite we give insulin to the hypothalamus or glucose or IGF or leptin okay and then we see what happens to the periphery although in the periphery those hormone levels are not increasing at all and not only that the liver is a good target to follow because what you can do with the liver you can do selectively a patek vagotomy and everything that you did through the brain doesn't work anymore because it needs the nerves right so I'll explain to the listener what that means so the vagus nerve connects the body through this parasympathetic system and of course if a patient has a liver transplant or if you do an operation where you sever the vagus nerve you sever that connection between the central nervous system and the periphery correct and so we do it experimentally and it will help us see if it really how much of it is vaguely mediated versus not or yeah or more nerve only you know it's the nerves because we do it's not only if I go to me we do a little bit of anergic too but it's through this the nerves and not through a chemical reaction on the liver you see this is the problem with metabolism near the more I go into it the less I know it drives me nuts my absolute knowledge increases incrementally and my relative knowledge falls precipitously well I think I realized that you know what to ask so you're undermining your own abilities but it's really it's really the integrity of metabolism is really very confusing to explain so we will define insulin resistance at the muscle whether it be from an aged phenotype or a diabetic phenotype as a scenario under which a fixed amount of insulin hitting the insulin receptor produces fewer glute for transporters is that a fair definition well the the definition of insulin resistance is really different and very simple it's all about the glucose uptake in the muscle really it's all about the ability of insulin to clear glucose okay that's the only way we define clinically insulin resistance although that totally misses the point because those insulin levels have different effects on different tissue but for us the insulin sensitivity is totally related to the glucose uptake so let me give you an example so when I use an oral glucose tolerance test with my patients I'm a bit of a stickler so if they take their 75 you know grams of glucose I measure their glucose and insulin at baseline administer the glue

[00:41:49] Cola 30 minutes later 60 minutes later 90 minutes later and if I'm feeling aggressive 120 minutes later weari measure the glucose the insulin and the FFA and maybe even the c-peptide but for simplifying it just the glucose and insulin so let's assume you have two patients who start out with a fat and glucose of 90 milligrams per deciliter and six insulin of IU's of six they both get their seventy-five of glue

[00:42:15] Cola and let's again simplify this by just looking at one hour what happens both of them at one hour have a rise of glucose from 90 to 130 milligrams per deciliter one of them did so with a rise of insulin from 6 to 20 the other did it with a rise of insulin from 6 to 90 they've both disco disposed of glucose with equal magnitude would you describe them both as equally insulin sensitive it's a little bit complicated you know first of all so let me just say for aging 120 is not enough in in elderly the glucose tolerance go so the rise in insulin is changing throughout normal physiology and throughout individuals and you must say you might have missed some of the insulin Peaks earlier on or later on yeah the third looking at 30 versus 90 is a big insight and you're right I mean Joseph Kraft who is a pathologist who has done a lot of work on this he samples to five hours now again clinically that's challenging in the regular day to day practice but in the laboratory that's feasible and you're right you can see so much happening beyond that but I tried to pick an example that was as egregious enough in its difference that the what

[00:43:39] I'm trying to get is the difference in hyperinsulinemia and whether that factors into how we think about insulin resistance right no I don't think the clinical world is thinking like that so I'm actually an active in the chronology I still see on Thursdays if I'm on time in town teaching fellows in an in diabetes clinic what if your hospital so

[00:44:02] I am involved very much in this field and I'll tell you that we rarely measure insulin in any of our patients but that's not really your patients okay I'm talking about what's the use of measuring insulin in type 2 diabetic patients so it's a different issue but yet this is sounds like there's a different insulin response to lower the glucose to the same extent because the hypothesis would be that the patient with hyperinsulinemia is now demonstrating I mean that's basically a harbinger of the first one who's going to struggle with glucose disposal that would be my hypothesis is the one who needed 90 units of insulin to dispose of glucose with the same efficacy as the person who needed 30 is sooner rather than later going to have a harder time disposing of glucose well you know there is another possibility that those are the people who get other diseases for his letter like heart attacks or stroke in other words their insulin resistance will affect a lot the way they do their terror otic plaque and you know this hyperinsulinemia on organs that might not be incident resistant even right or cells that not coming in services so I would say that they could either the one who become diabetic or the one we're going to get macrovascular disease much faster you know brings it right back to our observation of glucose versus insulin micro versus macular vasculature that's a very good point so how does insulin signaling work to get glucose into the liver the liver has a different glucose transporters the glue to that is not translocated and that is the major way by glucose gets into the liver so it's a little bit different but it's not stimulated the same so it's constitutively expressed across the membrane it's not stimulated really by insulin as much so it's more gradient driven to get the glucose from the circulation into the livers and that's where the portal blood is so there it's very sensitive to the increasing glucose concentrations well that's very interesting because it's certainly I mean there's lots of evolutionary reasons why that would be a failsafe right given the importance of you would never ever want the liver to be denied glucose given that if you ever shut down the livers ability to make glucose by my calculation you could live about six minutes yeah look I was an intern of Sheila Cheryl look she's named Sheila Cheryl look in

[00:46:39] England and the Royal Free Oscar very known at pathologist and she asked a group of us what's the main role of the liver and I raised my hand and I said it's you produce glucose why wouldn't my answer back and everybody laughed at me and she threw rocks at them and suffering just a man why are you saying

[00:46:56] I said because if you take the liver out and clamp the vessels the guy will die from hypoglycemia which is absolutely true yeah yeah it's um I you know maybe it's just because I'm in the midst of writing this chapter for my book about the liver but I literally yesterday i sat here in my room and and penned out the calculation of 180 pound person with blood glucose of 180 milligrams per deciliter clamped the liver how many minutes until they died it's about four under those under those conditions can you imagine that think about like what this beautiful organ has to do but you know another thing to consider in your example right here so for example elderly have enough insulin to suppress glucose production glucose production is easier to suppress then it's a pressing lower level of insulin then stimulating glucose uptake in the muscle deliver is more sensitive than the muscle and so elderly have the ability to suppress a pati glucose production because they have enough of insulin to do that but when you start giving them food during the day they fail and they become glucose intolerance and diabetic they might have diabetes although their basal level are well just because of this this enough insulin to suppress glucose production and not enough to increase glucose uptake so the sensitivity of the tissues is really - insulin is really part of what you're describing if you look at the basal it's very different yes it's the challenge that's such such a great point and I won't I won't go down that rabbit hole more because I I would love to but there's so many other things I want to talk about in here let's let's go back to metformin and let's do it now through the context of an anti-aging drug so there's gonna be some people listening to this who already know everything about you if for no other reason than the efforts you've put in to tame obviously I want to have plenty of time to talk about that but let's back up for a moment tell me when you first realized hey this metformin drug that I worked on thirty years ago it's not just a great drug for people with diabetes this could actually be a drug that helps someone without diabetes live longer what was that epiphany for you so first of all there were Studies on the biology of Aging in rodents and the first guy which I'll be embarrassed now to forget he's a guy from Leningrad that was the first to say I've done a rodent studies and animals with metformin Anatole

[00:49:47] I'll remember it maybe later and he showed that a life extension extension increases in variety of animals to which he gave metformin that led to some studies his hypothesis do you remember why what he had what would he drove him to do that there was never any hypothesis of authorization expedition it's even wasn't related to glucose metabolism necessarily he thought that maybe there is an anti-cancer effect and he looked at that but then he got models that were hypertensive and they also lived longer so he thought those are different effect and then he considered to aging but at that time this was in the 80s when he started that and you'll remember I should take more metformin and he was pushing he was showing up in in meeting and showing and so people have tried to do it in the United States and they showed that there is a significant effect on insulin by the way the effect of insulin in animals is 10% not like rapamycin is 24% so there's a milder effects but in every study they showed that hell spam is improved you know by 50% so the effect on longevity was less than the effect of health by the way that's perfect for what I'm trying to say I'm I'm not for a longevity I'm just for health spam right so if we can leave LT LT LT die that's fine with me yeah the soul of squaring of the squaring right square with the majority so he started a seam of his name is awesome oh so that's what a seam of showed people have started looking at that they've there several studies three studies that gave it also to nematodes they also lived longer and there's several effects on health span in the biology of Aging now the reason there's a lot of needle threading here in my story here okay but I want to tell you the the moment that I knew we have to do this study was a publication not in a very high impact Journal that it was an amazing study that could be done only in the UK because in the UK you can go into pharmacies and look at prescription that they gave and you could follow the mortality of those patient because the

[00:52:28] NHS system allows you to centralize everything from prescription to usage to mortality exactly and they're probably they don't need to di to be D identify after mortality when you're dead you you're not private anymore okay so they did this study so what they've done there are four arms to this study they came and took patients who are on sulfonylurea 12,000 patients okay and they match them to 12,000 people without diabetes okay same pharmacies same doctors controlling for some other things and of course the people in sulfonylureas at higher mortality than their control you know doctors of course that they had a reason to be taking the softener diabetes so that's okay then they took 78,000 people on metformin in 78,000 people who were non-diabetic again matching them and the 78,000 on metformin was metformin mono therapy mono therapy first line right and they watched their mortality so just to underline again the people on metformin had diabetes their control didn't have there were more obese than the control they also have more diseases than the control but they had significant less mortality 17% less mortality in the mid forming group and just you know the sulfonylurea group was okay so if you get less mortality with metformin when the set up is diabetes that really shows that metformin has a very important effect in humans as far as aging what was the median dose of metformin in those populations they were over a thousand milligrams that's it just a thousand milligram they intended more but the average was about 15 milligram you know I don't there's 15 ya know thousand milligrams I'm sorry they this is a discussion there I don't think they really could validate the dose because an elegant thing to do if you have 78,000 in your database is now stratify goes absolutely they who's taking five hundred a thousand 1500 2000 they couldn't do that and I really cannot answer you if you can get back to the data or not I really don't know a the dose that those who chose came from other studies but you know that's not the only thing we know about it for that what was that what was the time course of that by the way do you know how many five years five years more to five years exposure to metformin or five years of prospective mortality following no it's well it's all it was all a prospective study okay it was all a prospective study when they started okay they went back they looked at everybody on metformin okay I'm asking is do we know how long they needed to be on metformin to achieve the Benham no no we don't know okay so we followed them for five years of mortality in a prospective cohort but they could have been on metformin for five years or 25 years we don't know no no it's newly its newly prescribed met forming they were not more than so we have normalized by duration absolutely absolutely no they haven't been on metformin before those are newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes certain year that's a pretty to be blunt god damn staggering result so my metformin moment nowhere near as the dramatic is yours he basically came out of a research project I did with two analysts in 2013 and I don't even remember what prompted the question but there was a question we had internally about what was the benefit of metformin oh now I remember the question the question was was there a relationship between hyperinsulinemia and breast cancer this was the question we wanted to ask and as we dug and dug and dug and dug and dug something kept hitting us over the head over and over and over and over again which was with or without diabetes with or without obesity with or without hyperinsulinemia any way you slice and dice the data of people with type 2 diabetes with and without metformin they got much less breast cancer which then dogus down a rabbit hole if they seemed to get much less cancer which was you know that was a big aha moment right and there are hundreds of studies that show the association between metformin and less cancers and not only that less all cancer except prostate by the way prostate is hanging there maybe a little bit and when we went and I will tell you later but when we went to the NCI to make them partners in the same study it was really interesting how people what team stands for tain stands for taming or targeting aging with metformin and it's a study that's designed to prove the concept that aging can be targeted but also or mainly for me is for the FDA to give an approval to an indication that's like aging the first time I heard about tame was actually here in this city I was having dinner with Steve

[00:58:09] Austin it must have been in 2015 maybe 14 15 Steve is a gem of a human being I consider him certainly one of the most important mentors in my exploration of this field of Ages we're partners yeah many ways he's a great guy he is he is one of these guys that has his knowledge is out of control you you can't ask him a question that he doesn't know where to go for the answer I have the highest respect for Steve and can't wait to interview him here as well but I remember him telling me about this and my first thought was Steve that's a crazy idea the drug is free who the hell is going to pay for this study NIH can't pay for it because they don't consider aging a disease Pharma can't pay for it because there's no way to make money on it I mean I like 10 cents a year for my supply of metformin it's a free drug

[00:59:00] I said you're doing the wrong study man you got to do this with rapamycin so talk to me about the challenges of this this is you're proposing something that has really never been done before can I just ask you are we going back to MIT farming because you asked me about the bees but not much form in action will you ask me later absolutely I cannot wait to dive into metformin yeah we're not gonna get off this topic for a while yeah so so look if I'm answering now why metformin and not rapamycin but you don't need to answer that question I was just sort of teasing Steve that day but well there are people who are asking and of course

[00:59:37] MIT forming we have preliminary data we have the cancer we have clinical studies you know clinical studies of metformin the diabetes prevention program it prevents diabetes the UKPDS it prevents cardiovascular disease the Alzheimer they're two clinical studies to suggest that in mild cognitive impairment it improves some domain by the way like name recalling I see more will will up it will of your dose after dinner so there's lots of money and safety loop if we're going to have a new indication we don't want to kill anybody on the road with rapamycin we won't be sure and it causes diabetes it cause testicular atrophy and cataracts in animals okay so we have to play it safe so I would only add one caveat in defense of rapamycin which is with constitutive dosing right and and you're aware of the studies from

[01:00:35] Joan mani cry yes abort the last ones yes okay so my view on rapamycin is it should not be dosed every day it should be selectively chose to target and for complex one leave complex to alone exactly and I'll we'll get back to that because I'll tell you what we've done with metformin for the biology of aging part so that's why the fact you look we are a bunch of professors including

[01:01:00] Steve Austin we go to the FDA by the way beautiful movie by Ron Howard he went with us to the FDA to the same wait has it been released yet mr. Wenders a year and a half ago it's I'm sorry anxious it's called the age of aging it's National Geographic it's the best movie that was done ever on Aging it's really quite incredible Ron Howard is narrating it I remember I'll tell you what I was having dinner with Steve at some point during he was here in New York for that being filmed yeah so you know so we're a bunch of professors that are coming to the FDA and kind of telling them you know you know that aging has biology but this biology also can be targeted and they said so what we said well if you slow aging then you prevent a bunch of age-related diseases all together and I said well we're interested to hear and we went through this discussion with the

[01:01:56] FDA I would say that the most interesting part and you'll appreciate it because your diabetes centric I see your I'm actually not I'm literally I'm purely age centric I but I remember I'm diabetes I think of diabetes as a great example of what happens when you don't fix things earlier so we told them basically we came and we said we'll do a study and what we're going to see his cardiovascular disease and cancer and

[01:02:23] Alzheimer's mortality and diabetes and said no diabetes we said what do you mean no diabetes look you diagnose diabetes first of all you diagnosis on a chemical on a chemical test you know you decide yeah and only 40 percent of them 10 years later we'll get complication we're really not interested in diabetes when did the FDA actually say this absolutely absolutely said it and and by the way I should add that there's another bunch of people who came to tell the FDA that they should allow meat forming for pre-diabetes because the DPP said your Foreman prevents diabetes by 30% and the FDA said well if you think that's important why don't you make the diagnosis of diabetes in five point eight a modeling agency you know it's not up to us to to do that and they wouldn't give them an indication for two pre-diabetes that's a very counterintuitive point of view when you consider the long-term not short-term the short-term cost burden of diabetes is relatively trivial but it's that long-term cost burden that becomes quite elaborate you know it's very boring with you because we have the same views you're right so yeah so okay but so we had to adjust their study with take diabetes as one of the outcomes yeah and put in and you know just increase the number and take diabetes out it's not that we're not going to follow there is but the FDA is not interested in babies so the really the challenge was how do we define aging in a clinical study because one view is well because you can't use survival overall mortality well there is no there's no biomarkers to aging all the diseases are are there major risk factor is aging you know so how do you define it and we basically did a lot of work and a lot of work and showed that okay let's let's take somebody who has survived cancer and he's 65 to 80 years old what's his chances of getting cardiovascular disease cognitive decline mortality right the other things and let's say it was 10 okay and okay now let's switch it around let's take somebody who had cardiovascular disease what's his chances of getting cancer and all the others yes 10 okay let's take somebody with Alzheimer what his chances it really would aging it doesn't matter the disease you get first depends on you know your genetics and environment if you have a mother who's diabetic and you're obese you'll get diabetes first okay but really because because we age biologically did you know in different way whatever it is the next disease you're going to get the next disease and we don't know what's the next disease but that's what we're going to prevent that sort of thing it's it's a really interesting idea you proposed because it's in lending you would call that asset value correlation so you'd say well let's say near comes to my bank and he has a credit card and he has a car loan and he has a student loan and he has a mortgage and he has a personal business loan which one is gonna default first yeah I don't know I mean I could sort of tell you typically people are gonna stop paying their credit card before they stop paying their car and their mortgage but boy once you default on one those dominoes start to fall very quickly and so so that would have what we would call a very high asset value correlation of default yeah sort of like this is the same for disease yeah III think you're right I'm saying it's a little bit different I'm saying I'm agnostic to the disease which the first one is yeah it's just I'm agnostic it doesn't matter what you come and what what you're going to have I'm going to prevent whatever it is that's why we have a composite okay a composite and people get very prickly about composite outcomes very and I got it I gotta get on my soapbox for a minute here cuz this pisses me off to no end when people get all bent out of shape about how you can't have a composite outcome and this is the bias against aging really because in the end what matters is how long are you alive and how long is your health span optimized so I'm sorry for I made that rant as short as I normally could normally that would be a ten minute rant well that would be a ten minute rent for me too okay yeah absolutely and and this is where we get into trouble

[01:06:58] I'll tell you what the other pieces but we had our grant reviewed at the NIH and unfortunately and is this inside any of the groups except ni a like his NCI weighing in on there yes yes I'll tell you what we've done here I'll tell you what we've done in this in a second let me just make sure that I say that so our reviewers were not jerison because we everybody is involved and we have 14 centers okay so everybody is involved so the reviewers are from other place and they just they just just a minute you're saying that aging can be targeted and one drug can do it you're crazy okay there is no such thing why don't you do three studies one studies metformin cardiovascular one studies metformin cancer 130 and we're saying no because what are we doing we're trying to give aging an indication suppose we do is just such an element of the way they think and I'm not saying that to be critical of them right but they're in a silo i knowledge is if you come to NCI how can you care about anything but cancer right I know the silos are really are really killers but for us so you could say well let's do all those studies but for us we're calculating the power I was just about to say the power analysis on that study is going to quadruple your budget not will for what they decide for the size of it for us it's not only it's not only the budget we don't want to stop the study let's say that we show in two years that we we delay cardiovascular disease it's significant they'll stop the study they said no everybody now has to be on metformin but we wouldn't be able to show the FDA that if we actually that we're aging for us aging is stopped telling us diseases we are going to have a cluster and we're just going to delay the aging so we'll get we'll get the health span extended by two three years that's what we're trying to show you and the significance is the for the cluster not for the individual disease and if you tell me to do individual disease

[01:09:07] I need tripled by their budgets and I'm not going to get to the FDA with the indication for aging so it seems to me that the biggest challenge here is not the funding it's not the study design it's the conceptual leap it's it's a completely different paradigm of how we think about delaying death correct correct where do you stand today so I'll tell you a few things first of all we conceived it I got my friends to what I call a prison a French prison in Spain somewhere we were in a Parador in the middle of nowhere in Spain for several days saying what do we have to do in order to open the field for aging to allow us to get to treatments and we decided several thing but one of them is to go to go ahead we think by the way

[01:09:58] I'm saying French prison because the food was good but it was insane and we started and I started getting those people those clinical people together and we started really sinking through for what it takes for what it takes and we had this whole academic and wrote papers in order to say how we're thinking how we're thinking of cluster of diseases how we're doing power calculations for targets aging and stuff like that we really spend a lot of time with the best people now our friends came to us and said just a minute your study is 70 million dollars if the

[01:10:34] National Institute of Aging is going to spend 70 million dollars that means this the National Institute of Aging is very small it's just 3 percent of the budget although we are 80 percent of the diseases right then we won't have money for the grants and I said will what I'm going to do is two things first of all half of the money is going to come from somewhere else that's my association with a far where Steve and I are the scientific directors and for a far I got the other half so the 40 35 million is already waged and that's mostly philanthropic right and then we went among the Institute's and so NCI should chip NCI NHLBI niddk they didn't commit because first they have to see the review okay or they have to have the decision that they're a I want I would tell you though that the NCI director was a good friend of mine is waiting for time to come you know he he's like we're staying so the NCI has committed it's basically a bunch of contingent commitments yeah I just I just want to say committed is the wrong word because they didn't have a budget yet and the grin didn't come to them but I know that they will give them money because their head is will do it yeah so that's good to hear so when realistically when is the soonest you would begin enrolling for team you know I'm waiting for something to know next week and if next week goes well so I I just want to let you know that we have an alternative the alternative is non-for-profits that the reason they haven't joined us is that their Charter is not to fund anything that the NIH funds they want something riskier of course so if the

[01:12:21] NIH is not funding because they feel it's risky those will fund so we can start anywhere and it's the this the answer is early 2019 okay we are we're basically all our centers are ready to go how many centers 14 how many subjects 3,000 age 65 to 80 any limitation on comorbidities no in fact we'll there are there are a lot of limitations we're very inclusive but but no no existing diagnosis of cancer no and unless they are cured okay so you could be in remission but you can't have active cancer yes you secondary prevention or primary you could have cardiovascular disease you know in the past if you're if you're okay now you could have mild cognitive impairment in low speed walk will be a criteria so in other words we don't want people like in my study who will become centenarians because we're wasting we're wasting time on them we want people who we know are kind of in the midst of aging and we know that it's never too late to target aging and that's wait so 65 years and up five years studied and you're gonna randomized one to one or two to one one to one and the placebo versus what dose of metformin two grams 1500 so you know the so first of all I should tell you that Merck company from

[01:13:47] Germany is giving us the placebo admit forming right a drug is free so when when you say nobody's interested it's true it's generic but actually Merck has the worldwide license for MIT forming and they're actually giving supply to lots of studies because they kind of realize that this is good do you think there's a difference between generic metformin and branded in terms of efficacy is there any reason No so there really this is kind of uh this isn't necessarily a creative to them because one can buy metformin generically anywhere they're not going to make more money from giving us this will you know I should say even now a lot of them it forming suppliers have higher sales and a lot of them are non diabetic yeah so this thing which is which is bad for me because I don't want too many people to know that right I want to do this study I don't want and I don't I want what you'll have you know I don't think hopefully I won't impair your recruiting and their power analysis

[01:14:49] I mean it's funny honestly near I would have guessed but this is this speaks to the non-linearity and complexity of estimating power you can't do it without the tables I would have guessed you needed a bigger end than 1500 in each group you are using 80 or 90 percent power 90 percent pyre but I should tell you look for every disease we have almost a 30 percent effect and we we chose 22 percent effect okay for every disease with preliminary data for the same on it so you lowered your threshold to call it 20% from 30% and right at a 90 percent power you've hopefully powered this right you've got buff for both on your house and effects alright and and again we don't want to stop this study early either for one effect so we carefully thought about it we ask for a grant for six years because we don't want to overdo it okay so it might finish in four or in six but we have the flexibility to look at it any non-us centres or they are us no we decided to do only in the US because of communication and because look outside of the US people came and said you know we'll fontaine but how you know if they say after two years we won't fund them you know it's very different because because if it's a center they need to be part of the part of the power and we cannot afford to lose them so we you know those in other consideration we decided to stick with the United States so let's go back to what we really glossed over but now I want to dive into why do you believe at the cellular mechanistic level metformin is an anti-aging drug so let me take you through that you know I don't want to say schematics way because we don't have this scheme here but you know in a way that maybe I think will be easy to think so I want to start by saying that studies have shown that some of the effects of it forming are through a and

[01:16:59] P kinase and some of them are independent of a MP kindness yes is it important not for metformin but I don't know which are the ones who are relevant more for aging okay and it's hard to know and it'll get complicated in a second more so metformin gets into the cell through a transporter that's called Oct 1 okay this transporter is not equally equal in every cell so unlike fan forming that goes with other transporters and affect everything metformin is peculiar in this way but we have the data and it binds to complex one in the mitochondria does it do so preferentially does it gain entry preferentially into the liver in humans only in the sense that there's a nice concentration of Oct 1 in the liver but not not bear but it's not I don't think it's the top other organs have so basically it's more about Oct distribution and expression well then it's an issue specificity it's more that

[01:18:10] I want I want metformin everywhere okay I want platforming everywhere and I'll tell you how I kind of proved it so now metformin binds to complex one in mitochondria I'll tell you that metformin has some action epigenetic action that are independent of the mitochondria you can do it with what's called row zero cells you can you can deplete mitochondria and see and measure things and you can measure things even without mitochondria okay again do I need them what type of epigenetic changes you see in the row cell in histone deacetylation okay so I cannot argue that this can be important it's not important if we use metformin but it's important if you want to ask me are the mechanism of it forming a MP dependent mitochondria ATP dependent so there's an H Dec property that we may not have even thought of before right okay so it gets to the mitochondria and in the mitochondria it basically changes ATP ATP ratio and that's a lot of it is important in the liver but not only to the extent that there is an activation of a MP kinase and near is there a demonstrable reduction in nad to NADH in that cell when complex one is inhibited yes yeah absolutely those studies have been have been done so there is a lot that's going through a and P kinase and I would tell you the downstream of am P kinase there is mTOR okay and it depletes a decrease mTOR activity and increase autophagy and there's a whole pathway that will go to the pillars of aging you know I asked David Sabatini this question a month ago and where he doesn't know the answer but I'm hopeful that maybe one of the postdocs in his lab will start to figure this out I'm very curious about what the dose equivalent is between in terms of purely looking at the readout of mTOR inhibition what is the dose to dose equivalence of metformin via ampk versus rapa directly and I haven't I mean David didn't know the answer which tells me nobody probably knows the answer right look it's it's really difficult first of all for example lots of the non ANP kinase activities are on much higher doses of metformin well that's my point is can you clinically match them and no because you you really don't know at the end how much metformin is in the cell what we're doing now we're doing isolated cells in other words we treated animals with metformin and we're taking isolated cells to just see the variability of metformin in individual cells even amongst homogeneous tissues yeah like we take a pata sites and look at the various expression yeah right so it's all kind of important question but but the story is still I'll tell you the story because at the end I'm going to answer you what is doing for ageing okay and I don't want to rush this story because this is a great story you take your sweet time so think about it in a scheme you have the metformin in the middle getting through the plasma membrane getting to the mitochondria and on the left side let's say there is the

[01:21:42] MP kindness okay now in the right side oh sorry just for the listener explain what a MP kinase does at the high level it's it's a hormone of what it's a hormone of nutrient deprivation and therefore it tells the body to do what like when you don't eat for a day ampk goes up why well but it's also an exercise mimetic pathway yes what happens with with the exercise really that was the hope of what a MP kinase is doing but it's a nutrient sensing that is in part up string of mTOR mm-hmm okay but the other side of metformin is what happens to the mitochondria because in a way and I hope

[01:22:27] I won't regret saying it here but metformin is the weak cyanide hmm okay look what cyanide acted at complex for right but right oh you just mean more broadly speaking right it inhibits oh yeah there is less ro s production okay and then there is less inflammation and there is other things that's going just because the mitochondria is less oxidative pathway going down so this is a great example of why binary thinking doesn't very doesn't do very well in biology right it can't be all or none well so now I can go on and on and connect all those with you to eventually the pillar of aging but I want to insert another thing because other things are happening for example insulin levels goes down right why is it just due to the reduction if it had a glucose output

[01:23:26] I'll tell you why I think and then also inflammatory factors are going down and there is a whole NF kappa-b action of metformin that might be part of the our OS and part could be independent even without mitochondria okay it's that confusing but this is the point I want to make I don't know which one of those is important for aging but parts of what you're measuring is the following you fix the aging on a cellular level okay so the younger that the cells are younger a lot of things are correcting themselves so I think at the end the lower insulin levels the low inflammatory are not necessarily a direct effect and that's why we're we're fighting all the time about what metformin is doing because you measure lots of things but the things you're measuring her because aging was fixed and once aging is fixed then there's a whole ham or dynamic readjustment or whatever you want to call it and then you're measuring that everything and this is not only typical to metformin this is with rapamycin with resveratrol you also can see that there's a lot of things that are improving themselves and I think we have to get used to the fact that when you have a drug that we argue what it's doing because everybody is measuring something some of it is true but it's like secondary it's you fixed it hi how do you treat sure and unrelated and it's one of you you mentioned those three which again I think speaks to an advantage you have with tame so when you look at rapamycin resveratrol and metformin the big advantage of metformin is you already know the dose and the frequency with rapamycin over dinner tonight I'm gonna give you my philosophy on the dose and the frequency and we can discuss it but I can't demonstrate it to you with anywhere near the validity that you could do the same with metformin had a wonderful discussion with David

[01:25:37] Sinclair and bioavailability came up on receive a withdrawal right so maybe all the trials that say resveratrol is meaningless are simply not looking at what happens if you get enough respect all in the right place and again I it's amazing to me how many times in biology we can make mistakes of the first order because of a third or fourth order omission and this I guess I don't think

[01:26:04] I realized that until you just gave that explanation the value of effectively millions of patient years worth of data on metformin not just from a safety standpoint by the way it's it's billions and millions yeah so billions of patient year data on metformin I know that from an FDA standpoint the highest priority is safety that's a low bar to cross the more interesting one from the standpoint of this study is actual efficacy right and seems like if I'm hearing you correctly metformin is an amazing B student let's not be insulted by that what do I mean are there better ways to inhibit Ross if you want to hammer the Ross chain probably there's clearly better ways to inhibit mTOR if that's all you want to do are there better ways to modulate H

[01:26:52] DAC yes I'm sure there are but it might be that may be part of met Foreman's beauty is it does so many things at a B+ level never it's an A student but it's not a D student and it's never you know I mean I'm sort of thinking about this sort of in a tongue-in-cheek way but it's it seems to do so many things reasonably well well I call metformin a tool from my perspective it's just a tool to show that we can target aging because I think that there will be much better drugs and combination drugs and either in the future human lifespan is 115 years we argue maximal life yeah max yeah we argue because there's somebody hundred and twenty-two but you know there's a statistic thing so okay we die before the age of 80 so there are 35 years that is a specie without not that we cannot change more but just now without thinking too much futuristic low-hanging fruit that we can do and MIT for me is the perfect tool to start showing the proof of principle here but the future is much better it's just you have to to pave the road here this is a beautiful pivot to something else I want to discuss with you because unfortunately I could talk about metformin for three hours but there's so many other things I want to discuss with you near based on your work and you just alluded to one which is the work that you and your colleagues have done on centenarians has been very influential in my thinking so as I think about aging clinically I ask the question start with the existence principle what does it mean to live a long life is there proof of this having existed and there is we have centenarians they exist my hypothesis when I first started reading your literature which was only about five years ago my hope I should say not my hypothesis my hope was that whatever genetic benefit they had which it became very clear to me very quickly that this wasn't about what they did in fact they seemed to have almost near immunity to the worst behaviors imaginable my fear when I read your first paper which was a review paper I can still see it and I still remember where I was sitting in a

[01:29:13] Sheridan hotel reading it my fear was whatever blessing they had it was not it had nothing to do with chronic disease and it had to do with something nebulous and they had complete immunity from chronic disease and they just died in car accidents like they eventually just died because something else tripped them up and what I took away from your work was no their genetic gift was a phase shift and when they got chronic diseases they still died of heart disease they still died of cancer they still died of

[01:29:43] Alzheimer's disease they simply got a 20-year bonus if not more maybe 29 on average you could calculate call it a close to 30 year bonus well of health then yes yes because completely functional what was they had compression of morbidity so it's not only that they lived it longer and they lived healthier but they died it's the gun quicker quicker at the end of that and you know it's interesting the CDC the Center for

[01:30:11] Disease Control have looked at the last two years cost of life of people you know with different stuff so they looked at people who died at 70 and after 100 and the cost of dying after 100 was third of that of dying in 70 so it's not only in our study there is actually evidence wow I didn't know that to suggest that the medical and by the way those when they were 70 they didn't go to the doctor okay so the end and this is the base of this concept that's called the longevity dividend okay what what will happen to society if will actually be healthier for two and a half years and and the benefits are immense you think only of you know so we pay Social Security more and stuff but they're seven trillions dollars just in saving of cause if you could just live healthier so I know you don't spend an enormous amount of time anymore thinking about the centenarians you know your literature follow it very closely you you definitely are spending much more time talking about and writing about the things that we just discussed but if you could go back in time a little bit for me by the way that's not true maybe it's just selectively where I'm reading well no I think that's what's interesting to people now and I'm very happy about it but I just got the you know the longevity the Ipsen longevity price and my talk was actually about centenarians but a little bit of my hypothalamus stuff that was related to something but the centenarians are in and we have lots of grants on the centenarians because you know there's that talk by the way is it something that people can watch no no it wasn't it wasn't a record to shame it's a reaiiy I thought about it but this talk it was fun for me to give because it was reflective a little bit you know one of the things that's always funny for me is people say oh you know I have I can measure this thing I'm sure that centenarians they have they have high level because high levels are good and I had to put in to rest the fact that the genetics of centenarians is really great for me but the phenotype is not because you have a hundred years old and you can measure something that can reflect what brought you in here or the fact that thirty percent of them are going to die in the next year so it could be a marker of of death and not of longevity the other phenotype makes doesn't interest to me that's why I have their offspring because their offspring will have the phenotype or half of their offspring will have the phenotype but those things we're something that was nice because so many people are saying you know we should measure in centenary no we're we're doing a longitudinal study on their offspring and their offspring are equal everywhere to our control group they just have half of the diseases although you by the way that's a really interesting point near I never once thought of that

[01:33:04] I never what you just said that if I have a hundred year old centenarian in my study and he or she has a seat mu tation or an ape oc3 mutation and i look at the predictable phenotype because I know what you should have if you have that mutation hypo functioning APIs III should have low triglyceride but technically without a little more longitudinal legwork I don't actually know if what I'm measuring as a result of that but that said there must still be some benefit in you know what now that I'm saying it I realize you can't do it the dream state would be to have health records and phenotypes for centenarians that go 30 years back in other words it would be beautiful to follow a centenarian from seventy to a hundred so within a typical so that's why we have the longevity study it's a longitudinal study of offspring of centenarians and people without longevity and we're going forward we're already ten years into the study and we're starting you know to see the differences between those guys it's different population they are aging slower okay the children of centenarians so we have some of these things in mind what are the most important genetic differences between those either centenarians or offsprings of centenarians and the rest of us so it's very interesting and so this is a part that you haven't heard so from but it's actually the growth hormone igf-1

[01:34:38] Tamarians have genomic reasons so let's explain the normal path of that so the pituitary gland makes GH it tells the liver primarily to make iga right it binds to a receptor you're right in the liver and IGF and so some of the effects of the growth hormone system are through growth hormone itself and some of it is through igf-1 level both of them are decreasing with aging so in this system we identity you know more than 60% and I think I'm under estimating okay it's more it's probably more but I didn't really calculate who has several mutations you know I can calculate how many mutations they are but not the overlap of the mutation so I'm I'm saying 60% but it's the most common genomic alteration in our centenarians and I have to tell and where is it specifically I'll tell you in a second and I I wanted just to tell you I never

[01:35:37] I wrote grants on that because I thought because there's preliminary data in nature right the the small dogs live longer yes and the ponies live longer and when you mutate growth Ramone or or they're born dwarf they live longer and when you give more growth hormone they live shorter so there is a lot in nature but the human data was really confusing some diseases you know when you have iig if you have more concerts but you have less also less cancer

[01:36:08] I'm sorry less heart disease and less diabetes but more cancer right and mortality in mortality it's like in the middle you know a little bit tending to more from Canada you know from concerts by our analysis which I think pulls all of your data we found that there is an au shape mortality curve with the nadir being between 60th and 80th percentile of all cause mortality so I want to tell you the problem with this association on one hand an individual that age quickly okay their growth of an IG F goes down quickly okay so you would measure falsely low igf-1 level if you get edge them on the wrong side of their aging right that wouldn't fit our theory that low IGF is good because that's their their accelerated aging yeah so this is a problem with an association study like that we discovered first of all that when we take our centenarians so they're there in our study because they've been healthy at age 95 living independently we take them at any age but that's what they have to do and we just look at those with the highest IGF and the lowest igf-1 level those with the lowest igf-1 level leave twice as long those are already two centenarians but only women men do not in every example that I gave you there's a sex difference the growth hormone igf-1 sitive for women or for females sorry near let me ask you another question it's very difficult clinically to measure gh because it's pulsatile right so whenever you're saying growth hormone are you really saying i GF which is easier to measure no because I'm going to talk sooner but not on what I'm measuring but where the mutations are okay okay Pete what you just said the difference between men and women was that based on IG f level or gh level i

[01:38:14] GF levels okay but we discovered in aging we did a huge faux pas okay that we are now correcting we we studied in in our labs males only we had excuses what females are menstruating we don't know their effects and we're all discovering look even rapamycin that really works everywhere is better in females than males yeah but our boss is in males right there they're examples where we totally miss the sex effect and growth on a GF is a perfect example except those mice that are the snail mice or the Ames miles they have a pituitary problem which makes them I think sex confuse so you know there's so many other alterations but sex difference is important we also showed that those women with the lowest igf-1 level has much less cognitive problems you know third of the cognitive deficiencies of those with the highest

[01:39:18] IGF all right okay so we had to grab our second round of topo Chico there which by the way I didn't even ask you up front you this is your first time having topo Chico right yeah I mean this is there are a few things that bring me as much joy as introducing people to this bottled water that per year has is much milder I like to feel the bubbles well I would I think one thing we should consider for tame is if we can have an arm that also includes topo Chico so there's a placebo there's a metformin and then there's a metformin plus topo

[01:39:53] Chico and that question the this will be does that somehow enhance lifespan because even if it does not I predict it will enhance happiness well I have to tell you I'm an advisor to the prime minister of Singapore Singapore is a place that can you know plan the future and before going I said why don't you ask me questions and one of the questions shall we put metformin in the water or in sodas now good to ask the answer is no obviously but it's good that you're thinking that way so it for me and should you change your mind I think you now know which soda it should go into can you get it in Singapore oh

[01:40:36] I'm sure we can yeah so back to sort of what you were saying this this IGF male-female disconnect let's let's keep going down that rabbit hole so I was saying that one of the worries about low growth hormone in IGF is the effect on the muscle because people think that growth hormone effects muscle function muscle size and we found that in females and males the igf-1 level is not associated with better or worse lots of muscle function including grape and getting out of chair and you know other things so maybe the effect of low IGF in aging are just as good as having a higher effect of IGF on muscle just ways itself out okay but then our studies genetics okay that's what we try to do and a several years ago almost I guess a decade ago we found clusters of mutations in the IGF receptor those were new mutations that haven't been found before but we found him in nine of our centenarians which was 2% of our centenarians and that was kind of a proof of concept for us that that clusters of mutations that are functional is what we really need to look for rather than like everybody's doing doing Jewess and fine you know something infra genomic somewhere and this was also the first proof of concept that the growth hormone igf-1 to human human aging people that those 2% of our peer those nine people had higher igf-1 level because they were resistant right it's the IGF receptors they were resistant to IGF so their level was a little bit higher but they were significantly shorter than others which is a great explanation of how that phenotype would play out you would say well how can they be short statured with high IGF and the answer is if the IGF isn't as effective at the receptor right but remember that most of our people with low IGF are doing better by the way we take the people with Isis men men also or just women two men in those nine people and by the way then there are

[01:42:57] Dwarfs human Dwarfs that called LaRon Dwarfs the TV lien in Ecuador and Hussey coin and Valter Longo and some of the people in Ecuador were looking basically we're trying to find if they live longer too few of them to really know but they have less cancer in less diabetes you know significantly less so there's other evidence from humans came after ours that that there is at least less age-related diseases in those people he certainly didn't live a better life in any way that we could assess correctly I mean we we always joked that they they weren't happy with the fact that they're short so they drank a lot and that's the alcoholism and then when they cross the road nobody saw them so they died of more trauma but III think it's really not true so I met some of them we were in a Vatican conference everybody has to drip to bring his patients and longer brought somebody from Ecuador and I brought a centenarian from Rome and and the guy that he brought told a different story he wasn't unhappy he was also happily married with a big woman and had children and was so

[01:44:16] III don't and is the defect in them at the growth hormone receptor in the liver in the leaf so they make a normal amount of growth hormone their liver doesn't acknowledge you the feedback loop yeah so they have lots of growth hormone but it's not being expressed through the liver into I have no idea so we published last year a paper that took us ten years to write and basically we were looking at a relatively common mutation I'm saying common because it's like three four percent in the population where they have a complete deletion of exon 3 in the growth hormone receptor okay so one of the exomes the you know one of the things that are important for the integrity of this hormone right is deleted and of course you would think that that means that the growth hormone is less effective and Gillett smonny was fella with me brought me this data to suggest that while it's 3 4 percent in our control population it's 12 percent in our centenarians so I asked so what's the igf-1 level and he showed it slower and I said in what's the height of the people he said well that's the problem they're much taller so I said I cannot do anything with this study it just makes no sense i I don't know how to write to the people with lower IGF but the mutation was in the exon of of the growth hormone receptor so they had lower IGF so it was a dysfunction of the receptor Ron theory so less idea and we know that it was fully penetrant all their life in other words we there's no chance that it didn't start showing up until they were an adult well we'll come back to that but the mutation didn't change and by the way just give me some numbers here how low are there igf-i I don't directionally well you know we're talking about like less than a hundred we're no less than 200 okay yeah hundred is about the median level of a lie gf for somebody over 65 yeah I think in the studies that I told you the average or the mean or whatever was 94 something like that I don't remember to answer about those people okay now okay so he said what to do I said well first of all what you do with genetics you do replication study you know you go to other populations and you see what's going on there and second you do a functional study let's see if it's really a functional mutation so it took almost ten years right and in 10 years we replicated the data in three other population in Amish French centenarians in the CHS here in the United States and in all studies that people that lived the longest had much more of those homozygosity Xin the growth hormone receptor so that was a great validation second the functional so Hussey Cohen my partner in a USC we send him the lymphoblast of our patients the affected and not affected and he is a growth hormone igf-1 - baited them serum free so without stimulation and with growth hormone and looked boated activation and proliferation by growth hormone so in serum free without stimulation they had less activation and less proliferation half of normal suggesting yeah that's the mutation that's the function when he incubated them with growth hormone it totally switched I'm sorry by going back you talked about proliferation but was there a functional difference in the lymphocyte in addition to its increased number there's yet the the the first was activation by phosphoric and some of the okay some of the nonspecific activation no no specific to what growth hormone is doing but okay okay proliferation it's a you know it's a cell when he incubated it with growth hormone it was the opposite rather than this low proliferation low activation it was high activation high proliferation so what's going on well what's going on when do we have high growth hormones for puberty so with high growth hormone something has changed in the activation from low activation you jumped to high activation for reason with the the molecular met the real mechanism we don't know really but that's what happened when you have high growth hormones so they all were taller and then when growth hormone go down for the rest of their life they shut off okay so so okay so this is 12% of our people then you shin-soo who's a geneticist that's working on this she was interesting micro RNA that's another you know epigenetic thing thats comes we haven't been thinking about it but those are RNA that comes from certain region of the gene and they bind specifically to active region of the gene and they modulate it will 30% of our centenarians have clusters of micro RNA that are overexpressed by by a lot by 40 times you know just immensely activated one of them for example micron or a micro RNA 142 that's increased by 35 fold when you incubate it with with cells it prevents the phosphorylation of the IGF receptor a decreases some other signaling FOXO signaling and some other stuff dramatically so there's a micro RNA targeting of the growth hormone igf-1 in about 30% of our centenarians then 22% of our centenarians have mutation in

[01:50:27] FOXO 3a that's a common mutation in centenarians so you start 2 percent and 12 percent tell people at Fox or 3a does Fox Fox 2 3 AAA is another how would I say just house how's your stasis housekeeper that lets in good stuff and change things and good things in stop it's too complicated to go more but it is part of this very important energy factor that regulate homeostasis i cellular homeostasis I mean that's not a great explanation but yeah it isn't FOXO the most prevalent genetic difference between if you were to just isolate them by by genotype if you look at C type and c3 and FOXO and G

[01:51:17] H and IGF I mean if my recollection is that FOXO might be the single most prevalent of so I'm not sure that it's true but fox rea is common in all centenarians population around the world not every population has the same mutations in fact what we're doing now when we have the exome sequencing of all our subjects you know almost 3,000 exome sequencing the important thing to do is to assign them to pathways because you know we're doing something really silly with genetics when we had this G was we said we have million snips around the genome will find the diseases every disease in the world and one of the stupidest thing we did we took one snip at a time okay let's see if this snip is significant but we're not build of one snip of a time and in certain population there is down stat down this pathway there'll be another snip that will change the function so you need you need to our analysis now is totally different than how we started but this you know I mean I agree with you completely but I don't think most of the world is listening near I mean if I had a dollar for every time one of my patients came with their you know complete sequence and you know they want me to interpret them I have the same discussion so many times okay you have 20,000 genes to my last counting maybe 78 of them have a deterministic relationship with the disease you have none of them and we know you have none of them because if you had any of them we would know by now there's no chance you got here with

[01:52:58] Huntington's disease and we sort of missed it or there's no chance you have some inborn error of metabolism that somehow got missed and then we get into this whole G WAAS morass and you know it's hard to explain to people how multifactorial these issues are and I find myself maybe you do as well somewhat frustrated by these discussions and the over emphasis on this genetic you know it's a little bit of the drunk in the streetlight problem right and the guy is standing below the streetlight and you say what are you doing here and he says I'm looking for my keys and you say did you drop them here and he says no but this is where the light is so let me not increase the complexity but give you another ammunition okay so we did you know now several years ago because of funding we did our 44 best you know first centenarians their whole genome sequencing so think about it we have a study without control we just have 44 centenarians and we do the whole genome sequencing and our question was do sentiments have this perfect genome I mean maybe one out of 10,000 they just don't have all this crap from the G wasps those snips for heart and all servants are they're just great and we went to this a data set that's called clinvar clinvar then had the 15,000 pathogenic mutation that most probably will cause a disease okay now they have about 30,000 and our hypothesis is that our centenarians don't have any of those okay we'll support the perfect genome 40 for centenarians had more than 230 mutations between them another five to six mutations that should have caused them diseases and none of them had this disease in hundred years of life and some of those mutation I'll give you the best example therefore parking stone and cancer and everything but Apple a prohi for yeah what's the we have to Apple II 400 years old people that the textbook would say they're demented at 70 and dead at 80 and they're not demented and not dead at home do you think this at all explains the LPA uptick we see because you know one of my favorite topics is lipid ology and of course LP little a is a very virulent lipoprotein and yet centenarians seem to have more of it than the general population so we actually we actually showed in in a in a paper because we're the we we found a way so basically a week obviously we can have mutations that are protected because they have slow aging or longevity genes that protect them right so how do you prove that so we noticed that when you look cross sectionally i hope i can make it very simply when we put any genotype cross sectionally in other words we have all the ages from fifty to hundred and twelve is our oldest we see patterns if we see pattern that the genotype is declining with age we know it's killing people okay if we see that it's kind of monotonically increased with age like with its concentrating yet then means that people are surviving are surviving with this mutation that's why we have it more in hundred like the example of growth hormone receptor going for a three to twelve ena in a monotonic way m so we looked at LP Lily exactly and this is the most confusing of them all because I don't see any compelling evidence that

[01:56:59] LP little a is anything other than atherogenic and so it begs the question why would it concentrate in centenarians as opposed to just rise commensurate with the population exactly so this is the answer okay first of all we show cross sectioning that LPA drops until the age of eighty by half in other words it feels hot like that you like crazy people until it's not right and then and then you look at it and you kind of try to understand just a minute now this thing that killed now all of a sudden centenarians have even more right it should stay flat actually right it should be flat why is it increasing well because it's a protected aging gene in other words it was obviously during evolutionary times are you saying that the the thing that

[01:57:52] LP little a did for us 500,000 years ago that is no longer beneficial in this lousy environment the centenarians have managed to tap into its properties no no no so what we did what we did and it's all published in computational biology journals we took every one of the longevity gene that we have and we did gene to gene interaction in other words we try to see if there is interaction between the bed genotype and the good genotype the good longevity genotype and we did it to variety of those you shape right I'm telling you there is a u-shape you know it goes down with aging and then it's good in centenarians and we really found statistically significant that lp8 is protected by people who are homozygous to a CTP mutation that is a longevity mutation that we found that's the wavy mutation the VV mutation in other words most of the people with the

[01:58:59] LP Lily that our centenarians were also CTP CTP if you - can we tell people what that phenotype is so I've talked on this podcast a lot about CTEPH and its role in reverse cholesterol transport etc talk to me about what what does the lipid panel look like for someone who is CF VV plus or minus LP little s so those with CTP Vivi they have higher HDL levels hmm they have larger lipoprotein particle size and they have lower CTP levels that's their phenotype and this CTP has been protective against several age-related disease the most dramatic is cognitive decline and by the way the to a pony for are also CT PVV carriers so really the question is it sounds to me why if you are seat mvv that's a very protective phenotype and the difference if I remember the day they're going from 70 to 80 was basically flat if your seat fvv it really goes up when you turn 80 meaning the concentration of seat fvv the genotype yes the genotype goes up significantly once you hit 80 it goes in 55 it's 8% of the population and at a hundred it's 20% of the population so it's also important to know that not first of all the 8% the tariff vivir I don't know how many of them will be centenarians right and also not all centenarians are Vivi but it's really it's still very impressive because the problem with HDL cholesterol is is just such a dumbass metric it's so useless it's so far downstream that it doesn't tell us much but the hypothesis here would have to be that these people have far more functional HDL particles because I mean we could don't have to rehash this but anytime you pharmacologically increase HDL cholesterol by inhibiting C tap nothing good seems to happen right because you're actually impairing your entry raters release for transport right so it has to be with effect right that's what it has to be a functional a functional thing of the HDL probably or the lipoprotein particle size or something so I understand all of that here's the part I still don't understand near why wouldn't the LP little a phenotype or the LP a gene flatline after 80 in other words I understand why see tap VV is protective I don't understand why LP little a should concentrate I think because the CTP is common and it's very protective and that's why you do it look it's a cross-sectional okay it by the way it's a good question that's what we asked why it's not flat but for a person who's born and is going to be a centenarian for them it's really not so so they don't die women is I need to I need to do the math we and we we could this over dinner will sketch this out on a napkin you take a hundred people who are going to be centenarians a hundred people who are not eight percent of each of them call it ten percent of each of them have LPA we should do the math on if it's are we being fooled by the age because I do have one alternative hypothesis by the way I'll show you I'll show you dinner I'll show you the actual calculation computation okay so this would be good this will answer my question because the other hypothesis

[02:02:35] I've often wondered is depending on so I'll start with my question and then I'll go to my hypothesis how much phenotyping have you done on the LPA do you know how much heterogeneity is with their Kringle repeats for example no i and i don't have their LP a level I have just their LP a genotype so the things that we've done are though we can do actually we've done a little bit on the CTP levels or we've done but those calculation are on gene to gene interaction okay taking out the people without genotype and without general type and seeing who are the people where the centenarians that stayed with the bed LP a genotype they were only the ones were CTP also I a see it do you have serum stored on these subjects yeah but but and I have a proteomics done and maybe we can have some measurements I'm not sure I wonder if there's a clue to a very vexing question which is why is it that some people with high LP little-a do not go on to get premature heart disease many do most do a significant number do not and it appears completely uncoupled from the level of their LP little-a which makes me wonder are there virulent and non virulent phenotypes that at the level of expression by number or molecular weight aren't captured and my question then becomes is the is the non virulent one the one that is concentrating in the centenarians and are they the population in which we should understand that phenotype so we can better risk stratify the rest of us schleps walking around today 10% of whom have elevated LP little a but we don't know how aggressively to treat them yeah I didn't know that there's virulent or non virulent LP lolei my explanation is totally gene to gene interaction in other words you should you do another phenotype I guess the answer is is different is that the people with it what's the LP little-a what's there CTP level what's their HDL what's their HDL particle size and maybe you can see that's generalized that if you inhibit

[02:04:52] CTP the LP lay is less the problem we III agree with what you're saying the challenge is we do not have an HDL functional assay so right now we can measure HDL cholesterol we can measure HDL particle number and we can measure HDL size but none of those come close to telling us how functional Department I have a collaboration with den Raider yep who's doing HDL II flux and stuff yeah I mean Dan is a god in this field yeah so maybe but I'm you know that's not my this is a past life for me yeah yeah I moved on so I don't I don't really know to answer you let's go back to the IGF

[02:05:32] GH thing because this one still creates tremendous let's bring it back to clinical stuff so I'm often asked by patients hey should I be on growth hormone and my answer is I don't think so but if I'm gonna be brutally honest I really don't know I really have no insight into whether growth hormone is exogenous administered growth hormone is harmful helpful neutral or what because the clinical data certainly don't give us the answer right so the epidemiology if you're in sort of you know vaulters camp is that would be the worst thing you could ever do growth hormone is bad because IGF is bad but again the epidemiology tell a different story tell a much more nuanced story that has to do with how high is too high at what age and for what gender and with respect to what disease so of course how can you manipulate IGF well you can manipulate it the two easiest ways to manipulate IGF the three easiest ways to manipulate IG effort to manipulate growth hormone exogenously manipulate

[02:06:29] IGF dietarily predominantly through amino acids and manipulate insulin to indirectly impair or enhance IGF binding proteins well let me tell you we just published a paper in Nature a month ago the study that we're going also for a while and what we did is we got from engine engine is as much as other pharmaceuticals try to develop antibodies against IGF receptor because

[02:06:56] IGF receptor is expressed in many cancers yeah this was the disaster drug that they tested against metastatic pancreatic cancer it failed but if I recall there was a very special little gift which is no CNS penetration am I thinking of the right one Yeah right so it failed but we're interested for aging yes and not only we're interested for aging our hypothesis was that IGF you know that you need to decrease IGF action in the periphery but increase it in the brain because of the data so we asked them to moralize their antibodies were nice means to make it available for a mouse right and we got it and we did a longevity study that we started at 22 months by the way remind me in a human study how much did it lower i GF in the periphery it increased I'm sorry I know

[02:07:53] I'm sorry how much did lower IGF in the periphery was it a reduction by what fold like was it a two-fold question it's very hard to measure you don't measure it like that you measure it in in you know in vitro it's very hard to measure how much okay and they rebounded a little bit with IGF which is not the case with aging because with aging you don't have the growth hormone secretion so we gave it to 22 months old animals that are 70 75 years of age equivalent we increase their health spend dramatically and we increase their lifespan by 10% it's an old age okay so this is a drug that's already was you were able to demonstrate I'm sorry I missed this paper it came out a month ago so I'll be inhaling it this time tomorrow you basically showed that you didn't change

[02:08:42] IG f levels in the brain or you actually increased IGF levels we bring we really don't know there is a little increase in igf-1 level in the periphery and we're assuming that we didn't make it a big I'm telling you what we thought we didn't make it such a big deal but obviously the antibodies do not cross the blood-brain barrier but the IGF wasn't lower if anything was high right so if anything IGF went up in the periphery because it was being blocked and therefore it could have got more into it so you could have had more CNS activity less peripheral activity of IGF now again those were aging by the way it was in females in males we started to do the studies in males and since we didn't see any major effects and we had relatively little you know those are months of studies in many mice so we eventually did their longevity only in females we don't have data on males but the extent of health spend and you'll see the paper it's really it's a great paper with lots of studies and it's impressive how much they did better the females with it so there you have an example we have all the paths where you ask what do we do here is it's been in humans okay the IGF receptor antibody is there the only problem for us is aging could be an indication what what's before aging like we need another indication in order to start selling it before but what's your hypothesis in those mice in the female mice that they you said they live ten percent longer and and what's held here and much healthier so they had compressed morbidity as we had a car do you know they had the cardiovascular protection they have cognitive advantage functional advantage there's a whole thing the interesting thing between male and female the difference is the mice the female mice that were treated with

[02:10:39] IGF receptor antibody had a lot of of inflammatory markers right when we started there were 22 months and those inflammatory markers were really decreased with aging in males we had a little bit more inflammatory markers but they increased with the IGF treatment so maybe the and both the males and the females had an increase in peripheral IGF presumably the antibody was working in both right but somehow the inflammatory response in males was different so it's all driving so I'm answering you two things first of all what do you do here's a good example of a drug that was in females and we have preclinical proof of concept that it's good but the second is in males all those have not been shown any and in fact you know the functional that I told you it functional in women it looks like the function was better for men with a higher GF and not with

[02:11:43] Laura not statistically significant but you could see that it might happen so I'm telling you from human studies from genetic studies I'm telling you growth hormone treatment is not beneficial it should be dangerous for elderly people for elderly women with men I'm ready to say that I'm not sure you know I'm not sure it's not that I've shown that low

[02:12:08] IGF or growth hormone is better in males not in my rodent studies and not in my human studies but it's hard to say that giving growth hormone is bad when you know by the way the growth hormone receptor story is a lot of them are males that really that this said this is so interesting I mean this is such a layer of sophistication to this question which I've largely sort of decided that

[02:12:37] I can't come up with a compelling reason for exogenously but I also can't see much evidence clinically that it's killing people but of course I think disproportionately the data are in men what do you think explains this sex difference between men and women I think I'm really if you look at this inflammatory panel lots of cytokines in lots of animals I'm not sure we don't have the intellectual link to say what happens but this is something we want to actually go on and examine because if for some paradoxical way that is sex dependent low IGF increase inflammation we want to do we want to know why and we want to know how we can affect it right if you could repeat the study with younger mice both male and female again because I mean the most obvious example is the biggest difference between the men and women are the sex hormones and the older they get that difference is still there I mean women will you know the female mice would go from having some testosterone to zero testosterone but gosh the men would probably still have more estrogen than though the males have more estrogen than the females post-menopause right which makes me wonder if the estrogen the progesterone in the testosterone are somehow predict a protective of the inflammatory effects so there's a you know we're working on a grant because the sex issue is so interesting we started working on there lots of models where you can change x and y chromosomes and stuff like that and you know we're looking at a way to look at it because it's I don't think it's usually as simple as the sex hormones you know I think we're missing a whole biology you know a whole biology and whatever is the sex hormones I don't understand the inflammation in that either but by the way your idea of doing it in young is good Amgen sold this IGF receptor and we cannot get we cannot get more samples but we're interested to maybe do our own where am gene sold the rights to the human antibody right their whole section actually their whole section to do which company owns it now to like a private company that we're unable to get people to though I have to say it's not our major priority now but and we have some consultants that are trying to get it together with those people so you know it's still an issue but I'll tell you if I had to develop a treatment I would rather use the micro

[02:15:21] RNA 142 because the IGF receptor antibody didn't work in cancer but maybe the micro are penetrates better in another way and maybe that's the way to decrease IGF receptor in you know in cancers so anyhow but I really answered you is that yeah we there are things that we could do to affect the pathway I mean what do you think about sort of all the to me the most obvious way to manipulate IGF is through fasting so about once a quarter I fast for a week with just water only and it has a profound impact on my IGF level so for my age I think I should know these numbers off by heart but plus or minus two standard deviations of IGF and my age is about ninety two to fifty and if

[02:16:12] I take my if I measure my IGF level before fast right before a fast it might be 180 to 200 and right after the fast it's eighty or ninety and six weeks later it's maybe one forty one fifty so it sort of falls precipitously during the fast and then slowly Rises and then falls precipitate and slowly Rises and there's part of me that just wonders if a cyclic approach to IGF is a healthier approach then say constitutively being calorically restricted and just you know because you could starve yourself of methionine and eat no protein and live at a lower IGF of maybe 110 forever but

[02:16:57] I wonder if the the real game is sort of figuring out this sort of cycle and periods of just just as we think of a toff oh gee if you're always in a state of a tofu gee that's a bad thing if you never have a tofu gee that's a bad thing so you know about the calorie or the caloric restriction that then IA funded in three centers yeah Eric Roberson very cunning sinner is one of the main POS one of the things is that IGF level wasn't decrease in those people right and we think IG f decrease is really important part of longevity but we we've we learned something else and maybe I'm digressing because I'm sure you talked about it more that what we are doing in rats wasn't really caloric restriction we're doing intermittent fasting because in rodents we would bring the food in the morning they were hungry right they would eat all the food you know the 60% whatever we gave to it libido and they were fasting for 23 hours and and they had low you know low igf-1 level but in

[02:18:03] Eric reversing studies they didn't have low IGF because it wasn't caloric restriction like that they gave them just less food throughout the day okay Anna and I think that was a big mistake that we realized we were doing and it doesn't answer this they're circulating I think what we're trying to do at

[02:18:19] Einstein is we're doing a study we know that auto Fuji is improved quite fast in fasting rodents we don't know the timeline for humans okay so we're trying to figure it out and by the way we can do with Anna Maria Cuervo we can take T lymphocytes and look at the auto Fuji on a time course in humans and they actually reflect also tough OG in the brain there there's a lot of advantage in doing this what are you looking at specifically in the assay well there are several things because there are several or tofu G's right so macro tofu G or or chaperone mediated a toughie G so there there are several things can you measure might offer G also yeah we do yeah how sensitive is it to meal timing you know like for example if a rodent is fasting for 24 hours especially a mouse I mean that's gosh that's probably adequately human fasting for a week presumably a toughie G is highly highly highly up regulated if you give the mouse a little bit of Chow and then measure that assay does it obfuscate does it it does it erase the fact that they've been does it create the illusion I guess I should say that it's erased that they've had it this high period of Vltava gee did you transiently truncate it you know on

[02:19:42] America wherever did and I don't know the answer I don't know the time course and but the important thing is to find the time course in humans so that we can really say for example I'm what I'm doing basically is I'm trying not to eat after dinner until like lunchtime the next day so but do you really mean so first of all how hard is it to get an IRB at Einstein to study this in hell no no we have IRB we just wrote a grand we need money for that okay yeah I guess you know I have a whole framework around nutrition which

[02:20:14] I'm happy to kind of walk through as we inhale our dinner tonight have you decided by the way if you want Indian Turkish Persian yes Greek you know because it's raining out so I guess one of the things we could do to the closest well freaking out yeah so my concern with time restricted feeding which I practice quite liberally is I'm worried it is not a significant enough deprivation of nutrients in humans in other words I think Sachin 's data is so impressive in mice you know but I think that for a mouse to go 16 hours without eating is an enormous task it might be the equivalent of us not eating for three days and now that said I I'm struggling to see a downside of time restricted feeding and I know that you know Valter and others have said time restricted feeding is somehow bad I don't accept those arguments I do I'm not convinced by those data but this is a very interesting question you're asking I would argue it's the most interesting question of all because if we understand the time course of that all of a sudden we can program nutrient exposure and have you looked at that a say in the presence of rapamycin or metformin I didn't but metformin annamaria cuervo is using MIT formulas the control for a tougher G okay it activates a tough OG really well okay so that's it I'm talking about in vitro assays okay but we haven't measured it in in patients the the one thing I should say I just don't forget anything absolutely and it's it's back to the metformin just reminded me it's pectin with metformin studies so our reviewers we're saying you know okay all the data on the biology that you showed was from rodents and we don't know that the biology is real to humans okay although of course the preliminary data in humans are much better than in rodents right the association with diseases so we had a clinical studies a small clinical study which we took 15 people that are 75 years old and we gave some of them at forming for six weeks and other placebos and then we crossed over and it was blinded and we took it at the end of each period we took biopsy from their muscle and biopsy from their adipose tissue okay so not liver and we looked at the transcript and the metabolomics but mainly the transcripts in the tissues to see effects on mid forming and there are three interesting things first of all when they brought me their clinical results you know in saline how my glucose in all there was significant effects in many of them statistically significant effects but I was expecting more I started to try and break it down and then we found out that the people who were last on metformin although it was half of the people had much more significant results than the whole 15 people wait explain that again the people in the crossover who started who went placebo to metformin had better effects on metabolic parameters relative to themselves or to their peers do relatively to themselves because ever this was a person-to-person this was in person versus a paired t-test and the reason is that probably the two weeks wash over is not enough when you fix the s aging it lasts for a while okay so if you got meat forming and then placebo you didn't really you you went half way back also by the way because metformin is associated with weight loss and they lost a little weight that on itself really made them more ii yeah no well it's funny you bring that up i'm glad you were mention that what do you think explains the weight loss phenotype of metformin so when I started taking metformin which was 2010 I didn't mess around I just went straight to 2.5 grams a day

[02:24:30] I didn't even mix it up I don't think I took it the idea I mean I took to 2500 milligrams first thing every morning and after a month I lost quite a bit of weight but I was also nauseous 24/7 I mean the thought of eating was repulsive to me I still ate you know I was exercising a lot in doing all my usual shenanigans but I clearly ate less just because of that low-grade feeling of nausea today when I prescribed met Foreman to patients I have them start at 500 qhs than 500 B ID then v you know 500 in the morning 1500 before bed then one gram VI

[02:25:05] D is sort of standard dose and I see far less of that nausea and I see far less weight loss what what other mechanisms do you think it could explain the weight loss so could it be locked ik acid going up you know just like ketones you get as a substrate in additional substrate yeah I don't know but look I started metformin several years ago because I was pre-diabetic my doctor did it so it's before I'm glad that he did but it was before I thought much about it and I was just surprised after three months to realize that I lost you know seven or eight pounds I was surprised because I couldn't

[02:25:46] I wasn't nauseated I wasn't anything I must have eaten less I was less hungry I reacted better I reacted better to my body right to my leptin maybe I reacted better and I probably didn't eat as much not totally not noticing it it was a surprise yeah it's funny I tell patients not to expect that because I don't I don't like the idea of patients thinking if this is like a weight loss drug to me that sort of is not the right way to think about it but I've never had a great explanation and and by the same token I have had I should be clear I've had also some patients who have they've come back and they've lost 10 pack and these are patients who were not overweight this is not you know this is someone that by everybody's standard would be completely normal weight you know BMI is 24 body composition as reasonable and comes back in you know in three months and they've lost 10 pounds but I guess for in my at least in my practice that seems to be the exception and not the rule but very very interesting to the year you know I guess of course you wish that was more than a two by two two week you wish that was a twelve week by two week we are doing the same thing with our bows now and we're doing longer study with longer washing period because we want to get away from that but back to metformin I said that's one thing is there but forming last issue the second thing that we showed that most of the transcripts changes were relative to this to the tissue you know in fact it was more free fatty acid metabolism in the muscle was more pyruvate metabolism so it was appropriate if I was there wasn't limit forming you know the metformin part but in both tissues they were genes that are not metabolic genes you know like brca1 or myofibril genes and other things that are related to aging but they are not metabolic they change by metformin in other words the concept that it for me is not only metabolic it's aging okay brca1 changed yeah you know some other gene genes that are associated with Jeannette with the with DNA repair changed significantly the second did you see in the muscle by the way if you still have biopsies I'd be very curious to know if they lactate transporter out of the muscle I'm blanking on it it's MC t2 in other words as people make more and more lactate in the muscle do they get more and more efficient at shuttling it back to the liver and if so you would expect every CT to gene expression changes by that yeah you know we have the road date that he didn't come up

[02:28:23] I'll tell you didn't come up as a winner but that doesn't mean it's not it's not changed and you looked at genome or you looked at he looked at messenger as well you looked at em already it's all on the script it's all morning so you should have seen it if it happened well if it was highly I mean there are hundreds of changes okay so maybe just was underpowered do you see that difference is significant changes so I can still answer you I can see that

[02:28:49] I'll see you specifically and it's our na six so it's really good it will be good you know if if I take that and see that it can be without taking into account that there are 400 other changes it can be significant him the other thing though what you do with transcript you look at upper regulators of the system and there's a way to do that that's what everybody doesn't know so if you look at the upper regulators you get back to the same things that are affecting aging MP kinase mTOR all those pathways were affected by metformin except that what you measured below is the tissue specific effects but it was all related back straight to aging you know person so we we really connected not only the clinical data but the biological data in humans to the tame study and it's wonderful you know say it um a few years ago in my my father was diagnosed with cancer I immediately put him on metformin and you know in His infinite wisdom his primary care doctor took him off it because you know why would you put him on metformin and in the end my father decided his primary care doctor knows much more than I do and so remains off metformin but certainly this discussion because I you know I probably know more about metformin than the average person but this discussion has been completely illuminating there's one other thing I want to ask you about which is all of the discussion around nad

[02:30:21] I mean you're you know quite a bit about this what is your take right now based on the state of the science that we have which admittedly I think we're just scratching the surface of as far as first and foremost just at the mechanistic level do what is your belief that orally administered nicotinamide ride beside can actually make it into a cell I don't if you've seen it but Josh

[02:30:44] Rabinowitz his paper over the summer would suggest no most of this is going to deliver so wouldn't this sort of call into question the company's there's two of them right now chroma decks and elysium that cell basically nicotinamide right beside plus or minus pterostilbene what do you think explains the reported efficacy of those agents in light of

[02:31:07] Rabinowitz's nad tracer study first of all the Rabinowitz study was also criticized okay time cores and other things which okay I'm just saying that but I think really the biggest issue here I want just to use this opportunity to say that a lot of what we're doing is not based on clinical studies okay and it really just underlines the fact that unless you do a clinical study you can remain guessing now I'll tell you I'm taking a good preparation of nmn okay tell the listener the difference between n R and n MN because they're both precursors to nad but there's a there's a subtle difference yeah and I don't know I don't know to explain that really well I don't I don't care that much okay but theory one is slightly more stable than the other right it's a stability issue availability issue but they'll fight that we we don't know which is the better and we don't know which gets to the tissue right yeah M but what I want to I wanted to say is the following so so the answer is it could also it could all be water okay it could all be this you say that as you hold up the bottle of topo Chico right sorry you didn't see that in the microphone okay but what I'm doing now is I'm opening my feet beat okay and one of the things that the feed

[02:32:41] B tears is sleep okay do you use feedback no I use something called hora which works much better okay yeah this really measures sleep well do you get also the deep sleep and yes REM and all that okay since I started taking any men and it might be a coincidence so I have to stop it and start again but my sleep has been much better that means I in the beginning of the night I have much more deep sleep and then the end of the night I have much more REM mm-hmm and I thought if there is anything I can say about it is that just because of this association okay but I don't believe it right because it's not it's a smile it's me and it's empirical way many could have looked I was vacation I don't know many things could have happened do you take the nmn by itself or do you also pair it with pterostilbene origin others are too an activator just in a minute but it's a good it's a good suggestion maybe okay but then I run into em I do you know who's the my he is from st. Louis and he has his own patterns and studies in Japan on anime and he tells me unprovoked he says you know I have 200 subjects and one of the interesting thing is their sleep patterns improved they get more deep sleep in the beginning of the night and more REM at the end of the night in other words he tells me what I've noticed and it makes me just think and maybe believe in maybe hope that something is getting into the cells yeah and that there's a real effect a at least on sleep you didn't tell me any other things but really my answer is we don't really know enough it's it's very hard to measure effect because this nid goes and and goes away and and you know what system can you do it's very hard to measure that and without clinical studies that are really went well controlled I think it's going to be hard to just support it and that's me as a conservative scientist and one who says that even but for me that everybody says you have enough data no we have to do the clinical study to prove that and that's where I really stand and it seems to me that intravenous administration of nad is also not particularly helpful though it seems quite popular in the that I'm not I haven't seen compelling evidence that giving nad intravenously makes its way into the cell either so I think the development the interesting development will be to develop a drug and the drug will be a precursor that will get into the blood outside of the liver outside of the liver yeah exactly so if you could give

[02:35:45] NR or n MN sublingually or intravenously that strikes me as very interesting saying that there's a lot of data in rodents where also you look you give it in different ways you give it some in water but some are gavage and maybe that's different because one of the problems may be if you go deep enough you can bypass circulation right you can bypass something so you know but the in vivo studies are good studies okay you just don't know what it means to humans for you know well near I'll do a time check here we've been we've been going at this for a little while there's a lot more I want to sort of pick your brain on but we could also just sit down and do this again sometime

[02:36:28] I want to make sure you've said at least as much as you want to say about metformin because I think that to me is you know your your at this point arguably one of the world's experts on a drug that just to put this in perspective I think Lou Cantley who is obviously a close mutual friend of ours and James Watson who I don't know personally have both said quite publicly that metformin may have already saved more patients lives from cancer than all other cancer drugs combined or something to that effect this is a drug that I think with each passing day more and more people are beginning to learn about beginning to ask questions about and my hope is that if nothing else this podcast is a place that people can listen to this episode if they can't go and read 16 of your papers and they don't necessarily want to get you know that far down the rabbit hole but to hear it from you and not from me or some other schmuck who doesn't know much I want to make sure that if there's anything else you want to say about in that form in that that you say so and so is there anything else that you want to add well let me do one practical thing in one a little bit more philosophical okay the practical thing that really surprised me

[02:37:41] I was I was giving a talk somewhere for laypeople so it was organized by a university and they invited people and to their surprise there were three hundred people in the audience and by the way my talk wasn't about metformin my took my talk did to the titles of my talk is usually how to how to die young in a very old age that's what I my title is usually if I can get away with it that's a good title so people people are coming and as they are entering some of them come to me and say so how much performing should I take okay so I started talking and all of a sudden I said let me ask you something who here in the audience is non-diabetic and is on metformin and please you know you don't have to just if you choose to so how many half the people where was this talked about University I don't want to okay what City can you say what city was it in the United States no okay fair enough so you know the in other words the prophecies out which makes me a little bit worried about this study when we first Wall Street Journal is the first that picked on teh wrote an article the next week we had three thousand phone calls and emails of people volunteering to the study which is what we need to do the study and I thought was just cut your work you get you trim that budget from 70 million down to 65 you cut all the recruiting exactly except that then you really ought to bias him then you realize just a minute those people first of all we didn't advertise they had to find my phone number and email and second they'll do they're doing other things you know it's like with the estrogen bias they're probably exercising and stuff like that and then when I started getting emails like I'm volunteer to stir it to the study as long as I'm not on the placebo I thought you know if people care so much if they'll figure out they're not on metformin they'll just get meat for me so from recruiting the 3,000 we we out load those those are not in my study right so I want to say that still we haven't done the study okay we haven't done this study so you will be between 65 and 80 okay just know we haven't done this study we don't know if it's safe as it is in young people and so we don't have really a clinical study with evidence that this is good and I'm just worried now that part of the reason to do this study is because if it's not good people should know also right and not take another drug okay yeah not that

[02:40:31] I believe it but it is possible the second thing that is more philosophical so III said before that I was invited to the Vatican actually was invited twice the second time and I'm very close to Cardinal Revathi who was number four in the pontiff's he's in charge of science and on arts that is including science and it's interesting because the Vatican basically says we don't want to be in a

[02:41:00] Galileo Galilei situation again we don't want to be in a situation where the science is so right and we're so wrong that we don't know what to do with it okay and so they call me and they said you know we have a meeting in the Vatican and we'd like you to talk about aging could you come and say I said sure sure

[02:41:19] I'll come and then I'm going on and saying am i the keynote speaker they said the keynote speakers are the Pope and Joe Biden who was vice president I said okay sorry sorry I'm still coming so that's how it goes Joe Biden goes up and explains his cancer initiative and how difficult it is because when you have cancer you have in the cancer maybe five other genomes and they're all so different than every other cancer like that in the world it's really a mess then comes the Pope and says you know I still hope that there'll be one little pill cheap for everyone in the world that will cure whatever cancer they wear appropriate yeah I hope so too but then I go up and

[02:42:12] I say well there is actually a cheap peel like that and I don't know if it cures any cancer in the world but it can it can prevent a lot of the cancers in the world and actually it has a side effect that it also can prevent a lot of other diseases in the world so it was like so it was like the you know going back to aging and the risk of aging for age-related diseases and how impactful and cheap it could be compared to treating cancer or something like that so I think the prevention of aging is is really a good place to be and I think because we went from hope to promise and we have to realize the promise thing life is going to be very different in the less next decade with our advanced last question and not to end on a downer but let's try to figure out where a blind-spot could be what could where could we be wrong obviously you and I share more in common in terms of philosophy and points of view than I even realized before we spoke but where could we be wrong so you know I'll tell you what's my optimism you know we have the European have nine pillars of aging and we have seven pillars of aging and they're all inter connected and when I say interconnected I just spend the time with Anna Maria Cuervo this morning when she fix a toughie gee she fixes also metabolism okay there when when you start doing things in any one of those pillars you start improving the others now where we could could be wrong is we don't know what is the impact of each of those pathway in humans okay most of our data is kind of animal data but I our fallback is that we all age the advantage of in aging is that aging is universal every every animal has the skin the hair the skeletal the frailty it's very Universal and those treatments are metformin rapamycin you give it to any animal it almost delays the aging there so I don't think we're going to be wrong I think that maybe some pathways will not be so effective some of them will be harder to treat maybe but I think we have to affect 3/4 and we're right on our way to do better and that's just the beginning and in the tame study it'll it will it be one to one male to female yes so we'll also avoid that other right and have you powered it such that men and women are different animals well no because all our data on metformin and we looked carefully to the

[02:45:18] DPP and other they didn't see any gender effects on any of the outcomes so we're assuming that so you're powered is the gender that there are different a significant like like we would do maybe rough amaizing you know well near this has been fantastic you know I was sick the last two days my voice is gone I feel like crap I was like maybe we should postpone it but then when I woke up this morning I was like there is no way we are postponing this discussion because I cannot wait to have this discussion so thank you so much for coming over it was great it was you know it was great because you ask really great questions and also I'm now quite hungry and I'll be happy to have dinner with you now so we are going to put together a seminar on how not to calorically restrict right only tonight or hey thank you near you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter Tia MD com what's a nerd Safari you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
