## Transcript

[00:00:00] What do women need to be aware of? So, not every woman can come and see you, right? Not every woman has access to a doctor who has the breadth of knowledge that a select few do in this space. So, a how can women find practitioners near them and what do they need to be aware of? what are the exploitative practices out there that that they need to be uh mindful of and not get duped into sort of sub you know either dangerous therapies or you know just uh you know overly extractive therapies. I think there's danger on both sides. There's danger going to the doctor for 10 minutes and saying oh that's not safe. You don't want to do this. Right? And there's dangers of going to the very expensive pellet clinic that is going to overdose you and charge you lots and lots of money. So you need I like um being somewhere in the middle and getting a few opinions here, right? So this is where opinions can be uh following the a bunch of people on Instagram. Don't just follow one people. Follow a bunch of people. If you like books, there's tons of books now on menopause, right? There are What are some of your favorites? So I mean you've got um Mary Cla Haver has the most popular book called The New

[00:01:12] Menopause. Heather Hirs has a great book called Pick Your Menopause Type. Um there's been a a a hot and bothered a journalist wrote a great book on perry menopause. Uh Jansancy Dunn. Um Tams Infinidologist wrote a book um about menopause who's also a reporter. So you're getting a Estrogen Matters is a great book, right? A really great book.

[00:01:30] So this is there's a lot of books now, thank goodness. Um you know there's one called the Menopause Manifesto. There's great books on menopause. There's also podcasts now. There's great podcasts out there. There's great um Oprah just did a special on uh uh uh you know there's there's documentaries on PBS now. So menopause is having a movement. So you can't have this excuse anymore of oh my doctor doesn't do this. Go find a different doctor. There are tele medicine companies. And what's a what's the website you refer to? Menopause.org is the menopause society website. That doesn't guarantee you have someone who knows everything but menopause.org means somebody took a test and put some effort into saying I care about menopause. I um

[00:02:08] I'm on that website. But iswish iss.org is the women's sexual health society. So people who we care about menopause and sexual health. So that's a great place to find a provider. So those are two websites that can help you find someone. Again, you have to advocate for yourself because no one will do that other than you. And so I think the more you educate yourself, the more you can find the right people in your pit crew who are going to fill that gas tank and get you to where you want to go. Do you feel that there are too many women that are still getting their hormone therapy in the in the sort of dark alley with with sort of highly sus individuals? And if so, what would be what would be a clue that you're in that camp? Because there's nobody that's in that camp that knows it, right? So, what what who are what are the I want I want a woman who's watching this who's not getting great medical care but thinks she is to maybe get a a bit of a hint as to what that might look like. I think this is a a problem. When your doctor only has one type of med when your doctor says no, you can't have anything, that's suspect.

[00:03:13] If your doctor says you can only have this really expensive product that has to be uh uh uh inserted into your butt uh four times a year and you have to pay me thousands of dollars, that's extremely suspect compounded by me. If they say you have to pay lots of money for this special compounded product that's safer and more effective, I call red flag on that situation. If you have to give very expensive saliva testing labs and they're making you pay a lot of money, very suspect. Again, that doesn't mean you can't do it. If it's working for you and you're happy, you have body autonomy, you do what you want, but know that there's red flags there. Um, I think the pellet industry, we I have a big problem. We have an FDA approved pellet for men. Okay? It can be FDA approved. I am not upset with a pellet as a concept. If the pellet companies cared about women, do the studies. Go through the FDA. Show me it's safe. If you believe it's billion-dollar industry, if you believe that it's the greatest thing in the world, show me so that I have that so that I can start using it because I'm going to because the FDA is a pretty good compounding pharmacy. So, do the work. Go. I have my beef with the FDA. Hello, you need to take that box labeling off estrogen products, especially vaginal estrogen.

[00:04:23] But if the pellet companies deeply cared about women, which they say they do, do the work that everyone takes advantage of women. All the supplement companies, all of these, they take advantage by promising these things to women, but they don't do the work of science. So that's what I ask is is just do the work. I'm Peter.
