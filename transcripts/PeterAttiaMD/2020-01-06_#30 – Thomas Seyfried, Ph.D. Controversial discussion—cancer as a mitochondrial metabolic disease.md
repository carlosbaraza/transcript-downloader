-Insulin potentiation therapy and glutamine inhibition [1:13:15];
-The macrophage fusion-hybrid theory of metastasis [1:39:30];
-How are cancer cells growth dysregulated without a mutation? [1:47:00];
-What is the dream clinical trial to test the hypothesis that we can reduce the death rates of cancer by 50%? [2:03:15];
-How can the hypothesis be tested rigorously that structural abnormalities in the mitochondria impair respiration and lead to compensatory fermentation? [2:26:30];
-Case studies of GBM survivors [2:32:45]; and

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the episode with Dr. Thomas Seyfried:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Thomas Seyfried discussing his controversial view that cancer is primarily a metabolic disease rather than a genetic one. He argues that mitochondrial dysfunction is the root cause of cancer, leading to fermentation metabolism even in the presence of oxygen (the Warburg effect). The discussion covers his research journey from epilepsy to cancer metabolism, and his proposed "press-pulse" therapeutic approach combining ketogenic diet, hyperbaric oxygen, and glutamine targeting.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Cancer cells continue fermentation metabolism even in presence of oxygen [00:32:57]
- Mitochondrial structural and functional defects are present in all cancers examined [00:37:46]
- Substrate level phosphorylation (SLP) provides energy for cancer cells when oxidative phosphorylation is compromised [00:53:28]
- GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) rarely metastasizes outside CNS but can in some cases [01:57:08]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Maintain healthy mitochondrial function to prevent cancer [00:44:52]
- Consider metabolic approaches alongside conventional treatments [02:04:53]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- DON (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine) for targeting glutamine metabolism [02:14:28]
- Metformin mentioned as potential metabolic therapy [02:04:53]

5. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Ketogenic diet as part of cancer treatment protocol [02:06:09]
- Therapeutic fasting discussed for cancer treatment [02:06:31]
- Glucose-ketone index should approach 1.0 [02:06:09]

6. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Blood glucose and ketone levels [02:06:09]
- Lactate production as marker of fermentation [01:37:46]
- Oxygen consumption measurements [01:40:11]

7. **Notable Quotes**:
"We can drop the death rate by more than 50% in ten years" [02:00:32]
"Cancer is not a genetic disease" [02:35:10]

8. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What specific experiments could definitively prove whether cancer is primarily metabolic or genetic?
2. How can metabolic therapy be integrated into standard of care without compromising patient outcomes?
3. What is the optimal timing for implementing metabolic interventions in cancer treatment?

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com

[00:00:41] hello everyone welcome to this week's episode of the Peter Athiya drive my guest this week is Professor Tom Seyfried who many of you will know but I suspect an equal number of you will not know tom has come to us through many channels meaning the requests to speak with Tom have come on many levels there's been a lot of requests through social media through the site and of course based on our discussions with dom

[00:01:08] D'Agostino tom has been friend of mine for quite a while this is my first time meeting Tom but I feel sort of like I know him because I've read so much of his work and Bob Kaplan who of course you all know as my trusty right-hand guy who lives in Boston actually takes a course from Tom and he's taken a course in the past and continues to just wander around Tom's office and just hang out with him overall so in some ways this felt kind of familiar though it was my first time meeting Tom Tom's background is that he's got a PhD in genetics and biochemistry from the University of

[00:01:42] Illinois got that in the mid 70s and a bunch of other distinctions that I'm not gonna go into because we're gonna link to all that stuff he did his postdoc in the Department of Neurology at Yale and it was there that he first became interested in ketones because of their application in the amelioration of recalcitrant seizures as we get into in the disc in the episode that led to his interest in cancer which is now his focus Tom has published over 150 peer-reviewed publications he's the author of numerous books textbooks etc including kind of treatise on this so his magnum opus is effectively a book called cancer as a metabolic disease I probably got my first copy of this a few years ago and in many ways that's what sort of felt quite familiar in speaking with him he's currently a professor at Boston College and his research today focuses on the mechanisms by which metabolic therapies can manage chronic diseases such as epilepsy neurodegenerative lipid storage diseases and above all cancer in this episode we talk about Tom's background as I sort of alluded to his work in epilepsy and how that led him to the interest in caloric restriction and ketosis we revisit the man the legend

[00:02:55] Otto Warburg and talk about the Warburg effect and Warburg's point of view on these things and I I do push him a little bit on this because I want to point out that it's not entirely clear amongst people what the Warburg effect really implies and how ubiquitous it is and I have to be honest with you I don't necessarily share Tom's views on a number of these things so I wanted to do my best to sort of represent as many other views as possible but at the same time I hope the discussion is helpful we get into a bunch of the semantics I knew this was a very technical topic and I know that not everybody has the luxury of listening to this while they're reviewing the show notes so we do go over the difference between respiration or oxidative phosphorylation and fermentation it's very important to understand this so one thing to keep in mind with this podcast and frankly any of the more technical episodes we do if you're struggling with a concept hit pause I don't think it's worth sort of going through these not understanding them I think it's cool to listen to this hit pause go back hit Wikipedia ping us with a question on social media or whatever if there's a concept that's dumping you but this is obviously going to be one of the more important concepts if you can't understand the difference between respiration oxidative phosphorylation as it were and fermentation that a lot of this won't make sense we also get into this idea of substrate level phosphorylation a very important concept and the fermentation of glucose we also talked a lot about glutamine this is something that I haven't spent a lot of time talking about in the past I think I do touch on it a little bit with Dom D'Agostino but we get into it in much greater fashion and we of course get into Ultima we the fundamental question that I think people who are interested in metabolic therapies for questions have to be able to answer which is is cancer primarily a metabolic disease meaning a disease whose origin arrives in the mitochondria or in the metabolic machinery of the cell or is it primarily a genetic disease where sometimes you will and sometimes you won't sustain mitochondrial damage now I have to you know and you'll see this in the interview it's not entirely clear to me that I buy the argument that cancer is entirely a metabolic disease though as some of you will know I am very bullish on the use of metabolic therapies in cancer but I'm also very bullish on the use of immunotherapy in cancer and when appropriate chemotherapy in cancer so you know my view is that cancer is about as hard disease as there is ever going to be to target and therefore we ought to turn our attention to as many legs of the stool as possible and not just one

[00:05:23] I think the discussion gets a little bit heated at one point when I take issue with something Tom said about suggesting that biopsies could exacerbate cancer I I really don't want anybody to come out of this believing that having a biopsy is going to increase their risk of metastatic cancer I think that anyone's entitled to a hypothesis but to my knowledge there are absolutely no evidence to support that claim we talk a lot about a particular type of cancer called glioblastoma multiforme a GBM also known as a grade four astrocytoma this is of course a cancer that if you haven't heard of it you've certainly heard of its effect john mccain who recently passed away suffered from this

[00:06:06] I lost a friend to this when I was younger and I think that if you know somebody who has died of brain cancer the chances are there's that there's a pretty good chance this is the cancer they had this is one of those cancers that gives cancer a bad name and in all fairness I don't think there's ever been a true document and survivor of this cancer it also may provide one of the more interesting model systems to study metabolic therapies for cancer I guess the most important thing we close with is I sort of pushed home a little bit on what experiment he would want to see or do to advance the thinking in this field in many ways Tom's a little bit of a guy that's on the sidelines of you know sort of mainstream cancer these views these metabolic fuels unfortunately unfortunately in my view don't get the attention they deserve and other people that I'm going to be talking with in the future such as Sid Mukherjee and Lou

[00:06:57] Cantley are going to be some I think some of the people who are now starting to see through their own research some of the potential applications for these things and so I think that in many ways the problems that Tom has been working on for the last 30 or 40 years are very slowly beginning to gain acceptance and

[00:07:16] I don't like to use the word mainstream but in I think you know what I mean in the more mainstream circles of oncology this interview does get technical at times and so as is the case with virtually all of our interviews please pay attention to the show notes if you're having difficulty if for no other reason than the fact that a heck of a lot of work goes into preparing them on the part of our analytical team if you like this podcast I would ask a few very kindly to go and leave a review at iTunes and I suppose if you don't like this podcast you can also do that lastly if you are interested in receiving a weekly email which comes out every

[00:07:52] Sunday morning from me that usually talks about something I've done that week something I've learned that week something that is hopefully of interest to you by all means sign up for that at Peter attea MD com and I think that's pretty much all I want to say as we go into this so with that said please give it up for my guest today dr. Tom c3 hey

[00:08:16] Tom how are you well thank you very much well thank you so much for making time I know you've got a long lineup of students outside your office here who are kind of pissed at me for sitting here taking up time when you could be answering their questions so they'll recover you know a lot of people have been sort of reaching out to me on social media and saying you know you've got to have Tom on you've got to have

[00:08:36] Tom on you know the podcast with Don was excellent but there's so much more we want to understand about cancer and you know certainly cancer something near and dear to my heart I did my fellowship in oncology and but at the same time I think I understand cancer far less than I understand things that I didn't formally trained and like I think I have a better understand for example of heart disease than I do of cancer so I'm really excited to explore a lot of topics today and acknowledge that we probably won't even scratch the surface of all that you think about but all that said how did you get interested in this we started it when I was at Yale University Department of Neurology where we have been working on epilepsy and lipid storage diseases and ganglia sites basically is it complex lipid molecules and one of the individuals that I was working with that time Robert you he's my was my mentor at the time he had done some research on ganglia side changes in tumors and you know we had been looking at that and I said you know there was some interesting molecules in those tumor cells so I also knew Dennis Spencer who was the chief in the neurosurgery at the time at Yale and he said why don't you come up to the operating room with me and I'll get you a nice piece of glioblastoma from a patient you know you know I'm a basic scientist I'm not a clinician I don't know what's going on so I said sure he come into the operating room and was kind of an experience that I'll never forget having someone take a a tumor out of someone's head and they were asking me all kinds of questions like you know do you think we should do rate put pellets of radiation in the cavity and you know all this kind of stuff and so I didn't know what I said I'm here to look at the ganglia sight pattern in the tumor heads read the cancer or anything like this but any event we had then started making our own brain tumors in the mouse based on the work of Harry

[00:10:22] Zimmerman who started the first school of neuropathology in the United States at Yale University in the back in the 1930s and he was still alive at the time he lived to be 98 years old or something so I I was interested in doing comparative studies of glycolipids in human and mouse brain tumors to see whether or not we can come to some common changes and that's how we got started pretty much looking at comparative biochemical profiles between human tumors and mouse tumors and there was some similarities but there were many differences as well but we didn't get into the kind of therapeutic evaluation of these tumors and so we all said a huge program in epilepsy mapping genes for epilepsy we did a lot of things that yeah he's working on the glycolipids of the tumors glycolipids a developing brain lipid storage diseases and epilepsy and

[00:11:15] I wrote a grant it for internally at Yale which was rejected asking about ketogenic diets and what year was this is back in the slate 70s early 80s maybe 1980 and they said oh nobody's interested in ketogenic diets it's kind of passe this was before the work at Hopkins or yeah Hopkins John Freeman was a friend of mine too who was the

[00:11:39] Godfather of ketogenic diets he was the one that saved Jim Abraham's son Charlie mm-hmm and Jim was a movie director and his friend meryl streep made the movie first do no harm which was based on in part on Jim's experience with his son but I wasn't connected at that time to Abrams or any of that stuff that was even before the Charlie foundation I just had this inkling that maybe ketogenic diet would be interesting to test against some of the epilepsy models that I was working with but does that mean you suspected that something to do with glucose metabolism no nothing I just thought it was an interesting approach to a non drug approach for for seizures and anyway the grant was summarily rejected so I said well nobody's interested in this so I left

[00:12:26] Yale and I came up to Boston College here start a program and then we were here from then it was twenty ten years fifteen years later we developed some of the best animal models for epilepsy and we were looking at brains of biochemistry and epileptic seizures and the genes that caused epilepsy and then one of my PhD students Marianna Tran says oh they're having a big meeting out in Washington on ketogenic diets for epilepsy and maybe our model would be appropriate for this I said now this is you know I said after my experience at

[00:12:57] Yale I said nobody's interested in this crap you're still traumatized you know I got a sore marrow Lee reject and says this is nobody interested in nuclear Janet diets so anyway I she said holy man like that so I said I had a few extra bucks in the grant so I said okay go on out in fact she she wrote a little blurb and they funded her to go out there so she comes back and starts telling me about

[00:13:20] Wow you can't believe what I saw out there all these guys are interested in this ketogenic diet and and this guy Jim Abrams and he stalking us to start this foundation called the Charly foundation and it was like to study epilepsy and ketogenic diets and stuff so I said all right what the hell so we started to put them on the mice and it was funny because we didn't know what we were doing but then at the same time it was two things came together at the same time we were studying gangly slides for lipid storage diseases if there was a drug company over in England that gave us this new drug that was supposed to stop gangly aside synthesis and therefore reduced the storage in the in the brain of course at at that time at

[00:14:00] Boston College animal they didn't charge me for animals which they do now which is a tragedy because you can really do a lot of work the damn mice cost so much money and there were so fewer restrictions I mean we'd followed all of the animal care protocols but we we had access to a large number so we could do experiments that you couldn't do anywhere else so when we got the drug from the company we were feeding the drug to them to the mice and we looked at the ganglia so yeah it's really down but so was the body weight and then when we put the control group in we found out that the yeah the tumors shrunk and the ganglia sides were reduced from this drug but then the body weight was also reduced and these the controls were also there both animals being fed ad lib ad libitum one had the drug one didn't okay so the drugs somehow either reduced intake or increased expended we don't know but it's the body weights were reduced by about 15 or 20 percent so and the tumors were significantly reduced by about 50 60 percent so I told the company that you know I just threw them on I just did a pilot study I told the company that your drug seems to really shrink brain tumors they go why this is this is a much bigger market than say tay-sachs disease right so that's when they gave me $200,000 to investigate the mechanism by which their drug was stopping brain cancer because I showed them the data and they what they were all excited so we then began to investigate this in Pernambuco Jima dr. mukajee who worked started with me I said hey partner by me I hired her specifically to start looking at this and then when we realized that um you know what's what's working she said you know a lot of times these drugs work through calorie restriction so I said well why don't we put a control group we all decided let's put a control group for body weights and then we just won one was the guys with the drug and losing weight the other guys would just take the food away from them so the body weights would be absolutely identical so they were pair fat pad wasn't pair fat one one group was eating ad libitum and they were losing body weight and the other group oh I see you took a guess we had to restrict the calories to match to match the body weight were their pair we did yesterday waited yes

[00:16:03] Ida waited and then we evaluated this and the tumors were exactly the same size so it had nothing to do with the drug even though the drug was working on the target and molecule it wasn't the targeted molecule that was was responsible for this so that's when we also decided with the epilepsy overlapping does the categorize the ketogenic diet work through calorie restriction because many of these children that get ketogenic diets they have a very restricted calories and you have to you have to give very small you can't let kids eat massive amounts of fat because invariably John Freeman told me it doesn't think the diet doesn't work if they just fight one out of two or three hundred kids just loves to eat all this fat and they then the seizures don't go away so we in other words the the thinking at the time was there is some amount of caloric restriction that is necessary within the context of the ketosis to also affect the epileptic seizures yes absolutely but you have to be very careful because many of these children are on the growth spurt so you have to be careful on how much restriction you give and the other thing of course it's self restricted there's several physiological systems in our body that when you eat a lot of fat you just don't need a lot of calories yeah it's a turn-off it works through the vagus nerve the hormone cholecystokinin is kind of an appetite suppressor it affects the vagus nerve which then stops the appetite you don't eat as much so I have so many stories so

[00:17:24] I was sitting on a bus one day you're on the right podcast on time restriction yeah I listen so they made this thing called the vagal nerve stimulator and it was made by a company I can't remember the name of it made fortune they would implant the stimulator into the person's who has epilepsy and it would send out things to stimulate the vagus nerve and

[00:17:46] I was sitting on the bus with this guy from Norway and he says I said you putting this in the patient yeah we sort of putting this in the patient how does it work yeah it seems to work really good I said how much is it he says well it's the operation is like four thousand dollars but the device it was like fifteen or sixteen thousand dollars but there was putting them in all these epileptic patients and their work I saw does it work he's I don't know but it works so I said I didn't know I'm sitting on the bus I don't know we're going to MGM studios down in Florida they closed the whole place down in the middle of the week in December so that they they could attract all the all the epileptologist to use their device to put into these patients you know is one of these kind of things so anyway comes back when we were working on ketogenic diets and calorie restriction you know we realized that humans have this internal system to stop calories and if you don't stop the calories and variably you don't get the management of the seizures so we in our in our parallel studies in epilepsy with mice and cancer and all this other stuff you know we started to learn what's going what's working in the patients how do we translate what's working in the patients into the mice the mice can be another source of information that we can feed back and we published this big paper on calorie restriction and key to it was well that the ketogenic diet was working largely through calorie restriction and maintaining low blood sugar levels was the key to maintaining control of seizures now if you had a I don't if you did this experiment but if you took animals on an equally low caloric diet that was not ketogenic so let's just say a very high carbohydrate low fat diet where presumably glucose levels would be higher even though they would still be calorically restricted would you get the same anti-seizure benefit the same results exactly so because what was happening is that when the body is restricted of calories you then make ketones so the level of ketosis was also seen in the cow it was be like a human doing what are only fasting so how calorically restricted did they need to be if they were not on a ketogenic 40 percent thirty to five to forty percent restriction and then we did some studies another group we found out that 35 to 40 percent restriction of calories in the mouse equates to a water only therapeutic fasting in humans and that's because the their metabolism is right is seven or eight times higher than that of so humans can achieve much higher ketosis than a mouse can and the mouse so one week one day water-only fast and a mouse is like a seven-day water only fast in a human and the blood sugars go down the ketones go on IR bees don't allow you to fast mice that long anymore do that oh yeah I'm as long as they as long as they're healthy you know calorie restriction is generally a healthy thing if you you don't want to over restrict because then you put into a nutritional imbalance and you don't want to go to the level of what we call starvation this is another calorie restriction is healthy up to the point where you start breaking down muscle if you start breaking down muscle then you enter into a new physiological state called starvation and that's a that's very pathological you don't ever want to go to that digression so some people that like they get so carried away with with water only fasting they can enter into starvation mode I know this for a fact because I used to spend a lot of time with George Cahill we used to run the Joslin Diabetes centers down here in Boston and he and I would talk for hours and hours with Bud Veatch at the NIH about how long people can go with this transition over from therapeutic fasting into starvation and also the body bills it's like anything your body gets accustomed you can go a long time without eating if you're if you're in shape you know if you've done this but you know it depends on what your body weight is what your how old you are it depends on a lot of different things how long you can go without eating but you know the bottom line is that you won't we were trying to develop a therapy and figure out the mechanisms by which ketogenic diets were therapeutic now going back to the Cahill stuff for a moment before we come back to that did you have a sensor to George have a sense of when those patients are in a negative nitrogen balance and I assume it matters as to what their starting weight is and muscle mass and things like that but there were there general rules about once you cross over that point where you're basically you know pulling nitrogen out of the muscle right right and he got that those data actually from the 10 guys that starved to death and Mays Mays prison inning in

[00:22:02] Northern Ireland Bobby Sands in that group actually he was there monitoring their blood work well it was dying of starvation these were prisoners that they were fasting as a protest yeah correct yeah them they made a movie out of it every mother's son about that there was ten Irishmen that were how long did they live on average they averaged I think he had the data he was never able to publish it the British government was on top of him about that but he was able to collect the data and shared some of that stuff and it was very interested - horrible thing it's like one of the worst ways to dies is starvation so what happens your diaphragm is the last muscle that will be digested and there's a there's a momentum that starts now you have to realize that these guys that did this so they don't die of just acidosis there's the it's actually the diagram they're drowned in your own body fluids basically jeez it's brutal so because what happens is once your diaphragm can't work your lungs fill up with with fluids and you drowned in your own fluids and the diaphragm presumably stops working because of either the loss of muscle or the electrolyte imbalance yeah both the combination of both so and then there's a moment you can't stop it once once the momentum it's like these horrible hiccups right yeah yeah well it's it's um once the momentum starts it seems like they try to do an intervention on a couple of the guys and they weren't able to to reverse it so it was pretty horrific now those guys were all young Irishman you know in their 20s and 30s

[00:23:31] I don't know what the oldest guy was but but they lived from I don't know 68 to 85 90 days without any food just water but then he subsequently fasted these very obese people for 40 days longer for six months eight months oh wow yeah he has the data one guy who post men lost his job weight 450 pounds or something couldn't deliver the mail so they put him on the water only fasting for six months I think six or eight months guy lost 250 pounds this is different from the guy who there was a there was a single case report of a patient who weighed a little over 400 pounds and did a 382 day fast yeah but I didn't realize that was cahill that was over I don't know that was Cahill there was another couple of them okay but he was overseeing he showed us the data on this one guy the postman and you know and the issue of course is I don't know if he took many supplements because body-fat holds a lot of vitamins fat soluble vitamins the minerals come from your bones the liver control holds an awful lot of B vitamins and things like this I think there was supplemented a weren't you don't you need a lot of supplements your body holds over we evolved as a species to starve I mean our existence today is dependent on our ability to go long periods of time without eating that anymore but but yeah yeah and it seems that our ability to access minerals and vitamins is highly dependent on our nutritional state in other words your need for those things tends to go up in a fed state yeah at least according to some research I've seen yeah you're right and our ancestors were hardened people you know their bodies were already acclimated to a starvation mode so they were very efficient in maintaining mineral and nutrient balances I think in our society today and this is purely speculation I think a lot of the foods are depleted in the kinds of nutrients that we would need there forward some people are almost like in a starvation mode but they're eating food that has no nutritional value and consequently you you store a lot of fat because the body doesn't usually get rid of sugar you know as I said sugar is stored it's not you know pee out sugar unless you have type 1 diabetes or something the body has all these filtration systems to keep carbs in which is then transferred to fat and stored as fat that's our energy to keep us alive when there's no food but all these ideas and things were developing when we were doing the

[00:26:01] Epilepsy studies then it became clear that calorie restriction was a key form a key mechanism by which the ketogenic diet was working and we have since then seen and numerous children with epilepsy that breakthrough seizures will occur when blood sugar spikes define spike in that very specific case how high does it need to be in milligrams per deciliter

[00:26:23] Pepsi there's many cases where it just has to go a little bit above the baseline so kids will have a very low 70 68 65 milligrams per dekaliter they'll grab a cupcake at a party or whatever and spikes up to 120 or whatever and then you'll get a breakthrough seizure and do you believe that it is is the absolute value of 120 in that case or do you believe it's the D by DT like the meaning the rate of change you have we can't know that it hasn't been done effectively all we know is from the clinicians and the nurses that have told me all this information and of course when your child has a breakthrough seizure nobody likes to see a kid seizing I mean it's very it's traumatic you know it's it's not that's not a pleasant thing so once they realize that the kids have to maintain this very stable the parents are very very restrictive of these kids so because they don't want to see their child seized so they're very restrictive so when we do the same thing for cancer about the problem with cancer is you don't see a breakthrough seizure you don't see a group of tumor cells starting to grow faster you don't see the immediate effects but they're there but you just can't see them with epilepsy you have a very visible clear indication that something went wrong and and unvarying as a spike in glucose now what's very interesting is in these kids they could be maintained for months without a single seizure and then one drink of a grape juice or whatever the hell boom breakthrough seizure within sometimes minutes from the time you took the so it's a very they can flip back but then they can also get back on track again they don't have a large number of seizures they can just they can get back on track but it's very very sensitive system in our brains then as John Tommy John Freeman he says we don't understand that if a kid is maintained seizure free or minimal seizures for long periods of time on ketogenic diets and then we removed the diet they they seem to be managed in other words they don't return to their multiple seizures that they would have had every day so he doesn't know if it was because the diet did something fundamental or they outgrew the seizure or it was again these are areas in epilepsy that are under active investigation by a lot but it's interesting it's almost like a reset right I mean one of the things that impressed me about reading the case studies of these very very long fasts is that in the reports that are published several years later many of the subjects maintain their new weight reduced state yeah which is a bit counterintuitive based on what we know today about you know traditional dieting approach is where everybody's sort of you know will return back to baseline and so it begs a question right when you starve this person for six months do they completely change the way they eat on the other side but because of a behavioral shift or is it a physiologic shift meaning their metabolisms been kind of quote/unquote fixed yeah well I think it's probably a combination of both I mean again these are very complicated physiological processes you know they call it the thrifty gene that was a term it's not one gene it's like the thrifty physiology if you do yo-yo dieting give me you can be screwed up for a long period of time those things all have loose ends there's nothing that we have found that it's absolutely consistent in all patients all the time when it comes to those kinds of things and that's why they're always interesting to talk about because someone always has some new people new idea about something that they've seen kind of fits in a little bit with what everybody else is

[00:29:49] I don't really dwell engage in those kinds of things as far as our research is concerned you know we know about them we talk about them but we don't other than the calorie restriction that we introduced into the mice and then when we found out that the calorie restriction and the ketogenic diets were working so people say well why don't you just do calorie restriction because you know cancer it back to cancer we don't like to restrict the term restriction I even the term let's read already got a disease now you have to be restricted you know it's like so ketogenic diets are a little takes this thing out of a therapeutic fast and they can also replicate some of the same physiological changes the key is to lower the blood sugar and elevate the ketones and that's what ketogenic diets do for managing epilepsy and they do the same thing for cancer the issue of course is we don't know the mechanism by which lowering glucose and elevating ketones is responsible for the management of the seizure this is under an active investigation by a lot of labs that actual mechanism is that the elevation of the ketones is the reduction of the glucose or is it some combination of the two but for cancer it becomes very clear the mechanism of action is very clear for how this kills cancer cells it's based on Otto Warburg theory so when we started to do this and realize that calorie restriction was shrinking these tumors down massively you know based on the drug that I told you about because it was working through calorie restriction then I said you know how is calorie restriction stopping tumors and then we realized that it was lowering blood sugar so we started measuring blood sugar in these calorie restricted mice and measuring ketones and we were seeing that we were getting these major shifts and then we said you know then it became clear who was the guy who did this or thought about it was Warburg now he wasn't doing ketogenic diets had he done and known about that I think he would have been able to crack this cancer thing far far earlier than it he didn't do keto Jenny thing about that so let's back up for a moment for people I mean I think most people listening probably know what the Warburg effect is and and and who Warburg was but maybe just give us a moment of setting the stage for what he what his observation was that now bears his name well his interest was in biochemistry he was a classical chemist biochemist and his in his time and he began to look at the metabolism of tumors so he made an observation which was solidified that cancer cells continued to do a ancient fermentation metabolism even in the presence of oxygen so this the posture effect from Louis Pasteur with the yeast was that you know yeast will ferment they evolved that organism evolved to be able to ferment get energy in the absence of oxygen but when as soon as oxygen came into the the presence they stopped fermenting and they immediately started respiring they have a system that can do that so the Pasteur effect was basically the termination of fermentation and the presence of oxygen that was the pasture effect and and it was repeated in all these yeast strains of this kind of thing and that was a fundamental biochemical advancement so to say but Warburg recognized he knew

[00:32:57] Posterous worked very very well and then he said geez these cancer cells man they they continue to throw out lactic acid even in the presence of a hundred percent oxygen so he grew cancer cells in 100% oxygen and they would still making lactic acid so clearly the pact the Pasteur effect wasn't working I'll just interject for a moment to explain something to the listener and we'll probably have a picture of this but of course you take glucose too pyruvate in the cytoplasm right and that's a you know that yields a couple of units of ATP and then you have sort of a choice of what you're going to do with that pyruvate if your demand for

[00:33:30] ATP is incredibly quick usually exceeding the capacity of oxygen to get into the cell you'll make lactate and that's also relatively inefficient meaning you don't get that much more ATP I think you get another two molecules of ATP per unit of pyruvate but at least you have the advantage of saying I'm not limited by oxygen alternatively if you if oxygen is plentiful and more importantly if the demand for ATP is not excessive you can shuttle that pyruvate into acetyl co a in the mitochondria and you can generate over 30 units of ATP right and so what you're saying is there was an observation which said hey if I put this cell in the presence of lots of oxygen it really shouldn't make much lactate right and that's what he finds when you take normal tissue like kidney slices or muscle slices or or liver you'd grow them and 100% oxygen and they produce minimal - barely detectable lactate there's always some going to be produced in every tissue but basically it's a very minimal very minimal but the cancer cell continues to dump out massive amounts of lactic acid even in the presence of 100% oxygen so this was a phenomena he saw this over and over again it didn't make any difference whether it was a human tumor or a mouse to him a rat tumor they were all doing this same kind of thing so what he concluded from this was that their respiratory system was defective because like you just said if pi root now that's the M then Meyerhoff pathway going from from glucose to pyruvate pyruvate is the end of the meijer is the end of that so then the opportunity is that the primate would enter into the mitochondria oxygenating conditions and be fully oxidized to water and co2 and oxygen is the acceptor of the electrons to form the water and the carbons are coming from the foods that we metabolized but the cancer cell was dumping out large amounts of this lactic acid so why would a cancer cell dump out lactic acid and it became clear to

[00:35:32] Warburg through a variety of experiments that the respiratory system was defective in these cells let's just clarify that many people when they hear that Willis we think respiratory system we think of lungs what you really mean is the mitochondrial right right machinery that undergoes what we call cellular respiration the lungs are bringing in the oxygen and getting rid of the co2 the right enables and enables all the cell's and a majority of ourselves in the body to perform this very efficient form of energy production which then frees up the cells to do their sophisticated behaviors liver cells do what they do kidney cells brain cells they all do what they do because they have this very efficient energetic system that's the working called respiration the lungs are just the facilitators of the body to get the get the good air in and the bad air out and so basically the cancer cell was continuing to produce massive amounts of lactic acid despite the fact that there was all this so he was then looking at the mitochondria knowing it noticing that there were some defects and these kinds of things but he wasn't at the level of electron microscopy or this he just made the what year this is in the 1920s mostly late 20s 30s 40s all the way up to the 50 I think he stopped his research maybe in the early 60s now he won a Nobel Prize didn't he yeah he was at for the description of this phenomenon no it was forced to discovery of cytochrome C oxidase which is actually one of the key enzymes in the electron transport chain how cells generate energy through respiration so he he was nominated other times and there's still some controversy about how many times he had been nominated for the work on cancer but never to achieve another Nobel Prize but he was considered one of the dominant biochemists in the 20th century and he had very strong ideas and very excellent quantitative measurements for this a lot of his work was reproduced by dozens and dozens of scientists so that was the fundamental observation but he then extended this to the theory that why are this the cells are producing all this lactic acid because the organelle that is is supposed to be involved is defective this led to a lot of controversy what do you mean defect how defective what do you mean so much later

[00:37:46] Pete Peterson from Hopkins had done a magnificent job in collating all this information and he found that in every kind of a cancer cell no matter what kind of it is there was some defect in the number structure or function of the mitochondria and it could vary so some cancer cells have very few mitochondria but they look normal very few of them other tumor cells clearly have a lot of mitochondria but they look abnormal so whatever it was it was something to do with an impairment of the respiratory system within the cell and if the cell can't generate energy through normal respiration then it has to ferment there's no other way they can get the energy so it became that the Warburg effect which everybody talks about is one of the biggest problems in this whole thing because Warburg and his paper clearly said that aerobic glycolysis or what they call the Warburg effect is a secondary problem that's subjected to many many variances in the environment but everybody focuses on this is it the real issue is the damage to their respiration and everybody says no respiration is normal and cancer cells and why would they say it's normal because they started doing cells in culture rather than looking at the tissues themselves and once you start doing culture work that you're taking cells from a tissue and separating them and growing them as if they were microorganisms in a culture dish well this changes everything they're no longer connected to each other they're growing in some artificial fluid and they're doing things that they sometimes do and sometimes not do in the real world so you make a lot of assumptions about things based on a system that itself is artefactual so let me ask a couple of technical questions obviously measuring the amount of lactate or hydrogen ion that's produced is a way to give us an indication of how much anaerobic metabolism is taking place what if you're if you're not in cell culture how do you quantify the amount of aerobic respiration you look at the amount of oxygen consumed and the amount of lactic acid produced so if you're doing aerobic respiration you're consuming a lot of lactic acid a lot of oxygen and producing very little lactate and then you can quantitate the amount of ATP being produced per millimeter mili liter of oxygen that you consume and according to this this can vary from anywhere from 7-7 ATP units denying depending on the system but it's you know Warburg used to work the number seven based on his dad at that time so you could calculate the total amount of

[00:40:11] ATP being produced in the cell based on its oxygen consumption and select the gassed at production and Warburg did he ever do this insight you yes he did it in sluttin slices and then he did it in cell culture as well so he created some of his own his own problems as well switching from one to the other the concern that I that we have now is that many kept many cells in culture look like they're consuming a lot of oxygen so and they're making lactic acid but they're consuming a lot of oxygen so thank you suggesting that they're doing both which is still a bit odd yeah right well that was Sidney Winehouse's argument his argument was the cancer cell needs so much energy that respiration by itself can't be sufficient so they have to ferment and respire at the same time and that made everybody feel that yeah Warburg was wrong they do have good respiration but they just need so much more energy they need to ferment at the same time but the work from Pete Peterson showed that they have defective respiration so I mean they have defective mitochondria structure number and function besides many other studies have shown so you know that they can't be doing oxidative phosphorylation or respiration because they're very organelle that is needed for that is deficient in some way and that could be many different ways as I said there's no one all cancer cells all cancer cells have a defect in respiration how that defect came about can vary from one from one type of cancer to another so one has to recognize that so not every cancer cell will have the exact same defect in respiration in the mitochondria some will have very few mitochondria okay so they just don't have quantitatively enough organelles to do respect respiration but what seems to be there seems to be functional - partially functional other cells as I said are loaded with mitochondria but when you look at them they're morphologically abnormal so structure dictates function in biology we know that structure dictates function so if the structure of the organelle is abnormal you know that the function of that organelle is not going to be normal and is the idea that those those mutations were acquired I wouldn't call them mutations they would call them defects now you can't have other words the genome is unaffected in some of those cases yes we've done we've done that we sequenced the entire genome of five different independently derived cancers from mouse alder all derived from different origins and we didn't find a single genetic abnormality pather what we call pathogenic where were yet where the mutation would actually have an effect on a function and we didn't find a single one so that that's all let's think maybe take a step back and for the listener again we'll go over some is the basics of genetics because I think that for many people there's an understanding that I mean by definition a cancer has a mutation that renders it incapable of listening to normal cell signaling do you have a sense broadly of what amount of human cancers arise from germline mutations rather than somatic mutations it's obviously very small but I don't know what the number is well they say it's about five to six percent oh is that high okay you know and you hear about them the Braca one yeah records who really from any p53 you know Lynch syndrome it's yeah yeah but when we looked into those so-called inherited risk we call them inherited risk factors none of them have ever been 100 percent penetrant which means that every person having that gene must exhaust purely deterministic yeah they're not deterministic and as Warburg said there are many secondary causes of cancer but there's only one primary cause the primary causes the damage to the respiratory system so if the inherited mutation damages the respiratory system of the cell the probability of cancer is is a real possibility so because everybody who has li-fraumeni tumors or

[00:43:46] Braca one tumors or whatever they all have they're all fermenters so the fermentation metabolism is there in every cancer but there are some people that have the exact same mutation that the other person has but they never get the can't they never develop a tumor because for whatever reason in that person that mutation did not damage the respiration now it could be an environmental suppressive effect or another gene in the genome that prevents the inherited mutation from damaging the respiration we don't know that so we only know that you don't get cancer if your mitochondria remain healthy that's what we know so that's an important because that goes back to the prevention issue you know how do you prevent cancer you prevent cancer by keeping your mitochondria healthy how do you do that well you avoid if you can avoid those risk factors mostly from the environment like viral infections intermittent hypoxia radiation exposure carcinogenic exposure all these different things every one of those things can damage respiration in a population of cells then leading to cancer because we know of no cancer that has normal respiration but when you grow them in culture people say yeah they have normal respiration they've taken in oxygen so therefore our

[00:44:52] Warburg is wrong but when you look at the structure in the vivo and you look at the tissues and you look at the actual architecture of the tissue and variable you're find damage to the respiration damage to the structure and function of mitochondria so what the field has done is put more credibility into the results from cell culture work than into the actual tissues that people see and look under the microscope and look at because the Warburg effect was largely forgotten for many years after his initial observation right yeah a lot of what he did was forgotten and Pete

[00:45:19] Peterson was one of the few guys that kept the fire burning because a lot of it because I as I said when Watson and Crick discovered the DNA as the origin of the genetic material but it wasn't only them there was a whole group of other people that were doing it they just weren't acknowledged as much yeah and then the field ran off into that and be and they also knew that there were chromosomal abnormalities in some cancer so it made clear that hey you know these genomic defects and the tumor cells are likely the real the real origin of the disease so the whole feel more or less shifted away from the traditional biochemical analysis to that more molecular biology analysis and therefore you find more and more mutations more and more genetic defects and all these kinds of things leading people to believe that these were the causes of the disease and you know a lot of really nice experiments were done where they would introduce you know mutant virus particles into cells and they would integrate into the nuclear genome and then you'd see the cancer cells cells lose become transformed into a neoplastic kind of a cell making giving of the appearance that this was a cause effect that if I they didn't realize that those same viruses went into the mitochondria and blew out the respiration so that wasn't even considered as possible if the viruses are doing that presumably they're integrating into the genome yeah well they would do it both ways they can do it a lot of different ways so sometimes the viruses actually infect directly into the mitochondria they produce proteins in the mitochondria that screw up the electron transport chain other times the virus is integrated into the nuclear genome producing a protein product that then then disrupts them the mitochondria either way the mitochondria are disrupted whether it if it's a direct effect of the virus replicating inside the organelle or it's an effect of a product produced by the virus so that then goes and disrupts the organelle and this is what we're finding for for the majority of these situations so even the Heritage mutations that we look at they disrupt mitochondrial function and if they disrupt mitochondrial function you are at risk for developing a neoplasm in that particular population themselves there are some cancers that don't follow that correct I mean aren't there some cancers that have normal mitochondria we haven't found any because the evidence for that is that they're all fermenting we haven't found the cancer that doesn't ferment so if the cancer is fermenting it's obviously not respiring if it's respiration would be normal it shouldn't be fermenting as a matter of fact Dean

[00:47:41] Burke did this kind of a study way back in the 50s he went looked at have various kinds of hepa thomas because they were there was an article that was published to say that there was this very low slow growing hepatoma that did not ferment so which was directly related to your question but Burke who was at the head of the NCI at the time studied these things in massive detail and was able to show that the slowest growing tumor did have a significant elevation of lactic acid production over a normal cell but you had to look at it really carefully and do the experiments over extended periods of time so even the slowest of the slowest growing tumors guys that would be maybe considered benign we're still making lactic acid another another another interesting thing was the crown gall tumors in plants this is another interesting plants have cancer but they don't metastasize they just grow these tumors and people back in the 30s with testing Warburg's theory in these plants and they're all had damage respiration we're fermenting just like that just like the mouse tumors when you say respiration you mean photosynthetic respiration oh no plants have both plants can get energy from chloroplasts to build carbohydrates but they also have they also have my token

[00:48:52] I didn't realize that so their carbon fixation obviously comes from photosynthesis yeah yeah but when they make you know there's their equivalent of starch yes so they will burn their owns their own fuels to generate respiratory energy but they also have dysmorphic cell growth and they've called the ground crown gall tumors you see them sometimes on the side of trees and things so people back in the day analyzed the biochemistry of these things and they also found that they were following Warburg's metabolic profile but they didn't metastasize and the reason they don't metastasize is they don't have an immune system so and it turns out that from our work and the work of others that the metastatic cell is actually part of our immune system so macrophages and leukocytes these are the cells that have the genetic capability of moving around the body entering ads at tissues this is what they do plants don't have that plants don't have that kind of an immune system so they don't metastasize they grow in place but humans and other animals of course that have these cells of the immune system therefore they can get metastatic cancer so before we get to that because I do have a number of questions about that topic another argument that's been proposed for the

[00:50:01] Warburg effect is the need for cellular building blocks the other thing that the tumor is doing above and beyond it's non tumorous cell mate is growing and although not necessarily faster than a regular cell it certainly grows in a less regulated way and therefore it's going to proliferate so Vanderheiden and

[00:50:21] I think Luke Antley and Craig Thompson wrote that paper in 2009 that as I'm sure you're familiar with there was a science paper I believe and they proposed this other explanation which was look it's and it's it's not it's not just an energetic thing in fact I don't recall if they said it's not just or it's not even about the energetics but the point here was this is where you get building blocks to make cells grow do you think it's possible that both of these are correct yeah well you know you in the process of up regulating the ended Meyerhoff pathway you are gonna get the carbon step for building blocks at the same time you're going to get some energy now through the pyruvate kinase system however it is very interesting now this is but there they deviate from the pay from Warburg's theory and saying that respiration is normal okay they think there's nothing wrong with the mitochondria okay they've said that many times Craig Thompson has said this I can't you have to ignore a massive amount of evidence to make those kinds of statements you just have to ignore everything that Pete Peterson has done which is a which is a life's work shelfing that the mitochondria knows yeah but he doesn't mention that and they don't discuss pete peterson's massive amount of evidence but you're right it's in order for a cell to grow you need a lot of building blocks and you need Carmen where's the carbon coming from this and it's coming from both the pentose pathway and the glycolytic pathway and it's also coming from glutamate so these cancer cells is sucking down glutamine so you're getting the amide nitrogen to form the nucleotides you're getting the glutamate that then goes into an applause s and the TCA cycle so between glucose and glutamine you aren't getting all of the building blocks that you need for rapid cell division but where is the energy coming from okay without energy nothing grows nothing can live without ATP so where is the energy coming from and this is our thing so we myself and Christo should not listen and hungry I proposed this a long time ago on a purely theoretical basis having been convinced that Warburg was right that the respiration of QL cancer cells is damaged to some extent so we're if that's the case the Warburg effect was only the glucose part of the puzzle it wasn't the glutamine part of the puzzle so now with our new information we know that most of the ATP and the cancer is coming from substrate level phosphorylation in the mitochondria which is disconnected from oxidative phosphorylation so what we have now is the missing link info and Warburg's basic theory so explain what SLP is substrate level phosphorylation is the production of ATP when you move a phosphate group from an organic substrate onto an ADP molecule so it's a ancient way of generating energy in other words it's an organic molecule that's an electron acceptor rather than oxygen right so instead of going through the electron transport chain where you use nad NADH and ADP NADPH as electron transporters well electron donors electron donors you can do a very quick trick where you take an ADP and restore it meaning it has two phosphates you restore it to an ATP by using an organic molecule to donate a phosphate well you for substrate level phosphorylation yes yes so so sucks

[00:53:28] Anelka way has a phosphate group on a serine inside the protein itself and that phosphate group is then donated to ADP and sometimes gdp G to make gtp both depends on the situation but in cancer cells its ATP so you're moving phosphate groups from an organic substrate onto onto the onto the ADP as the acceptor and you can generate massive amounts of energy from that process which can replace the level of lost energy from oxidative phosphorylation and does that occur inside the mitochondria inside the inner yes inner matrix yeah it's in the matrix uh-huh so you're gonna be blowing out a lot of you're gonna make a lot of eighteens gonna just replace in the normal cell you're making most of the ATP from oxidative phosphorylation what in the cancer cell you're making most of it from substrate level phosphorylation inside the same organelle why don't our cells do this under demand so if we jumped up and down and did twenty five burpees right now we would very quickly exceed our oxidative capacity for respiration and we'd start making a bunch of lactate why aren't we also undergoing SLP well we do in the heart muscles they do they've done various cardiac and restrictions and things like that a lot of this has been work down in the heart so it does happen I mean we do do substrate level phosphorylation but it only can be done for short periods of time it can't be done extensively you can't replace oxidative phosphorylation under normal conditions with substrate level phosphorylation builds up I mean this was shown by host kotka when he did some incredibly interesting experiments trying to hold various aquatic animals on the water and looking at the metabolic changes that occurred so seals porpoises turtles and all these kinds of things he strapped them to a board held him underwater and then he would measure all these metabolites in the bloodstream now these were animals that actually could live underwater for if they did to us we'd all be dead right we couldn't live that long but five minutes at the most but these animals could live 10 15 20 minutes being held underwater and they weren't breathing of course now they were stressed out because they were strapped to a board but the bottom line is he started measuring all these metabolites in the bloodstream like the gas it goes right through the massive amount I expect that right so and suck cynic acid suck cynic acid is another so succinate suck cynic acid is part of the in the electrons in the TCA cycle is a powerful stimulant ory towards oxidative phosphorylation and it was being dumped out into the into the circulation so it wasn't being oxidized so so he claims that it was amino acid fermentation that was doing this so the body was grabbing amino acids and and metabolizing them and generating energy through substrate level phosphorylation well it turns out the cancer cell is doing this in a massive amount because they don't have the oxidized so you look at cancer cells and they're dumping out sucks Inuk acid and sucks Innoko acid it stabilizes if one alpha so you can continue to the transcription factors for driving fermentation so this whole thing is just it's just a massive shift from ox FASTA substrate level phosphorylation does creatine phosphate fit into that SLP pathway or is that totally separate yeah I'm not sure about that it could be a source of the phosphate groups but I haven't looked into that Dom but dominic may may know a lot more about that than I do so when you go back to sort of there's there's an undercurrent here to what we're talking about which is the view that you hold is the minority view today it sounds like just it's only it's just a matter of time okay why do you think that is what do you think is the I mean I know people want to come up with conspiracy theories and that's sort of one of the things about social media that I find frustrating is people always want a conspiracy theory to be the explanation like oh the drug companies don't want this to be true or something I find those things hard to began do you think there's a better explanation for why these hypotheses are not being investigated with the rigor that maybe they should be well you have to look at the discipline of the individuals that are working on the project okay so most of the people doing cancer research or molecular biologists which they are you have that perspective on the nature of the problem so you don't look at respiration directly you look at gene expression profiles that may be directly or indirectly related to that and then you make claims about what's going on so most of the people are of a discipline that says that genes are changed and and not looking at the actual consumption of oxygen and like production of lactic acid and not looking at what Warburg actually looked at then you have a very different explanation for for what's happening so a lot of people today look at use the seahorse instrument to measure oxygen consumption and when you put cancer cells and tumor cells normal cells into a dish they're all taking up oxygen similarly and therefore Warburg must be wrong Warburg also said that tumor cells and normal cells will take some will take up oxygen at the same rate except the tumor cell is uncoupled and the normal cell is not uncoupled which means that the oxygen uptake in the tumor cell is not linked directly to ATP production people nor that so they just don't and some of the most beautiful because how would one measure that ATP is very tricky to measure ATP production no ATP can be measured the problem the problem is is that what's the origin of it the well that's what I mean isolating so let's say you have a tumor cell in a non tumor cell and they're both taking up lots of oxygen as measured by you know calorimetry and one's producing a bunch of lactate but how can you tell if the cancer cell is taking up oxygen and not making ATP well if it's taking up oxygen well it if it doesn't make ATP it's dead alright so sorry if it's if it's not making ATP commensurate with its oxygen consumption well sometimes you look at that and you'd say well look at the oxygen consumption is the the ATP production is commensurate with oxygen uptake yes okay that would be coupled wouldn't it as long as it's not producing lactic acid or sucks in a gas okay so either I'm a bit confused why couldn't it do both couldn't a cell undergo anaerobic metabolism make ATP that is accounted for by the amount of lactate that's produced but similarly take up oxygen and in a couple - and make ATP there that's an important point because a lot of people stumble on that the problem with that is that when you're looking at the ATP production coming out of the mitochondria it's not always easy to know whether it's from a coupled generated by a coupled mechanism where where the oxygen is in fact linked to the ATP through f1 f0 ATPase or whether it's coming from mitochondria substrate-level phosphorylation there's no it's not easy to do the mass balance of this many moles of oxygen were produced or consumed and this many moles of ATP were produced you can tell you that math yeah well Warburg did that but he was looking he didn't know about SLP right he well lactic acid production the production of ATP the pyruvate kinase is substrate level phosphorylation but it's cytoplasmic yes yes it's not monitor sorry oh he did not know he couldn't have known because the very systems that were the they didn't come out until the fifties sixties that we knew that there was another form of ATP production inside the mitochondria what people what people have failed to realize is that the they consider if every every biochemical textbook says we only get two percent oxygen coming out of the mitochondria through a substrate level phosphorylation just like we get from the cytoplasm but for cancer cells people say oh you can get a lot more ATP from the cytoplasm but not thinking you can up regulate the same phenomenon inside the mitochondria as a matter of fact we think that substrate level phosphorylation in the mitochondria is far greater than the amount of ATP produced in the cytoplasm and that's because others can't Lee and others a number of people have found that the PKM to isoform of pyruvate kinase doesn't make much ATP makes a buttload of lactic acid but it's not making it's not linked to the ATP production so therefore they have to say no respiration is normal because the cell is making so much ATP but if I don't Warburg is correct and and all the but all of the structural biochemistry is correct the mitochondria can't be making oxygen from oxidative fog they can't be making ATP from Hux vos it can't be because the structure of the organelle is defective so where the hell is all that damn ATP coming from inside that organelle and then when you look at the data that we have it's and glutamine is being consumed in massive amounts so it's got to be coming from substrate level phosphorylation the mitochondria which is interesting I'd never thought until this discussion about the possibility that you could have a completely normal mitochondrial genome and just have structural defects and then of course so you can have genetic abnormalities that lead to protein productions they create social problems but in the case of the former perfectly normal genome samandriel DNA genome my mitochondria yeah but you now have a defective totem what is the actual physical defect in the in the structure yeah number structure this is the it can happen in many different ways for example if a carcinogen enters into the mitochondria they cause a lot of oxidative stress and what we found in our massive studies this is how we got onto onto the my tokheim knowing that Otto Warburg was in fact correct I mean at first I was didn't know what the hell was going on like any but like everybody else but when we found no mutations in the mitochondrial DNA and we knew these cells were fermenting because they were making a lot of lactic acid then we started looking at the lipids inside the the mitochondrial lipid dome like we call it the lipid oum and we have found that cardiolipin the signature lipid and the inner membrane is defective in all the tumor cells that we've ever looked at so that tells us right there that there's a problem in the function and then weak link that to abnormalities in ox fossa so clearly lipids are abnormal that would affect the the function of the proteins of the electron transport chain therefore you're not going to generate the amount of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation because the very lipid and protein structures are abnormal and you can't produce the amount of AC so that's supports Warburg knew that there was a there were many problems than the mitochondrial function that would then force the cell into fermentation so what did they ferment they ferment lactic acid and suck cynic acid what are the fuels for that it's glucose and glutamine so glucose and glutamine are ultimately the fuels that drive the cancer and they drive it through process of substrate level phosphorylation occurring in the cytoplasm where they can build a lot of metabolites for growth and also through the pathway called glutamine alysus now one can't render glucose zero meaning there's no dietary or pharmacologic intervention that could reduce glucose levels to zero are there any that could do that with glutamine let me just let me address the glue

[01:04:26] Koza shoe we can't get to zero but we can get damn close to it alright so we have people published papers people who are going powerful therapeutic fasting only and then given large injections of insulin sure and they've get to below 1 millimolar yeah point 5 so but but sustainably it's very difficult to be below about 3 millimolar right right right but but here's the situation the problem is is when you do that you're going to calorie restriction restrictive ketogenic diets you already are lowering the blood sugar to a significant degree and what we found is that glucose transporters actually get up regulated in the normal cells when you start doing this so the normal cells become glucose hungry and they become direct competitors now with the tumor cell that absolutely needs the glucose because the normal cells can burn the ketones and stay alive the tumor cells can't burn the ketones because their mitochondria defective so you need a good mitochondrial system to burn ketones for energy so what we do by calorie restriction and keep restricted ketogenic diets is we make the normal cells glucose hungry and we transition them over to ketones keep them alive but they're still glucose hungry and they are now competing directly with the tumor cells that absolutely have to have the glucose it's interesting because clinically we don't see that right so clinically when we put most people on a ketogenic diet or a calorie restricted diet in the short run they actually become physiologically quite insulin resistant meaning when you challenge them with glucose they have a paradoxical rise in glucose and insulin that's overcome by refeeding them with carbohydrates for 3 or 4 days prior to the glucose challenge and the offered explanation is that during a period of starvation and/or carbohydrate restriction the muscles which are the obviously the dominant sink for glucose basically become resistant to insulin not in a pathologic way but rather in a way to allow the brain to have access for the remaining glucose well if you do it in acute systems like that rather than the chronic changes that we're that we talked about you can get those kinds of get those kinds of in effect generally calorie restriction makes the body super insulin sensitive yeah it's interesting I this is something I've struggled with because you know I was on a ketogenic diet for three years and at the end of that period of time I went up to Stanford and did a an insulin suppression test which is along with the you glycemic clamp really the gold standard for measuring measuring insulin sensitivity would Gerald reven the late

[01:06:53] Joey even and Jerry was just interested in my physiology it was like wow you're kind of a weird guy you you're on this bizarre ketogenic diet hadn't studied it he did at the time have a publication of about 400 non-diabetic subjects who hae had put through the insulin suppression test the way this test works for the listener is you take an individual you hook them up to two intravenous lines one that puts glucose in one that puts insulin in and over a six-hour period of time you follow a protocol of injecting glucose and insulin and after about six hours the glucose level reaches a steady state level referred to as the SSP or steady state plasma glucose level and the higher that is the more insulin resistant you are said to be the worse you are at glucose disposal the lower that is the more efficient you are able to dispose of glucose oh and that number the SSP G correlates to the one over the

[01:07:51] M value which is the y-axis intercept on the you glycemic clamp so anyway so I went to Stanford one day but let me let me add why would you inject glucose and insulin if you were on a ketogenic diet it'd be already and you were to take glucose your insulin levels would already go up to the maximum physiologic so you're actually giving too much insulin in a situation like well so this was part of the issue right we didn't know what to do because the protocol is all developed around people not on a ketogenic diet these are all be able eating a standard diet but what you've what you're alluding to is what we discovered very quickly so again this is supposed to be a six hour test yeah and when you looked at and I looked at the data before we did this to get a sense of what the parameters were of the 400 non diabetics that they had done this on the most insulin sensitive person ended up having an SSP G of about 79 milligrams per deciliter meaning the lowest that anyone's glucose got following this protocol was 79 milligrams per deciliter which perfectly reasonable and the highest was I don't recall this but we could look up the paper but I think it was somewhere in the vicinity of 200 300 milligrams per deciliter so that's a person who is functionally a diabetic and even though they're quote-unquote you know normal their a1c was less than 6.5 they're very soon to be a diabetic and of course when you do this on people with type 2 diabetes they're all very very high so we're doing this test where they're sampling glucose levels every 30 minutes and within an hour meaning after just the first second third sample it was clear my glucose was going down very quickly so they said okay we're gonna back off on the insulin to your point at 90 minutes and I have to go back and look because I have all the data I could be wrong maybe it was a little longer than I think was about 90 minutes they basically turned the insulin off now at this point my ketone started to go down

[01:09:43] I think between the 90 minute and the two-hour mark it got really bad really quick and my ketones at this point had gone from I don't remember somewhere between two and a half maybe three millimolar down to less than 1 millimolar and they said you know we're gonna stop the test now because your your glucose is in the forties I believe

[01:10:06] I was at about 48 yeah no ketones you're gonna go unconscious you gotta be careful yeah so in the end I almost did go unconscious and the last thing I sort of remember was the profound perspiration that came over me which is very different from the perspiration you experience like on a day like today in Boston where it's hot and you're sweaty it's it's not that type of a perspiration at all it felt like I was in a shower and I began shaking and probably was about to have a seizure and then they went so the last blood glucose I think they I they got on me was about 31 milligrams per deciliter and when they were injecting the dextrose the d50 I was conscious enough to realize the IV had infiltrated so all

[01:10:49] I felt was the most ridiculous burning sensation in my antecubital fossa because I realized the dextrose was not getting and while you put yourself in situations we're never doing it when I came back to life I had a huge huge infiltrated IV in my right my left and a cube I took a picture of it and I sent it to my wife and who I didn't even tell that I had flown up to San

[01:11:15] Francisco that day I think I was just like you know I travel so much that like I could be gone for days she wouldn't even know it and I was like hey check this out and she's like where are you and I was like I'm up at Stanford today doing such-and-such she's like what you just about died and like you got it you got it if you're gonna die I mean you're an idiot but you've got to tell me in advance where you're gonna be when you die yeah well that mean our goal is is not to try to kill ourselves is to kill the tumor cells okay so my long-winded story there was to illustrate a point I turn out to be an exception to that rule so and I did this with oral glucose tolerance tests as well and I never had that physiologic insulin resistance in other words I seem to be one of the people for whom what you're saying seems to be correct chronically which is whenever I'm on a ketogenic diet my glucose disposal is remarkable but now putting on your insulin set you're very high insulin my muscles become very insulin sensitive but without the refeeding of carb yeah yes what I noticed though is clinically I see so many patients for whom that is not the case if I do an OG TT and oral glucose tolerance test on a patient in a ketogenic diet I feel like and again I think other physicians listening to this will have to weigh in with their opinions

[01:12:28] I feel like 70% of them failed the OGT T's and look like they have diabetes or are very soon too however if when on the repeat OGT t you just say look for the three days prior to the test you're gonna eat two potatoes a day they pass with flying colors in other words that they show that they are indeed very insulin sensitive but they need to be primed a little bit so my point though is if that's the case if the 70% of patients or whatever the number is they wouldn't actually benefit from this effect right because they'd be walking around and not you know they'd be the muscles would be selectively not consuming that glucose unless you can get the blood sugar down like as I said where we're experimenting now cuz don't forget our goal is to starve the tumor cells this

[01:13:15] I mean we're singularly focused on this the issue here is how you starve the fermentable fuels without causing without starving the normal cell yeah and harming at all it sounds to me like you were brutalized that's not to be done it that's not what our goal is here our goal is to emerge from the therapy healthier than when you start it so the question becomes how low can you get blood sugar without compromising the health status of the individual and again if the if you're in ketosis you can push your blood Sugar's down really low but you'd want to do this without insulin because insulin itself is Pro tumorigenic only if the blood sugars are high enough once you get those blood sugars down and you take away all the glucose from the body or the majority of it it kills the tumor cells we have the data to support that insulin per se is killing the tumor self insulin production of glucose a reduction of glucose even so you're saying basically because you can't eat insulin thank you so but but you're saying insulin does not function as a growth signal it outside of its anabolic activity and taking up glucose well if you have height like insulin-like growth factor of course is linked to the insulin of course that that facilitates the uptake of glucose I mean if you don't have glucose you don't have glucose but that's a negative look at what else is going on because without

[01:14:31] ATP you can't get energy anyway so the goal is to take deplete the sources of fuel to the cells so insulin you can't eat insulin now insulin drives the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex which facilitates that's why they say oh you know you can get this and that that's only if you have a lot of glucose around insulin becomes prone to more genic but if you have very little glucose and you give more insulin remove the way it doesn't stimulate tumor growth we have direct evidence to support that so in fact the Germans used to do that they used to put people into insulin comas the problem is you don't want anybody go into an insulin coma if they were in ketosis you could give it a shitload of in splint and they're not gonna die we've already have we have evidence in the literature to support that so you got to keep the door shut on that insulin is on the glucose as shot as tight as you can without harming the rest of the body so we use insulin and then we do hyperbaric chambers but that comes only after you shut the door on the insulin the glutamine so if you how do you shut the door--and glutamine the glutamine door you have to use dry and the best drug we found so far is dawn six days between or leucine it's an old drug was made years ago they used to use it on cancer patients but they they never targeted glucose at the same time so the tumor cells were sucking down the glucose as a matter of fact you can even make the gluten in more glucose sensitive if you take away the glue so there's no dietary strategy that could effectively reduce now glutamine is is a non-essential amino acid we make it from we can make glutamine from glucose I mean so it's why it's called non-essential however in Physiology terms it is essential it's the plays a massive role and the gut in the immune system and the urea cycle I mean it's such an important amino acid that's liquid it's the most abundant amino acid in our body yeah that's a funny distinction you I'm glad you pointed that out for this is a total aside but when I'm sure that there are people listening to this we get confused by the term essential and non-essential because it's eight of them are essential in 12 are not essential or something to that effect but what you're pointing out is an important distinction they're non-essential because we don't have to get them exogenously they're still essential for our survival once once produced endogenous yes absolutely and glutamine if you look it's the most abundant amino acid in our serum it's everywhere and our immune system just at the end of the point being there's nothing you're gonna eat or not eat that's gonna change people ask me that all the time it's got to be drugged you got to do it drugged and you have to use drugs but but it has to be done strategically and you have to have people that are knowledgeable about this you can't just have some guy just jack you up with a drug that blocks glutamine because it has to because your immune systems will be compromised and our immune system is needed for our the health of our gut the health of killing bacteria and if you use if you paralyze them too much then you're going to get infections you're going to have all kinds of other issues so that's why we develop the press pulse concept so you press the glucose hard with diets and drugs and then you pulse the glutamine so what we think is going to happen is we will target the glutamine with a drug that will selectively kill tumor cells paralyze the immune system but then immediately give large amounts of glutamine back and the issue of course is that you're going to restore your gut you're going to restore your immune system because they're only paralyzed they're not killed and when you say immune system are you referring to the cellular or humoral so cellular mostly as you've implicated we're going to come back to it but you've kind of implicated the humoral system with the macrophage in terms of mutagenesis well that when you if we're talking about the cellular immune yes you're talking about the T cells and B cells and macrophages and natural killer cells leukocytes all these kinds of things they're all glutamine dependent they're all heavily glutamine dependent okay so if you have a patient that's burned the skin now you open up the bacteria you have to give large amounts of glutamine because you're the immune system is needed to kill the bacteria you have to restore the gut function a lot of the cells in the gut or glutamine dependent so that's why you know you give a large amounts of glutamine to cancer patients that have been that have been subjected but the problem is of course is the tumor cells are using the same fuel so you have to be you have to know and as I said if you kill too many of the tumor cells too quickly you've got to have a cell system to remove the corpses you got to have some asset and that's what the macrophages do and some of these other immune cells they'll come in and remove the corpses the dead cells other why should get infections you die from the indirect effects of these things so you have to know how to strategically target glutamine without compromising the normal physiological systems that we have so before we get into the therapeutic stuff which I understand it's probably what everybody wants to hear about I still want to get back to kind of understanding some of the stuff a little bit better so experimentally

[01:19:03] I'm still struggling with this sort of chasm in belief systems between what sounds like the majority of people who take the view that says look the respiratory system of the cancer cell is relatively normal if you're seeing an increase in fermentation it's an artifact of a higher throughput of substrate to generate more building blocks this strikes me as a very testable hypothesis this really shouldn't be we shouldn't be debating this there should be a set of experiments that could resolve that well yeah and I think that diagram there on the board is the illustration of the strategy to test that hypothesis basically which is where are they getting their energy from the bottom line is where are they getting their energy from if you stop their energy the board picture by the way we're looking at everything we're looking at the I will put a picture of this of course up there but it's basically the TCA along with everything outside of the TCA is it's effectively looking like it's even metabolic pathways that I can't name at this moment yeah it's because you have to try to integrate like you said you have to try to integrate all of the knowledge that we have on the biochemical systems into a strategy to manage the disease and I break it down into some more simplistic things in other words energy without energy nothing grows and the evidence that I'm convinced about but I've read massive amounts of literature and looked carefully at everything the structure and function of the mitochondria and tumor cells is compromised alright that's a fact that's in my mind that is a solid fact and to deny that one would have to ignore the evidence that I've looked at you have to look at a mitochondria and say no that mitochondria that has no cristae and is very few in number there's nothing wrong with it okay let's call it white black and black white I mean but let's go one step further because there's an objective way to assess structure but shouldn't we just ask the functional question well mentally I'm yeah of course and we do and we do that so we know structure dictates function we with that's a common in biology then if that structure looks abnormal at the electron microscopy level at the various levels why don't we look now at the activity of the met proteins in the electron transport chain and just as an this may be a naive question but there can be large ranges of structure that could still produce optimal function and you would think that for something as important as respiration which to your point might be the single most important function of a cell as evidenced by the fact that toxins like cyanide are uniformly fatal within seconds you'd think that the structural leeway within a mitochondria would be so high that you could let's just say you could quantify structure as you know a scale from one to ten and obviously a 10 out of 10 structure is perfectly functional you'd want to believe that that thing would function good enough down to like a 2 out of 10 and only if you were staggeringly compromised does everything go to hell so in other words just to push back for a moment one could argue hey yeah of course there's structural changes but they're there not functionally relevant because they're within a parameter space yeah no that's important point and I think the normal flexibility of ourselves yeah that's the better word flexibility yeah the normal flexibility is able to accommodate those kinds of changes over the short period of time mitochondria is such an incredibly vibrant system it's it's a living organ L inside of ourselves right it's a it's a it's a separate organism actually separate DNA yeah and they've turned over all of their DNA to the nucleus except for 13 critical genes and those 13 critical genes controlled the front the life of the cell it's so it why shouldn't I do this activity when I can get a dumb ass nucleus to do it for me but I'm still gonna hold the keys to the kingdom there's still 13 genes that if anything goes wrong with them you're dead and this is the whole thing why cancer cells don't die through the a pathetic mechanism because the very organelle that controls the kill switch his day doesn't the switch doesn't work so the cell bypasses the normal control of life a pitocin in the cell because the very organelle that dictates that is now defective so consequently this cell now is reverting back to the way it existed before oxygen came into the atmosphere on the planet they were all fermenters they grew on with unbridled proliferation until the fermentable fuel in the environment disappeared and they all died so it was very clear what was going on before oxygen came on to the into the atmosphere cells would proliferate on brothers descent gorga Albert Shanker gave his alpha period and the existence of the planet so everything was working on substrate level phosphorylation it wasn't no oxidative phosphorylation they were all doing that what we have in our system today is these same capabilities but we don't use them but only for very short periods of time under very various physical physiological stress stress situations they're not a part they don't become permanent in the cancer cell they have become adapted because of Warburg said you can't get a cancer cell from a cell that cannot ferment so neurons in the brain can't ferment for very long you never rarely if ever get a tumor out of a neuron except neuroblastoma which is outside the brain so heart cardiac myocytes rarely form cancers even muscle cells rarely form because you lose sheets and stuff so cells that need a of oxidative phosphorylation rarely can form a tumor only tumors can form in those cells that can up regulate fermentation pathways if you can't do that you're gonna die but wait wouldn't skeletal muscle be one of the highest candidates to be able to up regulate fermentation given their ATP demand yes but they have a syncytium of mitochondria inside the muscles and they've adapted this is their part of the normal physiology they can ferment for periods of time under extreme stressful conditions they can't permanently do that they die the muscles will die on you the cells will die if you try to force them into a ferment a long-term fermentation metabolism but they have the capacity to operate fermentation for short periods of time like many cells do but brain can't do that heart can you let's go back to the this is an interesting point you bring up let's go back to a Maya site within my quadricep yeah versus a epithelial cell in my colon yeah to your point the probability I will get a cancer that arrived that comes from the Maya site in my quadricep tis virtually zero oh and say virtually zero but I mean outside of a sarcoma sarcomas well you know what is this arc what's the origin of the sarcoma what kind of stands it can be mi elias are coming there might be many but but just humor me for a moment the probability-wise the Maya site in my quadricep or my pecs or something forming cancer is so much lower than the epithelial cell in my colon right yeah or an epithelial cell in your kidney yes one of these guys I just picked : because I start a high cancer Robert your breast is another yeah yeah right so what is it they explained to me again the difference in their because because I would say like the muscle cell is far more adaptable at making lactate when it needs to because it's I demand of it much more than I demand of my colonic epithelial cell but then say what you were saying again about the toxicity of lactate to that cell versus the epithelial cell and my colon well the epithelial cell in your colon if it becomes and again it's a longer process you know it's not something you don't go from a normal cell to a cancer cell overnight in a colon there are some situations where cancer can happen much quicker than people would normally think but in general it's like it's a protracted process so at the

[01:26:35] CEL has to have the capacity to shift from an oxidative process to a fermentation process you have to have the machinery in the cell to be a fermenter because without the cap of that capacity you can never become a tumour cell because the cancer is two-fold process one is the gradual chronic interruption in respiratory function coupled with a gradual compensatory shift to the alternative form of energy which is substrate level phosphorylation so if the cell is incapable of making that shift it will never become a cancer cell it can't because you in order to be a cancer cell you have to be able to replace ox foss with fermentation and if you can't do that you're not going to become a cancer cell and that's why brain neurons rarely become tumour cells because they can't do that brain cells die so if you interrupt oxidative phosphorylation and then in the neurons of our brain we call that neuro degeneration so we don't generally get tumors we get tumors from the glial cells and the microglia on these kinds of things because yeah this is important I mean I know what you're saying but I know the listener will be confused by this because they're gonna say but gosh my aunt had brain cancer yeah it's very important that we distinguish between the glial cells and the neurons right the microglia there's another form of yeah which we think are even last year about astrocytomas which would be the most common brain tumors they're not actually the cancers is not existing in the neuron that's correct yeah they're not neuro so these are the kinds and/or cardiomyocytes yeah jelly cuz you're gonna you know they just they die they these cuz you'll packed with mitochondria you start they start fermenting you can't they die they can't deal with that again see that's the part time that just confuses me it's so counterintuitive I would think that if there's gonna be a cell in my body that I want to be able to buffer lactate and specifically buffer the hydrogen ion that comes with it that's actually what's killing this so I would want my cardiac myocyte to be the single most robust cell in the body because it has to be the last guy standing yeah well you know this is the whole thing when you get a cut when you get a heart attack you die from brain damage you don't die from your liver and kidneys are fine that's why you can donate your liver he's waiting heart attack because those cells are not dying because they have that they of a brain is most susceptible to the epoxy but the point is even at the level of the highest stress I would want my cardiac myocytes to be able to access all fuels glucose fatty acid ketone well they came they do that with heart rate of heart disease but they don't form cancer they have a capacity and this is where we found a lot of substrate level phosphorylation in the mitochondria the

[01:29:10] TCA cycle was discovered in stressed hearts okay so because they were saying we're with that the heart should be dead right I mean why is it still functioning here where's the ATP coming from and they found that the way most of them energy in the heart is coming from mitochondrial substrate levels for shorter periods of time I'm not saying this is AB you can't do this as a permanent shift but the concepts were developed from the word the work in the heart but you would expect yeah well same with my brain

[01:29:35] I mean why that be I mean if your brain damaged you can't function either I mean so the two organs heart and brain are remarkably dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for function and disruptions of oxidative phosphorylation are usually catastrophic for those cells I mean of course after time I I think I understand your argument what you're I was thinking about it in Reverse you're saying because the brain and the cardiac myocyte have evolved to be so efficient under oxidative conditions it's not so much that lactate is harmful to them it's that once you start to disrupt if the hypothesis is correct that it's the disruption in the mitochondria and its capacity to carry out ox foss that's harmful you died long before you get bother getting cancer those cells get undergo apoptosis or just die I understand your yes yes that's the point that's the point so so the key is that how long does it take to transition to cell from an oxidative phosphorylation state in a cell that can be coming to them or like a colon as you mention so the real problem that these other cells have where cancer is so ubiquitous whether it be breast or colon according to this hypothesis would be their metabolic flexibility it's their capacity to easily wax and wane between

[01:30:50] I shouldn't say it's not their flexibility it's their lack of dependency on oxidative phosphorylation well they dependent I mean obviously like you said with cyanide I mean it's not everything's dead real quick if that happens so cool quickly that they don't have the ebb and flow is their capacity to upregulate fermentation over time because it doesn't happen overnight it's a very gradual thing and hearten heart cardiomyocytes and neurons of the brain can't do that that these other cells are capable of doing and as I said what happens is the again you had that retro

[01:31:22] Singh the mitochondrial stress response and this is where your oncogenes come in now because the oncogenes are transcription factors that up regulate fermentation pathways so basically you when you damage the respiratory system of a cell if one alpha becomes stabilized and now you can up regulate glucose transporters into the cell glutamic is a glutamine they're all overlap each other lactic acid dehydrogenase you know all these enzymes that are geared for maintaining a fermentation metabolism the transcription factors that make those pathways up regulated are the oncogenes basically so the oncogenes have to facilitate if you're if you're not going to get the same level of energy out of your ox vas you've got to compensate to get because as I tell everybody the singular most largest consumer of energy in any cell is the pumps these pumps that are on the surface of the cells that maintain the ionic gradients that allow what we call life with it because once you reach equilibrium you're dead so most of the energy in any cell cancer cell heart cell and it's this it's the proton motive gradient across the membrane that determines whether or not that cells gonna be alive or not so you need any

[01:32:37] ATP for that if the ATP dissipates just swell and die you get anything to go wait to play pop ptosis or whatever so you have to then determine you know where am I where's my ATP coming for how am I going to keep those pumps going so and if fermentation becomes a replacement therefore I'm going to need a lot of extra fermentable fuels to make up the loss of the energy that I'm getting out of out of ox phos so anger genes have to turn on because they are the transcription factors that up regulate the transporters for glucose and glutamine so so you're bringing in two alternative fuels to make up the difference and therefore the genetic behavior of the cell begins to change and then because the cell is now using damaged respiration you throw out a lot of reactive oxygen species from the damaged respiratory system and they caused their mutagenic and carcinogenic so the the nuclear genome gradually collects all these different mutations and defects coming from the Ross of the mitochondria but at the same time the cell is not dying from this rust because it's being protected by the fermentation pathways of glucose and glutamine how much of that lactate is leaving the cell and going back to the liver to go the Cori cycle yes a lot of it a lot of it does has anyone ever looked at patients who have a very very high tumor burden and seeing if they appreciably have higher serum lactate levels yes then blood cancers have been from some of them in fact some there have been some patients who have had various leukemias where they died electic acidosis from so much lactic acid being produced from the tumor cells there's a couple of papers reported on that lactic acidosis from massive leukemias okay so the leukemia the same thing it's a blood cell there mitochondria defective so they're throwing out a lot of light although that's a confusing one because I could come up with another explanation which is in very very severe leukemias you could also create multiple end organ ischemia just due to the defective nature of the wipes all right white white blood cells could actually cause capillary damage and you that that lactic acidosis could actually be from other organs that's true and the paper that I read seemed to focus on the lactic acidosis from the cancer cells themselves but it doesn't rule out that what you just said yeah and we I don't know how you'd quantify the decision oh it's another one of these things but the question is you know but you're right you can't make like a solid tumor seeing a lot of lactic acid in the bloodstream it's the core recycle clears it out pretty quick so you're gonna be taking that lactic acid and making glucose again from it which thank you tumor cells up regulate the machinery I believe MC t2 is the lactate transporter do they up regulate that specifically yeah that's I mean it's it's up regulated and so is lactic acid LDH a lactic acid dehydrogenase a which converts pyruvate to lactate acid oh yeah rather than B so most cancer cells do not have elevated levels this is why some people say all cancer cell can burn lactic acid oh where where they burning it oh well because you know they're taking it back in the cancer cells are burn notes if it can't put poop pyruvate into the mitochondrion pump and lactic acid how is it possible we take like this and make it back the Peruvian put it in it if it does that and it's gonna go up to you're gonna store it as glycogen glycol you're gonna it's not gonna be respired it do you know if anybody looked at that and seen if MCT - I think it's MC - yeah there's the disorder there was sure you have regular odd yeah they're up regulated there's no question they're up because otherwise the hydrogen ion would poison this cell yeah so you have the whole thing is upregulated mono carboxylic acid transporters they dump out and they also take in ketones don't forget the same that same transporter brings in ketones so when you go into ketogenic diets the MCTS are upregulated as well so that you're bringing in more tea and more ketone bodies now to replace there's an irony for you right there the st. the thing that you use to bring in ketones is cos is giving you the exit for a lactate which protects the cell from the harm of the acidosis that comes with the hydrogen ion in the micro environment of the tumor it's a real it's a real mess so some of the lactic acid is persisting the hydrogen ions are persisting until they can lose out into the local bloodstream and get back to the liver that way but otherwise it's going to be a real acidic mess which then which then contributes further to the fermentation behavior of the cells which then their resistance so they're fermenting right so they don't need blood blood vessels so this is a whole why the angio genic anti-angiogenic field has failed because they said what will target the blood vessels and therefore the cells will die because they can't get the oxygen and whatever but the cancer cell doesn't need that

[01:37:06] I mean it doesn't need the blood vessels it can ferment did you know to to folk won by the way you guys were basically neighbors yeah yeah I know he came down here he gave a talk you know as some of his he taught he targeted some unusual kinds of cancers with his anti-angiogenic but hooked up napoleon

[01:37:21] Farrar I believe was the guy who started taking that all off and he even came to a meeting he said none of this stuff is working well because the 10th that and this is why I've Astin as I wrote you know avoid it like the plague it's a stupid drug it was taken off the market for breast cancer because it was harming more people than it was helping but they still use it for brain cancer and I think it makes still use it do they still use it for colon answer as well I don't know of colon cancer but for certainly for brain cancer so what are you doing you're targeting the blood vessels and then forcing these cells to spread throughout your whole brain so just for the listener right they've asked in is an anti-angiogenic yeah this was a

[01:37:54] Genentech blockbuster but Bevis is Amanda the name of the drink yeah and they still use it I think it's despicable to consider anybody using I mean don't they know the biology of the problem they would never do that and it's already been a bust and all the brain cancer studies that I've seen in fact my friends have told me that work on this that's but it makes the it's generally been priced out of use certainly outside of the US I don't think any third party payors would cover it and it's a very expensive drug it's about $100,000 a year and all it does is contribute to the invasive behavior of his tumor cells and all of these other things you're basically driving this idea which I haven't wrapped my head around yet is you're actually enhancing the promotion of the hypoxic factors that are giving cancer some of its selective benefit yeah and it's force and don't forget the cells that are invading which are coming from disrupted microglia in the brain macrophages they will invade they're already have the capacity to do this they live without blood vessels so so you're facilitating the invasive behavior this has been seen on his on histological preparations like brains that have been looked at after

[01:38:56] Avastin they find tumor cells spread through everywhere in the brain rather than clustered in one area it's like you know it's like they've just gone everywhere so and but when you look at the EM art when you look at the image the radiographic images it looks good because you don't see that that the living in the Quranic area that you would normally say well it looks it looks like it's like the image looks a little bit better you tell the patient looks like it's working but the overall survival is no different sometimes it's even less so it's a false image of what's going on you can't see the big central area it looks like it's very vague and and and diffuse and you look the pale yeah it looks like this thing is working gives the guy false hope you know because the end result is look at the overall survival statistics in there and they're abysmal so I want to go back to something you said a moment ago you said macrophage which reminded me of a point you brought up earlier which I guess I'm just not really familiar with which was the idea that the macrophage themself may be responsible for actual metastatic behavior yes can you say a bit more about that well this is a concept that goes all the way back to Akhil from 1906 in Germany where he was I able to show that in coal I believe was calling her melanoma can't remember the tissue he was actually observing fusion behavior between the neoplastic cells and the cells of her immune system and then claim that he thinks after this fusion at fusion event that these cells become much more aggressive and much more dispersive than than before these fusion events this was then solidified by the work of John Pollock at Yale University where he did some beautiful experiments showing that malignant melanoma is actually a macrophage disease there the resulting of fusion hybridization this was then further established by Melissa

[01:40:35] Wong her group at the Portland Medical Center there the health Health Science Center in Portland Oregon beautiful work showing showing how in the colon how macrophages were fueling with the fusing with neoplastic stem cells forming these hybrid cells so the question and we know that all these metastatic cancers are highly fermentative all right we know that's a fact they're all they're all highly fermentative so and they're all very very invasive and they spread that they migrate through the blood-brain bad they migrate everywhere they just invade and these are all behaviors of macrophages when you say fusion so you have a neoplastic cell that is above the basement membrane and you have a macrophage and tell me what the fusion actually is are they fusing genetic material or they just fusing cytoplasmic material what's actually well it's combination of both actually so macrophages cells of our immune system are extremely extremely few so genic okay they do this doomed healing like you'll see multinucleated giant cells and a lot of parts of our bodies during wound healing and this kind of thing and cancer cells you also find a lot of these multinucleated kinds of cells so our body recognizes wounding as an acute problem and the immune system will come into that local area to facilitate wound healing and when the wound persists sometimes these cells will fuse with each other and fuse with other cells in the micro environment to facilitate wound healing the problem is is if you have an epithelial cell like a breast cell or a colon cell that is coming and becoming neoplastic becoming dysmorphic and its growth regulatory and it's fermenting but it doesn't have the capacity to grow anywhere outside of that local area it doesn't have have the capacity so our immune cells come into this lesion if you will that's persisting the immune cell throws out growth factors and cytokines to facilitate the wound to facilitate wound healing the problem is those factors are also facilitating the growth of the neoplastic cell so the neoplastic cell is dysregulated but the very cell that's coming in to try to correct the wound is now provoking the cell to grow even more because but what is the wound that the macrophage is coming in to see because the neoplastic cell has not yet violated the membrane beneath no but it creates a it throws out lactic acid and creates a kind of hypoxic micro area okay a micro area of high pot because that lactic acid is a signal of hypoxia it's a signal of some sort of damage and you're not supposed to have pockets of build-up lactic acid in parts of your body so it sends OU and normally at this if this does happen if we have a contusion or a cut cells of our monocytes mass migrate out of the bloodstream go into the wound clear up the debris kill the bacteria and then move out of that out of that section go back to local lymph nodes and sit there in the event that you need it again or if they pus they form pus they they're all massive numbers of white dead blood cells so these cells are part and parcel of the correction of the wound the problem is in that if you have a colon lesion or a breast lesion from an occluded milk duct or whatever or lesion in the calling you have population of cells that will start to proliferate creating a damage to the local microenvironment signaling a system this there's something going on here right so when the market when the monocyte gets out and differentiates become the macrophage goes to this now poorly differentiated cell why doesn't it just kill that cell nonspecifically because this is just a macrophage and how does that well macrophages aren't designed to kill cells they're designed to kill bacteria that may be in the micro environment don't forget they're wound healing cell but going back to the bruise example right so you get a contusion in your thigh the the macrophage does play a role in clearing that cellular debris yes so why doesn't it just effectively do same thing with the cancers or with the soon-to-be cancer yeah because the cell is not recognized as being its looks it looks like it's a part of the local normal epithelial cells okay it's just it's not it's a it's not looking at as if this is a foreign invader this cell has all of that it looks like a regular epithelial cell that's proliferating because don't forget we replace ourselves by proliferation but the lactate secretion which is what got it there in the first place wouldn't that tell the macrophage hey something's still wrong here yes this cell is hardwired to do what it's supposed to do it's not like thinking oh let me let me problem-solve this is not a problem-solving cell it's hardwired to respond to a particular environmental issue I see so you're saying the lactate is the fight is the fire alarm that got it there but then when it gets there it doesn't see the fire no it well it tries to put out the fire but the problem is what the molecules that are used to put out the fire actually stimulating the growth of the cell that shouldn't be grown so it's out of context okay so how does this facilitate metastasis rather than just local advancement right so so at what point in this protracted process does this now spring to become a metastatic lesion over over a controlled political T that's not yet breaking through the basement membrane or we're doing this right so we don't know sometimes this can happen very fast sometimes it takes a long period of time because we have these certain cancer cells called cancer of unknown primary they're highly metastatic is where they only came from all right that we don't know what what's but they're very highly invasive then we have other cells that will well he had a lesion there a long time for several years this thing never healed it was always losing it was it and eventually explodes into a metastatic lesion we don't know at what point and - varies from one person to the next when now what happens is when the Macra FET we know biology there whew so genic cells there's massive amounts of biology to show that macrophages are very few so genic cells they confuse with themselves or with other fibroblasts they confuse with a variety of different cells usually that's part of the wound healing process to facilitate wound healing but if you fuse with a stem cell that has already defective respiratory systems you would then dilute the cytoplasm of the cell that you fused it with and it fuses again and again it's a process that takes place you eventually dilute the normal mitochondria in the macrophage and you replace it with the abnormal mitochondria from the cells that you're fusing with then leading to a cell with dysregulated growth growth properties how much how much of the mutation how many mutations would it take to do that we don't know because there's some metastatic cells that don't have any mutations if you can believe it deep sequencing they haven't found any mutations in some of these cells so but they're fermenting and they're spreading they have their growth dysregulated so but wait how are they growth dysregulated without a mutation you have cells that are carcinogenic that are tumorigenic that have no mutations Baker pointed this out it's like people can't believe this on the other hand we have skin cells loaded with so-called driver mutations that never form a tumor so this linkage between the number of mutations and the type of cancer is just there's so many flaws in this so there are there are cancer cells that have been looked at that have highly invasive metastatic and they can't find the mutations in there that's not common but it happens so it throws it it's it's a violation to the whole concept in glioblastoma there are some tumors that have been found that have none of the driver mutations none of them none of the abnormalities that you would have expected that are found in others so there's a break linkage between mutate you don't need new mutations to cause a metastatic lesion that doesn't mean that a metastatic lesion has no mutations but maybe I'm asking a different question okay so two women have breast cancer right and for all intents and purposes they have very similar patterns of mutations in their breast cancer and let's just say make it easy and say that their hormone ELISA mold their their er PR positive her2 new negative breast cancers both women present as stage t to n1 right so they've got whatever a five centimeter tumor if that's a still a t2 I don't even remember and they've got you know two lymph nodes or one lymph node they both have a resection 10 years later one of them is still disease-free the other one has died from brain metastasis which were presumably seeded before the primary tumor was resected ten years earlier it's not a sloppy surgery where they didn't get part of the cancer what I'm hearing you say is yeah one of them could undergo metastasis while the other one did not even though their primary tumors looked very similar is that yea the correct answer I think that's that's correct and and what we find now with a number of papers is the needle biopsies that you are used to diet diagnose the tumors can create a wounded even a more aggressive wounded situation in the micro environment of the tumor leading to the phenomena of inflammatory uncle taxes which facilitates the fusion and in other words by looking at the tumor with a needle biopsy to make the diagnosis you put that patient potentially at risk for causing a metastatic lesion and then when you look at the profile you say well this doesn't look too bad no not not here but wait wait let's say we do that we're gonna immediately resect that tumor anyway so how is that how quickly does this process take place because the wound is between the outside world and the tumor not between the tumor and the inside world necessarily especially if that tumor is going to come out you know within a few weeks right yeah we know from a number of studies that needle biopsies can facilitate in some patients the invasion of cells into the local and spread all right we know this this has been reported in the literature for breast for Colin for liver for brain the very act of stabbing this growth but ya know I think what's get the cells out I think what's known is that you can seed tumors along the tract of where you do that yes that I understand but maybe I misunderstood you're saying that a woman who has a needle biopsy of her breast who then goes on to get a lumpectomy has that increased her risk of brain metastasis well it wouldn't be brain metastases right away it would have to that brain metastases the secondary metastatic behavior and Tate has taken a while there's it's not just the brain how does needle biopsy increased the risk of that needle biopsy creates a more inflamed condition that's why I call an inflammatory Anka Texas and now this was one of the reasons why they get rid of the Moores elation procedure because this is what was happening so these women were dying from metastatic cancer from oscillation it's kind of a machine that used to be made by Johnson &

[01:51:22] Johnson for uterine removing uterine polyps well you've taken a polyp and you're grinding it up and creating inflammatory Anka taxes no there might have been one polyp out of a thousand that was that would have this right but that's very different from the I'm asking very specific question cuz here's my fear what I don't want is anybody listening to this who's got a breast lesion who thinks now they can't have it biopsied I'm still I think that's a very different case than the example well the evidence is clear in some cases not all cases not everybody who goes under a needle biopsy is gonna have metastatic cancer number that's not the question I mean what I'm asking is is a woman if you take a thousand women you take it's a thought experiment you take a million women with an identical breast cancer and you take half a million of them and you just do the resection and the other half a million you do a needle biopsy to confirm the diagnosis then you do a resection are you saying in the half a million women that had a resection following a biopsy their probability of metastatic cancer later on is greater I think so but I can't be sure because that experiment hasn't done okay I'm basing it on what has already been known about needle biopsies facilitating the spread of the tumor but I again I'm just being critical of this because I I feel very strongly about not causing panic in people but I don't don't think those data are about needle tracks eating yeah well needle tracks don't for example like as you said look you have a liver biopsy you can you can get cancer cells through the track even after but that's very different from saying you know cuz that that can be dealt with but this is a very different yeah well I think this is from what I'm looking at now I look at it the brain predominantly right you know how many we have what we call secondary glial blastoma and that is very it's not uncommon that when you go in and remove a low-grade tumor that within a shorter period of time it turns into a blastoma this is the same phenomenon you're just doing it a little bit larger scale rather than just through a needle biopsy so you go in and you take out a low-grade tail a tumor and all of a sudden within a year or something you've got glioblastoma sometimes even less and you say what the hell happened here so this is just a large what's the control for that observation well there meaning like another explanation would be the person who has the stage one astrocytoma is more at risk for the stage 2 3 or 4 astrocytoma from the operation itself from the provocation of the microenvironment without it we'd have to have a group of those patients who don't undergo surgery that's right and you would have to but who's doing nobody's doing these experiments but we but here's the situation what our philosophy is that is if we shrink the tumor whether it's a breast to him or calling to him or whatever if we take away the fermentable fuels and shrink that tumor down then it becomes a candidate for complete debulking not not diagnosing okay when you take a needle biopsy of a breast and you look at what are they why are they doing that they're doing if amazingly two reasons to try to diagnose what level of cancer you have and then to give you a gene read out like this genes are gonna play some role and whether or not you're gonna get a treatment right well yeah for example in the case of doing a biopsy before a breast resection you there's value in knowing if a woman might benefit from neoadjuvant therapy for example based on the receptor profile yeah but in other words it might not just be the gene right like knowing that she's er she's triple positive or negative right right might change what you do yeah I guess it could but but the bottom line is is that why don't you assume that you have a problem why don't you just put that patient on metabolic therapy and shrink that tumor down and then do a non-invasive check did it did the

[01:55:07] Border's change at all from that from the metabolic and then just the bulk it completely the probability of cure is going to be better in my mind then if you do a needle biopsy without doing the debulking and just to say let's look at this how long after the needle biopsy do you put that patient at risk for possibly ceding a cell that gets to a lymph node that then can spread out and later that you get brain metastases liver metastases or whatever else can happen from these cancers so the question is why put anybody at risk well if we know we have evidence from the literature to say that is a possibility why would we want to put anyone at risk for that unless the information you get from the needle biopsy is going to be a curative procedure and a lot of times it's not okay it's just for diagnosis procedures and now today we're using all these gene screens $7,200 to tell somebody what kind of gene profile and that may no longer be relevant after you've taken a needle biopsy from the very tissue you're doing yeah I know I think that makes sense I guess I'm a bit confused by the idea I guess I just don't see your controversial issues I and I and I'm looking at it from the point of the biological processes that are taking place from these procedures and knowing that I've seen literature on lung I've seen liver cancer certainly for brain I mean but but here's is so I mean there are so many potential arguments right so you look at one of the most metastatic cancers of all time is pancreatic cancer right it's it's almost uniformly fatal and yet up until recently very infrequently biopsied it's a very difficult biopsy you do it with an ERCP no that's true so yet in other words you can still have a incredibly aggressive metabolic cancers which have never which are you know or not often and then conversely you look at a GBM you look at a you know the cancer we're sitting here talking about the brink you know a very aggressive one that john mccain just passed away from well that's

[01:57:08] I mean that's only locally metastatic it never leaves the CNS does it oh yeah it does where does it go it goes to bone it goes to liver it goes that nobody looks at that what percentage of patients died from or no not many but when they look they supped they find this was one of the big things this is how we discovered the macrophage origin of the of the cancer we started looking and saying how many people do autopsies of organs on people who've died from glioblastoma and what did you find there's a hundred articles in the literature with metastatic GBM to various organs for people dying people say well it doesn't happen at all you know why they died the GBM before they start recognizing they have metastatic liver cancer but when you look at livers and kidneys and these other organs from patients who have died from GBM those studies that have looked have found cancer so clearly these sales are coming out of the brain and they're getting into the other organs the problem is the patients aren't living long enough to have a problem what was worrying about the guy's liver when his brain is starting to swell up from from all the treatments they're giving him I mean 12 months most people are dead so but there's over 100 articles in the scientific liver literature showing outside I call extracranial metastasis of glioblastoma so it's not that it's it's and people ignore it it's like knowing that the mitochondria damaged in in cancer cells people ignore it well I guess that would be I'd be that'd be a more forgivable thing to ignore because

[01:58:31] I'm not convinced it necessarily changes the story the mitochondrial one is a much more interesting question right if I mean that to me of all the things we've talked about today Tom that's the one that kind of has me scratching my head the most and wondering in 2018 how are we even having that this is it this this should be something that's not debated this should be sort of like this would be like debating whether DNA is necessary to make RNA like that that that discussion was settled in the 50s and anyone who disputes that now is sort of you know disputing the shape of the earth so I guess to me given the stakes here I would love to figure out why people aren't answering this question well let's look at the situation from even a greater distance in the United

[01:59:16] States we have over 1600 people today dying from cancer all right this is horrific right there's over a half a million people a year 1,600 people with a dying from cancer obviously there's something seriously wrong there's something's massively wrong with what we're doing with this disease you know when we talk about needle biopsies we're talking about this we're talking about that the issue is we had 1,600 people that they dying why are all these people dying from cancer so it's either we have a fundamental misunderstanding of what the nature of the diseases were mistreating it we're treating it as something that other than what it actually is so the debate that you mentioned now is that the results of the dead people are the consequences of the fundamental misunderstanding of the process of the biology of the disease what I'm arguing is that now understanding the biology of the disease we have the potential to drop the death rate by more than 50% in ten years there's no question about it if you stop doing half of the stuff that we're doing to these cancer patients looking at the biology and the nature of the disease how to best go about this strategically I think we can drop the death rate by 50% we're doing stupid things right with needle biopsy tumor cells for Trojan etic profiling that has no relevance to the nature of the disease that's just one we just to go back to that because I'm sorry it's just

[02:00:32] I just I really want to make sure people aren't gonna stop refusing their biopsies but have we seen an increase in the rate of metastases in the era of needle biopsy for genetic sequencing I mean we could go back and look at the death rate from cancer 50 years ago before anybody was doing this and it was the same yeah well I think that we've we've probably I don't want to say I just want to say that every year we have more and more dead people this is this is and the increase is faster than the general population okay so we had 3.8 percent increase in indefinitely is that is that actually true is the age adjusted population adjusted mortality of cancer today higher than it was 50 years ago I think it's about three or four percent lower so I just did the last five years okay from 2013 to 2017 but to test this hypothesis we'd want to take an even longer time period and go you know more extreme as far as well you know I mean every year it's good there's no year that we have fewer they're always coming the dead people are piling up so you know when I look at the numbers and I say okay what was the percent of population increase in the

[02:01:37] United States over the last five years and according to the demographics it's not 2.9 percent okay over the same period how many cancer does but again I'm again not I don't know my epidemiology well enough to make this case but I'm gonna try anyway isn't the growth in population more a function of the input of people meaning birth rate rather than the people who are getting cancer which are the older folks well we have younger people too right right but the majority of cancer older folks for sure so I'm not sure that that population argument would well

[02:02:09] I would answer that questioner well maybe there's always a guy you can find I think all you have to look at is the numbers of people that are dying from the disease I mean that's a fact you know no it's a fact and it's a tragic fact I guess you know a 50 percent reduction in this and the mortality of this disease in ten years is a very bold statement given that we've seen about a three percent reduction in cancer mortality in 50 years yeah which which I think you're arguing is unacceptable and under well you know yeah I'm looking at it from from the tragedy in China is eight thousand one hundred people today dying from cancer I mean that's the number over there maybe have I was the big bigger population but the problem it's now surpassed heart disease in their country clearly it's not whatever we're doing and yes 50 percent if you did what we think you need to do and to manage this disease looking at it from the biology of the disease you will I I think I wouldn't I would not be shocked if we had a 50% reduction in so normally you ask people what their dream experiment would be but I'm I want to ask you to I want to ask you this question twice the first one the first time I'll ask you this question will be the easier one because it'll be the clinical trial so what would be the dream clinical trial to test the hypothesis that says we can reduce the mortality of cancer by 50% what what would you want to put head-to-head to definitively what we do right now is if we do metabolic therapy at all okay if we do it at all it's either standard of care versus standard of care plus metabolic therapy we're missing the crew the critical control group metabolic therapy without standard of care what are we doing so tell me what the experiment would be let's let's use breast cancer as okay breast cancer you so you have your standard whatever you're doing today a lot of people dying of breast cancer with metastatic breast cancer so we're gonna now take metabolic therapy and we're gonna combine it with standard of care which is what the group and in Turkey and how is that how would you integrate that let's talk about how you would do it not necessarily have it's being done how would you for the purpose of the experiment integrate standard of care patient we use the chemo that man we would have people on on metabolic therapy which would be lowering you would do those in parallel you would have some patients that would be treated only with the standard of care which which would be our guest row and then we would have people treated with the standard of care plus reducing blood sugar elevating ketones and targeting the energy metabolism which we contend would that include things like metformin CA other things like it could it could include

[02:04:53] America accent yes yes that's what we're doing in Turkey so it's basically standard however in Turkey we're doing the lowest dose of chemo that we can use to still be in compliance with the with the law and if you get rid of now the control D and now your metabolic therapy alone group metabolic therapy alone what would that group that group would be press pulse concept so we've down regulate the glucose first shrink the tumor up make the microenvironment less inflamed less angry then we specifically tell me what would be in that so you would these patients would be on ketogenic diet first we'd blower their blood sugar gradually depending on the status of the individual so you'd go into lowering their blood sugar elevating their key putting them to therapeutic ketosis essentially so a lot of these people also have a multiple other series of metabolic abnormalities they have type 2 diabetes they've got you know triglyceride emia they have all kinds of other things besides having cancer so basically by by bringing them into a state of therapeutic ketosis you know how do you define that is that defined by the amount of glucose and ketone just by the glucose ketone index that we published we published a paper on and what what's the ratio this ratio about close to 1.0 or below if we can if we can get it this is where the millimolar of ketone and the millimolar of glucose are about the same and that people hit that somewhere between 3 & 4

[02:06:09] I'm guessing it days after no 3 to 4 millimoles tends to be the place where they're about the same it could be it could be you know it depends on the individual because that some people have higher glucose higher ketones and yet they still have the same ratio so some people have you know very low glucose and not that high of a ketone but it gives them the same ratio so so the issue is get your rig the only time I've been able to be at one-to-one is when

[02:06:31] I'm not eating anything yeah well it's variable from one person to the next and then the other thing too we have to be very careful about there's a lot of cancer patients very hard to get into one you're a young healthy guy guys that are young and healthy can get well below one women are better than men we've done some studies so basically but cancer patients are freaked out because they have anxiety and anxiety elevates corticosteroids at you you have a tougher time bringing here so we also

[02:06:56] Institute with with the press besides ketone supplementation is domme D'Agostino who's been telling and the ketogenic diet and then we have stress management which includes music therapy yoga therapy there's a variety of ways to reduce emotional stress and that's a very important part of the management you have to let the patient know that their disease is not terminal that they're lowering of the stress is going to make the medicine and the work so once we get the patient into metabolic ketosis now we have options now we can start using insulin therapy to bring the blood Sugar's down lower we can put them into hyperbaric oxygen which creates oxidative stress predominantly in the tumor cell and not in the normal cells the normal cells are burning ketones that reduces oxidative stress when you say insulin therapies do you mean actual insulin yeah we're testin that now the

[02:07:45] Germans used to do that years ago but we don't think we have to put people into metabolic comas to do this we think we can do it without it we're testing it now so I'm I'm working on it now as we speak we have these experiments going next door so so the question is you don't want to use insulin therapy unless you're in therapeutic ketosis you don't want to go into a hyperbaric chamber unless you're in therapeutic ketosis and then we would pulsed with drugs that target glutamine and together you're removing the in the antioxidant capacity of the tumor making it vulnerable to hyper Baraka how much can these drugs lower local levels of glutamine enough to slaughter the tumor cells but what I don't know enough about this is that a 50% reduction that's necessary to do that we we're getting about a 50% reduction in glucose based on Europeans we want to get lower the glucose even further because you can do that and with ketones correction with target and glutamine it's got to be pulsed because you can't chronically reduce glutamine to the availability to the physiology acutely how much do you lower it we can lower quite effectively we can shut it and well don't forget the cancer cell is absolutely dependent on this fuel the normal cells get they can burn the ketones also so they're not gonna be energy deprived completely whereas the tumor cell will be deprived energy completely are there some cancer cells that preferentially utilize ketones no cancer cell can use ketones you have to have a good mitochondria and a cancer cell that would have some oxidative capacity a small amount of oxidative capacity could burn some ketones but most can't most of the most aggressive cancer cells can't burn ketones because their mitochondria defective that you need a good might or that's why it's a selective it selects for enhancing the vitality of the normal cell while putting the cancer cell at a competitive disadvantage so this is the ketones are not to kill cancer cells they to provide the normal cells with a fuel as an alternative to glucose that the tumor cells can't use the ketones and if there many experiments like this you can't if you take Keith the cancer cells and grow them in a dish without glucose and glutamine just ketones they die but normal cells don't the normal cells can survive on the ketones without the glucose and glutamine so it's very clear that the tumor cells can't use in the end and I said that you have to have a good mitochondria to do this so so we're selectively marginalizing these tumor cells because of their metabolic in capabilities but it has to be done strategically over time and where does the hyperbaric oxygen fit in is that part of the pulse obviously yeah that's a pulse therapy and what how much hyperbaric what we want to try to replace radiation therapy with hyperbaric oxygen because the mechanisms of cell death will be very so many atmospheres we do it at two-and-a-half atmospheres for how long well we were doing it for 90 minutes every day you know something like this so it you know it's it's designed to put metal oxidation stress killing the tumor cells by oxidative stress the same way a radiation therapy would work okay radiation a lot of times doesn't work because the cells are in a hypoxic environment all right so why are they in such a hypoxic environment because they're fermenting all right they're blowing out all this fermentable fuels into the waste products got to clean that all up that micro environment has to be brought back to a normal state and therapeutic ketosis we published several papers showing that it's a tant powerful anti-inflammatory therapy it makes the micro environment less inflamed it's pro-apoptotic it's anti-angiogenic so you're killing all these bad blood vessels and replay with normal blood vessels that the normal cells will be able to use so it's a it's it's reconfiguring the micro environment while putting stress and killing tumor cells now the tumor becomes more and more vulnerable and now it becomes more and more damaged by by drugs that are going to chip away at the surviving cells it's not something we're gonna go in like a bull in a china shop it's going to be a gradual degrading of the tumor and and where does this surgery take place here is the surgery taking place before all of this happens no the surgery would take place at some midpoint okay the midpoint would be where the surgeon now looks at the tumor and says I can take care of this it's not going to be a diffuse mass it's not gonna be an angry inflamed thing well you have to cut out half the guys : in order to get what you think is the part of the cancer that's it no this thing will be now much more shriveled we've seen it it's much less angry it's at micro it's more demarcated you can see it on this end the histological slides you can see what the hell happened to this tumor how come it's um it's smaller how come it's more the margins are more sharply defined because you took away the inflammation that was being driven by the fermentation fuels so you shrinking this tumor down now the surgeon comes in and can potentially cure these people that would be maybe not curable in the past so this is why I'm saying we can reduce the death rate by 50% if you view the tumor as a metabolic problem rather than a genetic problem the gene mutations are all downstream epiphenomena red herrings even vogelstein who still claims that this is a bird vogelstein from Jonah he still claims it's a genetic disease but we're never going to cure the disease by targeting the genes as too many mutations to all this kind of stuff but we can do that with metabolic therapy we can actually eliminate the cancer based on metabolic therapy it's a process who's trained to do this no one

[02:12:51] I mean we need physicians to be trained to do this what they're been used to trained to give dose of high doses of radiation without killing the patient or poisoning these poor people with drugs that are very toxic and keeping them alive so you don't die from the from the treatments this is absurd why are you using radiation and chemo in the first place what we have to stop proliferation okay well we if they can't generate energy they're going to stop liberating is they gonna die what is the experiment the clinical trial that you're involved in in Turkey that you've alluded to you yeah so what we what we do my colleagues in Turkey do is they use chemo but they use the lowest possible dose is it for breast cancer all cancers in fact the results are the same all cancers are the same disease they're all fermenters so once you knew that they're all dependent on these two fuels then all you have to do is target the two fuels to put them at risk for elimination the question is how can you target the fuels without harming the rest of the body and that's the press pulse concept so we know we can press things constantly without harming the body but we have to pulse the glutamine issue because we don't want to deprive our normal immune system and gut systems of the very fuel needed to provide normal physiology and those tissues so this is why we have to pulse the glutamine issue how many glutamine drugs are there well this sums coming all the time but the one that works the best for us is Donna are there any that are in clinical trials in the United States yeah there's a couple is there's a name there's a few names of them you know they're they target various aspects of the glute ammonolysis pathway the problem is we have a drug that's called it's a dirty drug it hits multiple pathways of glutamine metabolism and it seems to work better than all the other drugs at least from our perspective so far which drug is done this is done the the six

[02:14:28] Norden or leucine it was used in clinical trials years ago but it was partially effective but they weren't targeting they weren't doing the full metabolic approach if you don't do all the parts of the problem you're not you're gonna the horse is going to get out it's it's still not going to be effective and today no one anywhere on the planet is doing the kind of a therapy that we think need to do to make to make this all work now this bit Simmons's on what are the drugs they're in current clinical trials that are targeting glutamine well there's a B EPTs I believe an acronym for another very complicated structure and then there's a they're making gone analogs that are supposedly less toxic what we find is with the ketogenic diet

[02:15:03] Don becomes far less toxic so you can actually use you can use far lower doses so I was talking to somebody the other day is it better to wait for a pharmaceutical company to build a new drug to target answer or is it better to develop a way in which a previously very effective drug could be less toxic and both of them become at the end result is the same you're going to get something that's going to work far better than than what was previously available so how many clinics in the country in the world are treating cancer as a metabolic disease using a strategy that will take away the two prime fermentable fuels for the disorder and the answer is no one no one no one's doing this but about this trial in Turkey is doing this well they're not targeting the glutamine so they're doing they're doing these other processes but so it's it's the glucose the ketones the hyperbaric oxygen yeah but not pulsing with glutamine not the anti gluten not doing the glutamine nobody's doing the glutamine we tried doing that in our Egyptian patient that we published recently we use chloroquine and we used EGCG which is a green tea extract but they're not they're not as powerful in the clinic now that poor guy he just passed away we were devastated by this we published the paper he lived 30 months which is far longer than most people with a glioblastoma he was doing really well on metabolic therapy we pushed off the standard of care for 3 months so we did surgery after three weeks of therapeutic ketosis debulk the tumor most of it because you never get well GBM and then we didn't we didn't do we were forced into the radiation therapy after three months even though the guy was doing remarkably well so this is a so we said why are we radiant when we have to because as part of the stand even and he just was in alexandria egypt and then a year later he starts developing or it was six or eight months later he starts developing a headache his head starts to swell and they did a compression debulking and they found the look at the tissue they were named tumor cells he was dying from radiation necrosis that he took from the radiation so this is why I'm very much against I think we're not going to make any major advance in brain cancer until we stop by radiating people with the brain because you're creating a bigger problem and this is leading to the demise of all these poor patients the survival after radiation is almost zero so and that's in my mind it's becoming because doing in part to the radiation that would give into these people so whether they're dying from the tumor or radiation necrosis they're going to be dying they shouldn't be doing that in the first place so the standards of care have to be dramatically changed in order to improve overall survival so when I say we can drop death rates by 50% in ten years we're not only dropping death rates we're massively increasing overall so and quality of life at the same time so

[02:17:45] I have a lot of anecdotal information with people who have been treated with metabolic therapy part of it they're living far longer the quality of life is much better and when they die they die in a very peaceful way and this but some of my clinician friends have been telling me this these guys that are in these metabolic therapies the quality of life is really good up until about two weeks before they died whereas the people do on standard of care never live as long and their quality of life is horrific they're living they're there they're there do you think that metabolic therapies are offered the potential for cure or just another therapeutic option because if you want to reduce the death rate by 50% it there's no lead time bias / therapeutic extension that's gonna do that that is that is a paradigm shift in cure not treat I think it's both I think you're going to be able to extend dramatically overall survival you're going to improve dramatically quality of life and how do we know if we're cured the issue is is that if you die from a heart disease at 85 and you had cancer when you were when you were 50 a tournament so called a terminal disease

[02:18:51] I mean I think we could pick something simpler than that right if you are ten years disease-free - a first order approximation you're cancer-free right if you had colon cancer ten years ago and you know ten years later you die of a heart attack I think it's safe to say you died of heart disease even if on a autopsy they find dormant cancer cells well you know here's a situation if you take standard of care and you live ten years and or like you said and you drop dead of a heart attack something that is that heart attack was that heart attack the result of the cancer or the treatment you gotta also have to put into into perspective what effect does the treatments have on your overall long-term survival as well right so dana-farber down here just opened up a branch of medicine called cancer survivor medicine it appears that many people treated with standards of care are suffering from horrific Lee from all these other kinds of diseases they never had but for the fact that they were treated with all this toxic stuff so we would eliminate that why would you if you're in therapeutic ketosis and you're doing unlikely but I'm still like what's the proof of concept that the metabolic therapy can lead to a cure so is your hypothesis that this gentleman in Alexandria if he hadn't been if he hadn't undergone radiation for the GBM your belief is he could have actually had a cure I don't know because we we can't know like you said we'd have to wait 10 years you know to know that so if we were to institute an aggressive metabolic program for managing cancer but it seems GBM would be the place to do it right because it's you know it unfortunately is such a uniformly fatal cancer and it's fatal because of the treatment that they're giving these this combination of the of what they're doing to the patient as well as the tumor the problem clinically right is that the mass effect doesn't give you a lot of flexibility to delay surgery so between corticosteroids and radiation when a patient most patients present with gdm not it not GBM not as incidental findings they have symptoms from the

[02:20:49] Mass Effect so we have to be sympathetic to the clinicians in the conventional pathway who are saying look I got Bob here he's complaining he's got you know Hemi paralysis and yet he's got a GBM the idea that we're gonna wait a month to put him on a ketogenic diet when I need to either cut that thing out now or radiate him or or put him on corticosteroids so so in other words there's AB is gonna be a very difficult thing to study well it's a judgment call on the part of the neurosurgeon okay so he looks at the data do we have a watchful waiting period this is I have spoken many neurosurgeons by their blood of my friends I said what's the stat what do we do here he said a tional e if you have brain herniation possibility the patient be dead in a week we don't do the bulking that patient has to be the bulk all right but you don't have to give them steroids you can just do the bulking steroids will shrink the edema of the 3 and what would be the most evil in your mind meaning metabolically evil the radiation the corticosteroid or the surgery Oh clearly the steroids and the radiation so that surgery that every GBM patient should go and have the resection and then undergo metabolic therapy even though they're not technically going to be free of disease yeah I think I think this is a the strategy the watch will how long the watchful waiting period is will give the neurosurgeon an opportunity to do a greater debulking and there's a hundred articles in the literature showing that the law you'll live longer on to bulking the more you can do bulk the tumour so if we can shrink the tumor down like we did to the

[02:22:18] Egyptian people ate at three weeks we put him under incredible therapeutic fasting water only 900 ketogenic diet they did a very awake good 900 900 calories kilocalories yeah but not water only you said water for the first three days water oh I see and then we did transition to him he did an awake craniotomy it was done done very well then we pushed off the radiation therapy for three months and then they did well and we didn't want to do that because I think the tumor was looking really good he had a correction of the midline shift he was he was he was in good shape so I think he suffered from the radiation I think he didn't survive because of the radiation treatment do you think that

[02:22:56] GBM would be the best histology to study this in oh yeah because it's as you said the survival is you're gonna see a signal if one's there yeah so and and then I've spoken to a lot of my friends who think that okay we have to debulk immediately then we're going to go on metabolic therapy we we can push it off for two weeks and then do metabolic therapy the thing we have to do is we have to eliminate radiation I think radiation is part of the big biggest part of the problem I think when you do if you're doing metabolic therapy you should eliminate radiation right away I have no doubt about this is absolutely in my mind a problem and this is one of the reasons why there's so few people surviving it's because you are radiating this if you didn't radiate you could survive a lot longer I think with a metabolic therapy you can double triple the amount of survival how do we know this because those patients that I know who rejected radiation and chemo took surgery after two years a year are doing well they're out for years so clearly they're with which histologies GBM there's a GBM patients alive yes at four years yes Pablo Kelly in fact I'm gonna be there next week he's gonna be sitting in the audience is this published no it's not published but the guy has all the documentation it's just that it's not yet published why because we I haven't I haven't sat down and wrote it up yet what would be more important than writing that up writing another paper up that I thought the guy was going to live just as long but he wasn't look that guy was one guy alive three years if you have a cohort of patients that have been alive for four years with

[02:24:23] GBM I don't know what would be more important than delay I don't know of anything more important either but you don't figure we should stop this podcast now you can start writing that up well I'll talk to you in fact he's gonna be giving a lecture after my lecture because that's I mean that's really where you want to be able to generate interest on a clinical trials okay so how many people he's a young guy 25 years old he says I don't want radiation

[02:24:45] I want kid I don't want chemo I don't want any of that stuff I don't want surgery he says oh you're gonna be dead in three to six months this was they told him it's all in the news it was in the newspapers I gave him the stuff on the metabolic therapy I didn't know he was gonna live that long I thought he was just gonna live a few extra months he comes back and he says I'm still alive and there's a big newspaper article in the British newspapers about this guy who rejects all so after two years he decides to let me that he had an inoperable glioblastoma that now became operable after metabolic therapy so they debunked it and now after another year he's he doesn't have any to him I left and he never had radiation he never had chemo he had surgery very delayed and they did a histological analysis after the debulking said yes you did have a GBM because what a lot of people say if you live that long

[02:25:30] GBM it's the problem it's just that you I mean what you're creating a situation that leads to the demise of those very people that you are trying to get to help and the and when you'e radiate the brain you free up massive amounts of of glutamine by breaking the glutamine glutamate cycle so those tumor cells are sucking down massive amounts of glutamine and then you give the steroids to reduce the edema which then elevates the blood sugar so I was going to give you two experiments to dream experiments so the second one would be going back to sort of the more fundamental premise of this which is what if resources were you know no constraint how could one unambiguously make the case slash test the hypothesis that despite structural abnormalities in the mitochondria the production of lactate and the fermentation is not purely for respiratory compensation in other words we talk about this idea that says you can have a structural deficit but still be functionally good enough how could that hypothesis be tested cuz that seems to be one of the central arguments here well I mean there's several ways we look at this if a cell can live with ketones without glucose and glutamine you'd obviously have some mitochondrial function that would keep them alive because they wouldn't be able to firm it but let's like we're in a resource unconstraint world so what are the dream experiments well that we would test that well we have humans you know I mean in vivo ba because a lot of these mechanisms would be tested in vitro because you can't do those kinds of experiments but the metabolic therapy that we have designed Dom D'Agostino myself

[02:27:13] Joel maroon who's the team surgeon for the Pittsburgh Steelers nurse a neurosurgeon George Yeo is a who's a prostate oncologist prostate cancer oncologist we all sat down and we built this press pulse therapy okay so if you if you deprive the tumor cells of their fermentable fuels and and you killed and you essentially eliminate you know I can't detect any more cancer in your body that's based on the biology of what the problem is all right so the dream experiments to are to ferret that out mechanistically in vitro so to prove that this is the case and we're doing that right now when we target these things these cells die so you can put them in and when normal cells wouldn't die so clearly what's going on here I mean it was shown in many papers in fact they're back in the 30s and 40s beautiful papers showing that the respiratory system of tumor cells is massively compromised okay if that's the case then they they they're surviving on fermentation there's no other known biological system in the world that can provide alternative ATP but yet most people don't agree with that statement so that's what I'm asking is what experiment could take the debate out of that very well we're in course okay so they don't they don't believe it if I look at the data and you look at the data and we both come to the same conclusion and this other guy looks at the same data and he says I don't believe it then it tells me the data are not convincing enough if everybody's acting in good faith well then you have to ask about what's what's good faith if I have or what's better okay look at here's the way I look at it if science is a human activity okay there are people who say things that are not true and everybody believes it right right all right so I look at something and but I don't refrain from making all political jokes yeah right now right I understand but I understand completely but but the issue here of course is that you have it's one thing to say okay I we had a review on a paper that that we know there's a massive biology on the role of cardiolipin and controlling the electron transport chain I mean there's dozens and dozens of papers on this molecular biology I don't believe it well what don't you believe what what part of this massive amount of scientific evidence that you don't believe I'm unfamiliar with cardiolipin therefore it can't be right well that's not the reason to discount the right right and when you write the paper up why would you not cite Peterson's massive compendium of evidence saying mitochondria are abnormal and you say mitochondria sysm is normal well how does that how does that jive with the massive amounts of evidence to say that's not do you what I tried to do in all my writings I never try to ignore an alternative fact to what I'm saying I tried to say there is a fact that I'm not yet completely clear about but I'm not going to ignore it okay you'll find in the scientific literature today in the top journals that they're ignoring massive evidence that don't support their position and that's what's it that's one of the problems and like you know we were saying that this problem in cancer all these top journals cell science nature you know 50% of them up to 50% of the article can't be reproduced in other people's labs this is a crisis in the field what's going on here so you're ignoring massive evidence that doesn't fit your particular mindset so you'll just discount it I don't think it's any different than the geocentric heliocentric model of the of the solar system the Catholic Church refused to believe that the earth was not the center of the solar system despite all the evidence that said it was they just refused to believe it we have the exact same thing in the cancer field you have massive evidence showing that the mitochondria are structurally and functionally dysfunctional I know want to believe it what what what what can you do about that what can you do about that when you have the evidence to show that and you choose not to choose to ignore it is that any different than the heliocentric geocentric system that we had the difference today is that we have 16 yeah I mean it's slightly different right but I don't get no justice it's a fact you have fact yeah and don't forget that yeah but I think the Catholic Church was you know basically relying on a religious framework he has their counter argument of and

[02:31:30] Lursa their belief system was formed by something different I think in the scientific yeah but when Galileo said please look through the telescope to document that Copernicus was right they didn't want to look at the telescope they didn't want to look in the telescope yeah so because it would disrupt their worldview if you've just thought I think I think that's a fair that's a first date yeah I guess again I come back to this through the lens of

[02:31:53] I'd love to know what the experiments are that cuz I view it as a stalemate if you're looking at a body of literature and they're looking at a different body of literature and every time everybody looks at everybody else's body of literature they say well there's an alternative explanation for this then we're making no progress the answer to me is collaborate generate new experiments where you know that's why I think knowing the biology of the disease as well as I think I do and we never can know completely everything because every human being is a different entity you're dealing with a different entity if we can if we can increase overall survival and improve quality of life massively advanced to what we're doing today because we used a strategy based on what we understand to be the biological problem and the results support that then I think that's the advanced and glioblastoma would be a wonderful so speaking of that realistically when do you think that case report of the these four years surviving cohorts will be published I'm going to try it when I talk to him over there I'd like to speak to the very physicians that actually took the data from him from the from

[02:32:57] Pablo because so many patients are in that cohort by just him oh there's just one guy who survived for you well one guy because he rejected no I understand I thought I misunderstood there were several patient well this Andrew Scarborough who initiated a first couple of rayon said no more of this he took no radiation no chemo he's still going he had a stage three astrocytoma which is also quite lethal then there's Alison ganic she's on the on the news she has a website saying that she survived GBM without this I have other key anecdotal reports based on what people have told me one poor guy they wanted to he had no money no insurance so they didn't say he they they didn't want a grade because they wouldn't get any they wouldn't be able to reach any revenue from this guy he he just did the ketogenic diets way back before even I was talking about it and he's still alive 16 years so so there but what was the did they eventually do surgery on him they did surgery but but they didn't do anything else but so what is it so again these are anecdotal but with Pablo we have data we have clear data from him so it's not it's not like we don't have data from him you know we have a lot of things a lot of these things people would say well you can't do this you can't you can't do what what

[02:34:06] I'm asking you to do because it breaks the it violates the standard of care okay the standard of care should never have been written in granite it should be flexible if you have something else that comes along that might be better you think there would be an enthusiasm no we have not seen that we try to get this through the University of

[02:34:24] Pittsburgh to try to do this the advisory board right this what are the IRB the IRB refused okay so they would only might consider metabolic therapy after standard of care fail what's the aim of care fails all the time why don't you try metabolic therapy as an alternative to stay on no we can't do that why well because we can't do that why because we can't do that that means there's inflexibility so we're up against firewalls you have two firewalls after firewalls to try to change the way we continue we're doing all the gene screening mounting to nothing because cancer is not a genetic disease so we have all these firewalls that are preventing us from moving forward the way I think we need to be moving forward for a GBM patient what do they have to lose there was a paper that just came out the other day and from out of

[02:35:10] British Columbia Canada looking at carefully looking a survival for GBM they said is woefully similar to the 1926 Bailey and Cushing paper for chrissake I mean what's going on here you mean in a hundred you almost 100 years John McCain size twelve months that's no different than if he had the cancer then if he had the tumor in 1926 so that tells us we have a serious serious problem and I'm offering an alternative that might be able to change that what is wrong with that why why why would I be attacked for something like this right so you tell me hi I have to know what's going on here why so I go up and

[02:35:46] I say you can't irradiated brain oh you got to do it radio here's my here's my parting shot of advice Tom which is it's worth nothing but your passion is palpable I lost a friend to GBM so the very first person in my life that I ever knew the died of cancer died of a GBM and I was with him almost until the day he died and it was the saddest thing to see the last year of his he lived 18 months and a year of it he didn't he couldn't see so you know you talk about it what does it like to be a 19 year old kid who can't see anything and I look at it's actually one of the saddest stories

[02:36:20] I only want to tell it it's so upsetting anyway I get it I think my advice would be the following whatever you've been doing a the phone rings what the hell perfect time whatever you've been doing is not getting through you got to do something different right so there's there's a quote by someone who's escaping me it's like the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome you got to do something different well I don't know what it is but but I'm just saying try a new approach don't forget a clinical trial done yeah well you know don't forget I'm a professor in an academic non-medical school environment right so we ferret we we designed the preclinical studies that allow the clinicians to then adapt it to their patient population so this is what there's very we're the only one of the only groups in the world that are actually doing bench-to-bedside real research because I have I have tentacles for all these different clinical things it's I get it and all I'm saying is yeah the current your cure you're a budding a resistance and I you've got to go around it you've got it we got to find a way you got to go around it and it might so what was your and enough of these case reports published that it becomes very difficult to ignore and people would say look you know here's a concession we're gonna do surgery immediately and then with metabolic therapy because I have a very hard time saying no surgery no corals no radiation I just don't think that's a judgement call the part of the clinician but I'm saying if you're if you're willing to accept immediate surgery but delaying or postponing radiation and/or corticosteroid therapy until they are necessary either due to medical progression and or symptom control you have a chance and so of course the question then is you you've got to find advocates on the other side of this ledger meaning but the ledger meaning in terms of the thinking about this disease yeah well I agree with you

[02:38:19] I met and so what would you suggest what's the what's the and get what's the roundabout what's your in the field I mean you know I did a great discussion over that scotch that you promised me before we started this podcast we're trying to do this and we need guys like yourself and others to get the word out that there are alternatives and that who's gonna be the bold one and I know

[02:38:45] I'm speaking to now people who want to set up these special clinics special kind of treatment clinics where we can bring everything under the same roof so you don't have to run over this place in that place we take the patients this will happen it will happen because people want to live yeah look I mean that was gonna be my if forced to give one idea now cuz I don't I don't think I know the answer but if I were gonna give you one suggestion it would be do this from a position of pull not push so right now you are pushing this idea what you really want to do is take a page out of the Charlie foundation where they're basically saying look in the end the results were so dramatic that the parents of the children a third of whom now no longer suffer from epilepsy another third of whom have at least a 50% reduction in epilepsy they basically become the voice of reason and I think that's a part of the reason today not the only reason I think the data are so good but I think they're a part of the reason why today the only place in sort of the traditional medical view where a ketogenic diet is viewed as a legitimate first-line therapy for you know recalcitrant disease is in epilepsy now

[02:39:54] I think there will be a day when that expands so what I would I would I would hope is that there's a a network of people family members probably who have lost people with two GBM who would would become the ones that would be your mouthpiece right would become the ones that would say you know what I'm tired of the fact that my loved one died in nine months seemingly in vain and there's this there's this body of evidence which look admittedly at this point is small and is uncertain but nothing in science is certain but they're offering an alternative I want to know that that could be tested you know the thing that it kills me on these private foundations and things their advisory boards are made up of physicians that subscribe to the gene theory of cancer so when the patients and their advocates here's my second piece of advice I know I said I wasn't gonna give you any advice my second piece of advice is you're fighting an uphill battle you don't need to it it could be a genetic disease and a metabolic disease simultaneously I would argue that cancer is when you think about the three diseases the three disease processes that are going to kill all of us sitting right here right now in this room it's gonna be a thorough sclerotic disease neurodegenerative disease or cancer but statistically speaking that's how we're going to die of those three I don't think there's any that are more evolved and complicated than cancer

[02:41:11] I think cancer is by far the hardest of those and therefore now there's where I would disagree twelve good that's too long a discussion point is whether you agree with me or not let's argue the following or let me state the following and or posit the following it's a very evolved condition and therefore you could have genetic pressures metabolic pressures immune pressures that all predispose to it so I don't think it has to be an either/or

[02:41:38] I think metabolic therapies could be valuable whether or not the genetic ideas of cancer are right or wrong so so to me it strikes me as an unnecessary fight right instead the answer should be look we should have medical oncologists radiation oncologist surgical oncologist immuno oncologists and metabolic oncologists period that's now you might argue those radiation oncologists are causing more harm than good that's beyond my paygrade you might be right but you're basically arguing for a fifth branch of oncology which is the medical oncologist above the three that we conventionally have I think the immuno oncologist is coming into his or her own right now I don't think it's worth arguing about whether it's a genetic disease or metabolic disease it's just a goddamn hard disease and we need every therapy imaginable and sometimes that will be doing things that are completely new as you've proposed so anyway that's on that note I want to thank you very much for your generosity of time and and just your passion for this and and and sort of how tirelessly you've worked on this I mean I've this is only our first time meeting today Tom but I've been familiar with your work for probably eight years now which is a small fraction of the amount of time you've put into this DOM is a very close friend and so through DOM and through Bob I've learned a lot more about your work and I know that a lot of people listening to this are going to be rooting for you to do this is there anything that someone who's listening to this who's got a loved one who's either died of GBM or has GBM that they can do to increase the chances that either others can get the types of therapies you're talking about in clinical trials or that their loved ones themselves can what what else can we do I mean in my position as a researcher who does the preclinical studies I mean we get support from

[02:43:22] Travis from foundation you know the metabolic therapy foundation and that's what keeps our program going and that's what tells us what we think should work really well or what might not work to help these people get the outcome that they want which is mm-hmm high quality of life and living a lot longer so we that's what that's my big thing is is that and as we can identify those and where do you do that you need funds for that the federal government is mostly like what gene is involved so this is where it comes back to the same problem again you don't get funding for things that actually can really work versus studying the disease let's look at the minimum let's study the disease more we don't need it we know we have a pathway but is there an easy path for patients who want to make financial contributions to the lab is it through a foundation that there's two ways to do it you could either do it through the foundation because we have a continual grant set up through single cost single cure found okay so we'll link to that make sure that people know what that and also at

[02:44:21] Boston College it like if you want to fund the work directly through the University okay it has to be through a very specific statement okay otherwise the university will absorb it absorb some of the other funds so basically that's the way now that what we do then is our me a data are immediately given to the clinical people who then put it on their patients and then feed me back and say this is working well or we don't think this is doing as well as we should wanted you tweaked it in this direction so I work with the physicians directly and I give them the pre clinical information they feed me back and see how it's working sometimes it works a hell of a lot better in the human than the mouse so let's be sure that we have from you any and all means that people who are passionate about this interested in this either personally or through sort of indirect experience can can support this work and and more importantly I think create maybe a bit of a groundswell that puts a little bit of pressure on the IR B's to say look this is you know GBM is as high-stakes as it gets right it's the type of cancer that gives cancer a bad name and maybe this is one area where we have to increase our appetite for risk in clinical trials I agree with that and I think that this is a disease that we think we can make major advances in and why not want to give it a shot because it's not going to hurt anybody it's not gonna accelerate their demise it's only good well I mean I would disagree with that only to in terms of a talking point to say it could we don't know but that's the that's the point of risk right I mean when the outcome is so asymmetrically bad which is uniform death yeah in in an accelerated fashion we have to be willing to take the risk of potentially doing worse than that I don't think that's the case understood but but I think the way we talk about this when we talk about this as though there's no risk I think that gives I think that reduces our credibility of with people who say well how can you say well well no we're any any open cranial surgery produces risk yeah that's and that's gonna be a part of every of all the all what we're doing well the point is I you know Bob's heard me rail on this many a time the the note this is a sort of idiotic idea of a

[02:46:27] Hippocratic oath which is technically he didn't even say it and it's such a dumb thing anyway do no harm I mean you you couldn't do any good if you weren't at least willing to do some harm no one goes into it do it wanting to do harm but anyway this has been really exciting and I and I really appreciate your your time and your insights and above all else the work you've done so thank you Tom thank you you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter thea MD com what's a nerd Safari you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
