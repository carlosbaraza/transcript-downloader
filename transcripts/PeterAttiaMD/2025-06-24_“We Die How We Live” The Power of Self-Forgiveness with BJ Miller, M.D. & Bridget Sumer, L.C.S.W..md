This clip is from episode  354 – What the dying can teach us about living well: lessons on life and reflections on mortality | BJ Miller, M.D. and Bridget Sumser, L.C.S.W.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Dismantling the “Invader” Myth – Death is reframed not as something that attacks us, but as a natural, built-in process of the body
- The Signs of Approaching Death – From fatigue and immobility to appetite loss and digestive shutdown, the physical signs of decline are laid out
- Why Food & Fluid Can Hurt – Feeding and hydration during the dying process can cause harm when the body is no longer able to process them
- Delirium at the End of Life – Mental confusion, especially hypoactive delirium, is common but often misunderstood by family and caregivers
-  Interpretation vs. Reality – Final moments are complex, subjective, and not always filled with closure—interpretations should be held lightly

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of the provided transcript segment:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. BJ Miller and Bridget Sumer discussing the process of death, particularly focusing on the medical and psychological aspects of end-of-life care. The conversation explores how the body naturally shuts down, the role of delirium in dying patients, and the importance of understanding these processes for both medical professionals and family members.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Approximately 80% of deaths occur from chronic illness rather than sudden events [00:03:00]
- About 50% of myocardial infarctions are fatal [00:00:00]
- Two types of delirium discussed:
  * Hyperactive delirium (obvious, agitated) [00:06:04]
  * Hypoactive delirium (more subtle, common at end of life) [00:06:28]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Don't force food or fluids when body is naturally shutting down [00:04:18]
- Understand that delirium statements shouldn't be taken literally [00:07:02]

4. **Notable Quotes**:
"There's nothing wrong with you for dying. This is the way it's supposed to go." [00:02:00]
"Bodies die, living things die... it's not some foreign invader." [00:01:38]

5. **Clinical Signs of Approaching Death**:
- Increased sleep/bed rest (>50% of day) [00:03:00]
- Decreased interest in food and fluids [00:04:18]
- Changes in mental status and orientation [00:05:23]
- Progressive fatigue [00:03:00]

6. **Medical Management Considerations**:
- Traditional approach: Using antipsychotics (haloperidol, thorazine) for delirium [00:12:00]
- Modern perspective: More selective use of medication for delirium, considering individual preferences [00:12:50]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific physiological markers of imminent death?
2. How do different chronic conditions affect the death process?
3. What are best practices for managing end-of-life delirium?

The transcript focuses mainly on the medical and psychological aspects of death, with particular emphasis on delirium and natural body processes. Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect of this analysis?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] On this podcast, we talk a lot about causes of death, right? People who listen to me are very familiar with the four horsemen and we know about cardiovascular disease and we know about cancer and we know about neurodeenerative disease and we can talk forever about these things but we don't really talk about the very very end perhaps with the exception of a fatal myioardial infarction. Um and about 50% of MIS are fatal. Um, but about 50% are not and they're just setting you up for maybe heart failure or something else.

[00:00:37] So, as difficult as it is, I'd love for you to sort of explain the mechanics of of death of and we can start with the more common cause of death, which is cardiopulmonary death. We could talk about brain death after, but I' I'd love for both of you to sort of describe what's happening both medically, socially, cognitively, like to the to the individual through that process.

[00:01:00] Peter, do you mean like the the the moments leading to the death, the as the body shutting down? Yeah. In those final hours, what is really happening? What does it mean to die of cancer? Right. like, well, you know, I think for many people it's a very foreign idea that this woman had breast cancer. Okay, there were cells in her breast that all of a sudden acquired mutations. Those cells escaped from her breast and went to other parts of her body, but there's still a bit of a disconnect. Why did that why did the invasion of those cells to her bones and her lungs end her life?

[00:01:38] One thing to get right out of the gates here is bodies die, living things die. It's uh I think a lot of us absorb a notion of death that it's some foreign invader or something that comes out of the woods and grabs us and otherwise I was just fine and then not. Um no. Um, and as you know better than any uh of us that there are all sorts of things we can do to promote life and there are a lot of ways we're wired to to hang on to life and to run from anything that's a threat to us. Those are all true and all natural. Um, but included on the list of natural things that we do is die. So I I you know it is that's what a body is supposed to do. I just want to get that clear. There's nothing wrong with you for dying. This is the way it's supposed to go. So your body knows how to do this. So let's talk about what the body knows how to do. I mean in general uh depending on the cause of death whether the pathway might be cancer as you're mentioning or heart disease or neurodeenerative diseases there's a final common pathway of a body kind of shutting down and it tends to shut down by organ system you know and it doesn't follow a neat and tidy pathway. It can happen kind of spontaneously in a kind of a moment. They're here and then they're gone. But very often, especially these days, most of us, like 80 plus percent of us, will die of chronic illness. We will meet the thing that eventuates our death well in advance of the death. Often times, if we're trying to prognosticate, help a person or family get a sense of how much time is left. Um, we're looking at things like, are they in and out of bed, you know, much? are they getting up and out of bed? So, if you're asleep on the couch or in the bed 50% of the day, you know, um and if that's sort of a progressive process, more and more fatigue, more and more tired, that usually in the context of chronic illness tells us we're heading towards the end. Um an interest in food and fluid is a big one. So, a body trying to die, a GI tract that's on its way to shutting down will stop sending hunger signals. And this is a big one for the audience to hear because a lot of us, you know, food equals nutrition equals nourishment equals life. So, if we see someone we love or ourselves not eating, the impulse would be, well, put some food into us. That's life. We don't want someone to starve to death is often what we do. And also love, right? That's how we show our care. And exactly symbolically the act of feeding another is you know the nourishment the love to your point

[00:04:18] Bridget that comes with that there's so much around food but then before we cut over to bridge to explain more that's that good piece of the puzzle that you know the body again is sending you a signal don't put food in me because it will hurt if a gut is not able to process the food it sits in place and can cause pain. Same with fluids. If we're forcing fluid into a body that's trying to die, that fluid will pull and cause trouble. So the judgment of call when to push the food and fluid and when not is up to really a dialogue and a sort of a song and response with the patient. Once you know, you might try a little bit of fluid and if that ends up in their lung or ends up swelling, then we pull back. But back to your question, so as a body's trying to die, it will stop sending signals for that food and fluid. And that's to be generally respected, not pushed past. Um, mental status. So, people often get really fuzzy in their thinking or all uh and delirium is very common. Um, so often times they'll they'll be disoriented.

[00:05:23] Think it's 1912 and they're in a forest somewhere when they're in a hospital bed. Um, so that's very common. And BJ, delirium is not uncommon in the hospital. A lot of times with otherwise very healthy patients who are in the hospital to get surgery, uh the loss of circadian rhythm, the use of narcotics and other medications can easily induce delirium in a person who's otherwise not going to die. Y is this a different form of delirium? And and what is really underpinning it? I don't know that it's a different form of delirium per se. Um you know ultimately it's a similar pathway and that it looks the same. So you can have a hyperactive delirium which are very easy to spot.

[00:06:04] Someone's jumping up and down under bed and going kind of nuts and acting in a way that's not comporting with the context of their sitting in a hospital bed. So hyperactive delirium can be easier to spot. Very often it's hypoactive delirium which is we often miss especially in the hospital setting. Might just be a little tangential thinking or not quite clear on what day it is. Something that's not so obvious and very often the person's just silent.

[00:06:28] And that's more often the case, I'd say, at the end of life. It's more likely to be a hypoactive delirium. And so it may be hard to spot and the person's been sleeping a lot anyway. So you might not you might miss it. But one reason to bring it up um is because if you if you don't know what to look for, I think a lot of family members and and loved ones will be at that at the bed, you know, trying to eek out every last moment with this person and looking for clues about what's going on for them and last relational moments and exchanges.

[00:07:02] And very often I've heard from a lot of people reports of well gosh I my husband never said a mean word to me in our 50 years of marriage and I've been traumatized for the last two years since he died because those last words to me were this vulgar something or other and or he told me that he to get out of his you some harsh comment and oh I I one of those big takeaways for your audience just please keep delirium in mind because what also means is a person who is delirious is not you cannot they are not themselves. So whatever they're saying you you really cannot take it literally. You really cannot take it literally. So that poor woman that was suffering for you know if someone had told her about delirium then she would have understood she took it very literally and was suffering immensely.

[00:07:56] Um so anyway that's a note about delirium. It does feel like an important moment to pause just to note a couple of things which is you know delirium at the end of life we take as seriously as we would in a more acute setting where someone's in the ICU with expectation to recover and we think about environmental factors that influence delirium like lighting and noise and interruptions right because if we can minimize delirium we want to want to want to treat it and care for it I think the other thing about this space is that we enter into the like riched and nuanced and complicated space of interpretation and the meaning that's being made around what's happening. Right? So, in that story, someone's I was sitting at a bedside once with two daughters and their mom was dying and she had been mostly quiet um hadn't really talked in a couple of days and um we're sitting there talking about her and telling stories and the her kids are telling me about her and she opens one eye and she kind of sits up and she says to her daughter, "I love your jacket."

[00:09:02] And I looked at the daughter and the daughter just bursts into tears. And you know, I'm sitting there thinking like, "Oh, this is so nice." Like, mom gives a like, I'm expecting something positive. And the daughter's like, "She's never complimented my clothes before. If anything, she always looked at my at my dress in this um critical eye like, "This is so off, you know?" And I think that could be one of those projections that we're going to get to the end and dad's going to say, Mom's going to say the thing that we never heard them say, and they may. and that might not feel good, right? So, it's it's complicated and so interpersonal and personal and subjective and you know, it's one of the reason why two of us being here together and why this work is done often in teams because we could both be in the room with the same person and have very different kind of hits or interpretations around what's happening, what's most important in the room, what needs to be tended to.

[00:10:08] God, but there's so much to say about this stuff and that delirium thing. I mean, there's a big on this point of altered consciousness and what people are saying and what's coming out of people. It's also true that deep dark secrets can sometimes get revealed. That's also true. But so much needs to be interpreted and it's therefore held lightly and because you don't there these are final moments you may never get the clarity of what mom or dad or that person actually meant in that comment which is another trick to holding death in our living is to hold it lightly because we keep we will find ourselves wanting to apply a story of meaning on all of this stuff as a humans what what we do but one of the great lessons around this work is just, you know, just to hold that carefully and lightly. It's not always what we think it is. Um, and on that note of delirium to I I will say as a medical person, I was taught that delirium is inherently a kind of suffering that it's uncomfortable that that to be confused to be disoriented is itself uncomfortable and it's certainly problematic for the loved ones. So we always medicated it with antiscychotics, haloparidol and others. just thorazine just shut it down. I will say my own arc of my career and as I've gotten as I've sort of diluted the medical piece with other ways of thinking um I'm not so quick to shut that down. Um there may be something either vital happening for that person in the bed to express whatever's in there. Um it may be something that's helpful for the person to hear. I gave you the counterpoint that it's hurtful for a loved one to hear it in a decontextualized way. But I think one of the meta messages here is dying um it doesn't can't always be shouldn't perhaps maybe to use that hard word um be so tidy and um immaculate and clean and you know perfect. I think I want to disabuse I think we'd both like to disabuse that notion of uh that that's a good good death. Um so a quiet death a person. So I I increasingly would not medicate a delirium unless I had a conversation. If you were my patient I'd say Peter hey you know there might be moments where you can get a little confused etc. And if that happens would you rather you know maybe there's an opportunity for me to ask you would you like us to kind of heir on the side of medicating that and help you sleep through it? you know, or talk to family about that. But the bottom line here is it's not such a onetoone thing. When we see this, that means suffering. That means medication. It's much more mysterious than that.
