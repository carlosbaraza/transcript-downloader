## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com

[00:00:41] welcome to this week's episode of the drive my guest this week is one of my dearest friends dr. Paul Conti Paul is a brilliant psychiatrist in fact I often refer to him as the single best psychiatrist I've ever come in contact with and I've met some many very sharp people over the years I've long wanted to have Paul on the podcast I've always wanted to interview Paul just in general because there's not that many people who

[00:01:09] I find myself having discussions with and I think to myself how can this discussion be shared with others and throughout this interview you'll hear us even comment to that effect which is God it's almost like we're not even talking in front of microphones this is exactly the kind of conversation we find ourselves having so often Paul's a very special person he doesn't get into great detail but his life has been shaped by a number of really really tragic events a couple of which he alludes to here many of which he does not in fact some of the most tragic events in Paul's life he does not allude to but I think the point that comes across here is that Paul is one of the most empathetic kind giving individuals and his understanding of the human condition is is really unparalleled so in keeping with one of the general themes here which is longevity of which healthspan and Happiness are important components we go really deep on this topic we talk about what is meant by trauma many people just think of trauma as you know you got hit by a car or something like that but we get really into emotional trauma we talk a lot about shame which is the result of trauma and what it ends up doing we talk a lot about depression suicide and a number of other topics that are closely related to this I I do think at times this is a little bit heavy but you know we really don't get into any of the technical stuff that I thought we might get into and in large part just because I think there was so much to talk about without getting into the neurobiology I I do think that Paul and I will need to sit down again in the future and get a lot deeper on some of those other topics that I also thought you know would be interesting and I suspect a number of you will find very interesting so again this is not a deep podcast from a technical standpoint though we do get into some of the heavier stuff unfortunately Paul is not someone you're really gonna find much about on social media Paul is someone whom can be contacted through his office of course and we'll provide that contact information for the folks who do want to reach out to his office but the good news is Paul is really considering writing a book and after we finished recording this podcast we spent another 20 minutes talking about the book he wants to write and the the gist of it is the book is exactly about the stuff we talked about today so I couldn't be more encouraging of Paul doing this and I think that the world will be a better place for that so I hope you enjoy this episode half as much as I enjoyed listening to Paul talk about all of these things and I think almost anybody will find something of a great value in this episode [Music] hey Paul how are you around I'm doing well Peter thank you for having me you're a super trooper here you have laryngitis I do indeed have laryngitis I am persevering and I appreciate your patience in persevering with me well luckily I guess luckily is the wrong word but most people here don't know what you sound like normally so they probably won't even know that you're that I'm only bringing it up because I I know you're straining a lot to speak but this is such an important topic we didn't really want to put it off between the two of us were so busy even though we're in New York often that we could both have a night when we don't have something else to do I think makes this worth it so thank you it's my pleasure and even though I sound like the

[00:04:25] Godfather I'm still gonna do my best to come across as open and honest in a way that's not quite consistent with the Godfather although you did pull one old-school Italian trick a moment ago which was as I as you came in my apartment you beeline for the kitchen what did you do with the aspirin I gargled with hot water and aspirin just like my grandmother told me to do she gets credit if people can understand me credit goes to my grandmother alright so there you have it your first old Italian old-school trick on what they do with laryngitis to take some boiling water smash some baby aspirin into it and gargle it they didn't teach us that in medical school but I'm still doing it alright so speaking of medical school you and I have now known each other for 21 years amazing yeah almost exactly 21 years and I think the relationship that you me and the other five coconuts had in our med school class the seven of us probably in some ways really annoyed most of our med school classmates because we were we became close like within the first week of school and never separated we were just we were an inseparable group of knuckleheads that I strongly agree that that annoyed people yes yeah but we're fortunate and I feel blessed to have met all of you guys and in particular probably all of the seven of us now I think you and I by far spend the most time together because so much of our work clinically overlaps

[00:05:47] I don't want to go deep so soon but I think I feel like I have to so I'll never forget the first day we met all med students on day one are sort of nervously talking about why they're here and blah blah blah and truthfully most med students don't really know what they be when they grow up they have sort of figured out they want to be doctors and that's about it but there were some of us that knew I wasn't really one of them

[00:06:09] I kind of knew I wanted to do something in oncology I thought at the time pediatric oncology one of our buddies decided on day one he was a plastic surgeon and that is exactly what he is today you said the most interesting thing I'd ever heard which was that you wanted to be a psychiatrist and I just remember thinking I didn't know people went to med school to become psychiatrists I thought that was sort of a lifestyle choice that they made later on or something like that but but you were adamant about it why was that the case I think it represented a search for truth

[00:06:39] I think it represented a search for truth and probably a response to some of the difficult things in my life and to a lot of the dissatisfaction that I was feeling with achievement with my personal life my professional life from top to bottom there was a sense of wanting to understand things more and I think it's interesting you know you talk about how quickly you know this group of us became really fast friends and I think there was a commonality there that we'd all had some life experience and in different ways as we came to learn we'd all really been through a lot and I think we were coming into medical school searching for something and trying to find that something for ourselves through doing things that are good for other people and and I understand that the ideas that's why people go to medical school and I'm not saying other people weren't doing that right but we'd all been through a fair amount and I think it's the suffering component that drove the ability to maybe be open and honest earlier with one another and to form bonds that were based upon the searching that we were all doing that drove all of us right to change career to do something different than what we might have thought we were doing as a response to an internal need and I think ultimately as a response to trauma it's interesting you remember Pike I mean I always knew this but I guess I sort of forgot until you reprime dit none of us were pre-meds and all of us were a little older we were all a couple years older because we'd all in some cases like you know and

[00:08:15] Bob case I mean Christ he'd been a mountaineering instructor for a decade or something like that you know zolly had been in the Army for four years same with Jace and all these guys sorry to be calling all our boys out here on the show but yeah none of us had just come through right right and you know certainly people can go through a lot by the time they're you know out of infancy right so it's not as if people need to be out of school do different things in order to really gain life experience but

[00:08:45] I think the choices that that each of us made were choices that came from a place of drive and ambition but ultimately that were colored by very personal things and I think led each of us to really want something more and I think we came to medical school in part to find that and and I don't think that there's a distinction between what are the things that we do for other people and the things that we do for ourselves

[00:09:10] I think that that's a false dichotomy that follows through sort of Western logic that things have to be one thing or another and I think often the best things that we do for others we do in a in a search for some healing or soothing in ourselves and I think that that was part and parcel of all of us was part of parcel of many people that you and I went to medical school with trained with but I think it's what made the seven of us fast friends and I think it's why there's there's remained a strong bond in part because that searching and that desire to do for self through doing for others I think really hasn't changed so what were you doing before medical school in other words you studied you were an undergrad and you went to Penn you studied math and then you can you move to New York you were working in finance right yeah i minored in math I majored in political science and I studied a lot of history and a lot of literature and what I didn't realize was that the attraction to me of everything that I was studying was was was really the the allure of people you know I studied World War two a lot and for a while I thought I wanted to go to grad school and be a world war ii history-- and at some point I realized what fascinated me was the the people right the the people who are driving the action bad or otherwise you know the people who are caught in the crossfire as you know the millions of people who were part of that event to end and what I realized over time was it that there was a commonality of drive about understanding what was leading people to do things or how people were responding to things and oddly enough it may seem odd but I think math is kind of part of that too right that that there are things that happen inside of people and there are aspects of our choice our choices that we design with a certain linearity but ultimately you know the complex functions in all of us that make things that we might think are predictable very unpredictable and and I only kind of realized that in retrospect I mean when I graduated from school I really wanted a good job and I came in 1991 and there was a little bit of an economic downturn and I was fortunate to get a job with a good consulting firm and you know I just thought okay that's where I'm gonna go you know that I'm gonna have this business career and if it's with my father having been entrepreneurial and had a business career and I just thought like okay that's for me and I'm gonna make my way doing that so then what changed what changed is it really really did not make me happy and I say that with no criticism or aspersion whatsoever two people for whom it doesn't make happy but there was something very much missing from it for me and and I think that was the intensity of human interaction and so the intensity of human struggle and what

[00:11:55] I found is you know I I did that for four years and I took some time in the middle and I traveled for for several months because I was kind of trying to figure something out like why am I not happy right and I came back and I took a better job with the same company right so as time went on you know I had more authority I was making more money I was doing more interesting things and I was less happy and it really became quite stark to me that um unless I was delving into like the intensity of what's going on inside of people I wasn't going to be happy and I think you know what I didn't really fully realized was that that was going to be a way of kind of delving into the things going on inside of me and

[00:12:36] I mean as you know in you and I've talked about many many times there were some traumatic things that happened during that time that really just brought to the fore to me I want to understand better and I want to be able to help soothe things in other people and what I didn't realize at the time was that wasn't a way of saying oh I'll be selfless and you know an altruistic right and like that's gonna save the day for me but but really you know that also what I didn't realize at the time was the mirror that it would put up that would allow me to like just get access to help that I did not before be open and communicative and understand myself in ways that it wasn't necessarily programmed to do right I mean I was programmed to like work hard achieve not be weak right and that inability to express right even to myself let alone to other people you know was ultimately draining the life from me and actually did you know drain the life in terms of like actual death from some people around me that I much cared about and in some ways I was rebelling away rebelling against that way of being in the world and that way of teaching people to be in the world and I had some I think inkling of understanding of that but it more came through anger and and rejection of things and it came through an understanding through the lens of compassion that you know we've kind of structured our society in a way that makes it very very difficult to live in that I think you're alluding to obviously something I know is very difficult and we've talked about it a lot I don't know that we need to necessarily go into great detail here but in the span of a year if I recall you lost your brother and your best friend yeah my my brother my brother died by suicide and about a year later one of my closest friends are the same at a close group of friends growing up with sort of like we had in medical school but there were a group of us and one of those very very close friends from childhood also died and he didn't die by suicide but there was sort of that same kind of desperate recklessness that I saw this common root in those two deaths and you know they confuse me and and infuriated me and you know it made me feel very helpless and and vulnerable and wanting to be able to understand better and to kind of fight against this thing that made it so hard for people to like to get help right and to be vulnerable and that was really the commonality is like both of the people who died had real and significant needs inside of them that came about naturally right like something you one would never criticize a person for having those needs right over those struggles but there just wasn't a venue of of getting real acknowledgement and help for any of that so that kind of silent bravado and silent struggle you know became very real to me that like oh that leads to death right I mean it doesn't all the time leads to death but at least a death no way more often than is even remotely acceptable I mean I think as we've discussed it sometimes it can lead to death immediately like in these cases and sometimes it can lead to a functional death which is you're still technically alive you know you still respire but you're effectively dead in many ways that's probably the more endemic more sinister more destructive over the long term given its sheer volume problem right oh absolutely I think and the deaths that we see in front of us is like actually okay that person is not breathing anymore are there a viscerally moving hallmark of what is so pervasive in our society and and I do think I thought I didn't understand that then that in many ways the way our society is structured and the way our Metra sees of achievement our structured really beckons us to death in life to losing touch with the basics of our own value system and essentially to incessant striving and not incessant striving to achieve although we may see it that way but incessant striving to not pause and to not feel the vulnerability that I think is so pervasive now I mean even in the twenty years you know since we went to medical school I mean you think about how pervasive media is right I mean how there's just marker after marker after marker after marker that says that you're not good enough you don't have enough you're too vulnerable you know there could be terrorist attack any time your kids could be killed we could die I mean it's one stimulus after another that tells us not to stop and to really value ourselves by the things that we really value we get through med school and true to your word you get a psychiatry residency spot you decide to stay at Stanford in part because your wife was still your soon-to-be wife you guys were married yet but your girlfriend was a couple years behind us in med school and you end up spending half your time at Stanford and then your wife matches at Harvard so you go and finish your residency at Harvard so whenever I'm telling patients about you and I'm probably bastardizing all of my knowledge which is so limited on this field but I say you know one of the things about Paul that's so unique is you did half of his training at Stanford which is probably one of the foremost institutions when it comes to understanding the neurobiology and the pharmaco neurobiology and the pharmacology of psychiatry and then does the other half at Harvard which is sort of a more old school but you know a place that specializes so much in the in the psychotherapy is that an active I am

[00:18:23] I'm making that up when I say because I've just decided to take the liberty and say that about you it sounds good so please keep saying it no no actually I think that there is truth to that and there's even more there's more truth to that the longer I get from it and the more I reflect on it I I think that you know I am NOT a very positive or hopeful person about the state of the field that

[00:18:45] I'm in which I think does not broadly enough train people in brain biology not just in the use of medicines but in what those medicines actually do and on a very real level what are those medicines doing as interventions in the brain in the many many systems of the brain in the cascade of effects that occur in the brain and we don't think about structural neurobiology we don't think about neuro chemistry in general so there's that part of the field that often gets ignored and then the other side is the psychology there has been a debate of should psychiatrists still be trained in psychotherapy and I see this come up and and I just think that it's [ __ ] we're putting it crazy to consider having people that are that are schlepping medicines to other people that aren't thinking about what it's like to really try and understand someone and what are the paradigms of understanding other humans right the kind of things that are valid and have a scientific basis for them but that are not hardcore brain biology and I was very very fortunate to learn so much neurobiology at Stanford and to have that integrated into my training but when I got to Harvard I was struck by that several very like prominent influential people there who were influential over like for example whether I graduated right we're like really shocked at how much brain biology

[00:20:13] I knew and really shocked at how much psychology I didn't know and even though I had sought out some of this on my own being in a place that was kind of steeped in an older analytic tradition really helped me kind of embrace this belief that understanding psychology and certainly from the perspective of what's psychodynamic right the things that influence and motivate us that are in our unconscious you know the gigantic part of the iceberg that's underneath the water but that is most deterministic of our behaviors and our choices and our feelings and being able to integrate that with the brain biology upon which it rests I think is I think it's the way to at least try and have the most broad set of abilities to try and help people and in some ways it was very fortuitous for me to split my time between those two places and to find a couple very very good people who took it upon themselves to try and teach me in a short period of time what maybe I should have learned over longer period of time when those of us who are not trained in this discipline think back to you know our psych 101 class or something as undergrads in college you you get introduced to all of the the luminaries in the field and one of the things I still remember was sort of the ego super-ego stuff how much of that stuff is still relevant today I mean even sometimes when you and I talk we still and when we talk about personal things this idea of ego still comes up I mean you and I both completely separate to all of this discussion because we won't go down this path it just takes too long but we share an enormous interest in psychedelics and the promise that they hold for people and of course one of the hallmarks of this is dissolution of ego so when you think about what what someone like me or someone who's listening to this who doesn't have the training thinks at a very crude level of you know the idiots till apply to how you think about these problems I think it applies tremendous like on a foundational level and the problems we often run into are often about semantics and even among like experienced psychiatrists the definition of words and terms can obscure any understanding so for example in the the Freudian concept of the ego it's it's much more the whole self it's the part of self that one can bring in a conscious way to bear on the questions and issues at hand it's that it's the part of self that can mediate between the different poles right so that it may be about gratification the super-ego may be about what you should or shouldn't do but ideally it's the ego the whole self that pulls that together and that's a very different use of the term ego then how it often is used these days where ego is a sense of self that essentially indicates a defense mechanism and the idea of dissolution of the ego through the use of psychedelics is not a dissolution of the classic psychodynamic or Freudian ego which is like the whole self at its most poised and comprehensively aware and empowered it's more the dissolution of ego as defense that we we build up over time I think a shocking number of defense mechanisms that serve us well at the time but that ultimately are an unhealthy part of the foundation that then gets built upon so I've broken a sense of insecurity in childhood and

[00:23:38] I'm not good enough and I need to achieve more and I need to please people you know we build so much around that that defines us in a certain way for example right that tells us that we must be perfect and we may beat up on ourselves if we're less than perfect because that's how we're gonna make ourselves perfect right and then you can think of all the things that build on top of that which could be maladaptive friendships maladaptive romantic relationships around that maladaptive career choices right there's so much that we can build on top of that and then in a very strong sense it's almost as if like the true us right the

[00:24:13] Freudian ego is surrounded by you know ninety story high walls that are built to protect us but actually protect us from real connection with self and others and real understanding and and some of what the psychedelics it seems through the the phenomenology the people's experiences the research right when you put all of that together and you look at it with the brain imaging and and the knowledge we have about brain biology is is in an amazing way they can take down those defenses which if not done in you know a therapeutic and a controlled setting obviously can be dangerous but in the right setting opens one up to an experience of self and an experience of the truth of self that is no longer walled off by all of these unhealthy defenses so I mean it's a long answer to the question but yes what's going on in our unconscious what's going on deep in our brain the things that were not consciously aware of are so deeply impactful so Freud certainly didn't get everything right but but this concept of the unconscious pulls on us and the ability to integrate those things in a healthy ego that can actually decide and choose I think is as relevant or more so than ever when there's so many pulls away from often city of the self and then the the hope of psychotherapy just shared human experience and psychedelics is to be able to take those defenses down so we can have an experience of self that reflects who we truly are which the vast majority of the time involves acknowledgement of the things that were ashamed of the vulnerabilities the things that we've ensured ourselves against which are often the very things that that keep us away from happiness you know I'm uh as you know I'm writing a book now and it's not a particularly easy thing to do I think it's probably hard even for someone who's a natural writer but first certainly for someone like me it's very difficult and I'm toying with a chapter that I've been really really flailing with for the past three weeks it may not end up in the book because I just don't know if how to how to write it but it's a chapter that centers around the experience I had in

[00:26:28] Kentucky which might seem like an obscure thing to write about in a book about longevity but of course as I've become very you know clear on lately I don't think all of this obsession with longevity and living longer and living better means a lick if you're miserable and so much of our misery is self-imposed and I think obviously I you are the reason I went there I would never have done what was required to go through that experience were it not for you insisting on it and frankly even had you insisted on it you know at a different time without the confluence of events that led to it I probably could never have done that because the the vulnerability that's required to do and to go there and you even put me in touch with another patient who you would sent who had gone again the thing that amazed me about that was how long I had lived my life never even considering the idea that there can be a child that gets wounded that wounded child develops an adoptive child and sometimes that adopted child is the one that shows up in the adult body and not as opposed to a functional adult yes yes and I guess I just sort of feel like I'm neo in the matrix and after I've gone through this whole experience I see my life in a totally different way and I realize oh my god like all of that achievement all of that perfectionism all of those things I was chasing it's basically a kid trying to protect you and I've certainly not held out any hope that it's gonna be ever fully resolved I mean I'm not I don't know maybe I'm just too pessimistic it's going to get better I'm absolutely confident because it has gotten better but it just strikes me is so hardwired that it kind of makes me wonder like is this something that's getting worse or is this something that has always existed in our civilizations in our societies and only now because so many of our other needs are being met you know none of us that are listen if you're listening to this podcast you're probably not worried about where your next meal is gonna come from you're probably not worried about a plague you're probably not worried about hopefully you're not worried about a civil war or something like that so is it just that our basic needs you know of the Maslow's hierarchy of needs they've been met and so now we we have the quote-unquote luxury of worrying about self-actualization and and and what does happiness mean and what does it mean to be fulfilled in content that we're now realizing this or do you think there are things that are actually making it worse today and there are more wounded kids out there and more adults that are effectively nothing more than adoptive kids it's such a fascinating question and I mean of course I don't know the answer but I do suspect that we are making it worse for ourselves in ways that we haven't intended so of course

[00:29:23] I'm all for a preachy meaning like we are numbing ours we'd have more nuttin agents to numb and soothe ourselves know we've made more opportunity for ourselves in certain ways right and that opportunity is a wonderful thing in many ways but every good thing has its potential for a downside and something that can work against or even negate the good thing so for example as far as I know for generations you know the people in my family lived you know up in the hills of central Italy and and as far as I can tell most of them are Shepherds right and we could look at that and say look there's there's there's a limitation to what they could achieve and how fortunate am i that people sailed across the Atlantic and now I go to college and I have a business career and then I go back to school and I take undergraduate classes and I apply to medical school after all of that and I get in and you did like you could list forever the additional opportunities that I have that people didn't have before and that's wonderful and I and I certainly would not argue against opportunity right but it also brings greater opportunity to run away from the things that plague us so for example you and I and probably many many if not most of the people listening to this podcast are driven to be powerful so okay some of the motivation for what

[00:30:48] I do or what you do is intellectual curiosity the desire to help others a desire to learn about self right but a significant aspect of the strength of the fuel in the tank right is running from something right it's running from vulnerability because there's more opportunity there are higher expectations and I think there were high expectations for both of us not that I am arguing against you know the fact that our families instilled in us conscientiousness and ambition but I think we internalize that as must be perfect must achieve more like when is in the Gwen is enough enough and it becomes very very unclear and it becomes very easy to run from things and you know it's that that I think that the modern world doesn't actually help us define what we are striving for so more striving more power whatever that means right it could be money it could mean prestige and titles influence whatever it means like more that by definition becomes better and we live in a world that constantly reminds us of our vulnerability so there's never a time I mean my guess is having spent time you know in places where like people are Shepherds right and people do have these simpler lives and sure they don't have the opportunities we have but there are ways that I often can see them at the end of the day feel a sense that the day is over and that what the day's exigencies are over the day's ambitions are over right there like things are okay and it's time to rest and there'll be tomorrow and I think most of us don't have that feeling you know most of my life when I fall asleep I'm exhausted and I have a sense that well now I need to sleep for a little bit so that I can get up and strive more and I don't think there's any way if we're honest with ourselves that we can frame that as oh that's a drive to something now that's a drive away from something right and it's running away from ourselves and it's running away from our problems and we don't even know what those problems are and the fact that as you know I have a pretty diverse practice right there that like really I think spans the spectrum of psychiatric and neuropsychiatric things and I absolutely believe and I've come to believe more and more and more and more as time goes on that 80% of what I treat is trauma 80% of what ails me 80% of what ails you 80% of what ails the world around us is all trauma there's another 20% that might be a head injury schizophrenia you know the complications of physical injuries biological determinants of addiction I mean but but none of those things even those things that that seem and are very biologically determined are free of the impact of trauma and the rest of it I think is purely trauma its manifestation is anxiety depression panic attacks choices to abuse substances choices to do things that are unhealthy whether it's overeating or it's cutting or it's gambling or whatever it is that we're doing so much of that is driven by trauma and and I think that you know yes it's an opinion right it's not something I can prove that you can prove like you know come a problem right but I think if you really look at it and you look at what's going on at the root of what ails people I think it becomes self-evident that I think there actually is a way of proving that which is just look at what's really going on in people instead of categorizing them use a dsm-5 that's a half a city block long that just looks to like look if we flip through it I don't know how many diagnoses you and I would have between us right because it's designed to capture everybody multiple times over but categorizing what else somebody and putting a number on it is not understanding them that is not synonymous with understanding them this is the tragedy of your profession yes is that's the direction it's going in it's it's it's designed to categorical if you categorize something you can work on it right and then you can get 20 bucks for through insurance and you haven't actually understood people I think that both the practitioners in my field and the people who come to care deserve better than what the field gives them and we've stepped away from really trying to understand people and no I'll give you an anecdote I was very very fortunate when I was interviewed for

[00:35:04] Stanford I was interviewed by Peter Rosenbaum who it was an emeritus professor of psychiatry this was in medical school or residency know for medical schools yeah and we got along really really well and it's a wonderful person and later on when I decided to become a psychiatrist I told him you know I got his email out of the archives and I told him and he said to me some redacted histories right of patients and he wanted me to understand that yes there have been so many biological advances there's space a general imaging there's an understanding of brain biology that was unimaginable 3040 years ago but if you look at what they were writing about people it really evokes a human being whereas very often now when I look at reports of people I can't tell anything right it's just it's an inventory of signs and symptoms that you could conclude anything from and then a number gets put on top of it and and yes I mean

[00:36:01] I'm being critical of the field as I'm saying this but in many ways it's a societal criticism all right it's a criticism of a society that dumbs things down and that doesn't respond to the individual whether it's the the incessant phone trees that prevent us from ever solving any problems right no matter what it is whether it's my banker it's the phone company I mean when do you actually connect right and and I think it's that isolation that is a societal malady and it affects psychiatry which is a very bad thing because psychiatry is trying to help us have better mental health and we're kind of disarming its ability to do that I think and then it pervades our society in a way that leads to isolation and desperation and you know if I think if you look at suicide rates and and just levels of general misery I mean I don't want to glorify the past including the recent past but it's pretty hard to look at that and to think that no there's not there's not something here that's getting worse yeah well I mean touching on that there was an article in The Wall

[00:37:00] Street Journal recently after the sort of very close to back-to-back suicides of Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain and it showed some stats from the CDC so these are obviously us-based statistics but when you looked at men and women between the ages of 40 and 60 across the board there was about a 30% increase in the rate of suicide over I don't want to be misquoted on this so it was either a decade or two decades but it was a relatively recent period of time and in my approach to longevity is very it's very kludgy right I mean I'm kind of a hack if you really stop to think about it I don't have like some single magic pill that I think can make you live longer instead it's like a whole bunch of reverse engineered problems and one of them is you know it's it's you figure out what it what it is that's gonna kill you and start to back out of that and so

[00:37:48] I spend a lot of time poring over actuarial tables and looking over mortality trends and trying to understand how they're shifting where are we quote unquote winning and where are we losing and it seems to me that you know even though most of my energy focuses on three things atherosclerosis cancer and neurodegenerative disease the only disease that shows up in every single decade is a top ten cause of death outside of the first decade so birth to nine is suicide accidents do as well and butBut but I think the suicide thing but but the nature of accidents by the way changes so much from beginning to end that it's a very different you know in other words the accidents that kill you know thirty year olds and forty year olds are quite different from the accidents that kill 80 year olds and 90 year olds I'm sorry to interrupt it how many of those accidents especially ones that are killing younger people are what we might call para suicidal rates people being reckless and getting killed because their mental state is such that they're not invested in staying alive not only that so that's a great point the other when you look at the top three causes of accidental death it is automotive accident falling an accidental ingestion which of course begs the question how many accidental ingestion czar not accidental when I was in college a friend that I grew up with his dad shot himself in the head

[00:39:08] I remember that Sunday afternoon that had happened he literally they all went out to church like a normal day went out for lunch after and then when they got back home his dad went out to the shed and shot himself in the head mm-hmm probably one of the saddest lessons I ever learned was maybe two months later during finals my mom said so and so my friend is not doing well he's really down in the dumps you ought to come home and see him this weekend and I still to this day just cannot I can't believe what I'm admitting and acknowledging now it's so embarrassing and painful to say this but I said mom look I'm in the middle of finals here you know I got to graduate first in my class right I have to be the best engineer that ever lived

[00:39:49] I'll be done in two weeks I'll see him then a week later he was dead now we don't know you know I don't know that he'll get counted as a quote-unquote suicide because it was alcohol bar [ __ ] you know is like a cocktail of drugs in his system and he just never woke up and again I only tell that story not because it's you know it's just such as sad it's a sad reminder to me too how to prioritize it's been it that overnight changed the way I prioritize things in life but it also begs the question you know his death might not be one that actually gets counted as a suicide but I would call it a suicide absolutely I mean the deaths by suicide are in general the ones that are just very clearly suicide right yeah but if you there's a note written that the gunpowder's on the hand as the gun points at the head yeah right but so many deaths they're not labeled as suicide actually are suicide and so many that aren't someone saying I'm going to kill myself now are the result of an approach to one's life that doesn't value it and wants it to end what gets called para suicide when you when you add those things together those numbers you just undoubtedly are strikingly higher than the shockingly high numbers that we're reading now and

[00:41:07] I've always kept a mental note of if someone I know you know which includes again I don't make much of a distinction in people my personal life my patients people I consult - I mean just humans right of what they died of on the death certificate versus what they really died of right and it might be auto accident accidental overdose fall right and I'm looking at I'm see now that person died of Madoff that they're so ashamed of what happened to them when they were swindled and humiliated right that person died of rape that was never adequately addressed and the the sense of shame and the sense of misery that was imparted on them was never addressed that person died of childhood bullying right that was so intense they they they decided that they were this awful reprehensible person in sixth grade and that never changed I mean every now and then the actual cause of death matches what what is is you know my brain registers is the real cause of death but very very often there's a difference there and and the difference i account for by the role of trauma right the role of trauma that pushes people to either end their life or to move towards the end of their life even if they're not overtly acknowledging that they're doing that which can be a clever way of not having to feel accountable right if the religion says don't commit suicide well it's a ultimately it was an accident or well I don't want to leave my kids ultimately it's an accident I mean I'm not saying that in any negative way but we don't help people to understand what's going on inside of them right and you know you're talking about like how you run your practice and how you try and understand the routes to not just to longevity but the healthy longevity and you know and I would argue I mean my take on that is that you actually have become the best engineer because what you're doing is as you said your reverse engineering two ways of living longer and being healthier and with so many complex variables I'm not so sure if it's possible to figure that out without reverse engineering and view it as a marker of your I truly mean this you're intense and incredible thoroughness that you look beyond the factors and the reasons for the factors and the reasons that underlie the factors and the reasons and it's you know I think what leads you to have me here instead of someone who could talk more about oncology or cardio vascular pathology right the realization that what undergirds a tremendous amount of the things that actually take someone's quality of life or take their life ultimately has a root in in mental health right that people who are depressed are more likely to die of cardiovascular disease are more likely to die of accidents are more likely to become addicted right people who've been through terrible trauma are more likely for all of those things to happen the role of stress in its impact on the immune system and the growth of cancer cells right there's a level underneath the things to which we attribute morbidity and mortality that strongly influence morbidity and mortality and I believe that's true I mean I think that 80% of what I treat is trauma but I actually think I don't know what the numbers are but I think more than 50% of what everyone treats any doctor more than 50% of what walks through that door is ultimately resting in misery inside of that person that I would attribute to trauma and and again it's not my way of saying oh we're all suffering and in some way that it just kind of denigrates you know you know look when really awful things happen to people I mean the problem is we don't take stock of really awful things that happened to people like most of the time and even when those things are something so overt as you know an assault a terrible loss maybe we we can ignore even those things let alone the impact of you know loss of a parent as a child loss of a friend who moves away loss of a pet I mean like these are things sometimes that that you ask somebody what their inner life is like 20 25 years later and and that thing may go through their head a thousand times and it may be that the the loss of the pet is symbolic of they will have no stability no peace no freedom so then it becomes you know becomes the internal symbol of their sense of hopelessness in life for their sense of infinite striving with no hope of getting where they want to go so so I don't mean to say that in some I don't know trite way but I mean to say it in a way that I do think way if you sit with individual people you see the depth of that and you see the pervasive design when you recommended that I needed to go to Kentucky needed to go to this place the bridge to recovery which will be sure to link to in the show notes here because I really think if anybody takes anything away from this and they even have a suspicion that they're some of their actions some of their pain could be sort of driven by trauma that had occurred earlier in life I want to make sure that people at least pick up the phone give them a call and at least commit the time to doing an intake interview with them but I mean I was so incredibly resistant to this idea right it was this idea that how could there really be anything wrong with me look at how hard I work look at how quote/unquote successful I am and by that I just meant like I'm not an alcoholic I don't have a drug problem

[00:46:30] I'm not a gambler like I don't have any of these overt signs of pathology yeah I've got these other things that are kind of pathologic but I can mostly keep them in check but I kind of remember when I did my intake call with them how pissed off I got and that to me there was two things right so the first is I'm talking to this poor woman whose job it is is to just do a basic screening call but she's asking me a lot of questions nobody's ever asked me and questions I don't want to answer and at one point she asked me a question I won't tell you what the question was but my answer was [ __ ] you like that was just my answer right like and when I later told that story once I finally got there everybody thought that was so funny because they're like wow she asked you a question about X and she found out you have X and a bad temper it's like it is really great and your management and this other thing check but that was also kind of the reason why that was certainly one of the things that made me think because as you recall you know you wanted me to go and I agreed to go and then I backed out and you know it's just like this had been something that had been on the table for years and I just refused to acknowledge this needed to be done and I think part of it was the semantics right it's like what is trauma mean we get so far in our lives our skin gets so thick that I think people get into different patterns and for me I know the pattern was minimization you know I didn't forget any of the stuff that got me there I just didn't think it mattered you know when they talk about trauma at the bridge they really refer to it in five routes so the first route is abuse which can be physical emotional sexual spiritual to talk about neglect abandonment enmeshment and the witnessing of tragic events and so I think it'd be impossible to think that somebody listening to this hasn't experienced at least some of one of those branches and and many of us more than one for me the single most powerful way to let my guard down was because we're now what three or four days into the most intense experience of my life which is 13 hours a day of group you know therapy and I had still sort of rare so I'd shown up but I wasn't happy but I'd refused to sort of even have a discussion about any of this stuff I was happy to listen to other people but I wasn't gonna get into it and one of the counselors and I had these two amazing counselors Jeff and

[00:49:07] Julie I can't mer if it was Jeff or Julie but one of them said something to the effect of you know if such-and-such because we were talking about an event in my life if such-and-such occurred to your son Reese because Reese is for about the age that you know I was would you think that was okay it's a very different question right it's one thing when it's like look that happened what the you know I'm over it come on look at you know Bobo you could I could even rationalize look these things have made me more resilient this has given me a chip on my shoulder this has given me an edge but when they turn it into you have a kid and that and it's so interesting because just last week I was having dinner with a friend um in Malibu and he opened up to me about something incredibly personal and private that I'd never known which was that his wife had had a really difficult year she'd relapsed in her smoking a whole bunch of other stuff had completely fallen off the rails in her in their lives but in particular in her life we get through the whole dinner and he tells me everything about the story and it's just a heartbreaking story and then he alludes to a fact that was clearly the trigger which was his wife had been abused very badly by her stepfather had been sexually abused non-stop it started when she was seven years old earlier this year their daughter turned seven and it completely triggered this because and again if I'd heard that before I would have been like come on that sounds like sort of psychobabble nonsense how is it that seeing your daughter at the same age that you were at when something happened could do that

[00:50:46] I mean do you see this often oh sure yeah absolutely and and to kind of lead up to addressing that I want to comment on a couple of things right one you said that the woman who is asking the questions okay she learned okay there's this issue and then she learns about a hangar right I would frame that a little differently I would say that that there's a very skilled clinician that is doing the same thing over the telephone that we might do physically examining a patient right any touch does it hurt here does it hurt there right I mean if you get where it hurts and we know we're not even if we're very gentle about it right at times the person has a reaction right and then you learn like oh you hurt there right and that's why you reacted that way and I think that's what she learned Jesus it hurt here does it hurt here and then she look [ __ ] it really hurts are there and you know it tells us something right and and what it tells a good mental health clinician is where there's shame and fear right and you know shame is extremely powerful and it's it's it's technically it's an aroused affect I mean the word aroused you know doesn't it's not purely a sexual word I mean it often gets used in that way because the idea is say something can turn a person on that you didn't choose to have turn you on right but the idea of a roust effect is something that's created in you without your volition someone shoves you get angry right someone shows you really hard you might get afraid right there things that make a certain what gets called effect but colloquially a feeling inside of us that we don't have a choice over and there's an incredible automaticity to that and and that's like what what's what you're talking about with okay like what what is this trauma thing and what is it doing right it's not necessarily what happens it's what does it make you feel and my guess is and can I don't know I don't know the person you're talking about but probably that person is carrying some sense of shame over what happened to her because you know at the age of seven you know that there's not the cognitive capacity of deciding look what's going on to me happening is wrong you know the child needs to make sense of it right and often how the child make sense of it is to decide somehow that it makes sense or what's happening to them is deserved or it's their fault right or it's the way it should be right and that evolves into a sense of shame that the problem here is me someone's hurting me in some way whatever's happening to me doesn't feel good and it's my fault and then it creates a sense of shame that does not give a damn about the clock or the calendar or levels of achievement you have a trillion dollars and 15 PhDs right it does not make a difference unless that shame is directly addressed so that's really the answer right is what has happened to a person and what is it triggering inside of them the same way there's litter there's pretty good literature that's that talks about um you know someone is shocked right how much does it hurt and like it clearly it hurts more if there's no damn reason to have been shocked right like if you try save somebody and you know you get shot and then people tend to feel less pain because there's there's a sense that that it makes sense in some way that this bad thing has happened with something good it has comfort or I was trying to do something good right it doesn't seem senseless and sadistic and you know that sense of absurdity the sense of of evoked shamed or aroused affect of shame the sense of an aroused affect of fear the sense of absurdity and meaninglessness is what then creates the trauma that stays with someone and kind of like it's not even like a ghost shadowing you know it's like you know just imagine someone who like can't stand you that just shadows you all the time and says awful things and that's essentially what this kind of thing evolves into and it's it's that that you know that raises that triggering that if there's still a sense of shame and now the daughter is seven years old you know what does that make the person feel like right the person identifies with the daughter they still identify as the hurt child but now they're supposed to take care of a child who's vulnerable because that child has reached the age at which they were hurt

[00:54:54] I mean it's very very triggering for reasons that make damn good sense so you've seen this where people's trigger is a child that reaches an age at which some traumatic event occurred yes very cut it's very common because that is a trigger that say okay it's my job to make sure that does not happen to them but I am still in the throes of it right so then well I am the traumatized seven year old child who is supposed to protect the seven-year-old child that's terrifying it's terrifying and then the part of the brain that is terrified it says look this this absolutely could happen to your child and you can't protect them and then you know the brain again the brain doesn't care about the clock and the calendar so that trauma is very very very real to the person and it's very immediate it doesn't matter if it was two days ago or if it was thirty years ago it's just as immediate and and we also lose sight of that and many times I hear people say oh I couldn't still be bothering me it was what two months ago two years ago fifty years ago and and the answer to that is it does not matter one bit how long ago it was if it instilled terror shame a sense of responsibility for something that wasn't the person's responsibility then I know my guess is we could probably live to be a thousand years old and and that would still be with us and again very germane to what to your practice is and that's one of the things that often prevents us from living longer right it's that kind of internal stress that leads not only to suicide and para suicide but also to the kind of strength sorry the kind of stress that contributes to cardiovascular disease to cancer to autoimmune problems right to all the things that ultimately you know if you look at the population as a whole that chips away at our health at our healthy lifespan and at our lifespan I still remember to this day the very very first patient we ever collaborated on which of course was such an interesting experience for me that it's what basically led to you and I being so close at the hip in terms of like how many patients we overlap with but obviously won't use her name but the woman in San Diego that I was taking care of very interesting case I think most of my patients her incredibly nice people but she would certainly be on the short list of like the nicest mmm just a very very specialist man yeah and there were a lot of things that didn't look metabolically right frankly her chief complaint when she came to me was you know she just wanted to have more energy she wanted to to feel better her father had died prematurely of heart disease she wanted to make sure that was not going to be her and we got to it we changed her nutrition and we fixed her hypothyroidism and we tweaked a bunch of things and everything on paper looked right but we couldn't eradicate certain things there was still a degree of inflammation in her body there was still a degree of insulin resistance I probably hadn't seen a patient who could be so compliant with her nutritional plan as she was and the only one of her meds I couldn't really offer any input on was she was on an SSRI I think I don't remember which one was wellbutrin if I can remember actually and you know

[00:58:02] I think this has been prescribed by her family doctor like ten years earlier or something like that but I remember one day thinking about what she talked about when her dad died when she was in medical school she was a physician and it clear to me on this particular day which was like a year after the first time I'd heard this story that like that hits that I didn't know to use the word trauma but that was clearly a traumatizing event in her life and my first thought we was actually I thought of these sucker rats right which I thought of these experiments that occurred because because what I couldn't understand was why in the world is this woman who's doing everything right see have a metabolic rate of a slug right it was like she's doing everything by the book and the only way that we could infer what's going on with her is that her metabolic rate has shut down because she's no longer hypothyroid all these other things have been fixed and I thought about these Zucker rats where they you know they sustain certainly jhin's into parts of the hypothalamus and they can alter the metabolic rate and so I floated the idea by you and you said look it anything is plausible and to make a long story short I introduced the patient to you she came up she saw you and over the course of the next six months without making any change in the thyroid meds in the nutrition and the exercise she probably lost thirty pounds and she looked at like a different person in fact I remember when I got her

[00:59:27] Christmas card with her and her family at first I thought I don't know who this is why am I getting a Christmas card from a random person and I mean what do you remember about that case then maybe not even the specifics but just like were you as surprised by that as I was you know I I think the fact that I wasn't is is just indicative of it's not indicative of like some genius that I figured things out that other people haven't it's just indicative of things that I have witnessed that utterly shocked me at the time that lead to what

[01:00:04] I would describe as more than a healthy respect but an utter reverence for the impact of what the brain can do to the body and you know a couple of examples are paralysis of a limb I mean I've seen people seen cases in my training and subsequently taken care of people who do something that they find reprehensible or almost do something that could have been disastrous and then the limb that they did it with is paralyzed and now it's like it's ten years later and the limb hasn't moved in ten years I mean the nerves haven't been severed but they may as well have been those contractures and ever thing else I mean when you see that the brain can like shut off vision right the brain can shut off movement to a limb these are really shocking things and and

[01:00:56] I think that we as a society like we just don't appreciate how much impact over all aspects of our functioning some of the things that torment us inside can have so so there was something tormenting this lovely woman that was like shutting her metabolism off and in many ways I get it it's a it's a shocking thing and and it would have like you know knocked me off my feet if

[01:01:22] I hadn't been like seen paralyzed limbs before and you know things that that that really kind of told me things that to be honest really made me angry and I thought like how is it that I consider myself to be the curious person I mean even let's think before psychiatric training right and I'm a well-read person I'm a well-traveled person I'm interested in other people I

[01:01:45] I took a broad curriculum in college like how is it that I didn't understand these things of what our brain and and what does that mean it means what our brain in the context of trauma which which is about evoke shame fear think about things we're talking about in the patients where we've had these kind of you know these kind of experiences right and even in ourselves think about the impact of shame and fear and what it does to us and and people don't tell us that so then a person feels ashamed right that their eating less and they can't lose weight they feel ashamed that they're sleeping but they're not well rested they feel ashamed that they want to be patient with their kids and they can't be as patient as they want I mean I could go on and listed thousands and thousands of things and what we often don't again don't appreciate is where's all that coming from and as anyone ever asked about it I'll give you a very quick aside that I saw a person in my practice several years ago five years ago or so very very intelligent person very capable academically accomplished who was working many many many levels underneath where could would have been operating at $10 an hour job and somebody you know who should be running a company that dramatic and you know I was I don't know how many people had seen and talked to this person before right and I asked him a question and you know we had been talking so it's not like it came out of the blue but but I asked him you know how many times a day do you say something to yourself inside that's some version of like I suck and this response was also as I'm a piece of [ __ ] and his answer was like he stopped it as hundreds hundreds of times all the way to the job all the way back in the shower before he goes when he's back at home with his kids non-stop you know that was all trauma based and it was based upon belittling bullying all things that had happened I mean you could take a trauma history from this person and not like no one's ever shot him no one's ever sexually assaulted him like if he's all there's no trauma oh no there was gigantic trauma and if you're saying something to yourself over and over and over again that is that is profoundly negative and that makes you feel vulnerable ashamed inadequate how are you supposed to be at your best how does it affect your brain how does it affect your endocrine system how does it affect your immune system how does it affect your vasculature the answer is dramatically then you look at this person who now was aware of substandard role performance and I feels worse about himself and by going after that we're actually able to change everything I mean that the person's life is dramatically different if you look at what he's doing for a living now okay that's you know that's something that seems more commensurate and in this person it doesn't represent the endless striving of you who never you know achieve enough right in this person it represents something that makes him feel whole that this wasn't you know his ability to be something he could feel proud of to support his family in a way he could free private part of it wasn't taken away from him but if you looked at what was the etiology of that problem it absolutely wasn't single-digit ages and it doesn't matter that this was like three or more decades along right it was with him on it's of times a day and it's why these things don't surprise me and and you know I've had an increased awareness over time of my own inner voice that you know I may as well as somebody you know behind me all the time I mean I've been trying to alter this and some moon someone's with your help and a couple of other people around us you know it's kind of gotten better and the realization that I carry around with me a voice that tells me how shitty I am for everything that's not utterly perfect from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep has created a lot of misery in my life and is created unhealthy situations and you know at times real risk to my to life and limb for me so you know I'm a huge believer that the reality and the truth that we're living and say that the reality and what we view as truth that that we're living in is often not apparent to anyone around us and nor is it apparent to ourselves and if we make that apparent then we can make some decisions about it which is why that woman was able to lose weight is because we we started talking about like what was actually going on inside of her and you know in a certain person if you are intensely ashamed and feel inadequate from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep you probably 20 calories a day and you're gonna gain weight yeah but that's the part that just blows my mind in her case the other thing with this stuff that I think it's worth people who are listening understanding and it's it's so important

[01:06:27] I certainly didn't understand it until the past year I think I wasn't so naive to know that I wasn't so so so maybe naive the wrong word I wasn't so ignorant to think that look bad things happen I got it but my sort of blinder based mentality was I can prevent that exact set of things from happening to the next generation to my kids and of course the irony of it is you learn that trauma almost always comes out in some orthogonal way and so it's not necessarily that the child of the alcoholic becomes the alcoholic in the case of the woman that I was just talking about earlier who when she saw her daughter turns seven triggered all these flashbacks of the sexual abuse I don't think that I think the probability that that mother is gonna go ahead and like sexually abuse her daughter because she was sexually abused by her stepfather the probability that is like close to zero that is not how the shame will be transferred to the next generation it will not be through the same route cause it will come out in something different and and to me that's the part of this thing that is so such an epidemic you know Terrence real who we've talked about a lot and in his book which I've talked about another podcast one of the most important books I've ever read I don't want to talk about it he talks about this the the number of generations it takes for shame to sort of work itself out and it's like you know this happened to the grandfather this happened to the to the mother this happened to the child and this idea of shame transference through trauma is I don't know I guess like I said even though I don't do this for a living it occupies more and more of my time because I spend more and more of my time thinking about it with with the patients that I'm lucky enough to get this close to and truthfully there are some of my patients I just don't get close enough to to understand this part of their lives but I want to because I realize so much of what we do without knowing this becomes quite futile absolutely if I mean if the man if the only thing we were guarding against was the manifestation of something that we recognize things would be different and

[01:08:41] I think the number of generations to get rid of shame without intervention you know is either infinite or there's just some yeah - is practically infinite right because why would something like that change unless it's understood now people at times can intuitively understand I mean they're things that can intervene but otherwise you're absolutely right I mean it finds a way out right so the person who was sheltered and over controlled as a child and that led to say you know big problems of rebellion and then something traumatic happens maybe if they don't understand that they may over compensate with sort of freedom and what seems like opportunity for their own kids but wide actually you know puts them in a verily in danger the person who was neglected and was in left in situation of danger may over control their kids and then the kids were battling the same thing happens I mean if we don't understand it there's a very good chance that it will find a way to get us and you know sometimes that's something dramatic and you know I see these cases like oh my gosh like this person did the opposite thing their parents didn't look the same thing happens right but a lot of times you know I think most human suffering and most bad outcomes you know happen with a physical not a bank and and I think that's part of the really the biggest sadness of it it's the things that we don't know or the person who just languishes who doesn't have a strong sense of self and is burdened with regret and that's the story I mean that there's so much about this that because we don't talk about it we don't educate ourselves about it we just let be perpetuated and in many ways like I'm not trying to say this is all easy to address right but some of this I think is low-hanging fruit of look why are we not talking about these things right why is it that we enter medical school and if all these like overly powerful guys and you know we don't think of it like what are we all defending against like why do we have to be so powerful all the time what are we guarding against why is it that we feel ashamed if we're not powerful right if we're not you know mean if we're not perfect if we're not the best right why is it and and and you know again I'm not saying gee let's let's have some like soft way of going about life and then people aren't driven to achieve things but it's it's a lot of it is based on this lie that like what doesn't kill us makes us stronger okay that is a lie sometimes something doesn't kill us and makes us stronger you know we can get an infection it doesn't kill us we develop antibodies right it can happen on a biological level it can happen with a life tribulation but my experience in my own life and in the people around me that I take care of or my friends family patients that like the humans in my life is that bad things that don't kill us often make us weaker all right they hurt us and if we don't acknowledge that what is this thing done to me right then we put it onto the surface and we soldier forward and for a lot of people you know what does that mean I mean it does mean languishing and often times for people who maybe are blessed with more Drive and perseverance sure it means we drive ourselves to achievement but amidst all that achievement we remain miserable because the the hurt part of us is is like still what we're living in every moment every month most of the time we're living in that hurt person but that hurt person is festooned in a way that doesn't look like that and and if you think about very powerful things in culture you know the Wizard of Oz you know like such a a cultural touchstone across generations even as to the emperor's new clothes

[01:12:25] I mean we're infatuated with things looking some way but being another way do you know things looking strong and powerful but being weak and vulnerable and part of our infatuation with that is it can take the fear out of some of the things that scare us but I think an even bigger part of that is that we often identify with that all right we identify with you know festooning ourselves look how great I am and like you know really

[01:12:52] I'm not festooned in anything right I mean there's like a there's a pathetic nakedness to some of it right but but we sort of posture that way right and we posture that way in order to show ourselves up and if I see a commonality between like how you and I practice medicine and how the vast majority of I think good doctors practice medicine is is it's what not hiding vulnerability I do not feel in any way shape or form healthier than the vast majority of my patients I mean some people yes I've had a bad head injury have schizophrenia okay III don't feel any better necessarily healthier to them a lot of the time but there's an identified problem that we want to address and treat that can let the person feel a greater sense of wholeness okay that's valid but most of the people that I encounter are just struggling the same way that I am and you know there really is no difference except that person may do something maybe some day I need an architect a financial manager you know a lawyer or whatever it is that they're doing but we're no different it just happens to be like okay this thing

[01:13:56] I do brings them to come to me for help about this certain thing but we're all people are trying to make our way and survive in the world and often some of the people who I feel are most put together are not the people that you might think right they're the people who if you look at their achievements you know you you you know you're not gonna like be wowed by it necessarily but they're people who have a greater sense of wholeness there are people who have made me spent more time and effort on themselves and again this is not an anti ambition agenda that I have here but what I what I absolutely am saying is that very very high levels of achievement or a marker in my brain for suspicion that this person is defending against something and you know that's the reason why I felt that you should go to the bridge it's a reason why trauma therapy is part of my psychotherapy it's a reason why at some point I should go to the bridge - right I mean this this is nothing McMahon for that places you that first person who told me I send a bunch of people there and no one tells me this and then you do I do it has two nicknames Camp misery and The Crying factor yeah okay tell me the crime factor and you know it points out that making ourselves healthier often is difficult it does involve misery it involves tears and exposure of things were ashamed of and you know of all the places that I have sent people it you know at this point in almost two decades you know I think that they are the most effective or among the most effective of places and I think part of it is because they don't shy away from that I remember something you said to me because you suggested look there are two or three places where I think you could go here's why I think the bridge is the best for you and one of the reasons was almost embarrassed to admit live you know to people doesn't any people what I asked you but I said you know Paul when I looked at these other places the bridge seems unique in that the socioeconomics of it look very different from where

[01:16:00] I've come from meaning I'm not going to be there with other people who have gone to medical school or gone to law school or whatever will I have enough in common with the other people there and you said that's exactly why I think you should go there yes I didn't understand that so I go there and of course the first rule is everybody has a roommate well I don't want a goddamn roommate I'm 45 years old I passed that course right I did that I did summer camp already I don't want a roommate so

[01:16:27] I you know have my assistant call over and say hey we'll pay extra but he needs a solo room to which they sort of said thanks for telling us how to do our job that ain't the way it works he gets a roommate right again everything that they did that I thought was pure torture turned out to be perfect there was exactly what you said I had to be around people who I could relate to intellectually who I couldn't relate to intellectually who I had a similar education to to whom I did not but in the end what I realized was we are all the same and I think that is such a banal glib idiotic statement but it's [ __ ] true we are all the same my roommate I swear for the first three days I thought I don't have one thing in common with this guy loved him out of the gate I mean was that just an amazing guy that's like we don't anything in common and that's fine I mean I didn't make me like him any less but two weeks later I realized oh actually we have more in common than I would have ever dreamed we have the dip the reason we look like we have nothing in common is perhaps some innate wiring perhaps some stochastic events but in the end we took very different divergent paths you know mine led me to college his did not my weaknesses led me in a different area than his did one of the things that I found most powerful and I'm bringing this back to a point you made earlier was in addition to 13 hours of camp misery every day seven days a week you get to go to a 12-step meeting every single night you get to pick what it is so they're not gonna tell you which one you're going to but you're either going to a a or al-anon or coda or NA or sa or

[01:18:06] SLA you're going I think you got one night off a week I think Sunday night you got spared the meeting and I remember thinking the first few times like I'm so tired I'm just so emotionally exhausted that you know it's 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. all I want to do is go lay on my shitty bunk bed and sleep but they're like nope you gotta go and you're a guy by the way who could work what how many hours on stantly as a surgical resident right yeah this was a different level of fatigue bedding so the fact that you're that exhausted speaks to like what's gone the magnitude of what's going on inside of you I find that to be like really fascinating and a great proof of concept yeah did this in many ways hurt more than swimming the Catalina channel every day Wow okay that's saying something right so but what I realized when it was all said and done cuz I I ended up being quite surprised at how much I really got out of being in these 12-step meetings and I wasn't a participant every meeting I went to was an open meeting I never once spoke never once but I was so moved by the vulnerability of these people now again part of that might be an artifact of the fact that we were two hours outside of the nearest civilization I mean we're an hour outside of Bowling

[01:19:24] Green Kentucky like we were in a place that I don't even I wouldn't know how to find on a map if my life depended on it but I couldn't believe the vulnerability in these meetings and I think in many ways that is an antidote to shame it is the beginning of it and fast forward five months I'm back I'm in I'm back into my life and and obviously much of my life has changed the result of this but look we still struggle we're still always thinking about these things and I remember my therapist in San Diego said something that I thought was so profound she goes you know Peter part of the problem with you is you're always the smartest guy in the room now she didn't she was sort of mocking me she wasn't like actually telling me how the smartest guy in the room she's like you basically are always the one on point you're the one talking you're the one giving the advice you're the one who everyone's looking to for the answer and the problem with that is like you never get the chance to listen and not say a word and not have anybody even give a [ __ ] that you're in the room and I was like you know that's the key that's the thing I miss about the 12-step meeting was nobody gave a [ __ ] that I was in the room and even if I was and I said yeah my name is Peter it's like great thanks for being here Peter you were no better or no worse than anybody else in this room and so in many ways I feel like and again I don't think it has to be the twelve-step stuff I know people are gonna listen to this and say oh twelve steps a bunch of nonsense it what whatever you know what works for you works for you but the point is there is really something to be said for that type of vulnerability in a group where nothing else matters it doesn't matter how much money you have it doesn't matter how many degrees you have it doesn't matter what you've done I mean none of those is better and of course the next place where that became the most riveting to me was on this prison visit that I went to which we've talked about as well and again just another great example of how in that moment in a moment of redemption all it matters is where it was where you are and that's in that moment and I just find that Lea again as I'm sitting listening to all of the things you're saying of course my my mind is immediately going to okay what can we do what can we do what can we do what can someone listening to this do what can someone listen to this who's identifying with this saying you know what like maybe that thing that happened to me when I was 10 or maybe this behavior that I have that's on the surface reasonable but underneath the surface is maladaptive maybe that needs to be revisited and again if the answer is they need to seek therapy fine but what else can people do I think that it's it's so important to to try and take stock of how are we trying to separate ourselves from other people I mean think about the things you're saying it's it's very interesting and people listening to this who know you will know that this is true and for the people who don't know you please I would ask take my word for this I mean you are you know the least entitled condescending human being right I mean you do not feel superior to other people

[01:22:17] I don't think I've seen one whit of that in the two decades I've known you so why is it that you want a private room and that you want to be different it's a reflex and the reflex is like I've got to stand out in some way because that's what allows me not to feel superior but to not feel ashamed and that's often what is driving us and it drives good things right I mean your expertise and and often being the focus in the room because you have you know things to say to ought to offer is like these are good things but they're also driven by the need to separate ourselves and you know we it's not that both of those sides of the coin have to come together but if we're not aware they do come together and then you're doing something by reflex that is the exact opposite of what you need what you need is to be part of the humanity around you right what you need is to relate to people what you need is to feel that my god I mean I'm a human who suffers from human things like these people around me some of whom are nothing like me some of whom may be like me but like none of that matters we're all people and our suffering is shared that takes away the unique stigma other things that you were suffering from but your reflex as mine has been and as is the case in many people who are sort of driven to differentiate themselves is to differentiate yourself so that you guarantee loneliness and you know that's what people I think really should try and be aware of is when are we differentiating ourselves from the world around us because we are trying to escape from something but in doing so we isolate ourselves and we don't we don't get a chance to just be human we don't get a chance to just be people like you know the people who are there at the bridge with you had trauma and suffering and they needed to express emotions and they need to cry and they need to get angry and and you did too right and and I have to and so many people need that to heal but we work so hard to separate ourselves from that and that's what I think you know if there's one thing that some persons can be attuned to is how much are you separating yourself from from the humanity around you you know groups of people when people have agendas or angry can feel threatening and intimidating but there are many places that people gather in order to feel some sense of openness and shared humanity and that's really what we're all seeking you know I know you know this but seven eight years ago and I had a clinic that myself and my practice partner built you know to be relatively sizable and we were doing a lot of individualized treatment and we were running groups and a lot of the group's we were running were around addiction and we were absolutely adamant that we did not stratify people by what they were addicted to so gambling cutting sex cocaine didn't doesn't matter nor did we stratified people by age socioeconomic status and it was a pressure to do that because certain of the people who had more resources right like wanted that not realizing that what they were asking for was it was the very thing that was gonna stand in the way of their ability to get help that's exact story when I called you up to say wait a minute

[01:25:47] I don't think the bridge is the place for me yeah and and I should be going to this place or that place and you you said no what you're missing is you absolutely need to be around people who on the surface you think you're different from to realize that you're not right and it's an advantage that people have if they're at a stage of life or for whatever reason they're they're not in a socio-economic class that allows them to differentiate because and they don't strive for something that stands in their way and you know and I think back on that venture which over about five years you know my partner and I and you know we had 30 people or so in some way shape or form were working for us by the end we all like really slaved away to make that place as good as it could be and when I think back on it you know I think the proudest moment people have asked me this like all that was so difficult and so some people who know me and kind of know what we struggled through and like some of the people asked what do you feel good about right and and the same image comes to mind is I remember you know a young woman where price I think she was 19 who really had struggled and was trying to find her way and had been on the streets and you know to the outward look of things you know as piercings and tattoos and all the kind of things that kind of mark her attempts to differentiate herself to say okay stay away from in a way that she was using to separate herself and God she had made so much progress so much progress in embracing who she was and not feeling ashamed of who she was and not feeling responsible for things that happened to her that she had no control over and I remember her I walked by and kind of late one day after groups had let out and she was having this like really intense conversation with a neurosurgeon and it was so clear that she was teaching him got a lot of things and you know and he was in sort of rapt attention and it's a marker for me of like our shared human Ness is like you know if you look at him and you look at her you say okay good things they've achieved you clearly he's the authority he's got a CV a half a half a mile long right and you know this woman has been struggling to stay off the streets she had done more work on herself so she had a lot to teach him and I have found that again it sounds trite but the things that I have learned through the course of my work so much of them have just come from people who have been through such difficulties and have learned things about themselves that I hadn't yet learned not at all tied to any metric other than that and I think that's part of the secret of it and we don't do these things anymore we don't have places where people can come and even get some mental health education some idea of like what else them in terms of trauma like we don't as a society acknowledge this so then it becomes some like shocking rarity when somebody finds their way to it and I just I'm astounded by that that we should be like setting a road map with like really gigantic arrows for all of us but you know person has to stumble upon it or come across it inadvertently and in many ways I think I'll forever be grateful I mean forever be grateful to you for making this happen because I guess some people just can't they need a greater degree of immersion to finally break down I think I could have spent two hours a week in therapy for the rest of my life and never never come close to what finally takes place when you're doing 13 hours a day plus 12-step meetings and and and only that it's like every meal you're sitting there with this same group of people we only got coffee once a day 7:00 a.m. was coffee time and it was like I would get up at 4:00 and work out and then I'd be you know waiting to have my coffee at 7:00 and there were like six of us that showed up for coffee every morning and the other thing about this place that was so amazing which I really ties into what you're saying is everyone who works there obviously not just the counselors and the therapists but the kitchen staff the custodial staff yeah the people that worked at the barn where we did a coin therapy every one of them had themselves been a client there Wow I didn't unbelivable shared experience like we are all the same at this place Wow and isn't there comfort in that right absolutely how can you be some exception who deserves shame for being something less than perfect when you fully appear in that reality it can't be right you know you said something a moment ago that made me think of one of my favorite talks oh you know you and I you know that I'm the biggest fan of David Foster

[01:30:30] Wallace this person who I've just I've just always been kind of so amazed by his insight I just you know here's a guy who was not a trained psychiatrist he's a writer and yet his insights into humanity go be hunted most anything I think you couldn't learn this stuff in a textbook and you know I've been asked before like if you could bring anybody back from the dead you know of recent era right who would it be and I think it would be him you know if I could if I could go back in time and spend a day with anybody it would probably be with

[01:31:03] David Foster Wallace he has a very famous commencement speech from 2005 that he delivered at Kenyon College titled this's water and in it he talks about the fact that we're I think he'd the way he describes it is there's no such thing as atheism we are all worshipping some God do you worship money power your body you know you were physical allure and he almost makes the case that at least if you pick a God to worship the harm to you might be less because if it is money you worship you'll never have enough if it's power you worship you'll never feel strong enough if it's intellect that you worship you'll always feel like a fraud and I remember listening to this for the very first time which was many years ago and thinking yeah I get that like I really get that like I I know I'm not alone but

[01:31:59] I think a lot of people who place their self-worth and their intellect you think what if people find out I'm not that smart like I'm just a fraud and you know it's again it's just it just speaks to this entire nature of humanity and of course the tragedy in the case of David Foster Wallace is that he ends up taking his own life by suicide three years after he gave that talk now totally unrelated I want to play something for you so I was actually just listening to this today now I hadn't come across this before but this is an interview with

[01:32:30] David Foster Wallace and Terry Gross from NPR I believe it was 97 it was like a year or two after Infinite Jest came out so I want to play this for you if I can queue it up on my phone here cuz I thought of you as soon as I heard this right okay here we go you know I really like the way you talk you're right about a pleasure and how difficult it can be to to really achieve you write about pleasure in the Infinite

[01:32:57] Jest your your your latest novel and I'm thinking you know one of the things relating to that in Infinite Jest one of the characters finds that that marijuana is marijuana is no longer a pleasurable experience it just makes them terribly self-conscious and therefore anxious and I'm wondering what happens to you when you do something that's supposed to give you pleasure and it just makes you uncomfortable or anxious boy I'm not really even sure how to respond to that look a lot of the impetus for writing if in a chest was just the fact that that I was about 30 and I had a lot of friends who are about 30 and we'd all you know been grotesquely over educated and privileged our whole lives and had better healthcare and more money our parents did and we were all extraordinarily sad I think it has something to do with with being raised in an era when really the ultimate value seems to be I mean a successful life is let's see you make a lot of money and you have a really attractive spouse or you get um you get infamous or famous in some way so that it's a life where you basically experience as much pleasure as possible which ends up which ends up being sort of empty and low-calorie the the reason I don't like talking about it discursively as it sounds very banal and cliche you know when you say it out loud that way believe it or not this was this came as something of an epiphany to us at around age 30 sitting around talking about why on earth we were so miserable when we've been so lucky well when did you realize that all the other benefits you had in an educated middle-class life weren't bringing you happiness well like look I guess it I guess it sort of depends on what what you mean by happiness I mean it's not like we were walking around fingering razor blades or anything like that but it just sort of seems as if yeah we sort of knew how happy our parents were and we would compare our lives with our parents and see that at least on the surface where according to the criteria that the culture lays down for a successful happy life we were actually doing better than a lot of them were and so why on earth were we so miserable I don't think I you know I I don't mean to suggest that that it was you know a state of constant clinical depression or that we all felt that we were supposed to be blissfully happy all the time there was just I have a very weird and amatuer sense that that an enormous part of like my generation and the generation right after mine is just an extremely sad sort of lost generation which when you think about the material comforts and the political freedoms that we enjoy is just strange I could listen to interviews with David well indefinitely but it's interesting that I came across that today for the first time again I don't know how I miss a little well today today just just literally today and you know I knew that we were gonna be speaking this evening and I thought you know I'm gonna put

[01:35:43] Paul on the spot and play that for him and ask him not just to explain that but even more broadly what the heck is going on right why I mean let's take a step back it would seem to me that suicide is the least likely cause of demise for our species just given our evolution I mean it seems to me that we are wired to survive so in other words and again I'm certainly not being critical of suicide I have nothing but empathy for obviously anyone who commits suicide it strikes me as the saddest thing ever but I don't understand it like I don't I don't understand how it can be so prevalent when we must be so wired to not want it when we must be so wired to want to survive and it I remember very recently

[01:36:34] I remember having this thought probably in the wake of the you know these high profile suicides which you know I remember when Robin Williams killed himself the same sort of thoughts go through my mind which is did our ancestors do this is suicide a symptom of our civilization is what David Foster Wallace is talking about here even comparing ourselves to one generation ago are we less happy or do we just have greater expectations and those expectations being unmet is what makes us feel unhappier again it's I mean it's so complicated and I want to start off by saying like but by no means do I attest to any expertise right or a right to offer an opinion it's more valuable than anyone else's but the thoughts that occur to be is you know we're wired to survive as long as we see meaning and survival and I am NOT here trying to glorify struggle but there is something around struggle that gives meaning you know people who struggle to survive in war zones you don't people who see meaning and survival they see meaning in what they're fighting for no Viktor Frankl writing the men's chorus search for meaning right is like if you don't have meaning then why would you struggle to survive and it's not a lengthy extrapolation of that to say if you don't have meaning why are you interested in survive have you read tribe by Sebastian Junger

[01:38:06] I have not I should and I've been told several times I should I just haven't gotten to it yet but eh but I mean I understand I think I think this is sort of part of what he's getting at yeah you know that we okay for example like I really I mean it's interesting right given what I do for a living they're like I don't know how I value myself I don't know how to value myself and whether I'm succeeding or not I mean is that what my family of origin thinks of me how much time I spend with them I've certainly ranged far afield and left the place I grew up in order to achieve things and do things I shouldn't be proud of that if I have I know not been a good friend or family member to the people I grew up with do I value myself by what other people think of me how many patients I feel I can help the health of my relationship with the people I love as adults the kind of parent I am kind of husband I am how much money I have how many you know people want me to offer some expert opinion on something music I have no idea I have no idea whatsoever and it occurs to me sometimes that I hope that all those ancestors of mine really knew how to value themselves like are the

[01:39:19] Sheep safe is there a roof over our heads and again amazed I am not glorifying the lack of opportunity you know the lack of like the basic medical care right in generations past but there is something very very concrete about that and when people go through struggle when we often most worry about them is when the struggle is over when people feel like I I made it through that you know whatever that was maybe that was chemotherapy maybe that was the death of someone close to them maybe it was a particularly trying time at home or in their career you know people persevere when they see meaning in their struggle but when there's not a struggle the struggle is over or we're not particularly struggling for something what does how do you value yourself and I think often we don't even know enough to answer the question I mean like you and I've never sat down and talked about this we spent a lot of time together we've been close for two decades like why do we not talk about the in part because we don't understand how meaningful it is right so we value ourselves by persevering but that's endless right I mean as you said you you there's always more of things to have so at a certain point that can seem very very Hollow and I think that in many ways that's the disease of the modern civilization I mean even when we grew up the time of the Cold War I mean I grew up with this very like clear idea and and I get that you know it was a simplistic idea right look at the West is good and you know we fight for democracy and you know the

[01:40:48] Soviets are bad and look I get that this is not the case I mean I've spent time in Russia and in Eastern Europe like I get like the people or people but it was an easy it was an easier algorithm to grow up in and it instilled faith in in America and faith in what we stood for and and as we get older and wiser we all learn about the hypocrisy of life and the the truths of life and you know learning of you know so I remember learning about like things that America had done in Central America right and you know one feeling a sense of like oh my God look we are not the source of good and it doesn't mean that we were a force of evil it means that the situation was far more complicated but it provided a heuristic and even that was something that kind of made sense I mean I can remember the Olympics coming around and like feeling this sense of okay like it's we gonna beat the East

[01:41:37] Germans and the Russians and you know there was just a sense of dichotomies ation which is why people who want to control other people know to make struggle right do you make an enemy so this is all a double edged sword and you can make meaning in ways that is not valid right you say ok those people are bad let's go kill them I mean that's a way of making meaning for people it's not an honest or a moral way but what

[01:42:01] I'm trying to point out is that we see value to our struggle if we see meaning and I think that for a long time even as people got wisdom and been greater knowledge of things like hypocrisy and they're really the truth of the world I think we still saw a greater meaning and I'm not so sure that we do as much now you know I think that um things are much more nebulous and then it's hard to get around the idea of well do I really matter you know what am i doing what am i standing for what's what's really the difference and

[01:42:34] I just think look that can happen at any time and probably did happen you know back you know when everybody lived in caves but I think we're much much more susceptible to it because we don't have some sense of community and we don't have a sense of community I mean it's interesting right people have written about why do human beings um we're so focused on survival right there's a lot of people that will spontaneously risk their life for somebody else jump into the river right try and rescue somebody why do we do that and if the answer is because in that moment we see we see very clearly defined a very lucid meaning to our actions and I think that that's um like very very profound and I think it's the opposite I see that as the opposite of suicide which is which doesn't I mean it can happen for a lot of reasons why people can be very depressed and and you know the delusions of lack of worth I mean again it's very complicated and I'm not trying to trivialize it but I think a lot of what promotes suicide is the absence of meaning which I see as the opposite of someone who's taking good care of themselves and he wants to stay alive very much so but will risk their life to help someone else that that's a focus of meaning that there's a compelling meaning right now right what parent wouldn't jump in front of a car to push their child out of the way right and a lot of those parents who want to be there for their child would jump in a river for someone else's look as they see a child so you know it's that just capturing of the attention like this is meaningful look at this this is a chant

[01:44:01] I will make a difference now right and I'm willing to take a chance to do that and I think it's very very different than how a lot of people feel I think but all socio-economic demographics I mean if you think that I don't know what the exact numbers are but you know what percentage of people in this country you know I was reading the the reports around like a $500 unexpected bill right and like just people can't survive that right like they're not gonna get medical care they're not gonna you know service the car and then they can't get to work or they're not gonna you know they can't live a life that we would consider except you know with an unexpected we're in the grand scheme of things otherwise surmountable amount of money that's needed and you know I think that's a very very hard way to live that that you know a lot of what we're talking about is Foster Wallace was talking about it like well we have so much opportunity and we don't have to struggle right but if you are struggling to put food on the table and you know you know that if somebody needs to go to the emergency room how the hell are you gonna get enough food that's a struggle it's very hard to see meaning in that's a struggle that seems like denigration yeah I mean it's it is you're gonna struggle whereas it's different our ancestors if they had to struggle through a famine or drought I mean it was just that was just that was the gods right that was nature that was the season and they were in it together right and it's not like you were struggling because of the drought but your neighbor was you know rolling around in a you know whatever the equivalent of the Ferrari would be right and I think it's so you know it's so in a way baffling right that look I hate the thought that how many people are there that 500 medical blown they can't put food on the table you know yet you know I'm fortunate to live in relative plenty compared to that but I don't know how to bridge that gap there's not a sense of community and sure like we can donate and we can do things for free and all of this but but like we don't have a sense of what does that mean and how do we change that and how do we make that better and my sense is that I actually feel quite insecure do I have enough if my kids need something right to have enough if you know things really go south and it becomes unsafe to live here

[01:46:11] I have a sense of vulnerability what does someone feel like who has the same sense of conscientiousness towards the people that they love the through $500 can sync so I'm not trying to make specific points about that but really to point out what I view as just a tremendous sense of isolation and it's not a disease of Plenty I mean I think it's a disease that affect people who have enough and that affects people who don't have enough even worse and that that lack of shared sense of community a lack of being in it together you know it may sound hokey but but through most of life that's how people lived I mean unfortunately Paul everything you just said does really seem to offer a foreseeable remedy to this and if today we're seeing 30% more suicide or there abouts than we were a couple of decades ago is there anything on the horizon that's going to curb that trend or is suicide going to become an increasingly greater part of our humanity and and perhaps worse yet for every person who actually kills themselves what if there's nine people who are in that category we described earlier is basically functionally dead and then you think of the effect of this what's the trickle-down effect of that on the next generation I do think that there are ways to make this better and I feel strongly and passionately about them you and I have talked about some of them and I'm fortunate to have dialogues with people who can really kind of help make a difference in this way again do I know that it's the right way no I don't but it's the best I can think of which is you know it's a simplification right that we don't have places where people could come together and have shared experience and have a sense of community like what about places where there are people to facilitate human connection and education even about the basics of what's going on inside of people and there's a couple comfortable couches and a pot of coffee these are not expensive things I mean you think about in this country what things cost go get an x-ray is $700 right I mean we've built up so much cost around things so much liability so much that prevents really basic simple things from happening and we've lost the basics of community support I mean there was an era before you and I were practicing medicine it's only before I was before of a psychiatrist right where where there were community support centers and they were publicly funded and it didn't cost very much money in the grand scheme of things and they were places where people who are pretty mentally ill could go for support not only do we not have places like that for you and me and the other people who are who are franck managing to function we don't even have those places for people who were really mentally ill so we don't provide an itis in the community for the basics of what I would call psycho education and for the ability to do that in a way that really links human beings and looks at what their needs are you know how many times have I seen where a person who if they overdose or they slit their wrists right that the world will pay a million dollars for their intensive care units day but what we will not do is buy them the three hundred dollar alternator that could fix the car that allows them to not have to go back to the abusive household situation that leads to the suicide attempt that that society pays a million dollars for like a lot of what we do is uh totally absurd as a society it's not even cost-efficient if you took out care and concern for human beings and and said look let's factor that out it's absurd you know it's like it's like you know you'll throw away ten thousand dollars to get a dollar and that's how we operate as a society and I think that if we're gonna survive our own progress you know as a species or certainly in this country we're gonna do things that are around mutuality and community support and we're gonna do things where people who have something can help people who don't and maybe that's three hundred dollars to buy an alternator you know maybe it's not that maybe it's somebody who doesn't have the education or resources that you or I might have who shares some wisdom that they've learned I mean it's not just all the people who have do things for the people who haven't I mean we all have and we all don't have and I'm not trying to trivialize the struggles of people who can't put food on the table like that's what we need to work so that that's not the case and it's actually not that hard to do but at the same time we need to recognize that the people that some of the things that we've done through drive to separate us and make us lonely and isolate and I think you and I have as many emotional needs and as many struggles that can be soothed by other people as somebody does who might identify as underprivileged or ill right like I said we're all in it together and but we work so damn hard to separate ourselves and you end up with maybe not everybody but most people feeling some sense of loneliness and isolation mm-hmm it's there's no easy antidote you and I have spoken a lot about the idea of creating a tribe we think about the seven of us from medical school and it was like we had this fantasy like what if we all could get jobs not only in the same city but like we could all live in the same block and we could all just sort of be one family the kids could go between the homes interchangeably meals were consumed interchangeably like it was just you know creating a tribe in the way that it would have existed 10,000 years ago but you know we still put our shirts and ties on in the morning and go to work but you but there's this closeness that seems so distant right now I mean you and I are so fortunate because of the geography in which we work that at least a few times a month we get to have a meal together but that is harder and harder to do with friends and I suspect that there are many people who go months if not years without really getting to do that because it's just too busy there's just too much to do that's mission critical right and there again is the automaticity of a value system that you know I struggle very much with how many people do I care about who've been really important in my life and I think and I and there's that we exchanged two emails a year

[01:52:51] I mean why right why is why do I not take two weeks every three months and go around and see people I care about like why don't we do that and I think again I think I do think that all paths meet him not all paths I think the majority these paths lead back to trauma that there's a way in which I feel too insecure to do that I'll step away from my work and maybe it won't be as good my work or opportunities will pass me by and I'll earn less and all these things that actually make no sense whatsoever but it's not as if I can stop them from driving me and and I don't want to sound futile about that I mean I think like there are things that we can do right and I think like you and I do some things that we might not have done even a couple of years ago right but do I think that we do enough of it no I don't and you think about those other people that you know we were in school with and care very much about and then think about people who weren't like sort of in that group that we know well and knew well and care very much about how much do we really see of them right almost nothing right and you know it's a strange thing to to have so much automaticity to our value system and we might think well I never decided I don't value that or I value you know another day of work overseeing those people okay

[01:54:12] I never actually put words to it but I've decided it right because I act in accordance with that decision and yes I'd like to be healthier about those things but I think the answer is as it's as a community that we start teaching ourselves and teaching people how to be healthier about those things because you can still be very good at what you do very successful move society ahead all these things that we want to do if we achieve and have a better sense of balance and mutuality which is why a lot of these fantasies and it's what kids say in kindergarten for their best friendly we're gonna live next door to one another right okay we're still saying that medical check left we're freaking 45 year old dudes and we still say the same thing right because I think we still have the same needs within us and we still have the same fears of loneliness and isolation and struggle in isolation so the fantasy is still there I think because there's meaning to the fantasy it's a recurrent fantasy in a lot of people that tells us something about our desperate sense of isolation and I have no basis to back this up and it probably is politically incorrect to say this but I actually don't give a [ __ ] you can be married you can have the perfect spouse you can have all that stuff going on but and I say this only being able to speak from my vantage point which is as a male

[01:55:27] I think that there are certain needs that can't be met by your spouse there are certain needs that like and again I think my wife doesn't even like hearing that like she'd like to believe understandably that every problem I have emotionally can be rectified by discussing it with her but I do think there's something different that I think there's a maybe even a degree of vulnerability that exists outside of that relationship and or maybe even there's just something gender specific like a guy needs to be with a guy sometimes a girl needs to be with a girl sometimes as far as like truly talking about some of these things and I think that for many people as they get older as they have families as they have kids as they have careers they lose sight with those other people meaning though the woman loses touch with her female friends who I think can offer her something that her husband cannot even if they're the most well-adjusted couple and similarly I mean I can't tell you the premium my place and the time I get to spend with my male friends and it's hard because as you said it often comes at the expense of time with your family

[01:56:37] I mean every minute I'm here in New York right now you and I are here we're not with our families right I mean I I think that that is a human problem I mean I think that we you know we can we see it through our own lens right but I don't think it's based upon gender gender socio-economic class sexual orientation

[01:56:56] I mean I think it's a human problem that that there's a fallacy that says that we're supposed to enter you know a committed relationship which already think about what there are people who you know might not be able to do that right might not want to do this so we're already saying de-facto that that's not okay so I think how many people were in validating already then we say okay even if you do that we're gonna put so much pressure to be everything to one another that that we guarantee almost a sense of a failure or of inadequacy why should your lovely wonderful wife think that she can be everything to you right like this is not how humans work but some house

[01:57:40] Society has told her that and then it engenders some negative feeling because both you and she being healthy people need a broader set of connections but we're taught to kind of hunker down and that's what we're supposed to do and then when we're getting away and we're doing these things with our friends that there's there's something about that that seemed kind of trivialized because we don't again we don't live in communities where and look think about it I haven't thought about this is what we think about in medical school when we were kind of living in a community and we did spend time like if we were friends then I spent time with Jill and you spend time with Brooke we were in a community so there was more of a sense of community and now we don't have that as much like that's not all the way it's supposed to be in a sense and then it engenders these unrealistic expectations of self and others and the question I would most ask about that I don't know the answer to like why don't we continue to live in a communal way and and I think that that's some of what you know communities offer people right communities that are based around religion or based around shared interests those can be very very good things for people of course like anything else the other side of that sort is they can you know that's they can be used to create cults and you know about like affiliates right and people are desperate to affiliate so you know I think if there isn't health and balance then you know we see more the negative side of things we don't have enough community affiliation so there are a lot of people who get caught up in cults or cult-like things we know more than we would we know more than we necessarily know on the surface because there are a lot of things like that that don't get defined as such or don't get you know acknowledged as such they just don't come to attention but there's a desperation for connection and for a multiplicity of connection and a variety of connection and we live in a way often that really makes no sense there's no reason why should one person be everything to one other person you know life is more complicated and more interesting and richer than that are there any books that you would recommend people read I mean I have my sort of a list of two books that I've suggested to people over time I certainly hope that anybody who's listening to this that thinks that some trauma in their life has continued to sort of yield its grip around their neck we'll look into some of these trauma based treatment facilities and ultimately seek out therapists who themselves are are well versed in trauma based therapy again you don't have to go to an inpatient place to start but I've since learned the importance of trying to vet therapists to find out who truly understands this but what other resources whether it be books or facilities or anything like I mean what kind of things can we can we leave people with to think about as they begin to navigate their own path I mean that like I said I suspect there's gonna be some people for whom this episode scratches a scab a little bit creates a little bit of bleeding what do they do now I think it's so important to take stock of one's inner dialogue we can say things to ourselves hundreds and hundreds and thousands of times over and never stop and reflect that we're saying it to ourselves so I think thinking about what's going on inside of us and talking to people that are close to us I mean most people have people that they can talk to more openly than they're talking to and that can be complemented with professionals I mean I think anyone who has no problems or issues whatsoever should never have psychotherapy right which is you know my way of trying to be clever and saying every damn human on the planet should have psychotherapy right because it's a way of understanding ourselves better it's a way of being able to commune with someone without feeling the pressure that we're burdening them like you know personal and professional relationships help us understand each other better go to a 12-step meeting helps a person understand oneself better even for no other reason by the feeling of shared humanity some of those things which may sound kind of basic I think are just of inordinate importance an ordinate importance of take stock of what's inside of you connect with people around you that may sound trite but most of us are not doing it we're not doing nearly enough of it and in terms of literature or books I mean I I tend to have very very few recommendations I'll say a couple of the standards that I say when people ask me

[02:02:08] I would consider reading que Moo's the plague you know the plague is about a city that is afflicted by the plague but it is also about the afflictions of all of us that are we all living amidst the plague and are we all living amidst threat to our life and health and safety yes we are and and I think it is it's a way of potentially thinking about in framing things inside of us this feeling often of being beset upon and needing a sense of community in a sense of mutuality that we often don't acknowledge and I think for that reason the book is of tremendous value somewhat of a very different recommendation is read some short stories by Katherine Mansfield I think that yes Chekhov was a wonderful brilliant short story writer but my favorite in terms of evoking the the realness of being human the subtle nuances of human interaction I think is actually best evoked by Mansfield and I think if we're searching for a way of identifying with our own humanity I think those two authors you know kind of can help us get there so it's not the most typical literature to recommend but

[02:03:22] I think exploring things that great writers have written that help elucidate our humanity is a good thing if one is trying to gain a greater grasp on what's going on inside of us and what may be really driving us to misery and I think those things engender compassion and compassion for self is what can ultimately lead somebody to take that step of getting help right is you have to feel like hey there's something going on inside of me that I've been hiding and that I feel really ashamed of I don't want to feel ashamed of anymore I don't want to hide anymore and in general people won't take that step unless they've engendered some compassion for themselves Paul there were so many other things I want to talk about I'm looking at my little notepad here where I had just scribbled down other things to talk about that amazingly we literally did not get through half of what I wanted to talk about we didn't get into you know the real understanding of distress tolerance the completely nuanced geeky discussions that we have over dinner about all of the different pharmacokinetics of every class of drug and every neurotransmitter I think the only real remedy for this is we have to do this again so I think there needs to be a part two of this discussion where we can get into all of these other things and and perhaps between now and then I could try and become less annoyingly long-winded [Music] despite the short tenure of this podcast

[02:04:50] I've already been given feedback by a few friends who have said Peter we are really loving your podcast but can you shorten it I would really like to just have a 30-minute podcast and I've said honestly I appreciate your feedback but that's not what I'm trying to do here what one is I want these conversations to be the conversations that we have and what we just discussed tonight the only thing that separates it from a normal discussion is we have these microphones in front of us and we're not eating a meal right I mean this is very similar to conversation you and I had three weeks ago while we were sitting around the same table eating really good Indian food right now the fact that I'm in the middle of a one-week fast makes that image particularly distressing to me right now I don't appreciate that but okay I just see part of how I keep myself in business is by causing trauma so just you just cost a [ __ ] ton of trauma and me by reminding me of that incredible lamb vindaloo that I was eating sitting right where you're sitting now and I'm not going to have any of it tonight well Paul I can't thank you enough for all of the insights you've brought to all of these topics from depression suicide trauma shame all of these things that are I think near and dear to our hearts but more importantly kind of near and dear to the hearts of pretty much everyone who's listening I know I said there's a lot more I'd like to get into I think we should certainly plan to sit down again and talk more about this stuff I I believe that there's a lot here that that people can take with them and hopefully at least take some steps that that kind of improve the quality of their lives I've said it before I will continue to say it

[02:06:29] I don't think it makes much sense to fixate on living longer if you can't on some level rectify being happier and that seems to be you know if we talk about diabetes and all these other things being diseases of civilization there may be no greater disease of civilization than our unhappiness yeah it's probably a good time for me to say you know what I truly believe which is I'm honored that you have had beyond here and I really do mean that I do think that the things that I have to say from the mental health perspective not because I'm saying them but because mental health undergirds you know our ability to live good lives are so important and I think it's a testament to you know your sort of relentless drive to understand things better that make a difference to the lives of the people that you take care of that has you looking at elements of the substructure that people often ignore so I consider it an honor and a privilege to be on your podcast and and to be able to talk about things that I think are really are so important and that are just so often overlooked so I thank you for the opportunity to get the word out in a way that I hope ultimately helps some people thank you
