This clip is from episode 296 ‒ Foot health: preventing common injuries, enhancing strength and mobility, & picking footwear

In this clip, they discuss:

- What Is a Bunion, Really? – It’s not just a bump—it's caused by transverse instability, where the bone at the base of the big toe shifts outward
-  Why So Many Have Bunions – A loss of foot control, often at the junction of the midfoot and forefoot, leads to that telltale bony protrusion
- What Are Hammer Toes? – Toes 2–5 start “hammering” the ground due to muscle imbalance between short and long toe extensors and flexors
-  Footwear’s Impact Is Massive – Toe boxes that don’t allow the toes to splay are a major contributor to bunion formation
-  The Real Fix: Strengthening, Not Surgery – Strengthening foot muscles and using the right footwear is more effective than just pinning bones

## AI Summary

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features a discussion with Dr. Courtney Conley about common foot conditions, specifically focusing on bunions and hammer toes. The conversation provides detailed explanations of these conditions' anatomical basis, causes, and treatment options. The discussion emphasizes how modern footwear and lifestyle choices contribute to these conditions, and how they can often be prevented or managed through proper foot care and appropriate footwear choices.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Bunions are defined as transverse instability at the metatarsal medial cuneiform junction [00:00:00]
- Bunions involve bone shifting to the outside of the foot [00:00:27]
- Surgical repairs often involve bone shaving and pinning the metatarsal to the cuneiform [00:01:13]
- Hammer toes affect toes 2-5 primarily, though can affect the big toe [00:03:26]
- Muscle imbalance between short and long toe extensors contributes to hammer toes [00:04:10]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Wear shoes with appropriate toe box width [00:01:42]
- Early intervention is crucial for prevention [00:01:42]
- Avoid constant foot bracing which can lead to weakness [00:03:26]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Focus on strengthening foot muscles rather than just bracing [00:03:26]
- Pay attention to wear patterns on shoe inserts for pressure distribution [00:04:10]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"You don't come out of the womb with a bunion" [00:01:42]
"If you were to walk around with your hands in mittens for 20 years, you shouldn't be surprised when your hands don't function" [00:06:36]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What specific exercises can help prevent bunions and hammer toes?
- How can one determine the right type of footwear for their foot type?
- What are the success rates for different types of bunion surgeries?
- How does genetics play a role in foot conditions?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Yeah. What exactly is a bunion? Everybody's heard of them. >> So, and a lot of people have them. >> Um, it's a transverse instability. Not where you see the bunion here at the metatarsal medial cuneaform. When someone can't control motion at the foot, >> sort of the junction between the midfoot and the forefoot. >> Correct.

[00:00:27] Then they will start to have this instability. This bone, all a bunion is, by the way, is this bone basically shifting to the outside. >> Yeah. So, anybody who's seen it will, what you notice is you're looking down at a person's foot and you'll see this huge out pouching in what's otherwise the widest part of the foot. Looks like it just got a whole bunch wider and it's pointing out. But when you see the skeleton, it's much easier to understand why that's happening. >> Yeah. So, it's this guy going that way. >> And a lot of people have these surgically repaired. >> Yes. >> What are they doing surgically to repair that? >> We could talk about this for a long time. Um, just some facts first with those surgeries. Okay. Um, a lot of them are not successful. And

[00:01:13] I'm not here to, you know, there is a time and a place. There is a time and a place. But I would be very cautious about getting foot surgeries, right, for symptoms. So what they'll do is they can either shave part of the bone down and then realign the toe >> and often times they will pin the metatarsal to the cuneaoform so they stabilize where most people have that instability.

[00:01:42] Once you start pinning things together, you might take care of alignment, >> right? But you've done nothing to to strengthen the muscle that allowed this to >> correct >> get there. >> And you know the conversation of um my mom has a bunion, my grandma has a bunion. And my response to that is you don't come out of the womb with a bunion. You might inherit connective tissue laxity for example or there might be um hypermobility issues. But if we know that just like we talked about with the kids earlier, the earlier interventions, right, you get them in the right foot footwear. You make sure they're in shoes, right, that have a toe box where the toes can actually spllay, especially if you know that your mother has a bunion. >> Mhm. Um, I think what's fascinating about the big toe is if you look at your nail bed, some people that have bunions, the nail bed will be flat and it'll just look like it's adducting. Right. So the here is the bunion. >> Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah. >> Right. But the nail bed is flat. When you see that, it's typically from footwear. when you see the nail bed and it's actually rotated because you see some of those people right where the nail bed's kind of turned in and there's looks like it's a rotational issue. >> Yeah. >> You know for certain they can't control rotation >> which is cool because now you're like okay let's I mean I have one of the reasons I got into all of this was I have bilateral bunions on both of my feet due to the fact that I was constantly in point shoes. And then my solution to that was I'm just going to start bracing my feet because they hurt.

[00:03:26] So they just got weaker and weaker and then I was like some this is not right. So we started strengthening them getting us in the right shoes and it's different different ball game. >> And what's a hammer toe? While we're at the topic of common pathology. >> So bunion very common. Hammer toes are basically when the toes start to hammer the ground. All of them are just two through five. >> Two through five. The big toe can hammer. It's just not as common as two through five. And this is why when you look at hammer toes, so this would be the the top of my foot. We have extensors, short toe extensors, but we also have long toe extensors.

[00:04:10] So on the top of the foot, the short toe extensors are doing a lot of work and the long toe extensors are not. Yeah, this is one of those things where if you're listening to us, this is very difficult to understand. It's it's why watching what you're saying makes a lot of sense. And and and again, just so folks understand, the extensors would be pulling back, the flexors would curl forward. And so it seems counterintuitive to say how can a hammer toe be in part driven by this extensor phenomenon? Well, if the short extensors, the ones that attach with a shorter moment arm are fired up and the long ones are relaxed, it actually looks like a hyperflexion. >> Yes. And for people who have pain along the bottom of their foot, so along their metatarscils, um, if you take out your insert of your shoe and you see a lot of wear underneath like the second or third metatarsal, you know you're probably walking around with too much pressure going through there. >> So on the bottom of the foot, it's the exact opposite. I have my short flexors that aren't doing anything and my long flexors who are. So hammer toes is it's a muscle imbalance due to a weakness in the foot. And what do you attribute the root of that to? If the bunion seems predisposed, um, not putting aside genetics and other things like that, but just environmentally, if the predisposing feature of a bunion is shoes that are pushing the big toe in, what is the environmental trigger that is most commonly driving a hammer toe? >> I think it's the same thing. I think that we have not been paying attention to our feet for a very long period of time. And if you think about if you were to walk around with your hands in mittens >> Yeah. >> for 20 years, you shouldn't be surprised when your hands don't function. >> Yeah. >> I'm Peter Aia.
