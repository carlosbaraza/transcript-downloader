Mike Joyner is a physician-researcher and one of the world’s leading experts on human performance and exercise physiology. In this episode, Mike discusses how to combat age-related declines in health and fitness levels by using various modes of exercise to improve lifespan and healthspan. Mike explains the impact of exercise on the autonomic nervous system, blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, heart rate recovery, and max heart rate. He dives deep into VO2 max, including how it’s measured, what is driving it, and how to improve it. Mike provides training insights for the average person, including training volume and exercise intensity as well as simple metrics to track. Furthermore, he gives his take on the theoretical “J-curve” relationship between exercise and longevity, as well as whether possible health dangers may be associated with excessive exercise.

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA it is such a pleasure to be uh at least virtually sitting here with you today um as I was kind of alluding to a moment ago you know if I were to sort of look at all the people I've had on this podcast so far and kind of asked the question when was the first time I became familiar with their body of work um you know you would be pretty far up there in terms of duration so you know growing up uh you know Endurance Sports were were always sort of something that that meant the world to me and once I even made that decision to go to medical school a big part of it at least was you know kind of understanding physiology better and so you know it's been 25 or 30 years that I've been reading your studies uh so it's in some ways it's a long time coming to to finally be sitting down with you and uh hope to meet you in person one day yeah Peter thanks much it's been uh great to be able to chance to visit with you today thank you for inviting me and I'm glad somebody's been paying attention to what

[00:01:06] I've been doing for the last 25 or 30 years so it's a very validating thank you so let's talk a little bit about your your background you're a physician by training uh I I believe you're an anesthesiologist correct correct uh so tell me a little bit about that so you know you decided in medical school you wanted to do anesthesia right but I you've always had a lifelong interest in exercise and exercise physiology did you just view anesthesia as the most logical conduit to better understand human physiology so Peter before I went to medical school I actually volunteered to be a subject in a study on the lactate threshold or Anor robic threshold when I was 19 at the University of Arizona and luckily there were excellent physiologists here but a couple of younger Physicians came over from the med school and it became clear to me when I was 19 or 20 that if I wanted to have a career as a research physiologist doing inv I studies in other words putting catheters in people in humans I it might be wise to go to medical school so this was always sort of my vision starting at about age 20 or 21 and then what happened is I was thinking of going to

[00:02:12] Cardiology or pulmonary medicine and I was working at the at the Tucson VA at one time doing a surgery rotation and I saw what they did in anesthesia which is a lot like an exercise test you're measuring people's breathing you're measuring their blood pressure their heart rate and you're giving them drugs that affect their autonomic nervous system and I've certainly done a lot of that so I saw it as the flip side of the same Co coin and so it it just sort of happened and and um it is strange though to have uh pursued this vision for you know over 40 years now yeah I remember having the same thoughts when I did my anesthesia rotation I can't even remember if anesthesia was a required rotation in med school I don't think it was but it was positioned as sort of a very good thing to do and I I agree with that and

[00:02:59] I had a feel even though I think by that point I knew I was going to go into surgery but I I absolutely loved it I I think as a as a sort of physiology geek um anesthesia and critical care for that matter are both two remarkable Specialties that are um you know the like you know the tip of the Spear of what physiology is well you know it's interesting too Peter because uh when you think about exercise or people climbing mountains or adapting to some unusual environment you know the the the brain stem back there has to do all sorts of incredible things to maintain what we call homeostasis or the internal environment in a way that allows you to survive and thrive well in in anesthesia and critical care you turn those mechanisms off and the Physicians and the nurses really become the patient's brain stem as they regulate the breathing of the patient the blood pressure of the patient the heart rate and so forth so so again it's the flip side of the same coin and and as soon as

[00:03:57] I saw what the anesthesiologist did at the Tucson VA it it just sort of clicked so where did you go on to do your residency in anesthesia so at the Mayo Clinic and so what happened is I got out of medical school in in the spring or early summer of 87 and I moved here I've been here ever since so 35 years in a couple of weeks and so you uh did where did you grow up did you grow up in a warm climate I grow up in

[00:04:23] Tucson so what I mean obviously the Mayo Clinic is a great program but presumably there other great in these are programs that W in the middle of a place like Rochester no offense to those from Rochester so what what Drew what Drew you to Mayo well I I'd read this paper uh a review article about skeletal muscle blood flow the regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow and there were a lot of new ideas in the middle 80s about the regulation of scal muscle blood flow and the world's leading expert was a man named John Shepard who is a very senior member of The Faculty here and I wrote him a letter and um he you know was before email and stuff so he was friends with the head of the department a man named Allan cesler and

[00:05:02] John took it over to him and uh I wanted to be able to both do my residency and spend time in the lab and I was able to work with Dr Shepard and and our department and our Residency program were very research friendly so that's really why I decided to come to Rochester but I thought I thought I'd stay you know three or four years and go back to Tucson So that obviously didn't happen I don't see that happening yeah so um let's talk about exercise you know people who listen to this podcast know that um I'm I'm really passionate about this idea of longevity right we think about longevity through the lens of five sort of modifiable behaviors exercise sleep nutrition um emotional health and all the tools around distress tolerance and then exogenous molecules those are the five things that as far as

[00:05:51] I can tell mostly you can manipulate and corre they can both impact your lifespan and your health span um four of those are kind of behavior avior Al right all the medications aren't really behavioral in the sense that you know compliance is relatively straightforward the other ones really require a shift in in in behavior and in and in mindset and of these I I just again maybe we all have our biases in our blind spots but I just think exercise is in a league of its own in terms of its potential uh both on the lifespan axis so it you know its ability to extend life and reduce all cause mortality is well documented we'll talk about that right uh but also on the health span side it has no rival so it's for that reason I think that we spend a lot of time inside our practice focusing on exercise it is really the biggest pillar within what we do uh because it has the most impact and unfortunately or fortunately it's it's also the most challenging one I think to uh to get people to change their um existing behaviors around because the time commitment is significant so uh let's start with some of the basics just for folks who aren't completely up to speed what what would you say if you're at a party and someone came up to you and said Mike I understand you're really into this exercise thing can can you explain to me why it is that exercise helps you live longer I I think there's a couple of things Peter and it's multifactorial the first thing is that you know the risk factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease all more cause mortality are all influenced by exercise and physical activity these would be blood pressure diabetes uh to some extent lipids and cholesterol and also how you deal with stress so I think you get the big three there there are some other kind of uh new age or second second wave risk factors like endothelial function the lining of the blood vessels uh in your body that improve with exercise the way what's called your autonomic nervous system and and people may have heard of vagal tone or heart rate variability that's also influenced positively by exercise so I think there's five or things but what's interesting is when you add up each one you know a modest increase in cholesterol a modest reduction in blood pressure those sorts of things when you add them up you get X you know percent

[00:08:12] Improvement in in health uh span life expectancy any metric you want to use but when you look at the epidemiology people who do the sorts of things you just mentioned uh have a much bigger benefit than just the the simple sum of the other risk factors so there does seem to be some sort of synergy here or some sort of X Factor that we don't really understand yet but again yeah go ahead no no you you go ahead I was just going to say this collection of

[00:08:39] Lifestyle related factors uh which are are are really critical and again uh the autonomic nervous system blood pressure uh lipids the lining of the blood vessels and and diabetes would be the big five I want to dive into a couple of these in in depth one of the things I would say at the uh before we do so is you know you've thought a lot and you've looked a lot at this literature and you you know one can one can say look the epidemiology is so overwhelming correct that it's I mean the hazard ratios are are sort of absurd right when we when we're used to looking at a field like nutrition and looking at the hazard ratios in nutrition they're very small in fact they're so small um and also so inconsistent that it becomes almost impossible to assign a more morality benefit or addition to almost anything you can eat I mean literally jelly beans to bacon to kale the hazard ratios are trivial and they flip-flop from month to month correct well and yeah let me tell you something that's really interesting it's good you brought this up so I'm working on a review article on related topics and one of the things I'm looking at is all of what you might describe as natural experiments uh where you have two groups of people that otherwise similar exposed to different things and that's a long long uh long use tool in epidemiology and and people are now using it in economics and Behavioral

[00:10:09] Sciences and in fact these natural experiments The Economist just got a Nobel Prize for them a couple of years ago but the classic one is is the London bus driver bus conductor story led by Jeremy Morris uh after World War II where they showed the Physically Active conductors who are walking up and down the the buses all day had much much lower rates of cardiovascular disease than the the sedentary uh driver bus drivers and it was about 50% and they had similar things with telephone operators versus people who were out walking around doing things and what's interesting is you look at that 50% it's it's incredibly consistent incredibly consistent those studies studies of long shoran studies of Harvard alumni uh there's one in the last 10 or 15 years of uh 50,000 male and 25,000 female finishers of the Vasa lowet 90 kilometer cross country ski race in Sweden and they compared them to match controls from the Swedish record system and they showed again about a 50% reduction in cardiovasc and all cause mortality there's data from the National Cancer

[00:11:19] Institute showing the same sorts of things and showing you know four or five or six year increase in life expectancy uh you know among the people who who got a substantial amount of physical activity or structured exercise either one yeah and I I think the the sort of take-home point for The Listener is the unlike nutritional epidemiology where the risk increases and risk reductions are very very small and they're never consistent right they you know I mean there's some things that are consistent and consistently small uh for example you know vegetarians consistently have a small redu uction in mortality which of course then gets to the next point which is what are the confounders and this is where I want to kind of talk about it with exercise um and this is where the natural experiments are much better on the exercise front than they are on the nutrition front you see going back to the example you gave which is a very famous one of the uh the the the guys running up and down the buses the sort of conductor guys versus the drivers that's a great natural experiment um because it's really not amendable to a choice and you would you would be less likely to believe that the bus driver who sits there is also making poor choices relative to the other guy when he's not at work in other words we wouldn't really have a reason to believe that he's more likely to be a smoker he's more likely to eat you know make poor food choices Etc whereas when you look at sort of the vegetarian to non-vegetarian uh dietary pattern in nutrition it's pretty clear that a vegetarian diet is very restrictive diet and therefore the person who's making that choice is likely very healthc conscious in a number of other ways corre some behaviors yeah exactly some of which are easy to measure and correct for like smoking but many of which are not and and that's what sort of makes the nutritional thing harder uh the exercise thing is pretty profound so let's let's explain to people what it means when you have a hazard ratio of 0.5 which means a 50% reduction in all cause mortality what's the time frame that that's usually looking at and how does that translate to you know a fiveyear increase in life expectancy the the way you would say it is is that you know the relative risk of dying of of heart disease in any any given period of time whether it's a year five years 10 years whatever the stud's doing is is 50% lower but obviously not everybody dies of cardiovascular disease people die of other things and so then you have to trans translate that into sort of

[00:13:54] Life years of life gained and typically the years of life gained are somewhere on on on the order if you account for smoking of three to five years something like that and then if you you look at um the concept of Health span you know you may get six or eight years of of improved Health span so Health span as you know Peter is is how long you can you know how disability free you are and and so you have you know four or five year increase in life expectancy and a four or five year additional increase in health span and the idea you know is to live a long time and then die quickly with minimal disability so so kind of one of the ways we try to get around this idea of the sort of vagueness of freedom from disease and disability is to make it very very granular and we do this by creating this model we have called the centenarian de cathlon which says if you go out to your marginal decade and we Define the marginal decade as the last decade of your life so again we don't know when that is but let's just make the math easy and say oh that's going to be 79 to 89 or 8 1 to 91 you're in your marginal decade what are sort of the athletic uh events and the activities of daily living that you want to be able to do but we do it by making people cross off things they do not want to do so we make this a you have to opt out of things right and uh they're very specific right so it's like walking three miles in one hour you know being able to climb X number of stairs you know 60 stairs that are 8 inches in one minute being able to carry 20 pounds of groceries a certain distance being able to get up off the floor with at most one hand of support so it's very specific stuff and I think for most people the initial reaction is well that's really easy like I can do most of these things today but you know when you're a 45-year-old reading that I hope that's easy I don't think they appreciate the precipitous deine that will occur without deliberate training and it's for that reason that I think exercise has more potential to offset all of those things than anything else sleep nutrition certainly any medication uh and and so that to me that's really what health span comes down to it's right it's not just I'm not disabled but it's

[00:16:21] I'm really thriving yeah I'm engaged I can engage in what I want to engage in yeah and I think Peter you've hit the nail on the head and and I think that that what we see uh in those decades there's what's really instructive is if you look at uh the decline in performance in age group swimming running cycling uh rowing really any any sport where there's pretty good recordkeeping is people can start to decline at age 30 without training uh you can push that back to age 40 with training in other words if you work out every day intentionally and relatively hard but then something happens to people in their middle 70s where there seems to be you know kind of a a more a steeper rise and what's interesting about that steeper rise is it it seems to shift from sort of a cardiopulmonary limitation to sort of a skeletal muscle strength filty situation and and what you described in terms of getting up off the floor I think something like 70 year 70% of 70 year olds can't get off the floor not one hand two hands just can't get off the floor yep and you start looking at and and we both from from being doctors if you look at what happens when a person in that age group

[00:17:32] Falls it's just no fun so so if you look at at at at what really takes people out it's things like Falls its inability to to to to do things and so what happens is is is uh you know walking three miles in an hour takes some cardiopulmonary uh capability but not a ton just some but whereas being able to go up uh you know the stairs takes more being able to get off the floor takes more so I think uh one of the things that people have to think about especially as they get into their 40s and 50s is is adding strength or some sort of circuit training and agility training to their program and so

[00:18:11] I think you hit the nail on the head and one of the things I do is is I'm 63 almost 64 is I have the jump rope my mother gave to me when I was 14 she gave me a beautiful boxers jump rope leather with ball bearings and the works you know and I I carry it with me when I travel because you can always jump rope even if it's out in the parking out of a hotel you can people think you're nuts but it's a you know but it works it's a terrific terrific exercise it it actually is for a number of reasons including foot reactivity which is also one of those things that can cont you know the lack of foot reactivity is something that can to the fall so you're you're getting the cardio benefit the coordination benefit and also this this this gentle foot reactivity without and it depends if you know how to skip like a boxer you don't have to really pound your knees as well correct and and the other thing is you do that with some body weight you know some some things as simple as push-ups or or planks and if there's a place to do some pull-ups uh you're good to go yeah there's so many things you said there Mike that I want to go back on and just make sure people really capture because it's so important um there's and I we'll probably find this study and I'll link to it but there's an amazing study that demonstrates um like muscle mass changes strength changes and activity changes in men and women as they age and it's one of those things where you don't actually need to understand the the statistics to be able to see the figure and it's exactly as you describe it at the age of 75 there is a cliff that is so violent you can't believe what you're watching and at it's at that Cliff where physical activity level declines like this it just goes boom muscle mass goes Doom strength Doom same thing and you know of course it begs the age-old question right is the patient losing strength because they are no longer active or are they no longer active because they have lost strength my view is it's both I think these things feed off each other um which one's the first insult I suspect it's probably the loss of strength that contributes to the loss of activity but then I think those feed back and accelerates this thing you really get into a death spiral and and I think that's why it becomes important to keep exercising relatively hard as you get older at least a few days a week to to slow this decline you know and there are remarkable examples there are some

[00:20:35] Swedish cross country skers men who were you know world and Olympic champions in the in the 40s and 50s who remained active as many of them were woodsmen and lived in the in the countryside remained very active skiing and so forth they were studied into the in their 80s now you could argue that there was something special about these guys to begin with or they would not have become uh you know champion champion athletes but their rates of decline were were quite modest and more importantly um you know their their

[00:21:07] Fitness levels were similar to what you would see in in people in very early middle age the other interesting thing about that is the classic studies from the 1960s um these fighter pilots you know Navy and Marine and Air Force fighter pilots were sending outer space these were incredibly fit guys they'd go up for a week and come back completely atrophied couldn't stand up and really in bad shape and in ' 66 NASA commissioned Folks at at at the

[00:21:35] University of Texas uh Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas to put five College age males two athletes at bed rest and and they had tremendous reductions in their their Fitness over just three weeks of bed rest and interestingly Ben LaVine and his group uh in Dallas along with the late Jerry Mitchell brought these same men back 30 years later so now they were you know early 50s and it's incredible but 3 weeks of bed rest uh you know caused losses of physiological function associated with 30 years of Aging so so it's an incredible study and and and that's one of the things that is instructive uh those sorts of small studies and that's why it's so important to to just avoid inactivity of of any type and whether it's low-grade physical activity whether it's walking the dog whether it's gardening whether it's you know taking a flight of stairs once in a while or intentional working out it's really the way to go and and as you point out really really in those lifestyle factors you mentioned really sort of overwhelms things over overwhelms almost everything else yeah you you mentioned and alluded to the danger of a fall in in later life and um this is something we've been doing a lot of research on internally um given our concern around bone mineral density in the Asian population um the mortality when you look at 65y old olds and up who suffer a fall that results in the fracture of any part of the hip or femur uh at one year depending on the study it can be you know as low as 25% as high as 60% yeah the magic number is usually around 4050 yeah again it's I want people to understand what we just what we just said you take all the 65y olds and you look at those who fall and the fall results in a in a broken hip or femur and you ask the question how many of those people will be alive in 12 months the answer is half of them correct correct and and the other half aren't the other half it's not like the other half are are uh yeah they're not they're not back to themselves necessarily no exactly you know and that's exactly right so you you want to avoid a major health it like that for sure you know and the other thing Peter there's a couple other things that have really hit me as we've talked one is is this man named Lester brlo who was this very famous epidemiologist who who um died in his late 90s was at UCLA for many years and he studied people in in

[00:24:05] Oakland in the late 50s and early 60s who made it to 90 a and the sorts of four or five uh things you talked about he he identified the people in Oakland who made it to 90 and they were non-smokers they weren't obese they remained physically active they ate modestly they stayed engaged in life and there was just five or six things that they did and the same is true in the honolu Heart Project when they' looked at a huge number of Japanese American males same exact stuff that you mentioned not so they weren't as focused on The small molecules but but but exactly what you've described and then I think about you know we've talked about natural experiments at the Cooper Clinic they've looked at at people's Fitness levels now that's not exactly the same as physical activity uh but but in general the fittest people are also the most active and they divided people into three or four groups of fitness and then had them look at a so-called healthy eating index so you know were you a junk food junky did you eat okay or were you really conscious of your diet and and the healthy eating index uh in people that weren't particularly fit did have something to do with all cause mortality but among among the fittest people there was very little impact of diet on on on the outcomes which is sort of interesting and always brings me back to the famous quote in a a book about distance running called once a runner where somebody said yeah if the furnace is hot enough you can burn anything even Big Mac now you have to take that with a grain of salt but or I guess we worried about diet maybe not a grain of salt but but I but

[00:25:39] I think it does kind of give you the take on message but just about what a powerful thing exercise is I I completely agree and and I know it's very um there's a very common Mantra that says oh you can't outrun a bad diet and I would argue that's probably not true I think you can outrun a bad diet but it's pretty hard to do and most people don't understand the amount to do it that's great because you know again I'm I'm looking up these studies so I've looked up these classic studies like that and so so there there's this incredible study from the 50s of of people who worked at a jute plant in in uh India and they categorize people on incredibly Physically Active you know doing manual labor hacking away on on on jute to make I think linen or or rope they were going to make rope with this stuff all the way to office workers and as you got as you got more and more uh

[00:26:30] Physically Active people got lighter or as you got more inactive they got heavier but what was interesting is is people that were in the middle middle kind of rung of Occupational physical activity also had slightly lower caloric consumption remain very trim so certainly you know uh if people are physically active enough if you read the old papers about what Lumberjacks were eating you know uh when they were chopping on wood all day long I mean it's 5 6,000 calories a day uh the the old order Amish who walk around and do manual labor all day long and don't have you know don't have uh don't have tractors and stuff like that they eat an awfully lot and and very few of them are obese so so I I think you can outrun a bad diet or can out exercise a bad diet in a modern uh high calorie low physical activity world I think is the caveat that has to go to that one yeah and yet when you look at athletes that are doing insane amounts of exercise most of them have a hard time keeping on weight well there there's yeah there's terrific study about the tur Fran you know where where where they get done every day and they're they're just handing them food and um you know these people are eating ad lib except when they're on the bike and even when they are on the bike and they have a hard time and they're eating 6,000 calories a day they weigh about 150 pounds yeah some and they have a hard time keeping their weight we they they are catabolic throughout the tour they finish correct in pretty bad shape correct they they they they look like you know uh you know not surv not death camp survivors but but people who certainly haven't had a lot to eat for a few weeks so let's go back to something you said at the outset which was the impact of exercise on the autonomic nervous system correct explain to folks what the autonomic nervous system is how it differs from the sympathetic nervous system and why it plays such an important role in our health and of course how exercise impacts it when we think about the nervous system normally we think about our brain our eyes our ears and and our senses and also our ability to grab things move our muscles that sort of thing and you know feel pain or feel heat or cold or or or or sense the environment but your autonomic nervous system is what controls your internal environment and and that's called you know the Malo internal or whatever is is from the French a long long time ago and it's called homeostasis so so you know we can increase our metabolism 10 or 20 fold with exercise but our our body temperature only Rises a degree or two and so this happens due to the actions of the autonomic nervous system now there are two branches of the autonomic nervous system there's the sympathetic nerves and the parasympathetic nerves and these used to be kind of categorized as fight or flight and you would either you know uh uh activate especially the sympathetic nerves if you needed to fight fight or fly run away and whereas the parasympathetic nerves were seen as what happened when you were asleep when you're digesting your food so on and so forth but it turns out there's kind of more of a balance and a ying and a Yang between the two that happen all the time but the the parasympathetic nerves and the most notable one is the Vagas they control uh part of your heart rate make your heart rate slower they also tend to lower blood pressure and they're critical to digest your food uh and uh that's one side the other side is the autonomic nervous system nerves that increase your heart rate uh stimulate your your blood vessels to constrict St uh help your muscles contract harder and also do things like make you sweat and so that's that's really uh the difference between the autonomic uh or the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system and the key thing to remember is that they help you regulate the internal environment and that exercise really keeps these things tuned up and by having your autonomic nervous system a bit better tuned up it it can do a better job regulating your internal environment the classic example being for examp your your blood pressure now of course what everybody knows and we're going to talk in a moment about V2 max testing and how that's done because

[00:30:46] I want to get into the Weeds on that but when we have our patients tested uh you know we have a protocol we look at their blood pressure before and then we look at their blood pressure throughout um and then we want to look where they are percentile wise the at the max exertion what's their blood pressure and um without exception a person's blood pressure goes up when we do a a V2 Max test so you take somebody whose blood pressure is 115 over 75 at the outset they'll easily be 160 over 95 or a 100 and that's completely normal and healthy even higher if they're if you measured it while they're weightlifting yeah yeah exactly right so so explain to folks why it is that during exercise nothing looks good right blood pressure is high heart rate's high heart rate variability is low what is it about the recovery phase from exercise that produces a net positive effect even though in the moment exercise presumably is doing things that are not necessarily in our body's best interest in the in that moment I would say they are in their best interest because what happens Peter is is the system uh shifts a little bit to kind of Meet the demands of the skeletal muscle you got to be able to contract the muscles to exercise and again that's sort of consistent with the fight ORF flight thing if you're going to run away or or be in a fight you want to be able to contract your muscles and so to to do that you need to to send more blood flow to those muscles and one of the ways you do that is by increasing your blood pressure more BL pressure equals more flow and the other thing you got to do is increase the pumping function of your heart at rest people's uh you know heart is beating about 5 lers or a little over a gallon a minute uh during in moderate exercise it can be uh you know 10 lers a minute during heavy exercise 15 or 20 and Elite athletes uh who are are are very trained have very large Hearts it can be 30 or 40 liters a minute so what happens is you're pumping all that blood out against these blood vessels and so your blood pressure Rises so it's a completely normal thing uh to think about and and to to to to to generate that large cardiac output cardiac output is heart rate times stroke volume that's amount with each squeeze of the heart and so naturally you're going to want increase your heart rate so that's what happens but then when you stop as you mentioned heart rate Falls blood pressure Falls and and things look probably better than they did it in somebody who is untrained and hasn't exercised what do we know about the rate of recovery Mike there's something called heart rate recovery hrr that is uh pretty interesting metric um tell tell us what we know about hrr so people do maximum exercise test and their heart ratees you know 150 160 180 whatever their age is and and you know 220 minus your age is an interesting number but there's a lot of Patient to Patient or personto person variability so what happens is how fast does your heart rate go back down to to some number you know does it how fast does it get till it's under 100 how fast till it goes back to

[00:33:48] Baseline whatever So the faster it goes down the faster it goes down the better the action of your vagal nerve the nerve that slow your heart rate the vagus nerve is also responsible mostly for your heart rate variability and that means that that that and this nerve also is is suppresses funny heartbeats and is protective when it's it's in good shape against uh you know arrhythmias and and ventricular tacac cardia ventricular fibrillation sudden death all of those things and so heart rate recovery heart rate variability all of those things are indirect markers of what we call vagal tone or the or vagal activity and and that's a good thing now heart rate varability can be quite quite genetic right Mike the the absolute number in milliseconds between any two individuals can be quite distinct and it seems to be not nearly as modifiable as some other factors is that have you found that to be the case you know I I would say again it depends on what sorts of training people have been doing what they're what what they've been exposed to but but in general you know most people can get a nice training braid of cardio which again is vagal tone and most people if they're trained can can uh go from you know slow heart rate recovery to fast heart faster heart rate recovery and and and also have more heart rate variability so I think I think worrying about the differences in the initial

[00:35:19] Baseline Peter while interesting and what they might be attributable to is probably less important than the fact that that they're modifiable as you mention very early uh you know as they say at the top of the show yeah so let's talk about this V2 Max test because we're going to talk about what it means and and you know how predictive it might be of an individual's uh mortality so let's just start by um explaining to people what you do when a person comes into the lab right so what you do is you get them on a bike or a treadmill you put some EKG electrodes on them and they either run on the treadmill or ride a bike and they have a nose clip on if you're going to measure it directly and and either a face mask or a mouthpiece that they breathe and that allows us to measure how much oxygen they breathe in or air they breathe in how much air they breathe out we know that the air has 21% oxygen coming in if we measure the amount of oxygen in the expired air we can make an estimate of how much oxygen has been consumed and so what happens is when people start to exercise size they go from using about 3 and 1 12 MLS per kg per minute so think about you know or or or maybe 250 MLS or 300 ml so like 10 or 12 ounces of oxygen per minute right and an unfit you know person in their 30s or 40s can typically increase that about eight or 10 fold to say in in in to to say 30 or 35 yeah to 30 and that would be that would be 30 35 or about 3 lers a minute right and with training most people can increase things at least 10 or 20% and if you have some ability and or you train very hard some people can almost double it and so what happens is that once your V2 Max goes up again just like physical activity it's a measure of of physical fitness and it's also linked to all cause mortality so people the fitter you are are the the lower your chance of dying in the next year two years 5 years 10 years and it's it for many years they thought that thing sort of plateaued at what they call about 10 or 12 Mets a met mean you're resting metabolic rate so you had to be able to get 10 10 Mets and 10 Mets is being able to run one mile in about 10 minutes roughly for the average person and and now people have shown a group in in

[00:37:52] Henry Ford in Detroit have shown that that continues to rise even up to 15 16 Mets so people that are quite fit continue to to to gain uh you know benefit in terms of all cause mortality I mentioned the cross country skiers earlier and while they didn't do V2 Max test in those people the people who had completed the most races and done the races the fastest so people who had both been active for the longest period of time and probably were the fittest also had lower lower all cause mortality than people who had not not compared to sedentary peers but compared to people done a few races a little bit slower so yeah Peak Fitness Matters yeah when we look at that that there so there's a paper and jamama that I think is by far the most compelling description of this phenomenon a couple things are noteworthy about it I've talked about this in a previous AMA because it's it's really one of the I would consider one of the 10 most influential papers that I um have read in terms of changing how I think about uh you know Health span and lifespan um as you said said the relationship is monotonic and it does not Plateau so correct it's that's that's an important thing to to appreciate which is this is a more is better phenomenon and very few things in physiology are more is better yeah usually physiology behaves in U's and upside down U's or maybe J's and things or or or whatever exactly sigmoid curves but this is not case here this study that we're talking about put people into the bottom 25th percentile you know 25th to 50th percentile 50th to 75th and then the last group it basically divided into you know 75th to 97 and A5 and then they had that little sliver of people that they called Elite that were at the top two and a half percentile and all cause mortality just went lower and lower and lower and lower correct and if you looked at the hazard ratio the other way because we often think about Hazard ratios in Risk reduction but if you look about it in

[00:39:57] Risk increase when you compared the people in the top two and a half% uh of V2 Max to the bottom 25% the hazard ratio moving in that direction was 5.04 my memory Serv me correctly that means there's a fivefold increase in all caused mortality between the fittest 2 and a half% and the least corre 25% and even when you took something less extreme I believe if you looked at the least fit 25% to the third quartile so the 50th to the 75th percentile the hazard ratio was still about just just below three I think it was 2.75 is which was kind of right on par with the increase in mortality that you would see from having endstage renal disease which is by the way greater than the hazard ratio associated with smoking yeah no no being unfit is an incredible risk factor you know and people like Frank Booth have argued that that it should be you know for lack of a better word the risk factor and Jill

[00:41:04] Barnes one of my fellows at the time she's now at the University of Wisconsin a faculty member she and I wrote wrote a um wrote a editorial for male clinic proceedings maybe 5 10 years ago where we said look if people had you know 12 13 14 met Peak Exercise capacity other than doing cancer screening you could probably just ignore everything else now you know I mean mean and that's a little bit I don't think anybody's ready to go there the sorts of people who do health screening and that sort of thing but if you screened people for physical fitness and again just did the routine kind of cancer screening and you could even argue that you could probably cut back on the routine cancer screening for most things except for skin cancers because fit people tend to be outside a bit more you can make that argument yeah you make it with a straight face and the data is there to support it and I would belt in suspenders it and say but look I'd still do the cancer screening I'd still consider aggressive lipid management and things like that but but you're absolutely right I mean there's really no intervention that we have that's going to rival it well and and I think I think you mentioned lipids uh Peter and I think there's a couple things you got to remember one especially for people who pick it up late in life you know exercise is not a vaccine and and one of the the most incredible studies ever done again we're talking about these sort of one in in of one experiment of nature sort of things there was a man named Clarence dear he won the Boston Marathon seven times was born I think in 1888 or 1890 also won a medal in the 24 Olympics got a bronze medal in the marathon and he really is almost like Master athlete number one so he kept training his whole life ended up dying I think of stomach cancer at about age 70 so he didn't live to be a gazillion but remember he was born in in in 1888 or 1890 anyways Paul Dudley white a famous cardiologist we know him from something called The Wolf Parkinson

[00:42:59] White syndrome a weird kind of funny heartbeat people get he did an autopsy on dear and he'd run really till very late in life and he had some plaque or you know fatty builds up and calcium buildup in his coronary arteries but his coronary arteries were huge were just massive and subsequent to that a man named bill has Cloud at Stanford in the middle 90s studied a bunch of ultra people who' done ultramarathons and they did the same thing except this time they put catheters in and and injected drugs to make the blood vessels expand and they showed the blood vessels were bigger and they expanded more so so again while you could still have some blockages uh even if you exercise and there are people with horrible lipids who do in fact get heart disease in spite of exercise so it's not a complete um you know complete vaccine but uh its overall protective effect is is quite large uh both in terms of what does to people's lipids but the fact that the blood vessels get so much bigger and the

[00:44:01] Linings of the blood vessels are are are healthier Mike one of the things that we've looked at a lot internally um is the the literature that argues a different point the literature that argues that in fact there's a J curve here and we all agree that a person who doesn't do anything is at the highest risk the literature is so unambiguous there it doesn't warrant any further discussion but um now let's now look at the addition of work now you and I I just want to make sure that the The

[00:44:32] Listener understands the way we're going to talk about this let's talk about these in met hours per week so you've already done a great job explaining a weird a weird I've actually had to convert my own training into a met hour per week spreadsheet so that I can interpret what I do in the context of all the a weird metric for sure totally weird but let's explain to people what it is right so so

[00:44:53] You' you've told us what a met is one met is the metabolic expenditure sitting at rest which corresponds to about 3.5 m per minute per kilog of minute ventilation so uh or actually V2 oxygen ventilation not P ventilation okay so then let's talk about how that ramps up right so if you if how many Mets is it

[00:45:14] Mike to walk three miles in an hour that's that's oh probably four five six something like that okay I would have guessed it may be because because remember remember a 10-minute mile is is is 10 Mets okay 10 minute mile is six miles in an hour yeah and that's pretty nonlinear so yeah yeah yeah you're right it's probably about three or three to four Mets I would guess would be yeah something like that yeah yeah yeah okay um and then of course as you noted to run uh 10 to run uh uh six six miles in an hour would be 10 Mets so let's say you did that so you you went out and ran uh you ran six miles in an hour for an energy expenditure of 10 Mets so that would be 10 met hours you did 10 Mets one hour and if you did that four times a week and that was the only thing you did you'd be at 40 met hours per week of activity um so I do this for my training so I I spend how much time am I on the bike at this many watts at this many watts and in the weight room and you know carrying my ruck sack and uh you know I'm sort of in the 100 met hours per week category correct so if you look at the literature the epidemiology on this it would say my mortality risk might be higher that would be the headline than someone who's doing 40 met hours per week in other words it's a J curve so it sort of starts up here highest mortality at nothing mortality comes down sort of naters depending on the study between 50 and 75 met hours per week and then the mortality tends to climb now you know I won't go into this in great detail other than we've we've looked at every one of these papers and we find significant fault in each of them and not all of them not all of them say that not all of them some yeah the big NCI study with 650,000 patients or subjects didn't say that and again you know what I really like is that that that CrossCountry ski paper that I mentioned from Scandinavia and and these you know if somebody's going to ski 90 kilometers and if they're going to do it year after year and they're going to do it fast they have to be training a lot you're gonna have to be training a lot you're going to be training year round you almost are certainly getting all sorts of met hours and and and training pretty hard now the one caveat in all this is is that and I agree with you completely I don't think the evidence for a J curve is particularly good uh the other thing is in many of these studies the number of people that are way out there is very small so even one death somebody gets hit by a car or something it can make a difference that's certainly one of the problems with a study from like uh

[00:47:48] Copenhagen as I recall or or Norway can't but one of the scandavian capitals and and again so I really think that the dispositive study here is the real world data from from the vasal lopet uh story now the one thing that does happen is is that people do have at least an apparent increase in risk of atrial fibrillation and now there's two there's a couple of caveats to that the first thing is they do not have any increased risk of fatal rhythmus I mean uh atrial fib is no fun but it but it certainly can uh uh you know lead to medical problems but not typically do kill you uh the sorts of things that kill you you ventricular aymas uh these are not seen in at any uh to any greater extent in these people that are you know really heavy exercises for their entire life so then the question becomes do these people actually have more H fibrillation or is it just that they're exercising and notice it and and that's the controversy I think I think you would probably have to say that people who who train uh the way you're talking about for for their entire life have some increased risk of atrial fib compared to people that are just super healthy otherwise and and physically active at that 50 to 70 Med hour per week thing you're talking about or level you're talking about but your risk of atrial fibrillation is still probably lower than people who are sedentary hypertensive obese diabetic and so forth and um there are good treatments for atrop fibrillation and you continue to be protected against fatally arhythmia so so I think that um that that's the one caveat I think that where there the evidence is is is better than marginal this atrial fib story and and what do you think about sort of myocardial fibrosis there's there's been some talk about that do we do we do we see compelling evidence to suggest no I I think in fact you see the you see the opposite if you look at people who who've been uh if you look at again the data from uh Ben Line's group down in

[00:49:50] Dallas where they've done a bunch of Echoes and loaded the heart and done all kinds of things and they show that that that young fit young people have very flexible compliant heart muscles uh and they show that that declines with age but but doesn't decline nearly so fast in people that are either habitual exercises or people who remained Master athletes remain highly competitive so again I think that you can you can talk yourself into these sorts of things through a case report here a case report there but when you look at the sort of data that came from Ben's lab and and other things you see that that that this sort of training uh keeps the ventricles compliant flexible and and able to handle the the the you know the increased demands and pumping demands of exercise so I I think the fibrosis uh argument is a little spurious I think we we've talked a little bit earlier about the uh large coronary arteries in people that are habitually Physically Active we've talked that those arteries vasod dilate uh better they probably are are less likely to generate a clot and and then we've just simply said and you're protected against fatal arhythmia we've just simply said there may be a subtle increase risk in atrial fibrillation but again good treatments for atrial fib and um so so I think I think you're in good shape I think in that regard doing as much as you do Peter and I think then the other thing to remember is that um that you know it's not it's not a uh an absolute vaccine or an absolute you know you work out an hour day you're never going to get uh have disease but but I think your risk are going to be dramatically reduced as as we've discussed throughout the visit so far the other thing I think that argues in favor of sorry argues against the J curve is the v2x data that we just discussed correct which is an enormous cohort probably the largest cohort after the Copenhagen cohort and far more balanced in terms of the number of people in each group and has been repeated in other populations yeah and so so there you have to ask the question how is it that people in the top 2.3% of the population for v2 Max have the lowest mortality by a long shot if they're not training significantly corre because I you know I if you I look at I know those numbers very well I mean we we we put all of our patients up against that template and we show them where they are and where we want them to be um and we actually hold them to an even higher standard Mike we kind of want our patients to be at the elite level for a decade below where they are actually are agewise and and I'll tell you in a moment why we do that I want to see if you agree with my logic but I just you know having been training my whole life I can tell you I

[00:52:34] I don't see how you're going to get there doing 40 met hours per week like you you can't achieve a V2 Max of that level just doing a little bit of you know maintenance stuff here and there I mean you have to be training yeah you have to be training you have to be doing some high intensity training so I agree with you and and the other thing is if you look at some classic Studies by people like uh Bob hickon and more recently wiof group in Norway you know people who do some longer intervals three or four times a week can get a lot of bang for their buck in terms of V2

[00:53:05] Max well I want I'm want to come back to that Mike because I want to talk very specifically about the different modalities for training before I do I want to see if you can check my Logic on this okay sure a big part of where we come up with the reason you want to have a high V2 Max when you're young is we want to be able to prepare for the inevitability of decline so I want to start by just asking you what what is the most upto-date uh understanding of how much uh peak2 declines in and let's do it in a non-training individual and a training individual so so if you look at if you look at it this way so so in general people think V2 Max declines about 10% per decade starting in the fourth decade so sometime in your 30s you know some people say nine some people say 12 some people say but roughly 10% all right a lot of that is driven uh by a age related decline in heart rate but in in people that are not training it's driven just because their their heart can't pump as much blood and their their muscles can't use it so among people who are training you start at a higher level and then if people continue to train you probably don't see a big decline until your late 30s or early 40s and we see that among athletes because there are worldclass endurance athletes in their early 40s and then you can reduce the um rate of decline by about half up to certainly up to your 70s probably now not everybody keeps training hard and uh if people stop training uh their V2 Max

[00:54:40] Falls precipitously Dr Dave costell really one of the founders of exercise physiology in the United States uh studied a lot of elite athletes in the 60s and 70s he brought them back to his lab when these guys in the 90s 1990s when they were in their late 40s and 50s s and about a third of them had continued to train very hard and had minimal reductions in their V2 Max a third had become sort of joggers had some reduction and there was a third that had just stopped doing anything and they look like regular sedentary people so you do have to stay at it so I think the and and there's a a group of Master athletes in in out in the LA area who were studied same sorts of things people declined and their VO2 max declined but among the people who who uh continued to train intensely and and in in the case of the men do some strength training their V2 Max uh declin at a much lower rate so so so you have a situation where it's 10% if you do nothing you know somewhere and and if you really work at it and and stay uh stay with it at a really high level it it's it's you know maybe five or six% per decade but most people who've been super competitive can't quite keep doing that their entire life so they drop off a little bit but even if they drop off 10% per decade they start at a much higher Baseline so if if your Baseline is 60 versus 35 and you lose 10% per decade you're still going to be way way way ahead way ahead and and at age 60 or 70 you're going to have a V2 max value higher higher than um uh you know 30-y old so the reason we push so hard Mike for our patients to have as high a V2

[00:56:22] Max possible as as as possible when they're in their 40s or 50s is based on this inevitability of Decline and with the hopes that we're extending Life by a decade so that hey even though actuar you might only be expected to live to 81 we're kind of hoping you're going to get to 91 correct and if you say you want to be active then we have to reverse engineer what that means so what do you think is the

[00:56:48] V2 Max above which um you have absolutely no limit itation on any normal person's activities in other words if you said to me hey look when I'm in my 80s I want to be able to do pretty much anything reasonable I don't have to run a FIV minute mile but what I do want to be able to do is I want to go on a hard hike and if that means I got to climb a hundred feet in half a mile so be it well Peter that that's a great question it goes back to one of your earlier comments about you know your scale versus the the traditional kind of anti

[00:57:26] Realty scale and and what do you want to not be able to do when you're 85 or or whatever the magic number is so if you look at it 14 Mets which is which is or for 14 a V2 of 14 MLS per kg per minute or four Mets four Mets is required from an oxygen consumption sort of perspective for people to do their activities of daily living which means an occasional somewhat brisk walk for a few minutes and and be able to kind of get around the house go to the supermarket and be quote independent whatever that means and now if if you want to be able to run you know 10 a mile in 10 minutes that would be 35 V2

[00:58:06] Max yeah yeah 35 or 10 Mets now so somewhere between those two are the magic numbers so so I would say that you know if somebody in their 80s had a Max in their in their 20s or or or or lower 30s that'd be terrific well that's so funny what you say we we have arrived at 30 to 31 as the magic number number that would be a a a rough guess and what's interesting that you mentioned that is those uh Scandinavian Elite skiers I mentioned yeah had values in the very high 30s or low 40s in their 80s in their 80s now but remember they would any any sort of biological uh gifts or genetic gifts that those men had and or the uh fact that they started to train you know probably be very physically active as youngsters and and you know really were maximally Physically Active from age you know 13 14 to probably 30 y that would account for that yeah so so so I think I think uh 30 be a terrific goal but I think the other thing too is is you know uh how many push-ups do you want to be able to do and how many sorts of body weight type of things do you want to be able to do uh you know what sort of agility Maneuvers do you want to be able to do and I think you know you have to kind of factor in um factor in you know uh orthopedic problems and that sort of thing but but again we have good treatment for those now and our orthopedic surgeons can fix a lot of of things that other otherwise would have made people very uh difficult for them to walk and move around well and and we yeah we think a lot about those things and we think that strength and stability need to be trained in parallel and as hard as we're training from from a cardio standpoint but I do think this idea that hey if you're trying to reverse engineer ending your life with a

[00:59:55] V2 Max in the mid 20s to high 30s the good news is you are never going to not be able to do something that you want to do correct if you're in the airport and the escalator isn't working you don't care which is which and I think the thing you have to ask people and this really resonates is you know do you want to be able to play with your grandchildren that's one question for for for for people the escalator question that's a terrific question a terrific question you know I was just the airport last week escalator down you got to be able to car and it's a long was one of those really long ones yeah right you got your carryon bag plus your backpack and you got to get up the escalator now I'm sure somewhere out there there was an elevator but the point is do you want to be able to do this stuff um and if you do then you have to you have to do the math have to work at it agree that's right you got to do the math and and what's interesting too is if you you see a few people around here uh in in rural

[01:00:52] Minnesota who you know grew up on less than fully mechanized farms and remain you know active milking cows and doing these sorts of things doing a whole lot of chores and uh it's remarkable uh the muscle mass that some of these men and women have you know that that some have and and I think that that is something to to to keep in mind too if you look at at at these these people in in in these well and if you look at in Japan for example and couple places you know the the the hilliest parts of Japan and some of the hilliest parts of Italy and

[01:01:26] Greece are where the longevity is the highest and people have argued it's because people have to walk up and down uh walk up and down the the the the hills and also um and so they they they keep their balance they keep their glute strength they don't fall that sort of thing Peter and also that they're they're you know living a more rustic lifestyle is probably getting them some de facto strink training on on a daily basis so yeah so I agree with you let's talk a little bit about V2 Max again in terms of like what is actually driving it so let's go through all the variables right so you've got sort of gas exchange in the lungs in the lung correct and then you've got gas exchange in uh or sorry then you have pump efficiency right so we went through the mechanics of that again but just so people understand what we talk about you've got stroke volume contractility of course afterload and preload and all these things that determine basically the efficacy of the pump to move the medium to the capillary bed and then you have capillary Exchange in the muscle bed right so so broadly speaking let's just say those are three variables right you've got the gas exchange at the source you've got the pump and then you've got the gas exchange at the destination uh is that I know that's overly simplistic yeah that's a way to look at it so let's just think you got air to lung y lung to blood blood from the the the heart to the tissues uh and and oxygen from the blood to the tissues right so there's four or five steps like that and you enumerated you know the three big ones and so in general you know oxygen uptake is is cardiac output how much blood you're pumping per minute times arterovenous oxygen difference how much blood you're extracting or oxygen you're extracting out of the blood and it turns out that if you look at all the studies and all the people fit unfit trained untrained in general the biggest issue is how how how much blood can you pump and and so what is that heart rate time stroke volume equation where does that leave us now when you train you get so you can extract more and if you're at high altitude or if you've got problems with your lungs maybe the lungs don't work as well but in general I like to tell people you cannot extract what has not been delivered so the key is delivery and that's heart rate times stroke volume and and interestingly Peter is you I'm sure you've seen is some of your fittest people actually have slightly lower Peak heart rates and one of the reasons is is because their stroke volume is so so so uh so high one of the really interesting again experiment of nature patients is or subjects is a man called escal eison who won gold medals in five Olympics and Rowing for for

[01:04:08] Denmark and and they have serial V2 Max date on them from the time he was 18 or 19 till his early 40s and his V2 Max stayed around you know 5.6 lers per minute which is quite High wow and he weighed about 70 kilos I believe he was a lightweight rower and anyways uh but his Peak heart rate dropped from about 190 to one50 over that period of time which all that means is for he was able to pump the same amount of blood but he had to do more with each beat and and that's that's sort of an interesting example but the that's an insane example actually yeah yeah and again these are the sorts of things you you you see so so that is really the key and so in other words in the individual as they age we think that the majority of the reduction in V2 Max is coming from cardiac output reduction but right and the majority is probably coming from a reduction in Peak heart rate which can be buffered to some extent if you have a nice compliant ventricle like we talked about I mean I'll I'll tell you I I'm not quite yet 50 and I am just saddened by the reduction in my Peak heart rate it it it is really breaking my heart I mean IR M was never very high anyway and

[01:05:19] I don't worry about it you know but I'm 63 so I stopped worrying about it I just I worry about what my workload is yeah yeah no I just but it is amaz I remember thinking like there will never be a day when I can't get my heart rate above X but but actually I'll tell you for me it fell quite precipitously in my 20s so as as a teenager when I was training obscenely hard in inappropriately hard a heart rate of 200 was was an everyday occurrence there was never a day in high school that my heart rate didn't hit 200 to 205 beats per minute right um and then by the time I was in medical school so 24 25 years old all of a sudden it dropped immediately to about 180 it became very difficult to get over 180 which by the way was Far lower than the 220 minus your age prediction so

[01:06:13] Peter I was in a study I was I was in two famous studies as a subject one is this lactate threshold study when I was 19 and then a few years later I went and was worked one summer at Washington University in St Louis and I stopped training I just run you know uh finished my last year of track and field at the

[01:06:29] University of Arizona i' run 10,000 m in 3048 and didn't done well on the pack 10s which was a fast time well I was good enough to get lapped by the world record holders like what is what I like to tell people but anyways um what happened is my Peak heart rate was like 185 or 188 I can't remember and over the period of 12 weeks of dra trining it went up to about 10 beats a minute uh yeah so so so went which would have been you know in the high 190s which would have been quote 220 minus my age at the time but but again and there are all sorts of examples there's a bunch of data on Elite athletes showing that that some of them have Peart rates similar to 220 minus her AG or but many are lower than that and they're like escal eison there are some people that have been world record holders Olympic

[01:07:17] Champions that had PE car rates in the 150s yeah mine's if mine if I hit 170 today it's a it's a that's a good day surpr is about 220 minus my age but you know my guess is I'd be hard I'd press to get to 140 mhm I I I was talking with Lance Armstrong on a had him on the podcast many actually but maybe about less than a year ago actually and we were talking about back in the in the

[01:07:42] Heyday of his tours they weren't really looking at their power meters when they were competing so they trained with a power meter but when it was when it was race day for the time trial you just went off heart rate and I was just blown away I mean so you gotta think Lance was winning the tours between 28 and 35 right he was still holding 200 beats per minute for the entire time right so so imagine 45 minutes at 200 beats per minute when you're 30 plus years old is and on the the other example there would be a man Nam Bob sh who is an American who won the 5000 in 1964 who did interval training all day and all night it was incredible how he trained and his peard I have I have the data someplace was like 154 156 it's it's was not particularly Jim Ryan's was not the great Miler was not particularly high in his 20s yeah so just incredible stroke volume correct correct correct correct big heart big pumps all right so let's talk a little bit about the training so so um let's um let's start with something that we haven't talked about which you know when you look at the best you you know high output endurance athletes today you know it's it's one thing to talk about their Peak engine performance but it's easy to overlook what they're doing at the low end you know I've had Inigo s Milan on the podcast twice and we've talked at length about uh Ted p pachar and it's is it's amazing to talk about high how high his

[01:09:14] FTP is his functional threshold power we can talk about his V2 Max but equally amazing to that is how much power he can put out while keeping lactate below 2 M right right right right and and you know I think he's at four he's over four watts per kilo while keeping lactate before below 2 Millo right and and what why that's amazing for someone who doesn't ride a bike is you if you took an average fit person off the street and said hold four watts per kilo they could maybe do it for a minute most people couldn't do it for a minute and this guy can do it for 4 hours correct so so so that lowend aerobic efficiency I always try to explain to my patients if your V2

[01:09:58] Max represents the height or peak of your pyramid The Wider your base the higher your your Peak do you agree with that sentiment so what I what I would simply say Peter you know as we think about performance and you think about these Elites we think obviously about their V2 Max then you start thinking about you know with their lactate threshold which would be sort of the FTP and they're all sort of related anerobic threshold there's a lot of terminology here you can get in arguments with people about the details but what fraction of your V2 Max can you perform at for you know minutes to hours yeah exactly yeah and so you know and typically it's about 60% in untrained kind of young to middle-age people lower in people that are are really untrained uh but but just just sort of sedentary and people that are are are very fit it can be 75 80 85 even 90% of V2 Max and some older athletes close to 100 so so that's exactly what you describe somebody like that probably has a you know a peak work rate that they could sustain for 10 or 20 minutes of 6 s watts per kilo so the fact that they can do four watts per kilo forever shouldn't surprise anybody and that's just like you you look at somebody like Mr Kip jogi you know who's running 440 miles at at a at at a a pace that doesn't really probably cause much of an increase in his blood lactic acid levels at all did they ever reveal any of those metrics yeah that dat that data has been published so tell tell me what was his lactate level at the completion of the 2hour of the just under 2hour Mar well remember remember at the end of of the race you wouldn't have a lot of carbohydrate on board but but I would just simply say he can run 440 miles or over 12 miles an hour at at at you know substant at levels it barely nudges lactic acid levels barely nudge them but but but remember too but his V but but and what's interesting is is when I first started thinking about this and making models of performance I I thought the the highest number was 85% of Max and it's probably closer to 90 for somebody like him uh but but but the other interest so the Andy you were talking about FTP for one minute the other interesting thing about that uh

[01:12:09] Peter is you know the kip chogi challenge people have gone and you know put treadmills at 12 and a half miles hour yeah and see how long somebody can last on the treadmill they're getting spit off in 30 seconds back yeah less than that you know so so yeah so so same sort of thing so so so I think that that that sort of training you know for and these people are training two three four hours a day um if you look in terms of the runners running is limited to some extent because of the there's almost you know Orthopedic issues becom a problem impact right and and so you it's really difficult for people to run more than about 120 or 130 miles a week and and ever run do do hard training uh for prolonged periods of time now there are a few people who can do it and if you look at what Kip chogi does it's almost identical even day for day what Bill

[01:13:00] Rogers and Frank Shorter did does it at altitude but but there's a lot of medium eight and 10 and 12 miles a run runs a couple of hard interval sessions per week and um you know long run and and that's so you know that gets them to 120 miles a week you know week in and week out now the cyclist can do more because you don't have that issue but remember that with Cy clean you know you're going up and you're going down and and and you have always a a chance to take a break here and there the swimmers do a h uh as well you know and again because swimming is very forgiving uh uh in terms of not beating people up provided your shoulders you know don't get a bunch of tontis so so but but what's amazing is is that if you look at what the the elite of the elite are doing does not really change that much for 50 or 60 years um you have better equipment you have better racist you got better this better that but in terms of if you look at the data on the elite of the elite from the late 60s and early 70s it's not like Kip choi's VO2 max was 90 it was high 70s just as what you would anticipate and so forth so so I I think a lot of what's happened in terms of at the very edge of things is has been better races people now have longer careers they they don't stop when they're 25 or 26 uh sports medicine is better so if they get injured they can recover we saw this in uh last night with Klay Thompson he had two injuries that 30 40 years ago would have been you know basically career ending and he's come back from a combination of an ACL issue and achilles especially used to just destroy people he's playing very well um so I think those sorts of things the races are much better you know and they used to run the Boston Marathon at noon whenever you so often you'd get a you know a really hot day so I think that's what what's happened so most of the improved performance can be equipment these sort of social factors uh unfortunately in the case of Mr

[01:15:00] Armstrong people you know bending the rules and so forth and so on uh but yeah so so let's talk about kind of the intensity levels that one needs to be training at so again let's I mean we could pick the most extreme example and talk about Kip chogi um so so how many hours per week is Kip chogi running because I know he also does a ton of other strength training and body weight training my my guess is yeah my my guess is that that the total amount of time he's running is is somewhere between 14 and 18 or 20 hours a week okay but remember he he he can you know he he's covering a much greater ground of course so he can do that and and and my again you know if you looked at it in terms of the lactate threshold or the equivalent of of critical power on the bike probably 60 70% of that is is you know fast but not that fast they typically start off their group grp runs sort of jogging and then they pick it up over time yeah also remember that he's uh doing this at you know 7 8,000 ft and then my understanding in reading his training program is that you know on a couple days a week he goes to a track and they run you know multiple 400 meters with say 200 meter jog or multiple kilometers with a with a 200 or 400 meter jog like 10 times a kilometer very fast y so the total amount of time he's running faster than race pace might just be 10 miles per week so he's probably running about 60 or 70% of his stuff some of it quite slow but most of it you know medium fast but certainly not you know where he's can't talk to you where where he's short of breath then he's probably spending about 20% of his time where where you know he can still talk to you but he's pushing it a little bit probably 10% of his time where he's pushing it a lot yeah I mean that's exactly my impression and it's the same impression I have of elite cyclists and Elite swimmers yeah no and and that would be true for that that that that those sorts of breakdowns kind of the you know 60 70 20 30 10 are are pretty typical now what's interesting is that's really emerged uh the last say 20 years if you look at people who've looked at the history of training and they have gotten training logs from people and I told you we have lab data on people that's quite good starting in the 19 some even in the 1930s but certainly by the 50s and 60s we got plenty of good data and if you look at what these individuals who have tremendous uh treadmill values tremendous V2 Max values ran very fast times on like dirt tracks and muddy conditions that sort of thing or or you know kind of Cl what we' describe as a kind of a cluggy bike now it's certainly no Arrow bars or you know look at the swimsuits people were racing so if you look at what those people were doing they were doing all kinds of things there are people uh runners in the 60s there were there were people again like Bob Shu a fan fascinating man who's still alive who his morning workout would be 40 times 100 meters with a short jog in between and his afternoon might workout might be 20 times 400 Metter and he rarely ran continuously at all except in races you know and and and it would be you know fast interval slow and there are other people who who ran you know up to 200 miles a week and hardly ever ran fast again except in races and some strides and then then there were already people doing the sort of mix train I described a minute ago so what is interesting is the extent to which things have sort of converged y on this 60 70 20310 sort of model yeah and it really I mean look it makes sense if you've ever done it yourself right I can I can understand why there is a benefit to just the mitochondrial efficiency that comes from continuous that that you'd miss out on if you were just doing the short bursts and similarly unless you do a whole lot of them yeah well it depends what short is I mean again if you're moving to 400s and 800s and your and the recovery is a jog yeah that's that's yeah because these guys aren't walking that's right correct yeah yeah um so so do you think there is a a sort of training benefit I know there's a health benefit but a training benefit in the lowest zone so so we kind of think about zone two as where Kip chogi is probably spending 60 to 70% of his time he can still talk yeah probably right right at the edge of two or three yep and then um and then obviously he's in zone 34 for you know kind of race pace and then and then he's like 45 10% of his mileage which is corre really stretching himself now is

[01:19:34] Kip chogi or our other athletes deliberately putting time into Zone one which is truly a recovery Pace or yeah they do that when they're recovering you know between intervals and and you would be amazed at how uh I mean because I did it many many years ago you know getting started so the first mile or two can be very well mhm I mean can be just almost a walk Jog and then they kind of drift into it uh and I think but but thinking about the listeners who are just trying to improve their health that where that's where you come back to physical activity you know versus intentional training so you know you start looking at the health benefits of just kind of uh less than brisk walking you know purposeful but not really brisk walking they're substantial yeah so so I I think you know people at Zone one too you know you know you know parking your car uh farther out in the parking lot and and strolling in I think you know walking the dog and that can mean all sorts of things depending on what kind of talk you have and and who's in the neighborhood uh you know can can helpful

[01:20:38] I mean the date on gardening uh you know and again you could be out there uh hacking away weeds with a with a machete or but but most of us think about ging is relatively light exercise so the the health benefits of of light physical activity light exercise I mean are substantial and remember you're you're correct in the sense that that at least from our perspective there is no J curve and things you know things are go up but it's not completely linear and and you know the the biggest benefit people get healthwise is the first 10 or 15 minutes a day and why do you think that is well I I think that if you if you if you look at what 10 or 15 minutes does I mean I think it begins to do things in your scalable muscle then improve your insulin sensitivity and help you fight against uh diabetes I think just a tiny bit of additional physical activity is at least some buffer against weight gain

[01:21:34] I think that there's some uh Improvement in your the lining of your blood vessels and and probably some improvement in your autonomic function is is your is your heart going to get bigger are you going to get a more efficient cardiac pump probably not but are you going to begin to to do some of the things uh and the answer is yes so Mike should those of us who really kind of care about this and care about using as many metrics as we can to understand this and you know should we be looking at heart rate recovery and adding that to our kind of repertoire of something we track in ourselves as we train so you know I think that that that that and you see it more among the cyclists and you do again among the runners uh and and and is is I think that there are people that are you know uh really into Tech and monitor and then they're sort of tech nudies I'm I'm I'm a I'm a tech nudy and and part of the reason is is is there wasn't as much around it when I started and me we just were getting digital watches and they weren't even stopwatches and and the other reason is is that that at the time one of the big Innovations was rating of perceived exertion uh you know the six to 20 scale or some people use a 1 to 10 scale about how hard you're working and

[01:22:45] I think that what's been shown is because you know you can have a good day and a bad day in terms of the metrics so I think what's been shown is is that that they're all sort of parallel and if you learn to read your own body via the Via you know the radiant perceived exertion and or or metrics you know find one you like and then just focus on sort of big picture things so I would not get too hung up on heart rate recovery and too hung up on on um on heart rate variability I would just more say are how much are you doing you know uh 304 60 100 you know 180 minutes a week are you also doing other forms of not a week a day are you also doing other forms of of activity you know like taking the stairs as you mentioned and what sort of combination are you doing how much time are you spending where you're really short of breath how much time are you spending where you're a little bit short of breath and how much time is it you know kind of a pleasant sort of pace so

[01:23:45] I I think that that sort of information can get you as as much as you need and I think the main thing then Peter is to make sure that that um you have some accountability whether it's you know with a training partner maybe with a device or a diary maybe you know with just how far did I run today that sort of thing so so what is your current exercise regimen I mean you sort of downplayed at a minute but 30 minutes and 40 seconds for a 10K so so here's what I do is is I mean but that's just I don't think people understand how fast that is I mean and I

[01:24:21] I once ran a 225 Marathon but but you know the older I get the better I was right so here's what I do here's what I do Peter and is is that that like I'm a big believer in what's called hard easy hard day easy day and and I think that that that and so what what I what I'll do uh like tomorrow will be a hard day so I'll get on on you know a stationary bike in my in my uh workout room and and and on the bike and the rowing machine do some sort of warm up for 10 to 15 minutes then I will do a circuit that starts with um uh 15 uh or really kind of 25 squat thrust a minute of jumping rope static walls set to failure and then some drop sets where you go down you know where you you go down the weight stack drop set then then then drop sets with with uh incline flies then drop sets with leg extensions and drop sets with a combination of of uh pull-ups and lat pull downs and military press then some additional stuff for my legs then some uh uh push-ups bar dips and upright rows followed by something else for my leg so

[01:25:36] I alternate arms and legs and I work my way through this with no rest drop sets on each thing for all large major major muscle masses and that takes about 22 minutes and it's it's it's 22 minutes for one circuit one circuit then then I get on the bike right and and I'll do uh like eight times uh 3 minutes of a ladder where you start you know unloaded go up a notch go up a notch go up a notch and I get to maybe about 350 Watts for the last 30 seconds come back down to about 100 Watts 350 watts do that times 8 and sorry how long do you take to ladder three minutes three minutes so so you go like 100

[01:26:15] Watts for something like 100 Watts for 30 seconds 150 for 30 200 for 200 for 30 250 for 30 300 for 30 350 for 30 come back down yep times eight and and that you know and that takes about an hour how long in between your three minute sets no you just go up and come right back down down okay you go right so you're rest the recovery is exactly and and that takes about that takes about an hour and that'll fix your wagon for a while so you'll do that'll be your hard day tomorrow and that'll be my hard day and and I'll do that basically every other day or every third day my easy days will be something like you know like this morning I I uh and I got I want to go do 20 more minutes not because I need to do 20 minutes I want to because I wanted to watch the uh first bit of Obi-Wan Kenobi and so so so my easy days are built around what what documentary or or you know how many times can you watch the Mandalorian how many Clint Eastwood movies can you watch that this started during lockdown right so my easy days are 30 to 40 minutes of of light cycling transition to rowing back and forth of around 30 to 40 minutes sometimes I do one sometimes if

[01:27:29] I come home from work and I I do another one but the goal there is is is an old concept called active rest so I'm not trying to get a real training effect I'm trying to loosen up from the day before it's workout because I'm sore that you know if you do what I describe uh you know you warm up for 10 or 15 minutes do do 20 minutes of drop sets and and that type of intervals at the end you will be sore right and so then what happens is is is uh you know so you have to recover the next day now I'll do this for about six months and then probably when it get starts getting dark again I'll do what I did like last year where where I start um just doing kind of Maintenance circuits in terms of the strength so not not quite is maybe only twice a week and

[01:28:12] I'll start doing longer rides we have a pelaton and um uh and I I don't do any of the classes but but I started doing this hour of Truth to see how many watts I could average for an hour okay what are you at and and see what my best is and I think I think my best uh during lockdown last year was 360 average 316 Watts for an hour wow do you do you think do I mean that's that's obscenely high well and and the things are calibrated pretty well uh so and I have I have a watt bike I got a lot of equipment I got a watt bike and I think they're pretty close and if you if you look online they claim they're close right wow and and and I know how and I think that I think it's consistent with what I think I haven't measured my V2

[01:28:53] Max in so I want to see if I can get like 320 Watts next year what do you what do you what do you think your V2 Max is right now you know well I'll tell you back when I was quite young it was 5.4 lers a minute right what my guess is it's my my weight then was probably between 75 but close to 80 kilos okay so I was right under 70 yep U I think my weight is now is probably about 95 kilos because I've actually made an effort to gain some weight and I think my Max is probably yeah 4.5 l a minute it be my guess something like that so yeah I mean that's still an amazing wattage under any circumstance well yeah assuming the machine is okay but I think it is because and remember when I'm doing those ladders that I was telling you about those pyramids uh uh that's after

[01:29:42] I've done a heavy leg workout you know so my legs are pretty fatigued when I did have done that but remember I have some ability too because what she ran yeah yeah I became a pretty and I didn't really start running till my senior in high school so I started late and and and I'm 6'4 and I to tell people if you know uh if I come back in the next life I'll be a swimmer or rower because I used to show up with these tiny people yeah so so I was I was I'm the world's largest relatively good distance

[01:30:11] Runner what on your easy recovery day Mike are you just paying attention to RP or are you looking at a split time on the rowing machine or a low R it's just all RP it's it's really just active rest which is a lost concept do you have a sense of what your heart rate is as a percentage of your I measure no I have no and and again I think it's probably based on the on the on the on the uh you know the the hour of Truth ride and and my wife got me a pelaton shirt then she had it printed hour of Truth on it which was kind of cool but but anyways I think

[01:30:48] I think Peter my um it's probably about 140 is my Peak heart rate that would be my guess um but but again I go with RP I go to Lys suffer and and it's but remember it's unusual and and and um you know uh it's unusual to be able to do intervals on your own and really push it not everybody can do it and that's why you need a class or you need a coach or you need a group and so forth but but um I'm lucky enough to be able able to do it and and uh yeah so my training is really polarized I mean like really polarized so let's talk about folks who are listening to this who want to boost their V2 Max let's talk about the different protocols that exist I'll tell you what we typically uh tell tell patients to do which is kind of in my experience one of the most efficient ways that you can do it but I'm curious as to what other ways so we typically talk about a 4x4 four on four off right so so we'll tell people um and again the easiest way that I personally can do this is on a bike on an incline and it can't be a very steep incline it's got to be like 6% grade I want to stay in the saddle and but I never want the resistance to go away and I basically want to be in the saddle climbing against resistance for 4 minutes and I use a power meter and a heart rate so I just want to keep the power as steady as

[01:32:13] I can invariably it dips in about the third minute and then I can recover it in the fourth minute psychologically and then the recovery is 4 minutes of literally doing nothing but rolling back to the starting line and then basically just repeat that so so so no no I'm with you what I tell people for example that if come and say I want to run a faster

[01:32:33] Marathon I want to do this I want to do that you know and they're running a lot of miles they need to get their V2 Max up and I tell them exactly what you've described sometimes I tell them five minutes and three minutes rest sometimes whatever people that are fitter sometimes only take like I would only take two minutes of rest okay and that's just but four time 4 is terrific so you would do something if you were thinking about running I would tell people to do something that would be right at their sort of 5K race Pace maybe a little faster or or you would do the first one a little slower than your 5K race Pace the next one you know a little faster than that the next one a little faster then the next one faster than your 5K race bace and depending on how fast you're running if you're going pretty fast then you would just jog in between and if you were were not going so fast

[01:33:20] You' walk in between so that would be the sort of thing that that I would describe to people and the classic training you know among Elite Runners is is mile repeats you know people doing you know four or five times one mile and then they jog a quarter mile or half mile in between and I I personally have seen really good

[01:33:43] Runners I mean it's I've seen people you know do you know 430 425 420 415 410 405 which is but I mean these were people getting ready for the Olympics you know so so so but but those sorts of things but sort of for the average person right you know the the hard part that I think requires a little bit of coaching upfront is it's you know you and I have done this our whole lives so we sort of know what four minutes all out feels like yeah EXA 30 seconds in you shouldn't be hurting too much if you are you've gone out too hard so it takes a little bit of work to coach somebody to understand what what you're going for is a constant four minutes but the but the suffering is disproportionately in the last 90 seconds and Peter you you're you're exactly right so I describe it as you when you're done when you get done with the last one the fourth one you do not want to be bending over you if you'd have gone a little bit of faster you want to be bending over you so I call it the no bend over rule interesting and then what people have to recognize both for the four time 4 minutes and within the four minutes is a good interval workout and this sounds completely masochistic is like putting your hand in warm water and then slowly increasing the temperature in the water to where you can barely stand it anymore and then leave it in for a while and then you turn it down and let your hand cool off and do it again and and that's really the the what you described and and you know uh uh one of the things I I think we've learned from the cyclist is a terrific phrase called manage your suffering you know you need to learn to manage your suffering and and and uh and I think that's the other interesting thing about this type of training in in um is is to the extent you know people can have these sort of religious experiences exercising uh this sort of interal training is one way to get them that's what I would tell you I no I completely agree I mean obviously we're Cut From the Same Cloth in this way but but I think that um there really is something wonderful about experiencing your limits and understanding that level of discomfort and if you're able to maintain your Rhythm and Tempo Peter while you do it that's when you can have these sorts of experiences and and um you know I mean one of the most beautiful things ever and it wasn't a total endurance athlete you know even it was a little bit Shor a couple minutes but to watch Michael Phelps swim the butterfly and watch his stroke he was a he was good at everything but he was especially good at the butterfly and to watch you know most people's stroke is

[01:36:22] Fallen apart and end up taking more Strokes the last 50 of a 200 meter butterfly and you know his stroke count the second third and fourth lap didn't change because he had that Rhythm that Tempo and if you listen to the Old School coaches talk about interval training they're constantly talking about Tempo what is your Rhythm what is your Tempo and and why you're doing it why you're suffering Peter why you're pushing it while while while it's hurting while it's burning the goal was to not lose your form and not lose your tempo you know it's funny I used I used to watch Michael Phelps train because uh before he kind of broke out in the early 2000s yeah um I lived in Baltimore because I did my residency at Hopkins and he used to train at a place called

[01:37:06] North Baltimore aquatic yeah right nbac yeah so so watching now Michael of course within the swimming world was already an unbelievable Prodigy because he he had gone to the Olympics in Sydney placed he's like 15 or something which is quite young for a man that's right he was actually the youngest uh he he became the youngest male to ever set a world record in a Time sport in early 01 correct when he set the record yeah set the record for the 200 fly so so watching this 16-year-old swimming at uh

[01:37:39] North Baltimore aquatic nbac um which his signature event of course was the 200 fly now it's 200 long course butterfly I would put that up there with the 200 breast and the 400 im as the three worst races in all of swimming to me it's like doing an 800 meteor intermediate hurdles on the track that event doesn't exist yeah yeah yeah it's just it's just it's pure it's insane suffer but here's the thing Mike his training was almost never you never once saw him do a 200 uh fly it was lots of 75s right lots of 75s and uh his coach

[01:38:20] Bob Bowman was really adamant about perfect form cuz if I recall Michael had an unusual Rhythm which is that he breathed on every stroke and usually like when I swam butterfly when most people swam butterfly it was every other you would you were Head Underwater for one stroke head up for one down for one and and Michael I I'm pretty sure he would Breathe every stroke but as you pointed out no one's form could rival his and that's why he he was usually the last guy to hit the wall at the 50 and and and yet would come back and just devour everybody well and you see that with Edwin Moses 13 steps between hurdles and the 400 hurdles in the late 70s with that

[01:38:59] Innovation and and again you you see these people you saw with Kip chogi doing it for two hours their ability to maintain this form and Tempo and as you watch it as you watch it Peter you you are AED by this sense of great effort and simultaneous relaxation it's really it's a real Paradox and and and well and again you see that you see that in other sports too you see it when the when the golfers get hot how how far they hit the ball but it's it's both violent and relaxed at the same time you you certainly uh you know you sit there and watch Steph Curry or Klay Thompson start launching balls and and and and it's just incredible the tempo the Rhythm the form and and and but and the effort but again just how relaxed they are it's just wild to think about even now going back to our very very recreational person who's never trained in their life we we don't even we don't use lactate testing on people at that level we basically do the whole thing off rpe and we try to get 80% of their time which might start out at two to three hours per week as we want you to be able to talk but not enjoy it right I don't want you to be any I don't want you to be any higher than that right and then once we build up a bit of a reserve in that after maybe six months of that kind of training we're sort of ready to move them to that next phase of of hey once a week I want you to do kind of four on four offre four rounds um do you think that once a week doing those four hard intervals is sufficient to boost V2 Max it will increase it for sure yeah in the vast majority of people especially if they're doing the other stuff you're talking about and and I think that that what I really like about what you describe and what people don't realize especially when you're going to

[01:40:49] Advocate relatively hard training for Citizens is that sometimes you have to train before you can really train yeah that's right you got to train to train yeah yeah you you got to get and you certainly seen that in some some uh uh studies with with older you know people that are really you know 60 70 years old is that they almost have to do three or four or six months of sort of pre-training before they are fit enough to train hard so I think you're spot on there and I my guess is after they they've been able to do it for you know once a week for a while you build them up to two times per week I I think the one thing that people need to re recogniz and this comes from a man named

[01:41:25] Stan James who I think is still practicing medicine he's in his 90s was a one of the pioneers of Sports Medicine orthopedic surgery and he's not operating anymore but he the last I checked he was alive and well out in Eugene Oregon and he he worked with coach Bill Bowman you know the the great Oregon coach found one of the founders of Nike the waffle shoe guy you know and they got into this hard easy thing which is is sort of what I do and I and and uh you know Dr James would tell you that once people start doing more than about five or six hard hard sessions every two weeks you're beginning to ask for some sort of load management issue whether it's Orthopedics whether it's just you're fatigued whether it's this whether it's that so I do think that that um you you want to do something literally I mean I can't remember the last day I didn't do anything you know it's probably been you know years but but but my guess is the the number of times I do something hard is you know 120 130 times per year and I and my guess is I I never go more than a week without doing something relatively intense when you think about about these sort of exceptional Elite athletes the choies of the world do do you believe they have a finite number of exceptional performances in them you know I I think people used to sort of think that but I think what's happened now is that um uh you know people used to drift into the into the into the world rankings and they'd last you know maybe uh two

[01:42:57] Olympics yeah so they'd last you know six seven years so they'd come in kind of emerge right before one Olympiad do well do well in the next one and kind of fade but I think there's there's there's uh two two things that have really changed the first is is that that again sports medicine is better uh so if people do get injured they they can do things about it I think the second thing is just it's been become so professionalized is is people can that are really really good can now make enough money to make it worth their while to continue and and you know you see this in terms of the age of

[01:43:34] Olympians where where you know you used to have uh you know it used to be very unusual to have women over age 20 and swimming there was no College swimming there was none of this there was none of that so was a lot of teenagers now you see that drifting up and you see people like Katy lki having extended careers you know uh Phelps going 2 2004 8 12 and going to five Olympics yeah that would have been inconceivable previously for swimmers you know because people you know people hung around and and maybe stayed for one additional Olympics and when they got done after college sometimes too but but eventually they they had to go do get a job but but again among the most elite who can now monetize this people can last longer and you see it also in in quote the major unquote professionals Sports you know before orthopedic surgery was good and and so forth and and every knee surgery was an adventure you know somebody like Tom

[01:44:31] Brady Brady yeah his career would have been over in 2009 and and why keep or or it would have been attenuated and and the other thing Peter is is why keep you know if you're making $100,000 a year why keep playing yeah if you're making you know 23 million or 30 whatever the number is yeah you know why not keep playing and you look at you look at it you know again uh in in sports like running swimming cycling you know there there's less of a kind of a journeyman group but if you look at at at you know the NBA the NFL

[01:45:04] Major League Baseball the salary scales are pretty good and if if people can play another couple of years you know this can be millions of dollars millions of dollars for them so they're very motivated in um uh to do this you know so if if you can be the eighth man on an NBA team and give people 15 20 quality minutes a game you know you're going to have a job for a long time and again if you're LeBron you know who apparently spent some huge amount of money on training and uh cook and all that other stuff is is uh is you know I mean if you start thinking about spending x per year for a an you know a 40x paycheck why not wh why stop so where do you think we are today Mike in um performance-enhancing drugs in sports so so cycling is probably the sport I would follow the closest of the major sports I mean I guess I follow swimming uh as well though not not nearly as much as I did for sort of 15 years prior um but but you know I think when you go back and look at the the cycling data and I I love the way Lance talks about this right you know I think he's very open right to say look as long as there has been a tour to France there has been a a graying of the line right but there is a difference between the kind of high octane cheating that was done in Lance's era and sort of the low octane cheating that was was done in Eddie ms's era when they were you know using a little bit here's what I would say about where we are with doping so the testing has gotten better both in terms of the frequency of testing and the uh you know the actual chemistry of the testing of the machines the analytics yeah the ability to detect you yeah um if you look at the way what's called an normal test is called it's not like what we call an abnormal test or an out-of range test in clinical medicine they they're typically many standard deviations above average for these things and they're typically designed so there's not a lot of false false positives they don't want to have any false positives so that gives people a room some room to micro do and that's why you have relatively few positive tests but occasionally there'll be people you know caught through investigations you judicial mechanisms the police and historically many of the biggest busts have been the police so I think what I would simply say is that the era of industrial strength doping is over you know PE people doing like the

[01:47:36] East Germans did and androgenized females to the extent that they really look like men so I think that that is is done so I think there is still sorry Mike you say that even in light of what the Russians did as recently as less than a decade ago yeah and I think I think what the Russians did was again relatively low dose mhm by comparison so

[01:47:56] I think there's plenty of room for micro doing and and plenty of room for the kinds of manipulation systemic manipulation if there's a motivated government to do it and there's plenty of room you know for other forms of corruption so so but I do think that that the industrial strength doping has largely been quote stopped prevented I think there are probably a bunch of

[01:48:16] Novel compounds that are out there you know small peptides that cause this to be released or that to be released which would be very very difficult to detect they'd have vanishingly short half-lies and so forth and they would just boost your endogenous production of hormone XY or Z you know something like a growth hormone releasing factor or or some sort of uh you know something that cause testosterone levels to go up or so forth so so I think that that um that it's a c mouse game and uh you're always going to

[01:48:50] I think I think for the kind of the big three amphetamine means eo/ blood doping and and anabolic steroids SLG growth hormone I think that that the testing has gotten better and industrial strength doping is over I think we we don't know what we don't know about these novel compounds and I think what we learned from the ball Coast situation is that there are all sorts of you know clever bathtub chemists who can make all sorts of things you know at home in the garage wherever it is and and and in in a very unregulated environment ironment and and the barrier to entry for that kind of do-it-yourself sort of stuff is quite low you can buy you know all sorts of laboratory equipment and reagents and all sorts of things so you don't have to be you know a big

[01:49:35] Farmhouse to make make interesting things that's say are you how familiar are you with with Bal and the and the agency Bal and Patrick Arnold you know Patrick I don't know Patrick but I know who he is and the tragedy of Patrick Arnold this tremendous uh you know kind of uh guy with a master I believe in organic chemistry the tragic tragedy of

[01:49:55] Patrick Arn Arn is he wasn't working for wasn't working for one of the big Pharma companies making anti-aging anti sarcopenia compounds that's the you know where he had he had been was making um you know unusual uh uh you know chemical chemically modified andrens yeah I I actually uh I've met Patrick a number of times I've spent a lot of time speaking with him and um in in in a very emotional way and in just a very uh Frank way he he can explain in great detail exactly how he modified these androgens yeah no and and and the guy has encyclopedic knowledge apparently of of everything that's ever been synthesized in the andren field and what it does in terms of Half-Life and that metabolism and that sort of thing and then I think if you think about

[01:50:43] Victor K Jr you know a uh a a refugee from the Tower of Power junior college educated uh rockjazz musici I who's one of the great Auto dicks ever out there and and and you know so so so so I think with both of these individuals step back from the legal ethical ramifications and and and say what do they know and and and and try to be a little bit objective about that and then you know you with doping you get into all sorts of other sort of areas you know um you know what was in in the in the in the in the cultures those people were operating in what was considered the cultural norm I mean you know and and

[01:51:28] Lance was not the only person doing industrial strength doping was he doing it better than other people if there were six ways to dope and and person X was doing two and you were doing three was Lance doing all six that sort of thing uh and so so I think that that the other thing people have to recognize about doping is that you're always going to U in these incredibly competitive situations with these incredibly competitive people with comp competitive organizations or or people that have you know foreign policy you know my our country is better than yours because we want more Metals is that there's always going to be some sort of arms race mentality and you see it with training you know if you're in there lifting an hour a day I'm going to go lift an hour and 10 minutes a day and and so where does it stop do you still think that growth hormone human growth hormone which is of course not something that can readily be tested for is still one of the more utilized agents probably even today for performance enhancement you know I think there's there's probably some of it going on you know I

[01:52:32] I think that I my guess is people are are probably have drifted back to more short acne androgens lowd do short acting andrens and hope for the best and uh that would be my guess uh the same would be true with with lowd do EPO uh uh and or and or you know sort of related compound or or other factors uh you know but again uh when when you when you learn about growth hormone it's typically because person X says that they're sending FedEx package you know trainer X or or Source X has been sending FedEx packages to athlete why you know that kind of thing yeah as opposed and I think that's that's really the bottom line is it's so much of this is is um you know and again again like the the the Russians so much of this has a Jud Jud judicial slash you know investigatory element to it when you when you get to the big scandals why do you think some sports seem more affective than others so for example swimming as a general rule seems less impacted than than than say cycling or even running even though the demands are still pretty high hard to know and how culture is head one way or the next is is you know I leave you know is I feel like yeah bones Dr Bones in in Star

[01:53:58] Trek I'm a doctor not a you know what I mean I'm a doctor not a sociologist Peter and and I think you know ingroups outgroups and the things that those folks are sociologist and and tribalism that people who think about you know tribalistic behaviors what's normal what's not normal and and so forth I think that that's really uh really really really

[01:54:19] U key to understanding that sort of thing key to understanding that sort of thing so so we started this discussion Mike by talking about the Miracles of exercise correct went through all of these things that exercise is doing physiologically and how the net impact of these things is so profound correct on the length of your life and the quality of your life there's no shortage of Pharma companies out there that are trying to understand how can those benefits be put into a pill exercise pill sure exactly what is your level of optimism around the idea that some of the benefits of exercised could be uh basically captured by a pharmaceutical strategy so so there's a couple things there Peter one is is the efforts for sort sort of exercise memetics so far have been primarily things that increased mitochondrial biosynthesis so uh and that appears like it it it at least Works in animal models and and then you always how do you translate it from one to the next but as

[01:55:29] I pointed out exercise sure it makes your mitochondria better or makes more of them but making your mitochondria better isn't going to make your autonomic nervous system better isn't going to make your blood pressure better isn't going to um necessarily make the lining of your blood vessels better so on and so forth so it's not going to make your heart bigger so on and so forth so I think at least so far at least so far um you know these have been sort of onetick ponies and and and while you might be able to get some benefits for people that that are you know wheelchair bound or whatever although even those folk I mean people that are quadr poic let's put it that way not even wheelchair bound uh or or or you know can't exercise for some other reason that may be helpful I think the jury is really still out and and I so I think that I'm not particularly enthusiastic about it I don't think you're ever going to get one that does any more than a little bit I think more interestingly I like to tell people you know at some level there's already an exercise M medic out there it's called the poly pill if if you look at the data on people who get a combination one pill a day of of lotos statins low dose blood pressure meds and maybe one or two other other components it it causes you know pretty nice reductions in risk factors in most people uh because because the um doses are low the side effects tend to be low and so forth and and but again none of this is patentable you know there's no there's no market for it but but if if if people don't want to exercise can't exercise or whatever you know I think you know a better choice than trying to find some mythical exercise M medic is to to use a poly pill which would do the same things you give them a stat and their cholesterol goes down and maybe their endothal function gets better you you do a tiny bit of Metformin maybe their glucose tolerance gets better you do a bit of beta blockers their heart rate is lower that sort of thing so I so

[01:57:29] I and again I'm not advocating this but but there's all sorts of data out there that that you know a polypill is would be a A or at least data and speculation and modeling suggesting a polypill is a quote legitimate unquote whatever that means you know potential Public Health strategy for lifestyle diseases I would encourage people to exercise and and and do the sorts of things you're talking about but I think poly pills have been understudied so Mike what is it you're most excited about right now uh you know what is the what is the what is the question you're most interested in trying to answer I'm excited about a lot of things so we've got some interesting data with Sarah Baker on sex differences in blood pressure regulation I'm I'm quite interested in in you know Human

[01:58:16] Performance as you know Peter the first thing they teach in medical school is that a right shift in the oxygen hemoglobin dis Association curve is good for you at altitude well all animals that are genetically adapted over over centuries you know Millennia to high altitude llamas the birds that fly over

[01:58:32] Mount ever so forth are left shifted we've been doing some really cool hypoxia studies and people with rare left shifted hemoglobins I'm super interested in that just as sort of a physiological question C can you explain to folks what the right and left shift looks like on the hemoglobin dissociation curve a right shift you know think of a of a a curve a linear situation an s-shaped curve uh uh kind of an italicized curve and so the idea is that if you shift it to the right the red stuff the hemoglobin in your blood doesn't hold on to the oxygen so it releases it and can give the oxygen to the tissue and that's great if it's hypoxic now the problem with that is it's harder for that kind of hemoglobin to get the oxygen out of the lung and animals like llamas and like these incredible athletes called the bar-headed that fly over Mount

[01:59:24] Everest yeah and without acclamation they're living in the plains of Mongolia one day they just fly over Mount Everest and go to India they're left shifted because they prefer to make sure that they can pick up the oxy out of the air in their lungs at very high altitude so we have a family of people and some other uh subjects that we studied uh that are left shifted and and um it's very meaning there is a family of people who genetically instead of shift right and there's all sorts of hemog rare hemoglobin variants and these just are not you know they don't they're not like CLE cell or anything like that so what's interesting it's very interesting Peter to be sitting in the lab having somebody breathe in 10% oxygen talking to you these left shifted people do that it's it's crazy it's just wild what is the F2 at the top of Everest by the way just for comparon uh the F F2 at the top

[02:00:18] Everest is well the uh barometric pressure is about 250 so it' be 21% of 250 so roughly about 50 so so once you get into your lung I I think arterials about in the 30s wow yeah and so so 10% would be if and certainly at at at 15% which is 3,000 meters these people exercise like like no you know they do fine so I'm very interested in that and then as I mentioned uh you know before we went on is through a weird collection of events um as when the pandemic struck in March and early April of 2020 I somehow uh became the principal investigator of the US convalescent plasma program a program that was initially designed to facilitate in 5,000 patients compassionate use of convalescent plasma plasma from recovered antibody rich plasma from recovered covid patients that we would give to uh give to uh people who had disease and hopefully the antibodies would help them and there through all sorts of twists and turns we ended up doing over 100,000 people we found evidence if we gave people a whole lot of antibody early in the course of disease we made them better we also found some evidence that it was probably very helpful in people that were immune supressed and and that has been the gift that keeps giving so at age 60 you know one 62 63 I got kind of a a new career in immunology and infectious disease and so we're pursuing that and we're especially interested in that Peter because whenever covid sort of finally winds down about two to 3% of the population is what we call B cell deficient so B cells are the cells in your body that make antibodies help you respond to fight the virus or respond to the vaccine and and uh about two or 3% of the people don't have any or don't have very many and those people continue will continue to get Co and other forms of infectious disease and antibody therapy is essential uh to help those folks and and and I was telling you uh you know

[02:02:23] I'm very happy that we've published papers and high-profile journals but uh we just learned yesterday from People magazine of all places that the actor Jeff Bridges uh you know the dude from the big Labowski he uh the dude himself the dude himself had gotten lymphoma gotten drugs that that depleted his B cells which is typical for lymphoma patients got Co he could not clear the co and and responded to convalescent plasma how What's the total volume of plasma you need to give a patient in that set if you get really high tighter stuff 2 to 400 MLS that's it one time treatment yeah typically sometimes we give people more and what's been helpful

[02:03:01] Peter is that we now have people that have been both vaccinated and they've had a breakthrough infection or they've had an infection and been vaccinated right so they have hybrid immunity and those people make uh you know really really uh their plasma has a whole whole lot of antibodies in them and they're broad spectrum so they cover all the variants and they almost anticipate future variants because of the of the the way the immune system works and as as a sort of a sloppy replicator and so they cover a lot of the variants they cover potential future variants and as monoclonal antibodies which have been super helpful during the pandemic as those get uh less effective due to escape variants this very high tighter plasma is still available so so we're back doing exercise studies we're back writing papers about exercise and doing our regular physiology but I I think um this antibody therapy's really got you know took a bite out of me and it's it's uh it's like what what Jim Bouton said the great pitcher you know you spend your life uh gripping the ball and and thinking about your grip on the ball and in reality it was the other way around the ball had a grip on you so you know

[02:04:12] I've been thinking a lot about antibodies and maybe antibodies have been thinking about me because it's really hard to stop thinking about it because it's so interesting and and we get uh reports back to us from you know not famous patients that are very similar to what we've heard in Mr Mr Bridges so we're quite excited to pursue uh these solutions for our immune supressed patients and I'm especially you know when I started medical school in 1982 those sorts of patients you know their life expectancy was quite low and now are patients with heem malignancy multiple Myoma lymphoma uh leukemia a lot of those people live a long long time and so how how long after a person uh is infected and recovers from infection are they a suitable plasma donor within about two to three weeks and we need make sure and then like what when does that window close uh certainly certainly it goes on for three or four months uh you know probably up to six months and it would probably reopen if they got boosted that sort of thing um but it only you only get sufficient antibodies from people who have had the actual infection not from people who just go get a booster uh what's happened is is that that that's been initially because there were no vaccines we only had people that had the normal normal infection since the vaccines have become widely available in the last almost 18 months now or 15 16 months we've now been able to get people who've had both and those people the people that have had both are really the U super donors you know and and and we can work with those people to come back in and and get multiple units we collect our own blood at Mayo we have a terrific blood bank here locally but but they're using it at

[02:05:50] Hopkins they're using at Harvard using it in Einstein a lot of other big places we're working with the societies the Food and Drug Administration and others like the lymphoma and or Leukemia Lymphoma Society the CLL group infectious disease or excuse me immune deficiency Foundation to make sure that we have this available for their for those sorts of patients they' they're doing this at scale in France to about 50 patients a week which would be about 300 a week in the US if you account for for you know uh population differences so that's one of the things we're quite interested in this is something people can donate it's a way for people to give back are are you able to find sufficient donors are there enough donors yeah there's there there's sufficient there there again because there's so many people who've been both infected and broken through there's a you know there's always logistical issues in terms of getting the person to the blood collecting Center getting it here getting it there but availability should be pretty high so and with plasma do you still have to do a type and cross yeah you still got it's got to still be typed and crossed people are subject they have to be eligible to otherwise donate blood yeah okay but during the during the peak of plasma use prior to the vaccines and prior to the monals you know 20 30 40,000 units a week were being used in the country and in the weeks when more plasma was being used the death rate two weeks later was lower so there's a pretty nice correlation between that so that's been but but again I think you know we've talked about training we've talked about you know a little bit about coaching we've talked about you participation in sports and so forth but

[02:07:22] I think one of the things that really helped me uh um you know uh work with the government and and work with our team to to instead of do a 5,000 person demonstration project do a do a really a treatment registry and over 100,000 100,000 patients was the organizational skills I learned from my coaches who who and I and I used to joke with the uh hups in the Food and Drug

[02:07:47] Administration they say well how did you do that I say I'm a recovering physical educator and that was always a always got it was always good for a laughter in at least a few Dark Hours last last question Mike um given your long-standing history in athletics both personally and professionally are you optimistic or pessimistic about the future of Americans based on the level of physical activity that we we see uh we need to do something we need to do something and I think really reflects our our society in general I think that you have you know for lack of a better word upper middle class kids who have access to superb coaching to superb facilities and to programmatic things I think we've got a tremendous problem with Play and unstructured play and I think we've got a whole lot of people that are are things that when I was growing up in the 60s and 70s that were done through the park park district and the school School

[02:08:51] District I think a lot of those opportunities are U are uh have fallen by the wayside I I mean we used to have you know the kids who were College athletes used to come back and have open gym all over Tucson when I was a kid and there's no open gym at the high schools in Rochester Minnesota a rich community in the summer and and I mean the and the advantage of open gym was a you know you got people off the street and they were doing things and and um you got better athletes and in in in uh and and you know even and the police knew where we were uh which which which they're always very pleased about you know if they know that they if they know that all the high energy boys are in one place it makes their life a little easier as well so so

[02:09:37] I I think uh yeah I think it's a real problem so so I think we'll have these incredible performances by the kids who have access but I think that that what we're doing in the rest of the world is is is proba atic and and you know if I could I guess if I could do anything uh i' I'd start a national open gym movement uh you know uh winter summer whatever because a lot of we have a lot of nice facilities that are used just you know a limited number of time per day yeah could you imagine if you were

[02:10:11] Zar and and you could sort of do anything and you just said no matter what it no matter what your lot is in life right if you're a school child if you're a person who works in an office if you're a person who works in we somehow rearrange the day such that every person has a mandatory 1eh hour activity right you you could make it exercise right you could make it you you you can go to the gym for an hour but but it could also be look at a minimum you got to go out and walk well you know it's interesting you mention that because uh in our department uh with with uh remote work and so forth this is broken alab it but we had a number of secretaries terrific you know almost they were all women middle women and we have this huge sort of uh you know deep bunker system at the bowels of the hospital with these huge hallways and it's about a mile around the place and and these these these folks would go down and walk at lunch and they're literally you know they'd bring bring their tennis shoes to work and they they would meet up with their Pals and uh you know they'd go do 30 40 minutes a day of of laps at lunchtime uh with the secretaries all over the hospital and it was uh I think terrific for them uh I think it was a social event for them and and I think that they solved a lot of problems too and and they actually made them way more productive I believe it well Mike as I said at the outset I've enjoyed reading your fantastic Peter put a qu yeah for more than two decades and I'll continue to do so and it's been it's been great to to chat and hopefully we can meet in person at some point and one do a do a workout together where where where do you live now Austin or someplace yeah I live in Austin yeah coil at the

[02:11:51] University of Texas is a good friend of mine so yeah I look forward to it yeah well it's funny I I I have been meaning to to get a hold of him and I'd like to have him on the podcast as well because i' also also a lot of his stuff yep Edd's quite a guy yeah exactly all right Peter thanks much y all right thanks bye bye [Music]
