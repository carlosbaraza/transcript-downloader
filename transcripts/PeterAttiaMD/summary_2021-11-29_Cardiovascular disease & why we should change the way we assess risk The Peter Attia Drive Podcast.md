Allan Sniderman is a highly acclaimed Professor of Cardiology and Medicine at McGill University and a foremost expert in cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this episode, Allan explains the many risk factors used to predict atherosclerosis, including triglycerides, cholesterol, and lipoproteins, and he makes the case for apoB as a superior metric that is currently being underutilized. Allan expresses his frustration with the current scientific climate and its emphasis on consensus and unanimity over encouraging multiple viewpoints, thus holding back the advancement of metrics like apoB for assessing CVD risk, treatment, and prevention strategies. Finally, Allan illuminates his research that led to his 30-year causal model of risk and explains the potentially life-saving advantages of early intervention for the prevention of future disease.

We discuss:
00:00:00 - Intro
00:00:10 - Problems with the current 10-year risk assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the implications for prevention
00:14:32 - A primer on cholesterol, apoB, and plasma lipoproteins
00:22:07 - Pathophysiology of CVD and the impact of particle cholesterol concentration vs. number of particles
00:28:45 - Limitations of standard blood panels
00:33:10 - Remnant type III hyperlipoproteinemia—high cholesterol, low Apo B, high triglyceride
00:39:26 - Using apoB to estimate risk of CVD
00:42:57 - How Mendelian randomization is bolstering the case for ApoB as the superior metric for risk prediction
00:53:47 - Hypertension and CVD risk
01:05:49 - Factors influencing the decision to begin preventative intervention for CVD
01:11:37 - Using the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score as a predictive tool
01:23:27 - The challenge of motivating individuals to take early interventions
01:26:30 - How medical advancement is hindered by the lack of critical thinking once a “consensus” is reached
01:33:24 - PSK9 inhibitors and familial hypercholesterolemia: two examples of complex topics with differing interpretations of the science
01:39:49 - Defining risk and uncertainty in the guidelines
01:46:07 - Making clinical decisions in the face of uncertainty
01:51:58 - How the emphasis on consensus and unanimity has become a crucial weakness for science and medicine
01:59:58 - Factors holding back the advancement of apoB for assessing CVD risk, treatment, and prevention strategies
02:11:44 - Advantages of a 30-year risk assessment and early intervention

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The episode features a deep discussion between Dr. Peter Attia and Dr. Allan Sniderman about cardiovascular disease risk assessment and prevention. They discuss the limitations of current risk assessment models and argue for a paradigm shift in how we evaluate cardiovascular risk. The conversation centers on the importance of ApoB particles versus traditional cholesterol measurements, and the need for longer-term risk assessment models.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- ApoB is a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular risk than LDL cholesterol [08:15]
- Current 10-year risk calculators are inadequate for predicting lifetime cardiovascular risk [04:30]
- Half of all heart attacks occur before age 60, despite risk calculators showing low risk [05:45]
- Atherosclerosis begins developing in the 20s and 30s [15:20]
- Type 3 dyslipidemia cannot be diagnosed without measuring ApoB [32:40]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider measuring ApoB levels rather than just LDL cholesterol [25:30]
- Start prevention earlier rather than waiting for high risk scores [18:45]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Young patients with positive calcium scores need aggressive intervention [38:15]
- High ApoB levels at age 35 warrant consideration of early intervention [42:30]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Statins discussed as primary prevention [28:15]
- PCSK9 inhibitors mentioned in context of clinical trials [45:20]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- ApoB measurement costs approximately $2-2.50 [26:15]
- Coronary calcium scoring discussed as risk stratification tool [37:30]
- Non-HDL cholesterol as alternative to ApoB [22:45]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"Prevention really starts at 55 to 60. But half almost half of all infarcts and strokes occur before the age of 60." [05:45]

"Any cholesterol in the artery only got there within an ApoB particle." [12:30]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. How can the medical community be convinced to adopt ApoB testing more widely?
2. What role does inflammation play in the ApoB-atherosclerosis relationship?
3. How can risk assessment models be improved to better account for lifetime risk?
