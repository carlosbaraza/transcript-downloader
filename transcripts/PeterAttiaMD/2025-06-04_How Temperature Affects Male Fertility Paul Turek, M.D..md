This clip is from episode 351 ‒ Male fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility, and navigating testosterone replacement therapy | Paul Turek, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Heat Exposure Affects Male Fertility – The testicles are temperature-sensitive, and excess heat can interfere with sperm production
-  Hot Tubs Are a Known Risk Factor – Time spent immersed in hot water can negatively impact sperm quality and fertility
- Saunas May Be Less Concerning Than Hot Tubs – Because they don’t heat the scrotum as directly, saunas might be safer, though caution is still advised
- Cold Exposure Like Cold Plunges Is Less Understood – Cold may not carry the same risks as heat

## AI Summary

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode segment focuses on the relationship between temperature and male fertility, specifically discussing how various heat exposures affect sperm production and quality. Dr. Paul Turek shares insights from his research on how hot tubs, saunas, and cold exposure impact testicular function. The discussion reveals that heat exposure, particularly through water immersion, can significantly impair sperm production, while cold exposure generally poses less risk to fertility.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Testicles naturally maintain a temperature 3°F cooler than body temperature (95°F vs 98°F) [00:00:00]
- Hot tub exposure (105-110°F) for 20 minutes, 3x/week can reduce sperm count to zero [00:03:22]
- Study showed 300% improvement in semen quality after 3-4 months of avoiding hot tubs [00:02:33]
- 600% improvement in total motile sperm count at 6 months after cessation [00:02:59]
- Sauna effects are approximately 1/3 to 1/4 as impactful as hot tub exposure [00:05:24]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Avoid hot tub immersion when trying to conceive [00:01:58]
- Steam rooms and showers are generally safe [00:05:24]
- Cold exposure (like cold plunging) is generally safe for fertility [00:06:04]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Not discussed in this segment

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
Not discussed in this segment

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
Not discussed in this segment

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Sperm count and motility measurements [00:02:59]
- Total motile sperm count as key metric [00:03:22]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Brazilian Journal of Urology publication on hot tub effects [00:01:58]
- Vasser College PhD thesis on heat exposure [00:04:19]
- New York Times article featuring the research [00:04:50]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"I calculated a lethal dose of tubbing... 20 minutes of a hot bath or tub, 104 degrees, three times a week would probably make you zero." [00:03:53]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Long-term effects of chronic cold exposure on fertility
- Impact of alternating hot/cold exposure (contrast therapy)

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Tell me about the impact of cold plunging and sauna and hot tubbing um on uh on on fertility for men. Okay, so the test it says outside the body. Yep. It's 3° cooler than the rest of the body. So 95 versus 98 degrees Fahrenheit. And then there's a reason for that. Unknown. We had that conversation. We don't really know why. But uh it may be that it's an imunologic sanctuary and that's the only way to do it and that God or

[00:00:26] Dorman could figure out. But um if you heat up the testicle, it's also close to the skin. So it's a radiator. So when the heat comes down the arterial blood, it has to cool. So it raises and lowers. And there was a journal in the there was an article in the journal of irreproducible results about 20 years ago. A man went to Big Su and wore nothing. and he measured ambient temperature and he marked on his leg with a marker where his scrotum hung, how low it hung and he could tell the ambient temperature by how high or low his scrotum hung. He became a thermometer. So, so it does go up and down. Is that Peter or

[00:01:05] Taturn of irreproducible results? Oh god, really cool. But it showed that it's very temperature sensitive, right? And it goes up and down to regulate it closer to the body when you want it warmer, etc. You go into a cold shower or a plunge, where are your testicles? They're way up there, right? In my abdomen. Yeah. And that's all the cremic muscle. And it's all temperature driven.

[00:01:24] So it spends all of its time regulating its temperature to stay at 95. Now saunas, baths, hot tubs, jacuzzi, steam rooms change that, right? The worst one of those is anything underwater, submerging underwater because you're 1 centimeter away. You're a liquid. It's a liquid. You're going to turn that temperature. Maybe not the in part inner part of your body, but little kids going into hot tubs, right? They overheat. So testicles will certainly overheat. So you get into a 105 degree hot tub, which is a very typical temperature for a hot tub is 105 to 110.

[00:01:58] You're saying within a relatively short period of time, your testes will assume that temperature. Absolutely. Yeah. You're 70% liquid. And this is right at the surface. Published in the Brazilian Journal of Urology. very I published 200 studies. This was the hardest one to get in. Everyone said we know that it affects it affects fertility. So I don't we're not going to publish it. So American I went to Brazilian Journal of Urology. It then went to the New York Times as a press release. That's how popular it was. It's probably my most cited paper ever and it's certainly not my best. It's very interesting. I took infertile men with low sperm counts and stopped the tubs.

[00:02:33] They were in hot baths because I used the word jacuzzi. Jacuzzi called me up and said stop. Don't use that word. So I don't use that word. So hot baths or tubs. And I told them out and they went up 300%. Their semen an semen quality went up 300% total mold count in 3 months or four months and 600% at 6 months. So you know you have to give us some time and that's that curve right the recovery curve. And we didn't look at fertility.

[00:02:59] We just looked at that recovery. And some men were zero and went up to close. What was the age range of these men? 35. So fertile men. Yep. trying to conceive. Yeah, these are men who are not able to conceive. You're making the diagnosis. I think it's your hot tub. Let's get you out of there. And they have a six-fold increase in sperm count. Total motor sperm count meaning count motility mainly driven by motility. Interesting.

[00:03:22] So, it's motility that the price the biggest one but also count might have doubled may have gone up threefold kind of thing. So, six-fold increase overall. Then I calculated after that I calculated a lethal dose of tubbing. So, what's the lethal dose? 50. Yeah. So lethal dose to me means you're zero. Y you do it enough, you have no sperm. And it came out to be 20 minutes of a hot bath or tub. 20 minutes 104° uh three times a week would probably make you zero.

[00:03:53] Wow. There have to be a lot of guys out there who are spending at least 3* 20 minute sessions in a hot tub that's at least 104° a week. And the highest group the biggest interesting the largest group of people in tubs in Northern California we did the study were environmental lawyers. I don't know it's like is your job that stressful? It's like yeah it is. I mean it probably is in California.

[00:04:19] All right. So then then I think there's been studies that was the I mean the only study ever done prior to that was a PhD thesis at Vasser College where someone had a guy dip their testicles into a a bucket for 20 minutes at really hot and looked at their sperm counts or their fertility and they went they went they was the only and I couldn't even find it wasn't published I had to go you had to figure out this thesis thing but that's how little was written about it and they gave me so much flack for publishing this it was really funny and

[00:04:50] The New York Times had an article said, you know, it drew a drew a condom and it drew birth control pills and it drew a guy in a tub. It's like pick your contraceptive. So, it's huge. And I asked it, I'd say 10% of my population's in it. Then the next question is, what about saunas? So, sauners is not underwater. It's not submersion, but sauners are you're in a you're in a hot room. You you you're going to it's going to affect it. And I would say the effect is one quarter to oneird as profound as a hot bath or submersion. So my friend was absolutely right to have those ice packs on his scrotum.

[00:05:24] He's think he's reading. Yeah. He's listen protocol. Yeah. And then I would say steam rooms, showers are probably fine. Yep. Because you you're in an ambient temperature is normal and I think steam rooms are probably between saunas and you know it depends how much time you spend but it's probably not normal but not a hot bath.

[00:05:44] Hot baths are terrible. Okay. Okay. And then what about the cold? I don't worry about cold. I remember Surfer magazine called me and said, um, you know, I know a California surfer, right? LA surfer. And they they said, uh, the editor of Surfer Magazine called me said, "Are are surfers infertile?" I'll let I said, "Is that water bad for them?" Because

[00:06:04] California water is 60°. And I said, "No, I have never met an infertile surfer." So, I don't think it's bad at all. All right. So, the cold is okay. Especially plunge where you're talking seconds. Yeah. Yeah. you know, your testicles are going to go up and you're you're going to be able to maintain that heat. I think if you did it all the time, it would probably be bad. Yeah, because enzymes work in the testicle at that one temperature. They work optimally. I'm Peter Aia.
