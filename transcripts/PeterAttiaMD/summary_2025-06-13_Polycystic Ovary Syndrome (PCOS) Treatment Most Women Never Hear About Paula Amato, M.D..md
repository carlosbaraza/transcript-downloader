This clip is from episode #352 ‒ Female fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility and PCOS, and understanding the IVF process | Paula Amato, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- PCOS Affects 6–8% of Reproductive-Age Women – Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common endocrine disorders among women aged 15 to 30
- Treatment Depends on Pregnancy Intentions – The approach varies significantly depending on whether or not the patient is trying to conceive
- Oral Contraceptives Reduce Androgens – Birth control pills are effective in lowering testosterone, easing acne, and restoring menstrual regularity
- GLP-1 Agonists Must Be Discontinued Before Pregnancy – These weight-loss medications are effective, but must be stopped at least 2 months before trying to conceive
- Ovulation Can Often Be Induced Without IVF – Letrozole is a highly effective, underused option for inducing ovulation in PCOS patients
