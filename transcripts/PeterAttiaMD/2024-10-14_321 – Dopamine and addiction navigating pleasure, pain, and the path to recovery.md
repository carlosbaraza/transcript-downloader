Anna Lembke is the Chief of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic and author of Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence. In this episode, Anna dives deep into the biochemistry and neurobiology of addiction, exploring the critical role of dopamine and the prefrontal cortex. She shares her framework for diagnosing and treating addiction, providing real-world examples involving alcohol, gambling, cannabis, social media, and more. Anna outlines the risk factors for addiction, including inherited and nurture-based risks, explores the rise of addictions in younger generations, and discusses effective ways to address these issues with children. Additionally, she touches on healthy coping strategies, the evolution of the “marshmallow experiment,” and provides insights into GLP-1 agonists as a possible tool for addiction treatment. Finally, she reflects on the value of 12-step programs and how she navigates the emotional challenges of her work.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dr. Anna Lembke:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode explores addiction, dopamine, and recovery through both a neurobiological and clinical lens. Dr. Lembke, a psychiatrist and addiction specialist, discusses how modern society has created unprecedented access to highly reinforcing substances and behaviors. The conversation covers everything from traditional chemical addictions to behavioral addictions, treatment approaches, and the role of dopamine in pleasure and pain. Particular emphasis is placed on emerging challenges like social media addiction and pornography addiction among youth.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Dopamine is the final common pathway for all reinforcing substances and behaviors [03:50]
- Pain and pleasure are co-located in the brain and work like a balance [54:24]
- The brain maintains homeostasis through neuroadaptation [51:10]
- Cold exposure stimulates neurogenesis [2:02:24]
- GLP-1 agonists show promise in treating both food and alcohol addiction [2:12:12]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal recommendations:
- Consider periodic "dopamine fasts" to reset reward pathways [49:24]
- Practice self-binding strategies to create barriers between desire and consumption [1:07:51]
- Truth-telling is crucial for developing healthy reward systems [2:07:33]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For addiction recovery, consider combining multiple approaches (medication, therapy, support groups) [2:14:32]
- Limit young people's unsupervised access to internet/smartphones [1:43:19]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:

Medications mentioned:
- Naltrexone for alcohol use disorder [2:14:32]
- Baclofen for alcohol use disorder [2:13:58]
- Gabapentin (600mg 3x/day) for alcohol withdrawal [2:13:58]
- Semaglutide (GLP-1 agonist) showing promise for addiction [2:15:36]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"We are cacti living in a rainforest" - regarding modern dopamine stimulation [1:43:40]

"The reason that the work that we do works when it does work is because we actually love our patients" [2:30:33]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What role does genetics play in determining one's "drug of choice"?
2. How might the emergence of AI and VR impact addiction patterns?
3. What are the long-term implications of widespread GLP-1 agonist use for addiction treatment?

Would you like me to expand on any of these sections or provide additional analysis of specific topics from the episode?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] the interesting thing for me about treating addiction is that it is a bioc psychosocial disease right there's a biological component psychological and a deeply embedded social and cultural component such that for example workaholism is really celebrated in our culture and we have many many Workaholics and you and I might even be in that category and yet there are so many social rewards monetary uh you know social validation um you know you name it um that that this compulsive engagement in the work that we do um we may not ever identify as problematic unless we begin to look at s more subtle manifestations or harms like opportunity costs like because I'm spending all this time working I really don't know my children right or because I'm spending all this this time working I'm not cultivating friendships or not investing in um you know my my partner or in my health or or whatever it may be hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:10] AA Anna thank you so much for making time to sit down with me today I've been looking forward to this for for quite a while months actually um so thank you for uh for humoring me and talking about subject that you I know talk about a lot well thank you for inviting me I'm delighted to be here um I actually hadn't realized that you were were a fellow Stanford grad so that was fun to learn I know I feel like we were passing each other briefly right because I think you graduated two years before I started but then you were in your residency while I was in med school so the probability that we ran into each other in the cafeteria or uh going through the hall is is probably pretty high yes it's perfectly possible that I Scutt you out as a medical student and made you go do things that you know I did want to do I I always tell people like I have the Fondest Memories of medical school but there are certain things that I still remember and I can't believe they were the case and one of them is that for a school as as uh as fancy and prestigious that do you recall we didn't have a bathroom in the library ah remember that fact yes I as you it could be I did not spend as much time in the library as I should have um

[00:02:29] I do remember that we had our anatomy classes in in trailers y I remember that yes um well we ended up studying mostly in the business school library which was really fancy had bathrooms um and didn't have business students in it because of reasons that are probably obvious so anyway um anyway great to sit down with you so there there's actually a lot I want I want to talk about with you some of it is uh the substance of what you've written about in dopamine Nation uh and and I'd love to probably start there but there's so much other you know material

[00:03:01] I'd love to cover with you if our time permits but um obviously one of the things that anyone who's familiar with you um thinks about is this role of dopamine and understanding addiction this clearly plays into a big part of your clinical practice as a psychiatrist um but I also realize that terms get thrown around quite Loosely and sometimes it can just be helpful for people to understand a little bit of of what we describe as as the semantic so I

[00:03:30] I'd like to actually start with an understanding maybe of some of the biochemistry and the neurobiology of dopamine and then I want to also talk about what an addiction really is um but this word dopamine is is something everyone has heard of um but tell us a little bit about the molecule how it works um and maybe even some of what The

[00:03:50] Supporting Cast of other neurotransmitters look like that factor into these Pathways that that obviously play an important role in our Evolution and our our existence yeah great place to start thank you for setting the stage so dopamine is a neurotransmitter so it's a chemical that we make in our brains neurotransmitters are the chemicals that allow for fine-tune modulation of the neural circuits that make us who we are you might think of the brain as a collection of wires uh those wires are neurons they send electrical impulses one to the other but the neurons don't actually touch end to end there's a little gap between them called the synap gaps and that Gap is bridged by molecules called neurotransmitters there are many different neurotransmitters in the brain um they have many different functions but dopamine has become uh kind of the common currency for measuring pleasure reward and motivation it's not the only neurotransmitter involved in that process obviously but it is the final common pathway for all reinforcing substances and behaviors so whether whether the substance is primarily you know modulating our serotonergic system or norepinephrine or the nicotinic system or the endogenous opioid system or the endogenous cannabinoid system the final common pathway for all of those chemical

[00:05:16] Cascades is to release dopamine in a dedicated part of the brain called the reward circuitry which consists of the prefrontal cortex that's that large gray matter area right behind our foreheads and then these deeper Li or emotion brain structures like the nucleus accumbens and the vental tegmental area we're always releasing dopamine at a baseline tonic level uh but when we do something that's pleasurable or reinforcing or that our brains consider

[00:05:44] Salient or important for survival so in some cases it might even be an aversive stimulus um then temporarily we will increase stok mean firing above Baseline that generally feels good to us which is how we tell our brains oh this is important I should approach explore and consider doing this again so broadly speaking that that's dopamine's function it's not its only function by the way so dopamine is also really important for movement as you know Parkinson's disease which is a movement disorder is characterized by a decrease or a depletion of dopamine in a different part of the brain called the substantia um and one of the ways that we treat Parkinson's is to actually give people l dopa which is a dopamine precursor why do we give them L Doopa and not dopamine because dopamine itself actually can't cross the blood brain barrier so we give them a precursor that crosses the blood brain barrier and then um you know binds to dopamine receptors in the substanti allowing for more fluid movements in people with

[00:06:47] Parkinson's unfortunately uh lopa transformed to dopamine also binds dopamine receptors in the reward pathway which is why about a quarter of folks with Parkinson's who get treated with lopa end up with uh addictive disorders that are usually uh reversible when you stop the lopa and tend to be um dose dependent so the more lopa the more likely the sex addiction shopping addiction or whatever the compulsive

[00:07:16] Behavior okay a lot there um and many questions but one of them is the role of the prefrontal cortex now again I think people listening to us probably um have heard about the prefrontal cortex uh it comes up a lot when we talk about dementia it talks it comes up a lot when we talk about higher order cognitive function Judgment centers um but it is also something that I believe and I could be wrong on this but I believe this is a part of the brain that is more developed in our species than in others um so I guess a question then would be around the um addictive potential of our species versus others Are we more susceptible to what we're about to talk about addiction um with a larger prefrontal cortex or is it not as simple as just the anatomic size of this part of the brain so um so I guess to back up for a second the prefrontal cortex has many roles but when we think about its role in um addiction or other repetitive disorders it actually has a stop function so if you think about um you know if you if you analogize to a car the prefrontal cortex um acts like the brakes on the car it allows for delayed gratification this is where we have the control centers uh it allows for appreciating future consequences uh it's it lights up when we're engaged in autobiographical narrative and of course narrative is part of the ways that we um actually uh create metacognitive awareness to inform future decisions so having a a very robust prefrontal cortex is is potentially protective Against

[00:09:02] Addiction um people who have cognitive or attentional disorders who are thought to have a disorder of the prefrontal cortex for example attention deficit disorder are at higher risk to develop addictive disorders so essentially again if you think of this as like the car analogy the prefrontal cortex is the breaks the nucleus accumbens is the accelerator the nucleus accumbens is deep you know deep in the brain is rich in dopamine releasing neurons and that like acts like the accelerator on the car so addiction is a problem either with too little on the brakes too much on the accelerator or some combination thereof in terms of whether or not um humans are are more likely to get addicted than animals I would say no um what's remarkable um about this reward circuitry is how incredibly conserved it is over millions of years Evolution and across species so you know neuroscientists used to talk about uh the lizard brain or the Triune brain they're not typically using that that phraseology so much anymore but what they were getting at was that if you look at the nucleus AC compens ventral tegmental area um it's amazingly unchanged across species over millions of years of evolution it's really you know our reflexive uh approaching pleasure and avoid avoiding pain is is what has kept us alive you know for for so uh so so many many generations on the planet um and so it's a very basic primordial structure that all living organisms or or you know more Advan well not even advanc even primitive organisms have you know even the most primitive nematode or worm will release dopamine in response to food in its environment which that dopamine allows it to locomote toward food it's probably no coincidence that the same neurotransmitter involved in movement is also involved in pleasure reward and motivation because prior to about 500 years ago if you wanted to get a reward you had to work for it that's no longer true which is one of the reasons our brains are um so confused today so I would say you know to again to just sort of try to answer your question um you could almost make the opposite argument that because we have these large frontal loes that can sort of reason and appreciate future consequences human beings might be even more capable of getting out of the cycle of addiction than um other organisms I mean it is miraculous that even people deep in the most severe addiction can find somewhere within themselves the capacity to stop using this is it's really really remarkable um and and you know I'm it seems to me almost a miracle in my clinical work when I get people who have been in severe addictions for decades who somehow find it within themselves either through some logical reasoning or some spiritual surrender or some combination to actually get into recovery there's so much I want to talk about on that front um but I I think I I'll still try to um get some of the more basic uh stuff out of the way just to make sure when we get there it we have a have the foundation to understand some of the incredible stories you've shared so um let's take a moment to now maybe technically Define an addiction uh I'm sure everybody once in a while has said man I'm addicted to

[00:12:41] Netflix and I'm addicted to chocolate and I'm addicted to this but how does one truly Define an addiction in a clinical setting yes so when I use the term addiction I I'm referring to a form of Psychopathology not the more common colloquial casual use of I'm addicted to Netflix although you know you could argue that we actually are addicted to

[00:13:03] Netflix um and we'll probably get there so the diagnosis of addiction is based on what we call phenomenology these are patterns of behavior that repeat themselves across individuals with unique temperaments demographics time periods Geographic locations um there is no brain scan or blood test to diagnose addiction although we know that addiction is characterized by distinct Brain Change changes we're just not at a state-ofthe-art where we can diagnose it based on that so it's still based on patterns of behavior that can broadly be summarized as the four C's plus tolerance and withdrawal so the four C's are out of control use compulsive use cravings and continued use despite consequences now as you can imagine that phenomenology is going to be a judgment call right and it's going to be based on both that individual's subjective endorsement of having those kinds of issues plus the observation of other people around them which is to say if you went to 10 different psychiatrists you might get 10 different diagnoses and that is true for all mental health disorders so we we don't have any brain scans or blood tests to diagnose any mental health disorder the entire DSM or Diagnostic and statistical

[00:14:25] Manual of mental disorders which is our kind of codification of different buckets that we put people in for different forms of Psychopathology is completely based on phenomenology um so you have the four CES and then you have tolerance and withdrawal so those are very clear evidence of physiologic changes psychological changes are also physiologic changes but here we're talking about more obvious manifestations of it being um say a physical chemical body reaction tolerance is the phenomenon of of finding that the drug stops working over time um and that we need more and more to get the same effect or more more potent forms and and and tolerance is overcome by using more using more often or overcoming tolerance by changing the delivery mechanism instead of you know orally ingesting maybe smoking or injecting or um overcoming tolerance by changing slightly the chemical combination or Moy or combining drugs together so that the brain sees something that's similar but slightly novel and then in addition to tolerance there's a phenomenon of withdrawal which is to say when I cut back um or stop using my my body reacts in a very predictable fashion which is most often the opposite of whatever the intoxicant causes so if I'm taking a stimulant like cocaine or meth or nicotine or caffeine and I try to stop using my withdrawal phenomenon will will feel like sedation lethargy inattention if I'm using sedative like alcohol uh then my withdrawal phenomenon will be restlessness uh um jitteriness maybe even seizures maybe even life-threatening seizures in the case of alcohol and benzo aines and also keep in mind that the universal symptoms of withdrawal from any addictive substance are anxiety irritability insomnia dysphoria and craving and I always like to mention that because I'll have like cannabis users or alcohol users come in and say well you know I don't have any withdrawal so therefore I'm not add addicted well did you feel anxious did you feel Restless were you unable to sleep uh were you in craving mind because those are all the actions so to speak that our brain takes to get us to try to use again so I want to use just two examples and walk you know viewers and listeners through them so um let's start with a chemical one and let's just pick alcohol because of its ubiquity so let's go through how a person might be evaluating the for sees and tolerance withdrawal so I come to you and I say um

[00:17:05] I you know I'm here because people around me think I drink too much what what are sort of the questions we go through to probe that yeah great so we've developed a kind of framework that um relies on Gathering data in a way that's not threatening and sort of factually based starting simply with data so we would ask people what do you drink how much and often um when we try to quantify that specifically with alcohol we we bring it down to what we call the standard drink a standard drink is one 12 oz bottle of beer a 5 oz glass of wine or 1 to 1 and a half ounces of hard liquor so that's one standard drink we use something called the timeline followback method because it tends to be more reliable than a sort of General Gestalt where we say okay how much did you drink yesterday how much did you drink the day before that and the day before that and the day before that until we get seven days we add it all up and then the person goes oh wow I'm drinking 21 standard drinks in a week that's very useful information for me as a health care provider but also for that individual themselves because when we're chasing dopamine we have a funny way of not being very good self- observers and losing track so we simply gather the data then we ask people to tell us why they drink what what is it what is the positive thing that they get out of it as well as trying to hint a little bit at tolerance um which is to say is it still working for them the way that it used to um I should also mention when we're Gathering data we're also looking for binge patterns so some people can go a long time without drinking but then they'll have let's say for an adult male a binge is considered five or more standard drinks in a sitting a sitting is a single day um for one for an adult female it's four or more standard drinks uh in a sitting and when we find that pattern that's also very concerning let me just say that the really nice thing about alcohol is that these questions are based on epidemiologic studies showing that for an adult male who drinks more than 14 standard drinks per week or more than four on any given day or an adult female who drinks more than seven standard drinks per week or more than three on any given day there's a much higher risk not only of having an alcohol addiction but also developing all all cause morbidity mortality so pancreatitis heart disease um you know cancer injury accident and death so it's very nice to have that data to back that up but anyway we we start there is just to say that and then we then we probe you know and why do people drink people drink for all kinds of reasons but broadly speaking they drink to have fun or to solve a problem that problem can be anything from social anxiety to loneliness to boredom and everything in between so we really explore that with patients and then next we um you we ask about s like are you having you know what are the problems that you have noticed interpersonal problems work problems health problems the simple problem of Tolerance that it's not working for you the way that it used to um are you having mental health problems depression anxiety insomnia and attention um and we kind of go through those and then based on that um you know we begin to see a picture that nudges us toward thinking that yes person has what we call an alcohol use disorder um and again you can see it's quite judgmental and contextual right depending upon the culture but one of the things that often happens is people will normalize their use by affiliating with other people who drink heavily so they'll say well you know you may think that's a lot but my fraternity brother Joe drinks way more than I do it's like well yes but in in the general population you're in the one percentile um in terms of even just the amounts that you drink and we know that but just based on amounts you're at higher risk for all cause morbidity mortality even separate from our diagnosing an addictive disorder okay so what and you also already addressed the withdrawal and of course um I I'm sure many people are quite familiar with the medical complexity of alcohol withdrawal and how um things like DTS can become an actual physiologic risk to mortality if a patient isn't withdrawn safely from alcohol using things like benzo aines um and as as discussed earlier of course tolerance is is clear with with alcohol um what if we talk about something like gambling how does the the framework work for something like that in other words for a person to have a gambling addiction is is the sin quanon of that that they basically must be financially creating chaos in their lives or as long as they're you know you know if a person loses a million dollars a year in gambling but they make 10x that and it's not actually impacting their life in other ways is you know how do you sort of far it out whether or not this is this is pathologic yeah great question and I would say when you think about the for foresees control compulsion craving and consequences plus tolerance and withdrawal um none of those is a scen quanon and in fact you can have no tolerance and no withdrawal and still meet criteria for an addiction um just little footnote there people can actually have physical withdrawal from behavioral addictions like gambling where they have headache nausea vomiting insomnia but for for gambling disorder um theoretically you know you could have somebody who was gambling a lot and had you know no control issues meaning that could set a certain amount that they were going to spend and they and even if that was a very large amount they adhered to that amount um when they decided to cut back or abstained for a period of time they were able to do that um they could have no craving no reported Cravings although again we're not the best judges often of ourselves when it comes to this disease process they could have as you highlight no consequences because they're making money although generally you know with pathological gambling that almost never works out that way the house wins um so then you have to get into the more subtle factors of compulsive use so what does it mean compulsive use it means a lot of mental real estate occupied with thinking about using getting the drug maybe covering up drug use because other people don't approve um finding that other things are less Salient so a kind of narrowing of our focus on that particular activity a loss of joy and other things that we used to find pleasurable um so this kind of and a level of automatic it right like I I'm just sort of immersed in this and then I think a kind of a qualitative judgment about the attachment which is to say feeling like if I don't have this activity as an outlet I can't function right even on just a mental level even if objectively you know everything looks great on paper in terms of my life like I'm so deeply immersed in this kind of addiction

[00:24:27] Vortex that I'm thinking about it all the time I'm organizing my life around it I don't feel like there are other things that I can do or take joy and when I try to decathect or de you know attach remove some attachment I I get anxious I get irritable I can't sleep um and again you know these are the interesting thing for me about treating addiction is that it is a biopsychosocial disease right there's a biological component psychological and a deeply embedded social and cultural component such that for example workaholism is really celebrated in our culture and we have many many Workaholics and you and I might even be in that category and yet there are so many social rewards monetary uh you know social validation um you know you name it um that that this compulsive engagement in the work that we do um we may not ever identify as problematic unless we begin to look at more subtle manifest dations or harms like opportunity costs like because I'm spending all this time working I really don't know my children right or because I'm spending all this this time working I'm not cultivating friendships or not investing in um you know my my partner or in my health or or whatever it may be well that's a big part of what I wanted to to chat about was was actually this idea of why different individuals uh become addicted to very different stimulus even if the final common pathway is comparable right so even if um you could put all of us into whatever it is we use fmri or whatever type of scan that we might use to to pick up on um the areas of the brain that that undergo excitation uh why is it that for one individual alcohol becomes the thing uh whereas for another person it becomes an opioid and and by the way are there clusters where for certain people chemicals really are the problem whether it be you know opioids alcohol cocaine and yet for others it's more behaviors and and I'll share with you um just as an example of why this is a question that is on my mind so often so

[00:26:38] I've shared this story publicly before but um when I was actually in medical school I suffered a really really uh debilitating back injury and um uh to make a very long story short uh through through some some some errors in the part of the medical system uh I ended up on a a really really high at the time very high doses of of of Oxycodone and oxycontin and um predictably went through the escalation of those doses until at one point I was up to a a 300 milligrams a day of Oxycontin so um I'm sure you can put that in the context of of the patients that you see uh and I'm sure you've seen patients higher but that's a that's a pretty staggering dose that's a dose that if you or I split it right now we would be dead um so so just for context to people so so after several oh I don't know probably six months of being on such a you know again enough oxy to kill a horse um I just decided I wanted off um and it was it was a very strange wakeup moment where I realized I wasn't even taking it because

[00:27:51] I was in pain anymore I was taking it because I wanted to escape how depressed I was that I was deil ated so I just decided to stop cold turkey and I at the time was dating an anesthesiology resident and she was like you are effing crazy you're going to die we need to put you on n tripoline and 10 other drugs to taper you off and I said no I'm doing this cold turkey which I did and I proceeded to spend the next two weeks in hell um but this is the point of the story it's not it's nothing that I said so far the point of the story is I'm no more inclined to struggle with an opioid than any other person for reasons I don't understand in other words after that experience I was quite afraid of opioids and I assumed I was addicted but maybe 10 years later when I had a really bad tooth condition and nothing was touching the pain I finally succumbed and took Percocet and then after after two days when the tooth was addressed I stopped taking the peret and there was no issue and I came to conclude I I I concluded from that experience that this was not a willpower thing that allowed me to quit this was just a a luck thing there's something physiologically about me that was not becoming addicted to that substance um and that's why I was able to stop cold turkey in other words there I wasn't morally superior to the opioid add I was lucky um and my question is why what explains this difference because there are clearly areas like work where I'm not so lucky um and and and where the addiction is indeed real and where the struggle is daily okay so a lot there to unpack um why don't we just start with your interpretation of your experience which is yes I got phys physiologically dependent on opioids in medical school but ultimately I'm not a person who's going to be addicted to opioids um well

[00:30:05] I thought I was but it didn't appear to be the case based on subsequent use patters yes yes right you ultimately decided you ultimately decided oh I I'm actually this is not an inevitable problem for me and but I recognize that especially given what you went through that it could be an inevitable problem for some somebody else right yeah okay so let's start with risk factors for addiction um so risk factors for addiction can broadly be um placed into three separate buckets which I call nature nurture and neighborhood the inherited or inborn risk for addiction based on family and twin studies is about 50 to 60% so this is for example based on studies showing that if you have a biological parent or grandparent addicted to alcohol you were at increased risk of getting addicted to alcohol than the general population even if raised outside of that Al alcohol using home right so these are really nicely carefully done studies so so high heritability is determined by twin concordance basically yeah and family studies right looking back in family trees looking at um kids who were adopted into non-alcohol using homes who developed alcohol use disorder at higher rates because they had a biological parent or grandparent so that those are those studies um and for a long time you know people have talked about the quote unquote addictive personality oh I'm I have an addictive personality whatever I do I take it to the extreme I'm going to get addicted um you know that's a kind of colloquial use but it gets to the heart of this idea that yes people come into the world with different vulnerability to this tendency to take to the extreme the pursuit of certain types of Highly reinforcing substance and behaviors once discovered in the environment okay um it's also probably true that we each have different what what what are called drugs of choice so even with people who are you know poly substance users which by the way is more more common than not today people use a lot of different substances and behaviors they'll still tell you but you know my my preference is opioids or the thing I really want to do is smoke a cigarette or alcohol is my go-to um and interestingly there's very little science on the concept of drug of choice because I I looked pretty hard for that and I couldn't find very much um but it is a really important one because what it means is that here we have the phenomenon of access intersecting with drug of choice to increase the risk for certain individuals let me explain what

[00:32:54] I mean one of the so we've got the Nate let me back up so we've got the nature right in the inherited Risk by the way that probably goes along with co-occurring mental health disorders people with mental health disorders are at increased risk of developing addictive disorders and addiction is probably a complex polygenic phenomenon then we have risk factors based on nurture so this is the way that we are raised early childhood development parents that model maladaptive addictive behaviors or that explicitly or implicitly condone substance use or other addicted behaviors those kids are more likely to develop Addiction in adulthood especially if there's trauma if there's uh negative attachment um whereas kids who are raised in in a home where patients are modeling healthy adaptive coping strategies where they have a good attachment to their kids where there's not sexual physical or emotional abuse those kids are um protected right or relatively protected nobody's completely protected you can have the perfect childhood and still end up addicted and then we have what call

[00:33:58] Neighborhood risk factors and these get to the key of access so one of the biggest risk factors for addiction is simple access to that drug if you live in a neighborhood where drugs are stol in the street corner you're more likely to try them and more likely to get addicted if you go and get Medical Care at a place where people liberally prescribe opioids benidipine stimulants your brain will be exposed to those drugs will change in response to those drugs and you are at increased risk of getting addicted to those drugs um now in your casee the risk of access um was ultimately what got you initially hooked but probably other innate protective factors that you have allowed you to not end up um with a serious addiction probably in terms of genetic protective elements maybe had having to do with the way that you were raised I don't know you so it's hard for me to judge but essentially you know that's kind of how how we think about it but what's interesting and I guess this is the part that's most Mo most curious to me is I am I mean if I'm being brutally honest and take an honest stock of my life there are clearly things where I behave in very addictive ways today so uh and and let's just acknowledge that the neighborhood for those things is high right like I mean online shopping like my wife describes me as an es shopaholic and she can tell my stress level by the number of Amazon packages that come to the door so when I'm under low stress we'll go a week without a package when I'm under high stress three packages a day to be clear it's not breaking the bank I'm buying stupid irrelevant trinkets but it's this dumb little Escape I have where oh my God I I need a keychain I wonder what kind of key chains they have on Amazon oh look I gotta you know so it's and I I fully acknowledge that there are real that that is a true addiction now I'm fortunate in that the consequences of that addiction are minimal but I'm but

[00:36:11] I'm but I but I'd like to believe I'm at least wise to the fact that um that there's a that there's just a a general good luck that is permitting Amazon to be my Pusher as opposed to to someone selling illicit drugs and and I wonder why that that's the thing I wonder why because this to me speaks to like we're all addicts potentially right why are some people unlucky in that the addiction is it turns out to either kill them or destroy the quality of their life and their relationships right so let me let me answer that in in a couple of different ways first of all thank you for sharing the online shopping addiction as you know in my book dop me Nation I talk about how I got addicted to romance novels now granted it was a minor addiction and I was able to once I recognized it um you know change those behaviors without having to get professional help um which again brings us back to this concept of drug of choice and how it intersects with access because what's so challenging about the world today is that not not only do we have more access to more potent forms of traditional drugs including alcohol but all the other drugs that have been around for Millennia but we also have brand new drugs that didn't exist before all of the online digital media online shopping pornography the drug ification of the romance novel etc etc you you described this Anna Sor to interrupt in a way that I loved so much I wrote it down we are cacti living in a rainforest

[00:37:55] I mean it's just such a beautiful way to describe the bizarre existence of the human in this in this condition relative to 10,000 years ago and and and for Millennia yes and I'd love to take credit for that metaphor but I can't that's Dr finnean from John's Hopkins who I but it's it's a fantastic metaphor that's right we weren't we weren't evolved for the world that we live in now so again just to go back to um my own example I thought that I had an inherited this so-called addiction Gene because alcohol was never reinforcing for me caffeine doesn't wake me up these are the legal and easily accessible drugs that people who do find those drugs reinforcing are going to be vulnerable to because they're legal and accessible why do nicotine and alcohol kill more people every year than any other drug because they're legal and they're accessible so I think that's a really important first thing to to say now that we have drugs like online shopping and romance novels people like you and me who maybe thought well I didn't inherit this addiction Gene maybe it's not true at all maybe we just hadn't yet met our drug of choice and now that we have new drugs proliferating we are discovering we are just as vulnerable as the next person given the the key that fits into our neurobiological lock um I am going to get to the heart of your question a second but I just want to make one more point before I do when I think about this from an evolutionary perspective it makes a lot of sense that mother nature would want there to be inter individual variability in terms of drug of choice right so if we're living together in a tribe in a world of scarcity and everpresent danger which is the world that humans have existed in for most of the time that we've been around it's very good if we're not all going for the same exact berry bush right it's very good if you like the red berries and I like the blueberries and somebody else wants to hunt meat and somebody else wants to look for people um that way we as a tribe can be pretty well guaranteed that um you know together we're going to be able to get all of the scarce resources that we need to survive so I think when you think about it from an evolutionary perspective that's important but I really think the heart of your question is not so much why is it that that some people get addicted and others don't because we've just explored the fact that really we're all vulnerable especially in the modern ecosystem but why is it that some people can self-correct that as we progress on this road of compulsive overc consumption why is it that some people can see it and make an adjustment which by the way I just want to make sure that I I know you know this but I want to make sure the listener understands when I tell that story about me with the opioids I'm not claiming to have self-corrected I'm simply saying it was not the lock and key for me so it was actually quite easy to stop and the only suffering I went through was the physiologic withdrawal which is dramatic but it's a chemical reaction that after a few weeks was gone and now I mean even as I sit here now we have a bottle of Percocet in our in our it's in my bathroom it's 10t from me and it's been there for 10 years and I've never looked at it and it wouldn't occur to me to but if I was in significant pain I would go and take two of them and not think twice about it and it would be fine so so just to be clear I didn't it wasn't through any self-discipline that I stopped taking it that was quite easy Once I just decided and made the observation that I shouldn't be taking it if I was truly one of willpower I would never step foot on Amazon again or if I did it would only be for something that I needed so in that sense I am a junkie um and I don't seem to possess the tools or at least innately to to stop it okay so good clarification you really don't think that you have a vulnerability to opio addiction but you really do think you're addicted to online shopping is that fair that's fair okay so um yeah and but I think you're too hopeless about your online shopping

[00:42:12] I think that that is an addiction that if you decided you wanted to you could work on um and and make progress in that regard um but you know you would have to clearly there are not Financial consequences for you to to buy keychains now in my book I do talk about a patient of mine who did get addicted to online shopping on Amazon to the point where his house was full of partially open boxes he was in credit card debt you know approaching Financial ruin um he didn't even get pleasure from the things he ordered anymore it was just the anticipation and then it would come and as soon as he opened the box he would have an immediate come down which by the way I I can relate to that I can really really relate to that and and and it's with great empathy that I read that story because I can imagine how painful that is as the size of the purchases goes up and up and again for whatever reason and I attribute it solely to luck and good fortune um maybe it's just a tolerance thing I you know I haven't had to get to the point of that patient but that would be awful if you know if you're spending all of that energy on something and you open the package and you're like yeah great okay what's next yeah and I think it's great for people to hear that you have some degree of incontinence around this behavior um you know Aristotle talked about what what he called wide-eyed incontinence why is why is it that I do what I do not want to do because really that's at the heart of addictive behaviors and I I'm I'm guessing that people look to you as a sort of paragon of self-discipline so it's uh very nice I think for people to recognize that even you have Arenas in which you you know you are in continent in this regard which by the way is really hard to admit um in our culture because we're all supposed to be you know have it together and have all this kind of self-control but really um almost all of us now have some some space in our lives where we're over consuming either a substance or behavior um even if it's only modly problematic that that we'd like to change um and I guess since I have seen people with very severe and life-threatening addictions be able to get into recovery and maintain recovery for decades um I think that we can all look to those individuals as um guides for the rest of us and and not sort of um be overly fatalistic about our own capacity to change these behaviors I think we can change these behaviors and I would also o suggest that um to do so is not just important for our own mental health but it's also important for the planet so our consumptive behaviors really do you know affect everything around us some of the stories in your in your book dopamine Nation uh as as I'm reading them I'm thinking to myself well if she included this person there must be a happy ending but but as I'm reading it

[00:45:21] I'm thinking there's no way this person is getting out of this alive I mean like some of the addictions that you some of the the clinical stories that you write about and I assume outside of changing names and maybe genders in a few places these are probably very accurate accounts of the of the of the individuals you worked with um I mean I really had had a lot of empathy for these people um again maybe maybe because anybody reading it who themselves has an addiction even a quote unquote benign one realizes that that that's devastating but but there are a couple that that you know I think are are are interesting and and worth talking about so so let's talk about the young woman who um whose parents sort of talk her into coming to see you because she's basically smoking pot Around the Clock uh or not even smoking it I mean she's consuming it in every form that THC is imaginable right um and of course by her own Reckoning this is purely um a logical coping tool for her anxiety this is there's nothing pathologic about it she's not suffering any ill consequences of it maybe tell her story and and and and and kind of a little bit of the work you you did with her and and the reason I want to use that as one of the examples is you talked about neighborhood a second ago and it's a very controversial topic right now which is for example the legalization of marijuana um and and truly it's something I find myself divided on right because on the one hand I think the criminalization um of marijuana has led to a lot of

[00:46:59] Destruction in people's lives um but at the same time it's hard to avoid the um the the the knowledge that you've you've shared which is look the more available and ubiquitous a substance is the more likely it is to be abused case in point alcohol and tobacco um and um so so so I'd like to kind of explore that a bit with you and also explore this idea of marijuana as a gateway drug that the so-called gateway drug to to to drugs that maybe people would argue are quite harmful even if they believe that THC consumed in any amount is not so so maybe we'll start with the story of that young woman and and kind of explore that a bit more yeah so this young woman first of all all of the patients uh that

[00:47:47] I talk about in the book are patients who were very longtime patients of mine who I knew very well well and who I asked for their permission to share their stories using a pseudonym uh so this this was a young woman uh very typical for the types of patients that we will see now who came in not looking for help with her cannabis use but looking for help with her anxiety and her depression and you know 20 years ago the first thing I would have done for a patient like this was prescribe an anti-depressant or an angiolytic maybe even some Xanax or some clopin uh and referred her for psychotherapy my practice has changed um very much in the last two decades because of what I've learned from patients in recovery and the ways in which um repeated use of

[00:48:37] Highly reinforcing substances and behaviors actually changes our honic or Joy Seto point and creates exacerbates and drives depression and anxiety such that now the first intervention that I'll do with a patient like this is to actually ask them to abstain from their drug of choice for four weeks as a way to reset those reward Pathways uh to see whether or not that alone will address the anxiety and depression and in the majority of my patients if they are willing and able to do that they feel so much better after that uh you know abstinence trial or dopamine fast that there's not even an indication after that uh to to prescribe an anti-depressant or an angiolytic or necessarily do

[00:49:24] Psychotherapy I'm I'm happy to talk talk about sort of how that honic set point gets changed from the perspective of Neuroscience if that would be helpful yeah I think that would be great okay so to me one of the most interesting findings in Neuroscience in the past 75 years is that pain and pleasure are collocated in the brain and work like opposite sides of a balance so if you imagine that deep in these lyic structures in nucleus accumbens the area that's rich in docine releasing neurons there's something like a teeter totter um a central beam on a full Chrome that in a very simplified way represents how we process Pleasure and Pain when we experience pleasure it tips One Way pain it tips the other there are certain rules governing this balance and the first and most important rule is that the balance wants to remain level um and that level balance is what neuroscientists call homeostasis such that with any deviation from that level position which is the definition of biological stress our brains will work very hard to restore level balance so for example um my patient uses cannabis through the endogenous opioid system that ultimately leads to the release of dopamine and the reward pathway her pleasure pain balance tilts to the side of pleasure and then her brain says oh that was good let's do that again but remember uh the balance wants to return to the level of position so it does that by adapting to that increased dopamine by downregulating dopamine transmission and production not just at Baseline levels but below Baseline levels I like to imagine that as these neuro adaptation Gremlins hopping on the pain side of the balance to bring it level again but the Gremlins like it on the balance so they stay on uh until the balance is tilted in equal and opposite amount to the side of pain That's The

[00:51:10] Hangover the come down the blue Munday or just that state of craving now if after that initial use my patient doesn't smoke again those neuro adaptation Gremlins get the message that their work is complete they hop off the balance and homeostasis is restored craving goes away and she goes on with her day but if she continues to use that substance in her case cannabis repeatedly over time ultimately what happens is those Gremlins on the pain side of the balance start to accumulate they get bigger they get stronger now they're camped out there and now essentially we're we're entering addicted brain now when she uses cannabis that initial deviation to the side of pleasure is weaker and shorter in duration but that after response to pain gets stronger and longer and ultimately she ends up in a kind of chronic dopamine deficit State below her natural dopamine basine where she is experiencing the universal symptoms of withdrawal from any addictive substance which are again anxiety irritability insomnia dysphoria and craving when she uses cannabis that temporarily counteracts those Gremlins on the pain side of the balance and she feels better so she thinks to herself I'm self-medicated my anxiety with my medical marijuana but in truth all she's really doing is just adding more

[00:52:33] Gremlins to the pain side of the balance so the intervention is to have her abstain from her cannabis long enough so that those neuro adaptation Gremlins get the message they need to hop off the pain side of balce so that uh you know healthy levels of dopamine firing can can be restored this is obviously a vast oversimplification of a very complex process but it gets to the heart of ostasis a level balance and allostasis which is our brain's attempt to adapt to these highly reinforcing stimuli for which it was not evolved right I mean the definition of an intoxicant is that it releases a lot of dopamine all at once in the brains reward pathway our brains were evolved for us to have to work very hard to find a tiny little you know jolt of dopamine and then essentially do that again and again to to stay alive so you know the intervention for her is to ask her uh to abstain and to let her know that she's going to feel worse before she feels better more depressed more anxious um maybe she'll have other signs of physiological withdrawal which indeed her case in her case she did she had vomiting which really shocked her because she thought that was a sign for her a physical sign that she had become dependent on or addicted to the Cannabis but as I say to patients if you can just get through about the first 10 to 14 days of feeling worse after you give up your drug of choice by the time you make it to about week three or four you will feel better less craving less anxious less depressed better able to sleep and that's so often a revelation for people because they have become convinced that their drug of choice is quote unquote self-medicating their depression or whatever it is so so that that that that was the intervention with her that that's our general early intervention that we do just a couple questions there before we go on um which drugs or chemicals I suppose can you not safely just do that with so for example in the case of cannabis um the the pain that she experienced was not life-threatening and therefore she didn't need anything to cope with withdrawal we've already discussed how that would not be the case with ethanol so if somebody came into your office um and they're having six drinks a day and they acknowledge you know go through the steps to acknowledge hey this is problematic and they agree to want to stop you wouldn't be able to just say hey leave your office uh don't drink and I'll see you in four weeks there's a very good chance they would be dead due to the cardiovascular side effects so there you would have to put them on other drugs um what are the other dependencies for which you wouldn't just have the liberty of stopping cold turkey okay so let let me just say that that's a very good point to qualify um this intervention but it it's not necessarily true that for somebody with an alcohol addiction you couldn't do this intervention it would depend on how severely physiologically dependent they were and whether or not they were at risk for life-threatening withdrawal or delirium tremens or seizures most people who are addicted to alcohol um actually won't have life-threatening withdraw and could do this how do you determine that by the way cuz I I don't I I you know we used to be very blunt about this in residency like because I was a surgical resident when we operated on people who appeared to drink a lot based on our intake assessment which is subjective uh we would just usually run an ethanol drip in them for safety but I there was no I don't think there was any real uh you know insight into whether that was really necessary or not so how would you evaluate that with a patient the biggest predictor of how someone is going to withdraw from alcohol is past withdrawal so we will ask them when was the last time you stopped drinking for how long and what was your symptomatology uh it's not you know fail safe and of course as people age they lose neuroplasticity uh their risk of having some kind of more difficult or even potentially life-threatening withdrawal increases it also increases over the drinking career especially as their liver is p is compromised or pancreas is compromised but really you know you look at past withdrawal how long ago was that and and and it is really interesting and we don't understand why this is that some people who drink enormous quantities for decades can stop and have minimal withdrawal and other people who have had much shorter drinking careers um will go into delirium tremens or have life-threatening seizures so we're not at all Cavalier about it and for any patient that we remotely suspect might have um a serious with withdrawal we would recommend uh medical monitoring um probably or possibly inpatient monitoring so we take it very seriously um and we don't just recommend this early intervention for for somebody who was at risk but I can tell you most people who who um are addicted to alcohol will not have life lifethreatening withdrawal from alcohol the other major category is basically our benzo disip Pines which is alcohol and pill form they work on the same or similar Gaba receptors and so people can have life-threatening withdrawal from benzo isipin which is why for many individuals we will um recommend a medically monitored slow taper or a more rapid

[00:58:09] Inpatient Detox we used to think that opioid withdrawal although extremely painful was not life-threatening but in the last 20 years as we've been helping people decrease the very large doses of prescription opioids they've been given uh by their doctors we have have noticed that especially in older people and people with serious medical comorbidities cardiac comorbidities for example the stress is just too much um and that those individuals again need to be slowly uh tapered down but the general ones that we worry about and have to screen for is alcohol bidas aines and and now um concern for opioids

[00:58:49] I would say the other category of individual in which we would not recommend this dopamine fast or absence trial um is individual who have repeatedly tried to stop on their own and been unable to that would just be a lesson and frustration those are individuals that we would recommend to a higher level of care like a day treatment program or a residential treatment program also especially with opioid use disorder opioid addiction we are finding that some people even with long periods of abstinence um never get out of that state of craving and really can't move on with their lives which is why we will prescribe opioids uh to treat opioid Addiction in some cases and for example medications like buprenorphine or methodone maintenance are evidence-based interventions for opioid addiction seems counterintuitive to give a patient with an opioid addiction an opioid but they're very unique opioids they have a long halflife which means it gets people out of this repeated cycle of intoxication withdrawal drug seeking Etc um it gets them out of that state of craving and if you think back to this pleasure pain balance we're not getting folks with opioid use disorder high but giving them opioids we're just allowing them to level uh their pleasure pain balance go back to Baseline homeostasis which then frees up their energy and creativity to um engage in other aspects of their recovery if someone's listening to us now Anna and you know by the end of this podcast they've become convinced that maybe they're drinking too much and they'd like to try this dopamine fast um do you recommend that they speak with their doctor before doing it is this something that a person can safely try if they're aware of what side effects might prompt medical attention we certainly don't want to discourage people from reducing their alcohol intake if that is indeed problematic but at the same time we want to be responsible on how we do that so what what advice would you have for somebody listening who's saying hey you know what these these three or four drinks I'm having every single day I could I'd be better off without yeah so I mean um if if if I think if the individual has any concern about serious medically dangerous withdrawal um from alcohol or from benzo disip Pines or from opioids uh they they should consult the medical specialist but the majority of people who use these substances have taken periods on the order of days or maybe even weeks when they have stopped so they have a pretty good sense of number one whether they can do it and number two what kind of reaction their body will have um so I do think that this is an experiment that most people can try um without medical supervision especially if they're in a position to either not be able to afford it or have access to somebody who's trained in addiction medicine we have far fewer addiction medicine providers in this country than we have uh you know the need uh to address the problem so I think as an early intervention it can be a a nice experiment even just to see if they can do it you know sometimes we think we have some degree of control and then it turns out we don't have uh you know we don't have what the degree of control that we we thought we had um it's also just you know a very interesting experiment for those who are not addictive to get a sense of deep understanding and empathy for the problem of addiction because even just giving up something like online shopping or romance novels or video games or what have you um and to observe ourselves going through withdrawal can be enlightened um and you know as you experience with the the opioid withdrawal um in that medical setting kind of give you a great deal of sort of empathy and and healthy respect for the phenomenon of addiction yeah going back to that uh the point about neighborhood again is really really clear uh which is uh it's very difficult to kick a habit if you go right back into the environment in which that habit was was rif so in the case of this patient patient for example um she comes back after 4 weeks um it's been a transformative experience in that she's she's gone through very painful withdrawal um you you prepared her for it by telling her it was going to hurt a lot and that she needed to sit in the pain effectively um and when she comes back the anxiety is gone um so one how do you now help her with this next phase of recovery and you know how difficult a set of choices does that person need to make if indeed their Social Circle basically fed into that addiction I mean to me as hard as that four-week abstinence program is it might be what follows that's actually harder yeah you're absolutely right so if the patient is able to abstain for four weeks they come back we ask them how how it went um and we kind of make a pros and cons list what was good about not using what was what was bad about not using in those four weeks um we typically when the patient feels better and again about 80% of folks feel feel better 20% don't and that's also really useful information because it tells us that something else is driving this and then we explore that um for for this case you know the feeling better we on the pros side people will talk about I was more productive I had more time I was able to be more present I felt physically better I was less anxious less depressed slept better etc etc so there's really a nice long list of things that they gained from stopping using and what I think is so powerful about this intervention is that the person has their own experience I'm no longer in the role of having to persuade them that not using or using less will make them feel better they have experienced it for themselves on the cons list like what was bad about not using you already anticipated the pretty much the top one which is I couldn't hang out with my friends cuz all my friends use um and I really like my friends and I want to go back to hanging out with them so that that poses a serious dilemma the other major con that people endorse is just simple boredom all of a sudden people are left with lots of time and wondering uh what to do with it but I like to talk a lot with patients about boredom being kind of the

[01:05:22] Midwife of of creativity um and then then we essentially uh talk about next steps and the first time around most patients want to go back to using their drug of choice but they want to use differently they want to use in moderation so I support them in that goal even if I'm thinking to myself this is a really bad idea I don't think they're going to be successful why do I support them in that goal because again this is experiential learning I can talk to the cows come home until they experience it for themselves it's not really going to take but also I've discovered that I'm a very bad predictor of who's going to be successful and who isn't I've had patients who definitely meet criteria for alcohol use disorder serious alcohol addictions who have been able to go back to using alcohol in moderation uh after an extended period of absence so what what fraction do you think uh fits that description um where and again we'll talk about it through the lens of chemicals maybe and as opposed to just behaviors but um is is that is that a minority of people who are able absolutely it's a small minority it's a small minority it's it's it's definitely less than 10% may maybe maybe even hovering closer to 1% so these people are clearly anomalies but just out of the you know the

[01:06:42] Curiosity of exploring the end user what is it about an individual that allows them on the one hand to have met complete criteria for a true addiction whether it be to alcohol or another substance to go through a period of detoxification and emerge from that and say you know what it's true I used to drink six drinks a day and I would blackout drink and binge drink and it was ruining my life DUIs all day long like all of the above but now I'm going to become a social Drinker I'm going to have a glass of wine with dinner every night that's it and and if there's the one in a hundred who can do it how are they doing that they're doing it with a lot of hard work so it it doesn't come just like that it's not like you abstain for a while you reset your reward Pathways you're good to go in fact quite the contrary um once we've created those kinds of addiction circuits even though we can get them to quiet down they're very easily reignited not just by exposure to our drug of choice itself but to reminders of the drug of choice so what

[01:07:51] I talk a lot with patients about is the specificity of the plan for how they will consume the more specific the better and this is all in the spirit of self-binding strategies self-binding strategies are very very important in a world where we're constantly being titilated and invited to consume and told that that's the good life uh what do I mean by self-binding strategies those are both literal and metacognitive barriers that we put between ourselves and our drug of choice so that we can press the pause button between desire and consumption so for a patient with you know a drinking problem that might look like not having uh any alcohol in the house right a very simple and obvious self-binding strategy that might look like um pledging to never drink alone but only with friends on special occasions making sure that I don't now fill my schedule up with many different special occasions which happens right uh that can look like making sure that I um am very cognizant of how much I'm drinking and keep it to no more than two standard drinks on any given drinking occasion and track it carefully and write it down so that I don't get into that state of sort of blurry denial where I can tell myself it was only one drink when it was really five um that might even look like taking medications so we have medications like nxone which is an opioid receptor blocker alcohol Works in part through our endogenous opioid system and by blocking the opioid receptor we essentially make alcohol less reinforcing so people who will take n TRX on will say when I'm taking now

[01:09:29] TRX on at least the ones for whom whom it works I can look at a six-pack of beer and I just want to drink two I don't want to drink the whole six-pack and that's really a revelation uh for these people because before you know just like I really want to drink the whole six-pack so you know self-binding strategies can be again at the like literal uh physical barrier level it can be at the chemical barrier level it can be at a kind of interpersonal accountability level it can be at a spiritual level um so um wanting to live in accordance with one's values or a greater good and seeing their use as or their excessive use as um um contrary to living according to those values so really getting at it from all different angles and people with the most severe addictions ultimately really need to kind of get a totally different orientation on their lives um in the sense that they they really need to inculcate um a philosophy about life that you know allows them to maintain their recovery um and and by that I mean like living recovery principles in all aspects of their lives so that's things like um telling the truth in all situations a lot of people in recovery have taught me that if they start to lie even about little things like why they were late for a meeting that is a potential for them to tip over and relapse so it's it's a very interesting um it's like a recovery mindset slash lifestyle slash philosophy it has to become bigger than just the substance itself yeah yeah it's um one of the things that strikes me is noteworthy as you describ the effort that would have to go into uh dipping your toe back in the water is at least maybe can the patient consider the cost of that right in terms of look if you if you really want to go back to having a couple of drinks here and there then the systems you have to put in place to do that as opposed to the systems you might have to put in place to just adhere to complete abstinence might not you know think of the opportunity cost of doing that that that's a lot of energy that could go into living a fuller life in other ways is it really worth having a couple of drinks a week or whatever it is that you've agreed to um do you do you sort of ever have that discussion or do you think that that's just up to them to figure out oh no no so that's a very common discussion you're so basically the the typical outcomes that we see after the dopamine fast or the absence trial is first the absence violation effect where people say I'm going to go back to using in moderation and immediately they're plunged into a binge episode even worse than what was there before and then you know then there's the discussion of gee maybe moderation is really not possible or people who are able to achieve moderation but who ultimately decide it's so effortful and so much work that it's essentially not worth it there's this famous uh you know

[01:12:47] AA lingo uh one drink is too many and two is Never Enough which kind of captures that very well uh this idea that you know stopping it too doesn't actually get me what I'm looking for but but does in fact kind of uh reignite those addiction circuits such that it's very difficult to stop it too when I want to keep drinking and those people will you know often ultimately decide that abstinence is uh not only better for them but also easier so let's talk a little bit about some of these behavioral addictions as well you I think of all the stories in your book the one that I I'm not sure what it is about the character but it he certainly invites enormous sympathy as I think his name is Jacob yeah um and look everybody's heard of sex addiction and sort of has a has an understanding of what it is but but it's not necessarily what what you describe in Jacob right his sex addiction is not the the one that you would think of when you're watching a TV show that features someone who's a sex addict um so maybe tell briefly the story about Jacob and and describe the the pathology there and and what what is what is the addiction giving him that maybe a gambling addiction wouldn't give a gambler or an alcohol uh an alcohol addiction doesn't give the alcoholic again what was the pleasure he was seeking um relative to to maybe what

[01:14:19] I would normally think of as a sex addict is is seeking many partners for example ah interesting saying okay so there are I mean many different ways that um sex addiction can manifest sometimes when people get addicted to sex they they compulsively seek out Partners but many people addicted to sex now are addicted to pornography and compulsive masturbation um it's very hard to get numbers on any of this but I would say the majority of cases that we see are are not in fact people who are having sex with other people they're they're people who are spending enormous amounts of time um looking at pornography masturbating and of course that's so easy to do now given the

[01:15:02] Advent of the internet and online pornography um in the case of my patient Jacob you know he started out with pornography and compulsive masturbation but he is an engineer and ultimately um made you know built a masturbation machine that escalated over time uh as his addiction progressed as itions will progress uh such that he was ultimately hooking himself up to the Internet letting strangers in chat rooms manipulate this machine you know in a way that was really very dangerous and potentially life-threatening which he was fully aware of and yet struggled to stop the behavior ultimately you know when the behavior was discovered by his wife she left him um you know and he considered ending his life so when when people say oh you can't really get addicted to sex way you can uh with drugs and alcohol I would just invite them to be a fly on the wall in the work that we do we are seeing more and more um men of all ilk coming in with really devastating um what we what we broadly classify as as sex addictions this is compulsive masturbation or the pursuit of orgasm in in many different ways what and and and you you mentioned this as as primarily a male problem why do you think that is well I mean I think there's enough evidence to show that men in aggregate have a higher sex drive than women um you know any teenage boy um you know the joke about how much of a teenage boy's brain is occupied with thinking about sex it's a like 99% I mean you know I I

[01:16:49] I'm sort of loathed to kind of speculate too much about that um but um it's just it's just the truth I mean that's what we're seeing we're not seeing women coming in with um with sex addictions the way we are with as with men occasionally we'll see that but it's quite rare although there are data emerging showing that more and more women are consuming pornography so um you know what what's been interesting to see uh in the modern era the ways in which certain demographic groups groups that were previously relatively immune to certain types of addictions uh that's no longer the case so for example with alcohol use disorder you know gener for

[01:17:33] Generations the ratio of men to women with an alcohol addiction was 5 to1 30 years ago it was 2:1 today among Millennials it's one to one we are now seeing young women presenting with alcohol youth disorders pretty much as often as we see men so who knows you know with enough time it could well be that this is not necessarily um a biological phenomenon and really just a sociocultural one certainly in part it's probably social sociocultural are men in general more prone to addiction because obviously you've stated now that men are effectively make up all of the or most of the uh patients who suffer from various forms of sex addiction I'm just going to guess knowing nothing about it that the same is probably true with gambling um so so what are the addictions maybe stated the other way where women disproportionately make up the patients the only one that I have seen data for where women um outstrip men is for benzo aines so sedatives like

[01:18:35] Xanax phum clopin okay so if we take all addictions together men have a greater problem with addiction than women I would guess just based on the simple fact that in most cases men outstrip women so how the one the one the one sort of new wrinkle there is just social media addiction where we're seeing more women and girls okay so do you think that that fits more into nature nurture or neighborhood as the driver um it's probably both you know it's or or both we have three things so

[01:19:11] I guess it's a combination of all three things I think very interesting okay so um let's go back to maybe some of the things that some of the itches that are being scratched with these different addictions right so you talk about I think it's called Lost dysphoria is that what you referred to as um oh no no I'm sorry lost chasing oh yeah is that what the Gambler is looking for now that was a very that was that was I had never thought of that before can you explain what that is and is that does that phenomenon expand beyond the gambling addiction is there an analog to that in other forms of addiction yeah great question um so lost chasing is a is a is a phenomenon that's been observed in pathological gamblers where they will report that when they are deep in an episode of gambling they actually want to lose and the reason they want to lose is because the losing allows them to justify staying in the game longer which is I think very revealing because it shows that on some level a gambling addiction isn't really about being being addicted to money it's about being addicted to the pursuit of money or the game itself or the trans like state that people can get into when they're deep in their addictive behaviors which I would argue applies to every single addiction

[01:20:38] Under the Sun um so for example sex addiction is not really about sex it's about self- soothing it's about Escape it's about numbing it's about relieving tension um and I would say that that's true for for all addictive behaviors interestingly there's been some work using brain Imaging looking at dopamine levels in pathological gamblers brains compared to healthy control subjects who are gambling and what the researchers found is that when pathological gamblers are winning there there will be an increase in dopamine Transmission in the reward pathway and the same will be true for healthy control subjects but the difference comes when they're losing uh when healthy control subjects lose there's no increase in dopamine transmission but pathological gamblers will actually have an increase in dopamine transmission when they're winning which is when they're losing oh sorry y but pathological gamblers will have an increase in dopamine transmission when they're losing um which Maps very nicely on to this uh this subjective experience of of loss chasing and it looks like the um the do the dopamine you a pathological Gambler dopamine is released at the highest level when the chances of winning and losing are equal so it's that place of uncertainty in the gambling state that is uh on some level the most appealing state of for the pathological Gambler is there just from a a population prevalence standpoint you've already alluded to the fact that addictions to social media are probably really really

[01:22:22] On The Rise um for the obvious reason that there you know didn't exist 20 years ago um we we we certainly know from an availability I.E neighborhood access phenomenon that opioid addiction is clearly On The Rise um I would assume that marijuana is also on the rise for the same reason is that is that a fair assumption I haven't looked at the latest data so certainly um overall in the last 20 years Americans are using a lot more cannabis than they were previously and they're using more potent forms of cannabis and what we're seeing in particular is that there's a subset of individuals who use cannabis who are using very very large quantities so a generation ago 30 you know 20 30 years ago people who used cannabis uh were still mostly using it recreationally on the weekends with friends now what we're seeing is a very hardcore group of individuals who use cannabis every day all day dabbing highly potent forms vaping getting very you know high levels in their brain so these are the kinds of

[01:23:36] Trends in other words The increased access is going to harm a subset of the most vulnerable individuals who will be most likely to use it in very potent forms in very large amounts yeah which really raises kind of a challenging societal question right which is do you punish all of the people For Whom The increased access has potentially made life better both in terms of the actual use of the drug and and certainly the decriminalization of it which has has probably made many lives better um but it's clearly made some lives worse and um you know I'm glad I'm not the person responsible for making those decisions because those are very difficult decisions I I don't know how one makes a decision if you're trying to put the good of society uh uh at at the top of the priority list when when it's there there are you know these conflicting um outcomes what about other things like uh well I guess you've alluded to the fact that it sounds like sex addiction is also on the rise very hard to get numbers on sex addiction but

[01:24:46] I can tell you based on you know 25 years of clinical practice it's on the rise at least in terms of help seeking individuals and my sense um is that since the Advent of the internet especially the smartphone which makes you know online pornography and chat rooms Etc so easy to access dating apps I would put in the category of sex addiction um I think that we are dealing with an enormous problem in ever younger age groups and that our what we see is really just the tip of an ice of the iceberg of kind of a rampant um compulsive consumption of pornography among men and boys um I want to come right back to that but just to close the loop on this what about gambling uh benzos uh other uh cocaine things of that nature where where do we where is the trajectory and trend line on those things so with gambling um I assume online gambling is just another thing that's right so the the online sports betting you know as you know has now become legal in many different states and in the states where it has become legal we've seen a 300 to 500% increase um in calls to pathological gambling hotlines which is just one metric again these are difficult to get numbers on these but it does suggest that again the old Bugaboo of increased access leading to increased Harms in a subset of the populations raising as you point out very difficult policy questions do we as a society have a responsibility to protect those vulnerable individuals and how do we do that and do we do it at the expense of individuals who maybe can use uh those substances and behaviors recreationally without too much harm um so yeah online sports betting is on the rise and just the portability of these devices the ability to place a bet without a mediator anywhere anytime has really um created very difficult situation for individuals who are vulnerable to pathological gambling in terms of um cocaine um and meth me yeah benzos yeah we're seeing a Rise um in recent years in addictive use and and harmful use of cocaine and methamphetamine um and it's hard to know exactly um why that is or where it's coming from again accessibility it may be partially related to the decreased access in recent years to prescription opioids people switching the stimulants or finding that when they combine a stimulant with an opioid they can overcome tolerance and get more of a

[01:27:30] High um so you know it's it's it's these are all the trends overall if you look at like all drugs of abuse um what we're seeing is a gradual I'm not even gradual in some cases what almost appears an exponential rise in drug overdose deaths um and I would attribute that again to sort of ubiquitous access you can there's probably no corner of the world anymore that you can go to where you can't get drugs I mean this is a little bit depressing and know because I didn't hear you say that anything is going down in other words you can't even argue that the increase in some of these addictions is due to the substitution effect of some things are going down like well we're just there's so much less alcohol abuse today and that's why some of it is

[01:28:17] Shifting over to this I'm just hearing that on mass everything is in aggregate at least things are all it's just going up in other words if in 1980 the percentage of the population that had an addiction was X and today it's 3x I'm making that up but you get the point right is is that is that assessment shared by both the data and your clinical experience well the data show that for example cigarette use has gone down in the last 20 to 30 years and that you do get a kind of a wacka effect you know as prescription opioids became less available elicit fenol uh came in to replace it um so it's not that everything is going up we are seeing some Trends but on the other hand there cigarette use went down go up right yeah and I think you know the point I try to make in dopamine nation is that I do think that we are living in a drug aied world where we all have more access to highly reinforcing substances and behaviors and that even so-called healthy behaviors like exercise and playing chess and reading novels um have been made addictive through the Advent of the internet and and social media and all the you know the comparisons and and what have you we we've really we fine-tuned our understanding of how to PE get people hooked on just about anything which you could argue is a natural byproduct of a successful capitalist system right I mean in in the most successful capitalist system um we would all be addicts right addicts are the ultimate consumers um you know I'm not arguing for a system other than capitalism but I am suggesting that this is problematic and that we've reached some kind of tipping point where if we don't put some guard rails and measures in place to guard against this extreme version of consumption we are all of us liable to suffer the harms of addictive behaviors okay I want to go back to what you talked about with with respect to porn and young kids young boys in particular so anybody listening to this who has young boys is probably aware of and concerned about this so I always think Bill Maher does the best job talking about this he says look you know for for People of Our Generation uh pornography was like you know finding a raggedy old Playboy magazine in the woods and and and and there's no question that you were obsessed with looking at that but it didn't warp your sense sex right like it it it didn't pervert you to the point of potential pathology and yet um in today yeah any anything on your smartphone can basically do just that and and is there an argument to be made that the impact of that is differentially worse in a sort of prepubescent SL in puberty brain than it is in you know a mature you know an adult I mean is is there a difference in the impact what are the data on that and then ultimately what I'm really asking is what what can parents do to to educate their kids because I think it has to come down on some level to education right I mean if you think about this through the lens of alcohol um you know I what a parent says and does probably matters more in terms of modeling I would hope than just you know a Draconian rule set that says you know anyway so so so so tackle those questions in any order you see fit but but basically what what is a parent to do in this day and age to try to raise uh boys in particular uh to be you know sexually healthy people when they when they get older okay great so let me let me start at the beginning of your series of questions so so first of all um one of the things that's been very interesting to me in treating patients with sex addiction is to see how tolerance manifests many of these individuals start out with kind of runof-the-mill legal types of Engagement with pornography or what have you but over time as their brain adapts to those rewards they develop tolerance they need more potent forms to get the same effect and they find themselves a year 2 years 5 10 years later then engaging in highly deviant or violent or pedophilic pornography or engaging with um you know sex workers legal activities um and so I think that is that is important because when we're trying to distinguish like a paraphilia from a sex addiction I think um many psychiatrists are not recognizing that the way that that person presents at sort of their endstage sex addiction might really be 100% due to and if you can get them out of that addiction cycle their preference for this illegal activity uh you know really might not be there um in terms of the developing brain so we do believe that children and Adolescence are more vulnerable to these highly reinforcing stimuli and that the earlier that folks are exposed the more likely they are to develop an addictive process we base that on analogy with substances CU we know that the earlier that kids start using substances the more likely they are to develop a substance use disorder in their lives we speculate that that is because adolescents still are developing the connectivity between the frontal lobe and those deep uh you know lyic structures the emotion part of the brain um and that adolescence is characterized by a period of pruning where the brain essentially Cuts back on those neuronal circuits and dendrites and axons that are being used least often and melinates those circuits that are used most often myelination is what makes the conductivity faster and more efficient such that by the time we're about age 25 we've essentially created the neurological scaffolding that will serve us for our adult lives so that means if young people are engaging in maladaptive coping strategies and strengthening those circuits it's not impossible but it's harder to change uh you know once they re reach 25 or early adulthood so the key for parents to realize is that while they still have some modum of control over how their children and Adolescence are engaging with the internet I I recommend that they exercise that control to limit access as well as educating um and having open discussions about um the potential harm what what is the potential harm again these images are highly reinforcing you know we were wired to find mates and partner and that's what allows us to propagate the species which is how we've been able to survive but what pornography essentially does is it hijacks these reward Pathways with very potent images that are made all the more reinforcing by the fact that um the individual can control them in the moment so with very little work that is required in real relationship ship they can now just go right to the money so to speak or the reinforcing aspect plus orgasm is the release of a bunch of neurotransmitters all at once uh which feels you know really good for many people I want to highlight that not every uh you know boy or man is actually drawn to pornography or sex um so it's it's again we have this interindividual variability but for young for for boys and men for whom that is a potent reinforcer it is the medium itself of the internet the easy access the potency even dating apps you know the the the idea of dating apps is that we're going to be matched with a partner but what can happen is people get just addicted to the match right the confetti of the match and then they want to have the pursuit and the match again and it's not even necessarily leading to any kind of um intimacy beyond that or if it is it's just leading to hookups which are about the sex um so for parents out there you know really recommend that a child under 13 not have unsupervised access to the internet um if if if they must have some kind of phone device have it be a light phone or a flip phone and then once they get to the point where they do have data and access to the internet um have a lot of open discussions about pornography um and they can be really really awkward discussions I'm a mother to two um boys and both of you you know both of my sons we have um try to have open quite awkward discussions about pornography yeah yeah tell me about that because it's like it's been really easy to have discussions with our daughter about uh illicit drug use because it's a biochemistry discussion and the risk is really obvious in other words um you know I I had a guy by the name of Anthony hippolito on the podcast who's a local sheriff here in the Austin area whose work focus is entirely around fentanyl toxicity and Fentanyl laced drugs so there there are kids all over here that are dropping dead from laced ambian laced Xanax uh you know cocaine whatever the drug is that seems to be spiked with

[01:38:10] Fenty so so having the discussion with with our daughter about that is really quite easy right which is but but what what are your coaching points for and I'm asking this honestly for myself just as much as the listeners right my boys are pretty young you know seven and 10 um but you know that's going to be a discussion to have soon how are you making the case to a 13-year-old or 14-year-old that hey you know you're going to be over at your friend's house one day and you're going to be playing sports and all of a sudden you know he's going to say hey come and come and look at this because maybe in their household it's not going to be as policed as it is in our household what's the case you're making yeah so this is where I really encourage parents to try as much as possible to just be curious think of themselves actually one one uh kind of metaphor I heard once which I thought was really good is pretend like you're a journalist and you're just trying to get the story um and just ask them you know what what did you think about that you know uh it's very easy as a parent to get disregulated in even speaking about these things or imagining our child engaging with these images but it is the reality so we have to go there you know what what did you think about that um you know is that something that you have started using yourself um you know to you know masturbate or get and as an escape or release um you know how is that working for you how do you how do you feel afterward I think really zeroing in on how do you feel afterward can be very instructive because usually there's a pretty hard come down as well as a feeling of like wow that didn't actually do for me what

[01:40:01] I was hoping that it did and I kind of am feeling bad about that experience so again um you know and this gets into the whole Quagmire of sort of sexual Liberation and this argument nothing's wrong with pornography nothing's wrong with masturbation you know so people are going to come to this with different value systems and and I respect that yeah what what what did the data say I think it's we we can put our feelings aside for a moment I think the real question here is are there data to tell us that that one approach is healthier than the other and then obviously what are what are the clinical anecdotes that that probably are more valuable than just our our our built-in beliefs right right well I mean the the data that we have is that men and boys and actually women now too are spending a lot more time consuming pornog graphy and young people in particular are much less likely to go out and actually have sex with other people and be in relationship now whether or not those things are causitive or correlative you know we don't know um but we could certainly make an argument that all the time that men and boys are spending engaging in pornography is actually becoming a substitution for real life engagement either with their spouses or Partners or other people that they might meet and in clinical care what we see with behavioral addictions including sex addiction is that the phenomenology is identical to drug and alcohol addiction people start out for fun or to solve a problem if it works for them they repeat that behavior they go back again and again over time it tends to work less well they need more potent forms or larger quantities to get the same effect and then at some point in severe cases they're marshalling all of their available resources in order to do that activity or consume that drug so you know this is a very new problem we don't have a lot of good data people are not rushing forward saying I have a sex addiction let me tell you all about it in fact it's very common in clinical care that we'll have a man come in and say in the first one to two to three visits that he's here for some reason that's not really the reason that he brought him brought him in he's really here for a six sex addiction but so difficult for him to talk about that so you know this is like highly stigmatized because at the same time that we have this incredible access to pornography we also have a culture in a climate in which men and boys are really seen as sexual predators so um it's it's a very potentially uncertain and dangerous environment for them to be trying to cultivate in real life relationships right it's a it's a risky environment and so all of that I think is contributing to this kind of retreat from engagement and instead a kind of a self soothing through this medium so let's talk about sort of a very near cousin of that which you've already alluded to which is social media now this is in the in the me this is you know this is the Forefront of everybody's attention right now there's a uh a book out about this by by

[01:43:19] Jonathan hey um that talks a lot about this um and and you know I I had dinner with Jonathan several months ago before the book came out and it was it was wonderful to sit down with him and and sort of have this discussion about everything um and I and I posed a question to him that um you know and I don't I don't want to speak for him but

[01:43:40] I I think it's safe to say he didn't really have a great answer for um but I think it is the jugular question and it's interesting that since the book has come out uh there have been folks in the medical establishment that have um have come out and argued the opposite side of of his and so the question I posed to

[01:43:59] Jonathan was Jonathan it's very clear here that the correlation between social media and declining mental health amongst young people in particular is overwhelming um but I said how compelling are the data and what would need to be done to demonstrate causality because if if you have causality it becomes much easier to have a discussion about policy and action right so um once causality could be unambiguously established for tobacco use and cancer um which really occurred in the late 60s and by the way it was it didn't occur through rcts right it occurred through a very careful application of the Bradford Hill criteria um coupled with some mechanistic and and and animal research obviously no one could do the RC C to demonstrate the harm of tobacco and um with respect to to to cancer but nevertheless once causality was established the the the the die was cast for the monotonic decrease in tobacco consumption that has occurred over the last 50 years um and and when causality is missing it becomes very difficult to make the case for it so there there's there's I've read all these arguments that and again these are the minority arguments to be clear I think the majority of people believe that you know if they're even thinking of it that way they believe there is causality um but the minority argument is look there are a lot of reasons that young people are too anxious today um social media might be one of them but it's far from the only one these people would argue that we've catastrophized everything in the world right we've got every young person thinks that by 2030 uh the the climate is going to have eroded to the point where it the world will be uninhabitable um even though of course that's not true but nevertheless there there are enough people who who have catastrophized so many things in terms of um of of the future of this planet that that maybe that's that's part of the reason and um and anyway they just go on and on and on so so I guess my question for you as a person who I know thinks about this deeply is do you think we have causal evidence um that that will pin uh what seems intuitive to many of us right which is social media probably is a net negative it has some benefits but it's got a lot of negatives at at least for a vulnerable population um or or do we think that we just haven't got that causal bullet and that really there's you know we're looking at two things that have gone up over the same period of time that are correlated but but you know getting rid of social media is not going to fix the health of young people so so how do how do you sorry for the long question but but how do you think about that well I'll start at the end um I don't think anybody who thinks there's a causal harm from social media thinks that we should get rid of social media that that anyway is an impossibility I think what we're talking about is Sor sorry I I should just be clear there and and Jonathan doesn't think that either right I think

[01:47:18] Jonathan's argument is maybe maybe people should not be using social media while they're young um but but anyway yes so so I just wanted to make sure I wasn't putting words in anybody's mouth on that front yeah okay yeah great um yeah so I mean let's look at the different types of evidence one of the most important types of evidence in medicine is empirical evidence this is observation and subjective experience and we have plenty of empirical evidence to show that young people I'm going to focus on young people because you know when when you think about a policy intervention I really think we're thinking about how to direct that to young people um that young people endorse that they feel addicted to social media not not all but many and that they use it more than they would like and that it's adversely affecting their mental health that is a powerful piece of evidence now you could you could say there's you know could there's cultural stimulation or stimulated reporting sure but we have loads of young people now who are endorsing that we also have a lot of observational evidence that is showing many of the

[01:48:33] Bradford Hill criteria starting with a dose dependent response we know that the more people the more time that people spend on social media the more likely they are to experience anxiety depression insomnia in attention Etc um now you could argue well chicken in the maybe those were individuals who were vulnerable or already had depression anxiety which made them want to self-medicate by using more social media but I think the strongest evidence uh against that is the um the evidence that we have on another Bradford heral criteria which is experimentation when we intervene in these cases of depressed and anxious individuals and take social media away for a period of time or even limit use people are feeling less depressed and anxious and that is a very powerful piece of evidence to me but not even the only one other Bradford Hill criteria you have biological plausibility does it even make biological sense that engaging with social media could change the brain and in ways that are potentially harmful and and beneficial sure I mean it's you know that's the organ that we're using to consume social media uh so it's completely biologically plausible we also know that when people are doing activities that engage in for example social validation that releases dopamine in the brain's reward pathway and what is social media if not a slot slot machine for validation you have um you have strength of Association so yes these are correlative phenomenon but study after study after study is showing similar findings yes there are exceptions uh but in general you know the the powerful studies that we have are are showing the strength of Association then you have temporality now temporality is hard to to get because usually meaning that which one comes first are people using social media a lot and then get depressed and anxious depress and anxious and then using social media um and of course our natural retrospectoscope we'll want to rationalize and explain uh certain irrational behaviors but I mean we can often get pretty good reports of temporality subjectively in an individual clinical case but also epidemiologically and this is Jonathan

[01:50:51] Height's work right he's saying look if you look at when um for example social media became widely available on college campuses it didn't happen uniformally some college campuses uh got social media up and running much earlier than others and you see on those campuses where it was widely available and used worse mental health outcomes so to me um you know the weight of the evidence makes it more likely than not that social media is causing mental health harms especially in you and so earlier you asked me what can parents do because to me you know pornography that that that begins to fit into social media as well um what can parents do I don't think it should be solely up to parents parents need help right schools need to get smartphones out of the school so that uh adolescent can actually have the liberty and freedom to concentrate on learning because these devices the way that they Jack the reward system make it almost impossible for children to learn and almost impossible for teachers to teach uh you know you you analogize to to alcohol we have lots of laws that limit a child's access to alcohol we have Federal funding for highways that are tied to drinking age limits in those

[01:52:13] States the age of 21 is universal in every state now why because people wanted those dollars to build their highways we should be doing that we should be offering federal and state funding to schools that actually um make sure that from the top down uh kids are not looking at their smartphones and that they have some tech-free spaces and some opportunities for both socializing and learning that don't rely on the internet and rely on technology what are we hearing from schools mostly private schools uh that are eliminating smartphones that the schools are noisy again because kids are actually interacting with each other so lots and lots of empirical evidence um that's also yes consistent with our intuition that g is there's a problem here we need to do something about it which isn't the same thing as saying um social media is bad and nobody should be on social media and it's all evil and it's the devil and that's what people said about TV and that's what they said about radio you know this is on a very different scale the way that the algorithms learn what we've done before um making these media so potently addictive you only have to walk through an airport to see the ways in which we've all you know stopped engaging with our surroundings I want to talk about something we haven't talked about yet but that gets often lumped in the category of addiction which is exercise um so maybe let's start with the brain chemistry of of exercise I think people have heard the term endorphins but what exactly is an endorphin is that sort of a an irrelevant uh topic here and is it is does this really boil down to dopamine again I would say yes and yes so endorphin is an endogenous opioid we make our own opioids thank God we do um otherwise we wouldn't be able to cope with physical pain exercise is actually immediately toxic to cells strange why would something that is toxic to cells be ultimately healthy for us and the evidence is overwhelming that uh exercise in moderation depending upon that person's Fitness level um is is healthy essentially what's happening is that as the body senses injury we upregulate production of our own

[01:54:30] Feelgood neurotransmitters like dopamine but also serotonin neurop nephrine endogenous opioids that's the runner's high if you look back at this metaphor of the pleasure pain balance we saw that when we press on the pleasure side the Gremlins of a neuro adaptation hop on the pain side as a way to bring us in

[01:54:49] Balance ultimately again the same thing happens with painful stimulant when we do things intentionally that are physically or mentally challenging for us our body senses injury upregulates Feelgood neurotransmitters and those Gremlins actually go over and hop on the pleasure side so we get our dopamine indirectly by paying for it up front and you see this for example with studies that have looked at ice cold water immersion noting that dopamine levels gr rise gradually over the latter half of the immersive ice cold water bath and then interestingly those dopamine levels and serotonin and nephrine stay elevated for hours afterwards before going back down to the Baseline levels of dopamine firing which is amazing because what that says is we never go into that dopamine deficit State we get our dopamine indirectly by paying for it up front and that process is relatively more immune to the problem of addiction because we had to work first to get it um whereas intoxicants cause that sudden upward Spike of dopamine followed by dopamine freef fall that dop mean deficit state that state of craving before going back to the level position now are there certain personalities that can get addicted to exercise absolutely um we do see this in clinical care and I think we also see it you know again just in our culture we've also drug aied exercise made it more potent made it possible to do it in more extreme conditions um we've social media fied it so that now people are comparing themselves not just to their immediate but to people all over the world we've

[01:56:24] Quantified it down to the nth degree we're constantly measuring ourselves our heartbeats our breathing our sleep um many people actually get kind of addicted to those numbers or quantifications now they're pursuing a certain numerical outcome dopamine is probably ultimately quite sensitive to numeric um and when we intervene for an exercise addiction we intervene similar to the way that we intervene for other addictions we ask people ble to abstain from that particular exercise for a period of time try to reset reward

[01:56:57] Pathways and then when they go back to using using in a way that's not harmful or self or other destructive this idea by the way that both exercise and cold are for the most part healthy ways to experience pleasure because the pain comes first and you have to do the work to get the pain to experience the pleasure um I think it's safe to say that that's probably how the majority of people would experience that you do write about a fellow in your book who uh you maybe took the cold plunge thing a little too extreme but I would argue in his context it might have been the lesser of two evils right because ultimately this became uh I I think a a more well- adapted coping mechanism to an otherwise maladaptive addiction would you say that's fair I do I agree with you so this was an individual addicted to alcohol cocaine who got into recovery um experienced a lot of dysphoria and discovered that taking an ice cold shower in the morning that was recommended to him by um a trainer or a coach was actually um made him high it gave him the kind of response uh that he often got from drugs so he began doing daily ice cold shower and then over time got himself like um a cooler and you know would submerse himself in ever colder temperatures and then got a motor to circulate the water so he was breaking the ice off in the morning at some point kind of realized oh wait a minute I think you know my tendency to take things to extreme maybe operating here but yes absolutely I agree with you ultimately this was a a healthy a healthy coping strategy um and ultimately you know in a really which really speaks to what is a healthy coping strategy uh it's something that we also do with other people so he started doing it with his family with social groups people would come over over for ice cold water bath parties you know much better than having people over um you know to to snort some lines or you know whatever the case may be um so yes and we have lots of patients who when they get into recovery from drugs and alcohol will often discover Sports and and you know endurance athletes to to in order so that they can still have that striving and that goal and the endorphins we just have to make sure they don't continue to do it to the point of you know personal injury you know I discovered something uh several years ago which was um if I took an ice cold shower uh and I when I was very upset angry uh the the mood would reverse quite quickly and and

[01:59:40] I kind of attributed that to stimulation of the Vegas nerve um again it had to be like my head had to be immersed in cold water it could it could have even presumably been dipping my head in a cold water sort of stimulating uh the dive reflex um but like others who enjoy cold plunging which I do very very much um I I I would completely share that experience it is a absolutely mood lifting experience and when people ask me which I get asked as you can imagine all the time um you know is is cold plunging kind of an elixir of longevity um having looked at the data very carefully um I can say that answer appears unlikely I I see no evidence that cold immersion um Alters any of the

[02:00:28] Hallmarks of Aging with the one possible exception being a reduction in inflammation uh so but but that's never translated to a clinical benefit Visa disease in the way that I do think that there is benefit to sauna right so I do think if you look at the sauna literature and run that same Bradford Hill criteria uh along with the experimental data which are included that that there really is probably causality between the benefits of sauna and disease prevention so again I don't see that with cold um but my my use of it personally just stems from the mood elevation and if it you know so so believing that it has no benefit on my ability to reduce the risk of cancer heart disease or dementia uh just the mood elevation alone for me seems to be reason enough so um I was I enjoyed the story of that gentleman yeah yeah yeah that's interesting I didn't know that about the data with SAA or even longevity relationship with ice cold water plunges but in terms of a mood modulator and a a replacement

[02:01:38] Behavior because I do think that ultimately we are Strivers right we want to experience intense emotions and and it's not that we can just sort of not have goals and not have emotions we we want that kind of intensity and certainly many of my patients um have reported similar types of positive responses to ice cold water plunges um which by the way I don't notice with sauna so so with with with extreme heat which I also enjoy greatly um it's a different sensation and I'm I'm curious do you think that there's something about cold that produces more pain I mean I guess it does feel much more painful um is that is it simply come down to the pain

[02:02:24] I you know it I don't think we know I I do think that the immediate response is going to be some kind of hormetic response hormesis being this Greek term that means to set in motion we're setting into motion our own uh regulatory healing response in response to injury um and the the branch of science called hormesis is uh looking at the ways in which toxic or noxious stimuli actually makes us more resilient over the long run so so um yes I think that it's an immediate horic response and let me just say we see this being beneficial not just in people struggling with addiction or looking for alternative sources of dopamine but also when people get immediately disregulated so you noted that when you get angry it's helpful so when we have patients who are very disregulated overwhelmed by their emotions can't re-regulate we say stick your face in a nice cold water bath plunge your hands in a nice cold water bath so and it really really works for some people um there there's also interesting work looking at cold more broadly and what it does to neurons and it turns out that cold is one of the uh most potent stimuli for neurogenesis so very interesting looking at like mice brains after Expo exposing the mouse to extreme cold or the effect of hibernation in extreme cold and finding that cold uh uh initially caused is a sort of like not neuronal death but if you look at the brain slices it looks almost like these dendritic you know tree likee neuronal structures sort of die out you know in response to cold but then very quickly afterwards you get a spring-like regrowth um an amazing neurogenesis so who knows maybe the repetitive use of cold on some level is causing or facilitating um human neurogenesis as well I don't know um I would love the to see more broadly in the field of Neuroscience people look at this concept of drug of choice because it's so interesting cold for example does absolutely nothing for me I don't I don't enjoy the experience but I also don't get benefit afterward um I sure wish I did because it's a nice easily accessible kind of a tool um but for many people including you it's it's very potent and that's great you write about um a very famous experiment that I'm sure everyone listening to this has heard which is the marshmallow experiment and most of us who are parents did the marshmallow experiment on our kids with the real hope that they would be able to refrain from eating the marshmallow uh because of how we believe it might predict better success later in life but you also write about a revised version of that experiment which I think is actually a little more interesting um do you mind just explaining both the original for those who might not be familiar with it and and also of course the revised version and and above all else what it is that that tells us about being parents yeah so um the original marshmallow experiment was conducted at

[02:05:30] Stanford and it looked at kids between about the age of 2 and five um and it put them the kid the child was placed in a room with nothing in the room except for a table a chair a little plate and on that plate a single marshmallow and the researcher said to the child you know I'm going to leave the room um I'll be back in 15 minutes if you can go the whole 15 minutes without eating a mar eating this marshmallow when I come back

[02:05:58] I will give you a second marshmallow so you'll get two and the whole point of it was to really measure delayed gratification and a child's ability to delay gratification and the the most significant finding was very simply that older children were better able to delay gratification than younger children so that this is a a skill or a capacity that children will develop with age but even within a single age Co cohort there were differences some children were better able than others to wait the full 15 minutes or just wait longer before eating that first marshmallow and what they then did and this part of the study is a little bit controversial but what they then did was followed those kids prospectively some in some cases all the way through college and later and sort of looked at their life outcomes and the claim was that the kids who within their cohort were able to wait longer for the marshmallow I.E delay gratification were also more likely to graduate high school graduate college and go on to have sort of successful lives so to speak so the variance on the marshmallow experiment that that I learned about in in my researching for this book was that they decided to do um um uh another version in which they divided the groups of kids into two groups and in addition to the plate and the marshmallow there was also a bell that they could ring and they told one group um if at any point in these 15 minutes you'd like me to return for any reason just ring this Bell and

[02:07:33] I'll come back uh so they told told that to both of those groups but in one group when the child ring the bell the researcher came back and in the other group uh when the child rang the bell the researcher didn't come back until the full 15 minutes were over so in other words one one one group of children was told the truth and another group of children was lied to and um what they discovered was that the children who were lied to were much more likely to eat that marshmallow before the full 15 minutes were up and I it's just to me it's such a powerful Paradigm for the importance of Truth telling and to not only to teach our kids the importance of telling the truth but to model that for our kids and actually be truthful and show up when we said we were going to show up because it looks like what happens when we're living in an environment where people cannot rely on other people around them especially adult caregivers to do what they said they were going to do that we essentially go into a kind of survival mode where we just feel like nobody's going to take care of me I got to take care of myself I better eat this marshmallow now because if they're not going to come back in the room maybe they're also not going to bring me a second marshmallow if I the full 15 minutes and that can really breed um Within a family Dynamic a very toxic kind of interpersonal family system that I think does increase the risk of addictive behaviors later on because what we'll often see in patients with severe addiction is not only that they had a parent or caregiver who was addicted but that they lived in a house where lying was rampant where people almost never showed up when they said they were going to show up never did what they they said they were going to do um so it's it's very interesting to me how something like telling the truth can be such a powerful shaper of appetitive control speaking of repetitive control you you note how individuals who have had gastric bypass um while quite successful in uh curbing appetite and ultimately food consumption and therefore being a great tool for managing obesity and type 2 diabetes are prone to higher rates of ALC olism can you say a little bit more about that and and and ultimately what I want to really talk about is this new class of drugs that have been introduced uh glp1

[02:10:01] Agonist but let's just set the stage on the uh on the gastric bypasses yeah so about a quarter of individuals undergoing gastric bypass for obesity which you might conceptualize as food addiction um in certain vulnerable individuals um will go on to develop an alcohol use disorder after their gastric bypass and that's probably operating on multiple levels one level on which it's operating is that alcohol becomes immediately a much more potent drug for them because through the gastric bypass they essentially have a kind of a dumping syndrome where they get the equivalent of many more drinks because it immediately goes into the duodenum and is absorbed so they get um you know where they can have one drink and immediately feel their effects and and part of Po Y is not just how much DOP mean it's released but how quickly it's released um which is why for example you know injecting is so potentially addictive because it's basically right to the brain um so alcohol becomes a very potent drug for them but also because of the problem of cross addiction where when people give up one addictive substance or behavior they are vulnerable to switch that addictive tendency over to another substance or behavior and so unless we're directly addressing the problem of the behavioral addiction itself at the same time that we're addressing uh the Obesity and doing the the bypass surgery folks are going to be vulnerable to that yeah so so so what has been your experience clinically with the significant increase we've seen in the use of gp1 Agonist and the expansion in use from uh type 2 diabetes to obesity to overweight to you know basically anybody um on the one hand there have been a lot of reports that glp1 Agonist not only curb appetite which is the desired outcome but may in fact also curb desire and maybe even pleasure and that would actually suggest that unlike a gastric bypass an individual who uses a gp1

[02:12:12] Agonist to achieve their weight loss goals might also have another benefit in that it might curb other maladaptive behaviors such as alcohol consumption um so just kind of curious as to what you've seen as the as the field is still quite nent in our understanding but but obviously you're you you're probably the canary and the coal mine for some of these things yeah so I mean these are really fascinating drugs and what we are seeing clinically is individuals with food addiction and individuals with alcohol addiction alcohol use disorder which by the way is closely linked to food addiction because alcohol is cic so we've got both mediated through the carbohydrate system individuals with at least in the cases where where we have experimented off label uh with the semaglutide the glp1 um you know drugs um these individuals have tried almost everything to get their addiction under control and I would say more we have more experience with treatment refractory alcohol use disorder including trying medications right medications like bphen um medications like uh nxone medications I didn't know about backlin so tell me backlin the muscle relaxant is used to treat alcohol disorder yeah so there are more Placebo controlled trials in Europe than here in the US it's not FDA approved for that indication it's not first line for us but we will sometimes use back backlin sometimes you we'll use Gabapentin what doses of of backlin and Gabapentin are are necessary to produce that effect well Gabapentin we usually I I will say

[02:13:58] I I'm using less Gabapentin than I used to because we've been seeing people actually get physically dependent and some cases addicted to Gabapentin but typically we'll use the 600 milligrams three times a day to help people withdraw from alcohol and in some cases um maintenance although less of that I don't use backin often enough to tell you what the dose is I I have to look it up um but but those are those I would say more often we're using nxone the opioid receptor blocker which can be very nice because a many people's goal is moderation not just abstinence and Al

[02:14:32] Ton's been helped been shown to help not just with abstinence but also reducing drinks on drinking days so that's very nice we we use that almost as first line we use antibus dulam which is the one that's a deterrent if you drink on it you'll get sick people don't usually like to go to that first line but it works when people take it we use things like topy it should be pointed out that if patients do use that and drink through it they are actually increasing the toxicity of alcohol gram for gram because they're experiencing more acety alahh which is the obviously the toxic mediator yes exactly so you really have to be careful who you prescribe it to and it has to be somebody who can can really be committed to not drinking what once they've taken that medication um we also use Topiramate which is a seizure medication which was first first discovered off label to be helpful for binging disorder and um later was shown to be helpful for alcohol use disorder but the bottom line is when we have a case of a patient who has tried these various medications who's been involved in Alcoholics

[02:15:36] Anonymous who's tried Psychotherapy who's gone to rehab who's done it all um in that rare instance because it is off label and because it's so new and so we we are conservative with medications we will occasionally we have occasionally recommended suag glutide or the glp1 um drugs and um in one case in particular it was very striking the extent to which this individual with treatment refractory alcohol use disorder indorsed the complete cessation of alcohol craving um with uh semaglutide and you know it's it's very moving to see that in an individual who has struggled so long long and so hard uh to battle their addiction and then there's this drug that seems to um just suddenly turn off all the noise for them was that patient at all overweight yes and so that's how we could justify it right because uh he we were giving it to him for being overweight for um not having type two diabetes but being at risk for type two diabetes um but but the our real agenda was the alcohol and it worked very well for that do do you think that we'll ever be able to explore um in in a in a in a in a rigorous scientific way the question of whether or not independent of weight gp1 Agonist might be tools to help people with addictions more broadly beginning with alcohol even before we talk about other substances oh yeah so those those trials are those small trials are already underway um and showing some effect so I I would not be at all surprised if in 5 to 10 years semaglutide is FDA approved for alcohol use disorder it might not happen because the the company doesn't need it um and it's expensive to get those FDA approvals and there's no shortage of demand for suag glutide um so uh you know they may never pursue that FDA indication but um I think that it will be used more and more often for alcohol use disorder in particular and Bing eating disorder and I think you do the best job I've ever encountered of describing 12-step programs um which I think people tend to have very polarizing views of right so you've got people who view these things as you know the best things in the world everybody should be in a 12-step program even if they've got just the mildest inclination towards addiction and then you've got another group of people who say it's a cult it's you know it should never be a part of addiction recovery and I I think um you very eloquently I think describe both sides of this and and and

[02:18:34] I think land in a very reasonable position which is which is actually quite favorable for a given individual and maybe not for all individuals do do you mind just saying a little bit about that because I know that um there are many 12 12-step programs out there um I I've been to many meetings myself and have have actually always found them to be remarkable um even when the the topic at hand is not something that I particularly share the addiction for but where I've always found it amazing is in the sharing um and in the um something that you describe as the pro-social shame right so so maybe maybe say a little bit about um your your view on 12-step programs in in in the in the in the help uh of those who who are struggling with addiction and and and what pro-social shame means and why it's an important part of recovery yeah so um

[02:19:28] I always like to say there are many ways to the top of the mountain uh and everybody is going to take their own path but we have clear evidence for things that work and at the same time there's again enormous interindividual variability so what works for one person may not work for another but it would be good if all persons had access to all the different options so they could explore what works for them um 12-step groups are not a treatment per se they're not professionally LED these are peer recovery groups where people are helping other people struggling with the same problem and they intentionally issue affiliation with any kind of political um agenda there's no monetary um there's no fee structure they they don't involve themselves in in money all of all of that incredibly wise recognizing that we humans are um so vulnerable to um kind of mismanaging and asserting our own agendas uh in these kinds of Endeavors and so to keep it free and accessible and everywhere um is just makes the bar for admission much much lower which increases access so even if you're talking about an effect size that may not be as large as some kind of professional mediated treatment the simple fact that it's free and it's in every free church or synagogue basement uh in the world or or or

[02:20:55] Community Center equivalent uh makes it already a very potent intervention um I think it's it's also important to acknowledge that for uh people with more extreme forms of addiction um that the 12-step groups may work even better than individual or group Psychotherapy that's professionally LED and I refer folks to the the the Cochran review by John Kelly and Keith humph and co-authors that really reviews the evidence and clearly shows that 12ep are an evidence-based treatment or effective intervention for people who actively participate for reasons that I don't entirely understand the the press and the media and sort of the culture has been very 12-step bashing of late I don't know quite where that comes from um I do think that it's important not to force people to go to 12 step or to say that's the only way to do it um but but you don't want to also then you know malign or get rid of something that's clearly very effective why does 12 step work when it does work I think one of the main um sources of efficacy is again easy access low bar for participation and it may be one of the few places left in modern society where people can show up and be there fully flawed and broken selves and be entirely accepted for that not just accept aced but where our Brokenness becomes a positive social good um this may not even be true anymore in faith-based organizations where people are sometimes get so caught up in proving the uh the bounties of believing that they are then loathed or reluctant or even discouraged from disclosing the ways in which their life is not working out I have a very good friend who's a a theologian and a devout Christian who of late has stopped going to his church and instead is going to 12-step meetings he does not in fact have an addiction but he gets so much um nourishment from this coming together of people who can talk freely about their mess ups and their greed and their their the mistakes that they've made and their you know shameful um guilt-ridden types of behaviors and come out you know on the other side feeling better for it less ashamed um more motivated to change those behaviors um and plus you know it the whole sponsorship program is so powerful right where you get a sponsor you work the steps but people can call their sponsors any time of the day uh any day of the week you can't do that with me like if you call me at midnight on a Saturday I'm not going to get that message till Monday and depending upon the you know the the clinical ACC I might not return that call till Tuesday that's not true for a sponsor you can call a sponsor in the middle of the night and that sponsorship bond that person will might even come over to your house you know what I'm saying so to me it's just a very remarkable social movement definitely not for everybody but incredibly potent and Powerful especially in a world that is in general conspiring against our mental health you write about something so eloquently and it really reminds me of a close friend Paul kti and I don't know if you inul overlapped when he was doing his residency at Stanford but um Paul always talks about the patience Story the patience story and so I was really uh um touched by how you you really wrote about the same thing right which is we've pathologized mental health so much down to you know history of present illness review of systems and um you've talked about your own Journey as a psychiatrist and your own evolution away from the traditional training where at the end of the day you've got to come up with a DSM 4 or dsm5 code you have to be able to come up with a label and so you're interacting with a person and you're you're in the mode of what's the label what AIS is this person what's the diagnosis and you talk about now how you teach residents to just put that aside and listen to the story of the person um what what is it in your journey that that led you there um and and how how difficult or how easy is it to be training other psychiatrists in that in that school of of thinking yeah I mean what comes to the mind immediately about what in my journey led me to do that is going to sound super selfish but it was the realization that I was not engaged or interested in this person I could not capture my own empathy for them unless I knew the story uh you know the the sort of as I say the mini autobiography of their lives what had transpired in their early life what were the major

[02:25:59] Milestones how did they end up where they are today who was in their life what were the you know the major influences I mean it narrative is so powerful as you know our brains are wired for story our prefrontal cortex is activated when we listen to narrative we learn through narrative I mean narrative is such um a powerful mechanism for so much of what we do I think Fuko said something like narrative is the only way we can measure lived time which I think is really powerful and it's also one of the primary ways to get at causality of course we can tell ourselves stories that aren't true and come up with causal relationships that aren't based in fact but when we're telling true stories it is the way that we um understand what led to what led to what um so uh and it's also just much more interesting and more fun and that's I I see that as a psychiatrist job that's the data right what that is our that's our bread and butter you know the the cardiologist gets the EKG the surgeons cutting and sewing and and we deal in story and we must deal in story and when we have new fellows we have addiction medicine fellows um you know they come from many different specialties we have family medicine doctors emergency medicine doctors uh pediatricians psychiatrists and it's so hard for them to let go of that kind of structured categorization Chief complaint history of present illness past medical history but I just say trust me on this trust me start with their story say tell me the story of your life um where you were born who raised you what you were like as a kid major Milestones memories that you remember that were impactful or important um all the way up into the present day who do you live with who are the important people in your life what do you care about what are your goals and dreams if we don't do that we end up with a kind of a you know a laundry list of symptoms that is not actually a person Anna when you think back over your career you know you you've written about what are undoubtedly a lot of the amazing success stories right people who seemed on the on the brink of of death in some cases and and if not death outright destru ction of their lives and relationships um but I have to imagine that there's a graveyard too of people that you haven't been able to help um H how have you coped with that it's a great question and it's very timely because I just had Clinic yesterday and

[02:28:34] I had an interaction with a patient that was really not good and the patient was very angry at me um the key I think for me is to just stay curious to just continue to wonder about this person what shaped them um what their motives might be and how all of that might inform how we can help them so to to stay in this empathic professional stance um to look at myself right so if a patient criticizes me or the treatment what what is potentially correct about that um how have I messed up um how can

[02:29:14] I make amends um so really trying to walk a path of humility um you know the longer I've practiced Psychiatry Believe It or Not In some ways the less I think I actually understand about the brain and um how people change um I mean at some really core level it is a great mystery um so just trying to stay humble and curious and empathic um and then also go home and forget about it for a while and uh make sure I take care of myself and my family yeah the further you get from Shore the deeper the water gets uh for sure when when you lose a patient which

[02:29:55] I'm sure you do right I'm sure there are many patients where it's not just that they're angry at you in clinic it's that they succumb to their addictions uh physically succumb literally die um is that something where you've accepted the fact that that's going to happen but it's the P you know being attached to that patient and suffering the pain of their loss is the price you pay to be a better doctor or is there a way to uh create a boundary and never let yourself uh hurt in that in in that situation one of my early mentors and supervisors said something to me that

[02:30:33] I'll never forget he said Anna the reason that the work that we do works when it does work is because we actually love our patients and the emotions are real we have to come to the therapeutic encounter with our own physical mental sexual needs met so that we are there 100% for the patient needs but the emotions are real the relationship is real we have to care about these folks so I think that is a deep truism and um when when you know when my when when when a patient dies it is devastating it's absolutely devastating and the guilt is enormous um you know the kind of what ifs if only I had done that if only we had been more present or more proactive or whatever it is you you kind of can't get away from that this has been a fantastic discussion um I I really appreciate the work you're doing your writing is exceptional um and and and I certainly appreciate it uh and and obviously just appreciate your your time today thank you very much oh well thank you it was a lovely interview I enjoyed meeting with you thank you for your important work and uh yeah it was it was a pleasure to talk with you thank you [Music]
