This clip is from episode #352 ‒ Female fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility and PCOS, and understanding the IVF process | Paula Amato, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Infertility Rates Have Risen Over the Decades – Lifetime infertility risk is about 1 in 6, and delayed childbearing plays a major role in the observed increase
- STDs Can Scar Fallopian Tubes – Infections like gonorrhea and chlamydia can travel to the fallopian tubes, causing damage that prevents conception
- Scarring Can Lead to Ectopic Pregnancy – If tubes are scarred, embryos can implant outside the uterus, creating a dangerous condition
- One Damaged Tube Can Lower Fertility – Losing a fallopian tube cuts fertility potential but doesn’t eliminate it, as cross-ovary fertilization is rare but possible

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Is it possible to say anything about fertility rates changing over the past 50 years? Uh c is there any statement you can you can make on that? Yeah, there's some data that seems to suggest that infertility rates are increasing over the last several years. Uh it's pretty common. I don't know if your listeners know, but about you know the lifetime risk of infertility for each person is about one in six. So that's close to 20%. uh in the last few years in the United States seems to be kind of a plateau of the prevalence, but as far as the reasons for the increase in infertility prevalence, it's not super well understood. Part of the reason is delayed childbearing. I was just about to say you could make it 100% if every woman decides to have a baby when she's 70. By definition, you have 100% fertility infertility. So women are waiting longer, of course, to start their families, to pursue education, career, etc. maybe they haven't found the right partner and so that definitely is contributing to to increased rates of fertilities. There's some data that show that sperm counts are decreasing globally. It's a little controversial but that may be playing a role uh there might be a slight increase risk in sexually transmitted diseases as well.

[00:01:13] So all those things are are probably factors. But do we know if a 30year-old woman today has a higher rate of infertility than a 30 year old woman 50 years ago? We think so, but I don't know that data off the top of my head. I got it. And so if the answer there is yes, we would then I don't know that it would answer all our questions because it could still be explained by decreasing sperm count. It could still be incre explained by increasing paternal age.

[00:01:39] You know, this this would be a very difficult analysis to do. Right. Right. Environmental factors as well. you know, where our exposures are different now than they were 50 years ago. Well, and then the question of course would be if this is an environmental reason, what are the environmental triggers? Now, you mentioned STDs a minute ago. So, how do

[00:01:59] STDs and which STDs play a role in fertility? The ones most well understood are probably gorrhea and chlamydia, which are very common sexually transmitted diseases. And on the female side, those particular infections can ascend to the fallopian tubes and cause scarring in the fallopian tubes, which then interfere with that process that we talked about earlier, the egg and the sperm meeting and can lead to infertility. And is that something that happens if it is left untreated or is that something that's easy to address with antibiotics if caught early? I mean if it's caught early then it's usually treatable with antibiotics or there are some issues with antibiotic resistance especially with gorrhea but usually if you catch it early it's treatable u but if it's late stage or it's unrecognized or untreated then it has more likely more likely to ascend to the fallopian tubes where it usually cause fertility problems. How prevalent is gorrhea today in the US? I think it's pretty common. I don't know really. Yeah. Yeah. uh in certain populations is more common than others but um yeah unfortunately and there's a number of reasons for that.

[00:03:06] Some of it is just lack of awareness and education around about safe sex practices um maybe less testing as well especially we saw that during the pandemic for sure. How does it present in women usually with um pelvic pain, fever, vaginal discharge? Those are the most common symptoms. And is it equally transmissible from male to female and female to male? It's probably more transmissible from male to female.

[00:03:39] Okay. And is it is it an STD where the person who has it knows they like if a male has it, does he know he has it? Not always. Presumably not if it's being transmitted this readily. Yeah. Not always. Okay. Yeah. Uh what about HSV? Does that factor into fertility at all? Uh, not as much. No. And chlamydia, again, I apologize for my ignorance. I just don't remember any of this stuff since taking uh, you know, the the USMLE exams. Uh, tell me how chlamydia presents and and how it impacts fertility. The same actually. Yeah, very similarly. So, pelvic pain, fever, uh, usually they're they're both present together. Okay. And does it have the same pathology where it creates it ascends the fallopian tubes and scars the tubes? Yeah. So if if worst case scenario if a woman underos a severe infection with one or both of these um it's not treated in time she has completely scarred fallopian tubes. Is it still likely that she could get pregnant through IVF? Are the eggs still generally is the are the eggs and uterus still preserved enough to Yes. Yes. It doesn't usually affect the uterus or the eggs or the ovaries. Yes. Now, she may not know that she has blocked tubes until she starts trying because you wouldn't necessarily feel different if your tubes were blocked. So, one of the tests we were talking earlier about, you know, what testing we might do in addition to a semen analysis and getting your menstrual history, etc., is we usually do an X-ray test. It's called a hyroalpingogram or HSG for short. And it's done specifically to evaluate whether or not the tubes are open. So are you just injecting contrast in you go you go in I assume you do this externally. You go into the into the cervix into the and you just inject dye and take an X-ray. Exactly. And you're looking for how smooth and so tell me what does a normal fallopian tube look like on that test. So first the die. So it's done in radiology facility usually by radiologists although some gynecologists do this this test as well but usually fills up the uterus. So you can also see the uterus and then the tubes are kind of like these wire like

[00:05:50] Yeah. How what's the diameter of a normal fallopian tube in that setting? Like less than a centimeter. Yeah. That that's that's pretty big. Yeah. The whole tube but the the actual sort of opening how big is the lumen? microns. Oh wow. Okay. Or millimeters. I don't know. Exactly. But you can see it definitely see it on X-ray and you can see Well, you can see it. It's probably a millimeter or more than not a micron.

[00:06:13] For sure. Yeah. Yeah. And then the dye is filling up the tubes and then spilling out the tubes. So you can see that the ovaries are not visualized because of the finger-like projection. So it's actually spilling dye into the paranium at this point. Right. Okay. Right. And based on that visual inspection, a a trained radiologist NGYN can say that is smooth, that looks great versus that is jagged and/or obstructed.

[00:06:39] Right now, if it's obstructed, yeah, I assume that the woman has a much bigger problem, which is every month one of those eggs comes out. It's not getting past the point. Does it just atrophy and get reabsorbed? I see. So, it wouldn't necessarily cause pain. Yeah. So, let's say you do the analysis and I assume if you if there's scarring on one side but not the other, would you intervene or would you just say, "No, we just have to it's just going to take twice as long for one to get through." Yeah, there's still a chance to get pregnant.

[00:07:12] Although, whatever process caused the scarring in the one tube probably affected the other tube as well. So, just just because it's open doesn't mean that it's functioning normally. um certainly can give give it a few months of trying. But the other issue you have to worry about is uh what we call an ectopic pregnancy. If that tube is not normal, if fertilization happens, that embryo can implant in the tube and that's kind of a very dangerous situation because obviously the tube can accommodate a pregnancy. So usually eventually that causes pain and if it goes unrecognized, it's a surgical emergency. Yeah. Exactly. at how many weeks of gestation is a woman typically because that's you know I did my training in general surgery so that was one of the things we were always thinking about was ectopic pregnancies for women presenting with abdominal pain um but I don't think I know the answer to this question which is how many weeks of gestation is a woman when she's showing up in the ER complaining of abdominal pain usually about 6 to 8 weeks pregnancy two months pregnant right now remember we time pregnancy from like 2 weeks before ovulation. So she, you know, by the time she recognizes she's pregnant, she's already a month pregnant. So in the next month is probably the most common time where those ectopic pregnancies present. So when a woman has an ectopic pregnancy, can that fallopian tube be salvaged?

[00:08:37] Sometimes. Sometimes if you recognize it early, it can be treated either medically or surgically and that tube can be salvaged. If you recognize it laid and the tube ruptures, then often time the treatment is to just remove the tube. Plus, especially if it's not functioning normally, too. Yeah. So, when you remove that, let's just say it's a young woman, she's 25 years old.

[00:08:57] You you can't salvage the tube. You end up taking the tube. You're leaving the ovary, right? So, you still want her to have her endocrine system intact, right? What's happening to the eggs that come out of that tube? They just get released into the abdomen, the paritinium, and resort. So, do you tell that woman your fertility rate just went down by 50%. kind of. Yeah. Yeah. She can still get pregnant if she has the other tube in intact, but most of the time if the egg ovulates from the right, it's going to try and go down the right side. Although there have been cases where, you know, you can ovulate from the right ovary and it can travel down. It makes its way over to the makes it way over there.

[00:09:33] Yeah. It's rare, but it could happen. Yeah. Um, what are the risks for ecto ectopic pregnancy besides former STDs that lead to scarring in the tube? uh previous surgery, pelvic surgery in particular, like a ruptured appendix or something like that. Endometriosis can cause scarring of the tubes. Those are probably the most common. I'm Peter Aia.
