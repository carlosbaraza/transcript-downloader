[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive this week I had two guests this was a first I've never interviewed two people simultaneously which is not to say it's rocket science I think a monkey can figure it out and I'm at least as good as a monkey so I was able to figure it out but it did stress me out a little bit because I was trying to figure out how do you keep two people engaged but it seems like we did a pretty good job and I think you'll enjoy this episode my guests were two guys who

[00:01:06] I just referred to as the brothers Bell but they're obviously known more commonly by their actual names mark Bell and Chris Bell some of you may recognize these guys especially if you're interested in powerlifting or if you've ever paid attention to some really interesting documentaries in particular bigger stronger faster which was sort of the breakout performance for Chris Bell that is I believe a documentary that if you look at all of its downloads on

[00:01:35] Netflix would certainly put it in kind of the top 10 docs of the last decade I could be wrong on that but I feel like I remember reading that somewhere prescription thugs was also a follow-up documentary and there were a number of others including one that is in the works at the time of this recording that will link to as well his brother Mark

[00:01:53] Bell his younger brother is an absolute legend in the world of powerlifting and he owns a number of Records all of which are staggering and we'll get into those during the episode this was also a bit of a first for me in that it was the first time I interviewed people I didn't know personally so obviously I'd communicated with mark and

[00:02:15] Chris through email a bunch leading up to this but I didn't have a rapport with them in the way that I've had with every person I've interviewed to date which actually is a little harder you have to pay a bit more attention when you're doing your homework so I hope that doesn't come across as being strained I don't think it did I think we were definitely getting along well and having fun the other thing that may or may not come across here is we were exhausted we did this interview up at a place that

[00:02:38] Mark Bell was renting for the month up in Malibu and so I went up there and they interviewed me for their documentary slash podcast then I took about 3 hours and 15 minutes we took about 45 minutes off to play patty cakes and grab-ass and eat and then I proceeded to interview them and for about two hours so I think by the end of that two hours we were all collectively exhausted so that may or may not come across any way all those caveats aside this was a super interesting podcast because what I really want to talk about was not just their stories and their lives which I think are very interesting and touch on so many of these themes that I've become quite interested in if you've seen either bigger stronger faster or prescription thugs you'll know that their older brother Mike died and they talked about that quite openly in this podcast and it's actually quite it's quite touching and it's actually quite emotional Chris gets kind of emotional at one point during this and it's sort of palpable in the room as we're talking about it they talk a lot about their parents their upbringing I obviously am completely fascinated as to what kind of upbringing could produce such remarkable human specimens and they are remarkable human specimens let's make no mistake about that I also get into some of the details about like their training and very fascinating to understand like how relatively low volume their training was and yet how it produced such remarkable achievements so

[00:04:06] I guess I would say the following if you've never heard of these guys and you're not that interested in powerlifting or strength training I still think you will find this interesting though there may be some parts you want to fast-forward through once we get into the technical details of some of their lifts if you have any interest in strength training you're gonna want to get to know a lot about these guys and one of things I actually learned in the interview I hadn't even done enough homework before the interview - no this is the YouTube channel that Mark Bell has which I've since looked at and it's an incredible resource for someone who is trying to learn how to do the major lifts correctly so without further ado here is my interview with mark and Chris

[00:04:46] Bell mark Chris thank you so much for making time to talk to me about this kind of stuff today thank you young you know this is kind of unusual for me it's two first it's the first time I've interviewed two people simultaneously and also interviewed people that I don't know much prior to this but I kind of felt like there's something else for him please do you can only interview one person at a time you've learned this during the documentary it's just the way it is so if we both talked at the exact same time then this would not work can be trouble we will try to keep that in mind but I do feel like I kind of know you guys which is weird that's I'm sure something that you guys have experienced before when someone's watched one of your films or seen a documentary that you've been in or a part of and it's sort of like they meet you and they sort of think they know something about you right it's like well I know what this guy's all about because he said X Y Z and so I'll try to free myself up from that I get a lot of hugs because of it people like I feel like I know you can I give you a hug yeah it just depends on who it is whether or not I like that or not well when people do that what are they thanking you for cuz I'm sure people do thank you a lot it's a really bizarre thing I never thought anybody would thank me for like making a movie but I guess it's had a profound effect on their life so they say thank you for making that with my film prescription thugs for an example a lot of people see that and realize like oh yeah you know I have an opioid problem I have a drug problem and they'll go do something about it so I think with bigger stronger faster was like more getting off your ass and going to do something with your life and want to be somebody you know that's something that I think is really important to a lot of people trying to prove that you're not just another bum from the neighborhood you know the thing about bigger stronger faster that I found so appealing and and surprising and I think that's I would guess at least part of the reason why ten years later it's still endured is the vulnerability of it you didn't hide your own issues your family's struggles I'm sure I'm not the first person to say this but your parents come across as like the two most lovable people on the planet like I actually didn't have the urge to hug you but if I walked in here and saw you mom I would absolutely have to give you a big hug yeah absolutely was that designed or did you that just happen by accident that you realized hey

[00:06:57] I'm just gonna show my family it was really weird when we did the movie we had a lot of great people helping out my philosophies like go find the best people and do it so like if you're gonna make a documentary I was like who's who's a good documentary filmmaker oh Michael Moore he won an Oscar for Bowling for Columbine

[00:07:12] I thought Bowling for Columbine was one of the best whether you agree with the politics are better not that's not the point the point is is one of the best written documentaries I've ever seen and actually won an Academy Award for the writing of it and it really inspired me and I just said I want to make a movie about steroids so I want to adopt the same style so I watched Bowling for

[00:07:31] Columbine I literally wrote out every scene from Bowling for Columbine and then tried to define what that would be if it was about steroids like what that particular scene would be and in doing that developed like this style and then I actually brought people in that worked on that movie so the editor of Bowling for Columbine was an editor and help on our movie as well and that's sort of how

[00:07:54] I got into making the movie about stars that's that's how I approached it was uh getting the best people and putting them in the right spots so I had learned a lot like in the course of making the movie as well well he directed the cameras at us once he started to get into some of the basics of the film I think for a long time you were kicking around the idea of he knew that there's something magical about Gold's Gym

[00:08:16] Venice he knew something was magical about a lot of the things that were doing the environment we're in but it wasn't until he got into some of the actual ideas of what the film ended up becoming to where he started running through these different scenarios with his producers and he's like yeah you know my brothers you know they my brother Mark does this and my brother

[00:08:35] Mike you know he was doing that and you know I did this and they were like wait hold on a second your brothers are taking steroids right now and he's like yeah anyway they're like that's we need we need to get that on film ya know anyway I was getting to those people that worked on these other great movies were the ones that defined that too me so when I was on the phone with my producer Alex bono I was like hey you know uh you know my brother's not Marx on steroids and Mike's on steroids and

[00:09:03] I'm in the middle and I'm just trying to figure it out and as soon as I said that he was like that's the movie right there that's exactly what the movie is it's like you're the middle brother and you're conflicted whether or not you should take these drugs or not regardless of whether you've tried him in the past he tried him once he felt a little guilty let's just tell that story and what I found is in making films just being honest and telling the actual real story that's going on is the best place to be right now we're embarking on a documentary about nutrition and I keep going back to like keep trying to manufacture what the movie should be in my head and I'm like going back to it should just be what is going on right now what exactly is going on right now

[00:09:40] I'm conflicted about my diet I don't know how I should eat I'm trying to find answers and that's really what it should be the most honest representation of that and not a representation of like here's what I think about the ketogenic diet and here's why you have to do it and so by taking this approach I think it's allowed us to be pretty open minded about the whole thing there's something about that movie also that I've watched it obviously probably half a dozen times if not more and and each time I see it

[00:10:07] I'm struck by this feature which is the empathy with which you approach people even when I think the viewer can tell like you don't necessarily agree so I'm blanking on the boys name but the high school kid who'd killed himself when yeah that's right when you spoke with his father that's a very touching scene because if you're watching that purely through the lens of what the research and the data would say it's pretty clear that you know steroids probably had nothing to do with that tragedy and you know that that boy might have ended up in that situation with or without steroids but at the same time I think you know if I were doing that interview

[00:10:41] I worried that I would have come across as condescending or like a know-it-all but I was I was very touched by the fact that that wasn't at all the case like he didn't press the issue at all the guy just said it the guy said steroids had nothing to do with my son's death and that was that and you I thought it was spectacular as well when you're watching it like that interviewer right there even though it's my brother he had an opportunity to kind of jump on that guy mm-hmm like wait a second how could you say that but it never goes any further than that and shouldn't need to it is the beauty because you you were able to sort of look there are people where you can cross-examine them but you don't cross-examine the father who's lost his son like there's there's absolutely no role for that and so there's a certain level of civility that I think there were other questions where I'm like there's I think other ways to approach it right rather than go I'm gonna jump down his throat say well why don't I just pose a question to him that is comparative saying like hey look your son died from steroids that's what you're saying that's what you're telling me he died from steroids but also like you know my brother died in a sober living facility and drugs were involved and so like I'm trying to compare and in his case I was like well hey look you know you're gonna have a steroid awareness night in this baseball stadium where fathers are going with their four-year-old kid and they go and they drink six beers and then they drive the kid home and it's like you know what's the difference there isn't that ironic and so I was just trying to like figure out ways to not be mean-spirited to the guy but yet like sort of come across where it's like just make some points to them and hopefully like it'll sink in with them I don't know if it ever did or not I don't know if it does or not but that's sort of my approach is to like not really go in there with a mindset of like I'm gonna destroy this person because think about it all realistically we are all human beings we're all in this big soup together we're all here we're all on this planet together and we off to function together so like to pick a side and stand there just doesn't seem to make any sense and what makes more sense is like when this movie's over that guy is still a human being he still has a family he still has things going on right and so I'm not trying to destroy that guy I just want to try to figure out what his point is and move past it and and so I think that that's you know my philosophy is try to try to keep the peace so that after the film we can still continue to have a relevant and smart intelligent conversation about the subject matter so I remember seeing a movie for the first time probably in 2009 and I really

[00:13:07] I'm not saying this just because you're sitting here but I really do credit that documentary with being the thin end of the wedge that got me to begin to revisit a set of beliefs that I had just taken for granted so one of the challenges of medicine is it's not necessarily a discipline that's full of critical thought and part of that is just the nature of you there's too much stuff you got to learn you know so you can't approach it through the lens of intellectual curiosity all the way it's just these are a set of facts cholesterol causes heart disease well maybe it turns out to be the lipoproteins and inflammation and a few other things but look the zeroth-order answer is and of course one of those hugely dogmatic things is anabolic steroids that's got to be like one of the most dangerous things on the planet and so all through my medical training

[00:13:49] I've never really given this any thought and I just sort of assumed that stuff's got to be bad and I even remember as a kid when Lyle Alzado died I remember the cover of Sports Illustrated I distinctly remember the day he died I had just come home from a run it must have been the hottest day of the summer and I remember like you know reading the newspaper about it and it was like it was pretty clear like Lyle Alzado died because he took steroids yeah and I was in high school at the time and it was like I steroids are bad your movie comes along and I collect quotes right so I've got yeah Michael I have a file of just my favorite quotes I'm gonna read you one of my favorite quotes which I think applies to so many things we do this was

[00:14:28] John F Kennedy said this I believe it a Yale commencement in 1961 for the greatest enemy of truth is very often not the lie deliberate contrived and dishonest but the myth persistent persuasive and unrealistic too often we hold fast to the cliches of our forbearers we subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations we enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought it was before we got a male moon huh oh yeah that was when the man on the moon was an idea all right so when I think about bigger stronger faster through the lens of that

[00:15:05] I realized that my understanding of steroids was primarily the comfort I had of opinion it was an opinion that had been passed down passed down passed down but I actually hadn't really submitted myself to the discomfort of thought and I don't think your movie is meant to necessarily make the case that hey steroids are good steroids are bad I mean that's also part of the beauty of the movie is the way it ends with you mark is actually a very powerful ending super powerful like the lat scene in that movie is one of those powerful things ever because it deliberately doesn't try to say here's the answer but what it did at least for me was it said dude like I don't actually know jack about this topic yeah so before I form an opinion I might be wise to start thinking about it one of the interesting things about filmmaking is a come across these things by accident we were editing the movie and my editor like left the computer on one day and went back to the computer and there's my dad and my mom and they're like the chair and after Mark one thing and we're kind of looking I like that's kind of an awesome shot kind of like end the movie on like it's like the family and we're like look at mark he's on steroids like he's awesome you know and and now kind of feeling you know I see him has a few more dinners apart with the Simpsons and so when you're making a movie there's a lot of happy accidents like people go you're brilliant for you went out and got these day laborers and you brought them in your house and you guys made supplements in your kitchen those guys worked outside my office they were there every day and every day I joked like I'm gonna just get these guys to make my supplements for me and I just joke around I guess it's a joke then when it came around the time where we have to shoot a scene I'm like why don't

[00:16:44] I hire those guys there's they're so cool every day I'd like to put some money in their pocket so I paid them all hundred bucks to come make supplements with me for that no idea what was going on and I'm sure they're they probably still don't know that they're even in a movie but they were and they were they were an awesome part of it it just shows you it just shows you how wide open this this industry is and like how things aren't what they seem you know you think they call a supplement must be made in some factory with everything's all through the FDA and Sigma it's not the world's it's not like that you know so prescription thugs sort of carries on in the theme of the same type of investigation but also it's very very personal yeah you know I remember the first time I saw it I was confused at the very beginning because I was like but wait their brother died why is did they film this earlier than I thought and then I realized of course no that was b-roll basically that was that was film you had before you started making prescription things right yeah and so um right off the bat and the

[00:17:47] I was like I want to make this movie and I just remember had his phone call my dad and my dad's like my dad was crying and he doesn't cry that often mark will tell you right he's kind of like him cry like twice choked up pretty money said this is the legacy this is it Chris this is like this is what your brother meant and bigger stronger faster when he said

[00:18:06] I know there's something out there that for the world to hear but I don't know what it is he's like this is the message the message that you don't need drugs in ball wha right and what was really fascinating about that as my dad comes back around full circle again the point where I was in trouble and I wasn't doing too well my dad called me and said only time he's ever yelled at me and he said I don't know what's wrong with you but you're a drug addict or an alcoholic or something there's something going on with you and I can't figure it out but you're not right and I just cried for an hour afterwards you know just like oh [ __ ] I let my dad down like that's the worst feeling I'll get choked up now talking about it was like the worst feeling you could possibly have is like you let your father down and so for me he was very instrumental and just being there for me and being like for him to show his anger just once I think is what saved my life do you remember that time mark when he was going through some stuff yeah of course yeah it was hard you know we are we already lost one and you know I guess one thing that's important to share with everybody is that it's never over the people ask a lot of questions about success or getting jacked or bench press and more weight you could take steroids and you can do all these different programs and you can do all these different diets but it's never over you never there's never a spot you get to and you're like [ __ ] yeah this is perfect this is where I wanted to be I'm gonna hang out right here every once in a while you catch glimpses of your own set of greatness right and it feels good but with his battle it took so much support and it's still it's still it's still a lot of support there's still a lot of he's come such a long way but there's a still a lot of healing that has to continue to happen for his life to be as prosperous as it possibly can be for him to reach he has a lot of big goals but he's not even halfway to some of these big goals because he's still in the healing process and he's heading towards all those things now which is amazing to see after where he came from but it was almost like his life kind of restarted that 40 years old or so and his girlfriend at the time called me and it was a weird number I don't even really answer my phone that often but I was just like this is a weird hour a night it wasn't too late but most people don't really call me past like 7 8 o'clock it was like 9 10 o'clock and you know I hear this voice on the other side just real frantic and really upset and I was like didn't understand who it was and then she started talking about Chris and I was like oh it's Lauren okay that's why phone numbers from the East

[00:20:51] Coast and stuff like that so so then I said okay well where you know where is he what's going on can you calm down I can tell me more and I guess he was inside their apartment she was outside the apartment and she just didn't know how she was gonna find him like what condition he would be in and I said well as bad as it could possibly be I was like you're the only like family he has there I was like I need you to go and check it out you know because if he's really sick or if something happened we need to figure out a way to try to handle it and so I said make sure you just take his key to remove his keys from the house that way he isn't going anywhere and I said and call me back and let me know that he's still alive you know so she called me back she was still kind of hysterical she's like he's still alive but he's passed out I took his keys and I talked to my wife Andy who just somehow always knows the right thing to do with the right thing to say and I talked to her about it she goes we're gonna book him a flight we're gonna get him up here and we need a book

[00:21:51] Lauren a flight too because if we don't book both of them he's not gonna come he probably won't be able to get to the airport in the morning and he'll probably just figure out a way to miss the flight and what we're gonna forget him here and we're gonna safe proof everything around us and we're gonna figure out a way to help him and that's what we did we flew him to Sacramento

[00:22:12] I had a longtime family friend that was a an alcoholic herself and she explained to me you know some of the things that we're gonna go through through that process she gave me the place to send them for what is that where you go Knox detox there we go for like three or four days you know they take your phone and they give you certain pills and his very strict regimen and thing you know contact with anybody and you know that set everything in motion but what I always try to share with people it's a very long process even though that was only three days it then led into him going into rehab for another sixty or seventy days and then it was just constant communication trying to figure out what he wants what he needs I think the coolest thing that came from it all was sitting down with him and we had kind of this intervention thing which really [ __ ] pissed me off because he didn't remember any of it but he did say some things in there that were that really helped a lot helped me a lot and help everybody understand a lot better of what was going on and he said I feel alone and when he said that

[00:23:19] I was like I understand he's in LA and he doesn't you know he kind of has a girlfriend but he doesn't have us we're not there he flies up here for Thanksgiving but he doesn't have family all he has is a bunch of fake ass [ __ ] around him that are in Los Angeles that's what Los Angeles is made of sorry la but la is is like that people come and go in your life in a flash I mean they do in in regular life no matter where you live but you see that a lot in Los Angeles you just meet a lot of people are striving to be actors actresses and you find out that most these people are for [ __ ] a lot every single day you meet the person that's gonna change your life or they have the deal for you you know every day but but anyway you know we were able to surround him my parents obviously played a huge role in all that and we were able to you know have them here still today what five years later four years later four years later yeah it's weird cuz even thinking back to those times like that's just not the same person you know it's a completely different person I was

[00:24:22] I guess I was in that body but I wasn't registered in that body you know I got now I feel like just a completely different human being altogether then I was a couple years ago you know I think that you have to go through some of these things to get like if you want to for me there are certain things that I wanted in life and there were certain things I had to go through to get it you know and I never wanted to be a drug addict or an alcoholic but I thank God for it because I think that it's helped me to really help other people you know and that's sort of the bigger goal is like well how can I use all this to help you you know how can I use it to help other people like oh all I'm doing I was inspired when I was a young kid to lift weights and do you know do these things and and so um when I got older and realized that it was all [ __ ] I made bigger stronger faster you know I just wanted to help you have just Angeles people in the world asking us questions all the time Joe Rogan's texting him asking about the carnivore diet Donald Trump juniors asking me how to improve his squat I mean there's some crazy coolest person in the world but there's some crazy [ __ ] going on though yeah you know there's you know who were kind of unlikely heroes I guess it's really crazy the kind of people even even being able to talk to you it's like you're somebody I've listened to every podcast we've been chasing him down but

[00:25:44] I've read everything you know like I read all the blogs I'm like I I just consume this stuff like crazy so even though like be able to talk to you is to me amazing and I think that that's something that if we can spread that message to other people though you know look get involved in something be proactive about it be excited get other people on your team and go for it in life and it doesn't matter what you do but to me that's what makes our life fun is like now I have all this opportunity to do all these you know fun things like

[00:26:14] Mark and I are gonna go see Joe Rogan perform tomorrow night tell me that's amazing to be able to get invited to do something like that from somebody like Joe and he's okay you guys want to come of course we want to go you know I'm and that to me is what it's all about and what it's all about is like I just told you about when we did prescription thugs well my partner on prescription thugs who's sitting right across the room is

[00:26:34] Greg young GB young and Greg on proscription thugs saved my life he was the person who was able to communicate with the other producers that Chris is in trouble we have a man down but he's not gonna die and he wants to save the movie so he could have easily went to the other producers who was actually

[00:26:53] Peter Billingsley who was the little kid in Christmas Story hmm Ralphie he was our producer but he went to Ralphie and he said hey Chris is gonna be okay but he's in a rehab and we got a man down and this is serious business and we got to take care of it so because he did that obviously has this loyalty to us when it came around to make this film that we're making about nutrition we brought Greg on Greg when he started it was about 330 pounds and now he weighs about 280 so he's already lost about 50 pounds just doing like a keto diet and and he comes and trains with us and so to me that's what it's really all about is like getting in there and helping somebody else change your life because I know Greg well and I know what he's gonna do is he's gonna turn around he's already told the next three people that are gonna tell the next three people and tell the next three people and all it is is we're getting people on the side of being healthy that's all we're trying to do as mental health has improved big-time he's more determined he's in the gym now he's never been in the gym before which that takes a lot of courage to even work up the steps just to even get your butt in a gym and before he said he didn't even want to get up off the couch and you know the thing with with it is like we're not really selling anything we're just trying to trying to help people with their lifestyle mark sells products obviously not that allows us to be able to do these things which i think is a really cool are everything is ten minute walks go lift some weights but stop being so fat stop eating such gross foods you know like that's that's our prescription for everything yeah but again I think what's interesting is it doesn't come across at least to me and maybe that's because I've gotten to know you guys a little bit since you first reached out to me but it really doesn't come across as the way a lot of people in the fitness space come across which is again I'm not gonna name names although I've got a long list of people that I think are complete and total douchebag school business names yeah yeah yeah occasionally my Twitter account will release my criticisms of some such individuals but you know there's this sense of look you just got to work harder you know without acknowledging hey man you're down in the dumps if you're 330 pounds and you're eating poorly and you're sitting on the couch like it's not just a matter of willpower like you have to make some other changes to at least get the inertia to make these changes and again I just think it comes down to this I suspect it comes down to something you can only learn having suffered you know what's amazing to me it's like through doing this like Greg's a guy that I work with you become closer to the people too and so you also you're drawing your friends anymore right here rather than like pushing your friends out and excluding them and things like you're sort of including them now and everything and it it's easier to be friends with somebody that has the same dietary habits as you it's easier to be friends with somebody that does the same things as you has the same habits and like if I want to be successful I'm not gonna let their bad habits sway me in a bad way I'd rather let my good habits sway them and building on that I think it's also I think people sort of don't realize that once you start to let down sort of barriers and you can sort of communicate this vulnerability about your own struggle in this case it's amazing what that does for other people because I think many many of us kind of go around thing and we're the only ones struggling with problem X or problem Y I've talked about David Foster Wallace a number of times he's sort of someone I obviously never had the luxury of meeting but I love his work and he's talked about this so eloquently right which is every single one of us is only experiencing the world from our own vantage point

[00:30:14] I only know what's in our head we only know what we see and it's so easy to think you are alone which goes back to what you said earlier which is chris is he's breaking he's falling apart because he feels alone perspective is such a huge thing and a lot of times it's easy to be judgmental but I think about my own life and I think I had to what I can would consider perfect parents both my parents were there for everything my dad was like our baseball coach and I can't remember my dad ever telling me no that he couldn't hang out with me or throw a football around with me or whatever I can't remember a time where my mom didn't cook dinner like you know they were just just around there was no shortage of we can't complain no shortage of like resources basketballs weights money no shortage of hugs no shortage of love no shortage of encouragement so somebody asked me certain questions about whether it's my lifting or whatever my lifting you know I I started out in a way different spot then maybe somebody else maybe somebody else grew up with abusive parents maybe they didn't even find Fitness until they were 40 whereas I found it at twelve because we had in our basement because I was privileged enough to have parents that were always headed in the right direction always trying to do right by the family and we're really trying to you know build build towards something where is this other people that maybe their dad wasn't around maybe their mom wasn't around maybe they're alcoholics maybe they're being abused or who know the list of things is unbelievable but your starting point is is a big factor in where you start to end up and Mark talks about that a lot and I think that that's the you know he said he says not everybody starts at the same spot and so in we can't really compare ourselves other people mark and I right now are training with Mike O'Hearn Michael

[00:32:02] Hearns a freak ever since he was 14 years old he looked like a professional bodybuilder right so he's known as having the worst transformation in the history of the world because at 14 or actually more like 16 or 17 he looks the same as he does now at 48 yeah he's always been jacks exactly and so you know we for us we're like man we if we were to compare ourselves to him we just feel like crap every day if I compare myself to mark I'm gonna feel like crap every day because he's bigger than me and stronger than me and leaner than me right now he's getting ready to do a bodybuilding show but you know in my head my goal is to try to beat him you know like we're still brothers so in my in my head I'm starting way back from him and I'm not comparing myself to him but I still in in some weird way go like man I hope I surpass him somehow okay I hope I can sneak in I'm hoping he you know after his bodybuilding show he has one too many days of cheating you know and I could still beat him in something but I you know I used to always beat him in powerlifting I used to tell him emphatically you will never be as strong as me I would tell him you'll you won't even get in within a hundred pounds of my benchpress and for a while that was like so true and then now I'm not even close to him so it's like it's funny how those things happen and can reverse Never Say Never and never seen lovers write to me the journeys kind of everything my brother he has a more eloquent way of saying it and I'll sort of bastardize it but the gist of it is you don't judge a man by where he stands you judge him by how far he's traveled to get there and awesome yeah I always thought of that I mean I mean he said this even when we were young and I remember I think I just always grew up with such a chip on my shoulder that whenever I sort of felt myself being compared to someone who was better than me or that I would assume was more privileged than me I would not necessarily verbalize it but internally

[00:33:50] I would think well screw them I've traveled wait I might not be where they are but I've traveled way further to get here and you know I've always been a negative energy it doesn't help you totally right and I'm still kind of you know completely fascinated by whatever it is that motivated the three of you as brothers to be you know trying to be anything other than ordinary and again I don't think anybody just wakes up and says I'm programmed to be ordinary but you know you guys have accomplished kind of remarkable things I mean I want to come back and talk about the physical stuff because it is I'd like to be able to put some of that in perspective for people who who don't really fully understand what some of these lifts me and so will certainly come to that but it's interesting because it's not the story I would have expected right what I would have expected is something in childhood wounded you guys you know and it's like your entire adult life has been a way to cope with some pain and that's been channeled into mostly positive things but then sometimes it's gone off the rails like that's the narrative I would construct if I didn't have any background I had really honestly when I when I said January 23rd 1984 was a day that changed my life forever

[00:34:58] I meant it I really meant it when Hulk Hogan beat the Iron Sheik we were we were fanatics we were nuts man we were like well that's so loved it so much and we wanted to be part of that without all we could see is ourselves inside of a wrestling ring we had the ability to dream because our dad provided and mom provided that for us that's all we had to worry about his kids was the dream big that's it that was the only thing when I remember like the smell I remember I remember everything about like getting our first Nintendo you know

[00:35:25] I mean I remember all these different things I remember watching that match how old I was yeah seven I don't know there's such a difference like I really remember those those are really strong memories for us and there's there's such a difference from when we got involved in watching wrestling to before it like

[00:35:43] I don't I don't remember anything before it I just remember the I actually don't even remember to tell you the truth should not even January 23rd it was before that January 23rd was the big day where Hulk Hogan pinned the Sheik but before that this was WrestleMania 1 correct that was before that even this is 1984 WrestleMania once again 7 no 585

[00:36:05] Russell many one was WrestleMania one with Hulk Hogan and mr. t it was the year after yeah it was after we had to drive out for whatever but yeah before that mark and I were watching wrestling and Mark used to have to hold the clothes hanger we had a metal clothes hanger that was attached to the antenna that we could get you know so that the

[00:36:22] TV coming I can't really watch it I could kind of be like hold it but he was only like 5 seriously was Mike 5 or 6 and Mike was two years older than you yeah a year-and-a-half nearer than me you're four years older than Mark yeah so he was like a little kid he's like 5 maybe I'm 10 right and mad dogs like 12 and we're watching wrestling and we're watching this body slam challenge every time Big John Studd would come out and they'd hold up the bag full of money and they'd be like $25,000 body slam challenge and the smallest bag for some reason yeah a tiny little bag and $1.00 in there - not even hundreds and we're like excited like who's gonna try it this week and we know the guy's never gonna get him and body-slamming who's gonna get him this week and it's like chief Jay Strongbow so we're kind of bummed out I got chief Jay Sharma he's not gonna do [ __ ] you know so chief

[00:37:09] Jay Strongbow like walks out and he's standing there and he just starts shaking his head like no he's like got his hands crushes like nah and he turns around and Andre the Giant walks out behind him and we're like oh my god it's Andre and we were so excited with the honor who's gonna come down and slam him and take the money but it was even better because Andre came down and tried to slam him and then the manager smashed him in the back and Andre took the money and threw it out to the whole crowd to us like those moments were like bigger than life they were the hugest things that happen it's like so much to where we would my dad would always you know say hey if you guys want to do something special I'll do one one thing a year and it was always like let's go to Madison Square Garden and watch wrestling let's go to Wrestlemania you know was always something to do with wrestling so for us it was a huge influence on our lives were just like what we saw in the movies and on TV and we lived in I do think seeing our dad being a suit and tie every day it was not anything that we wanted for ourselves either and he worked for IBM and he poured so much into that job he would do anything for that company and he worked there for nearly 20 years I think right around the time he got to a point where he would get some privileged things upon retiring like around 19 years or so is when they let him go and it was like wait what like all this this work that you put all this time into you just out the door and he realized it himself like I was a huge lesson for us well he hadn't he said he you know later he told us he had no ownership of anything he's like I didn't own the [ __ ] stapler I didn't own the paper that they had I didn't own he's like all

[00:38:41] I owned was myself he said so and after that he I think he had like a knee surgery and some things so he went through his own process but went through probably a lot of personal development which maybe he didn't even really realize that he needed to go through because he was stuck in corporate America he was like frozen his brain was frozen in time whereas corporate American family corporate American family go back and forth between those two things it didn't leave time for anything else but when he lost his job I think he paused for a minute took a breath and said I'm actually really smart I'm gonna be an accountant he was already doing some of that I'm gonna go in a real estate he picked back up I think within three years he was not only making the money he was making an IBM but he was doing it and then some our grandfather was an entrepreneur grandfather could tinker and fix anything he had a used-car lot and I think a lot of our creation backyard yeah its Genesis his home yard he built his own home you know so when I when when I look at my grandpa and I look at my dad like I feel like he and I are giant steps backwards compared to what those two are able to accomplish well there's something you said that I find really quite quite powerful which is despite the fact that you was working for the man busting his ass he'd give anything for IBM he still gave you guys everything yeah you said absolutely you never were without a hug you never there was never a moment when you wanted to play with your dad and he wasn't there and so my guess is that would make it a lot more palatable when you get [ __ ] on by the man because can you imagine the guilt that would rest upon you if you're doing all this stuff in service of your family right you're working this hard to provide for your family obviously but in the process you're you got to make these hard sacrifices to not spend time with your family and then in the end you get the shaft so that's where my mom came in she had the strength to pull him aside one day and say you're not here enough and he was like what he was like I'm trying to be she's like yeah you keep getting these promotions you keep making more money but she's not here and he was like oh my god I didn't he almost he got lost in it he didn't know and so my mom pulled him back in and and that that really helped were your parents athletic when they were growing up no our mom was my mom was slightly but she she came from a family a big family and she was the babysitter you know she had a lot of responsibility as a young woman literally raised yeah or she raised you know seven other kids basically you know my grandmother at the time my grandmother was going through alcoholism as well and same with our grandfather so our grandfather was a chief of police on my mom's side in the family and he was dealing with alcoholism and he dealt with that up until he died my grandmother got sober and she'd been sober for like 30-something years I think when she passed away which was like last year maybe our grandparents lived down the street from each other and we would go we didn't realize the dynamics of that until we got older that my dad and mom met on the bus and my dad like winked at my mom or something when they were like 13 but they were literally like just a few labors a few football fields away from each other but when I go to my mom's side of the family the house was real dark and you didn't want to hang out there as a kid it smelled like alcohol it smelled like cigarettes and it just had unease just sitting just like fogging through the whole household you just needed and want to be there you didn't know why but you didn't want to be there no one was mean really but just it was like kind of like just to be where everything was like the house is just depressing but then we would go to my dad's side of the family and everything was like bright and everything's wide open and somebody's dressed up as Santa Claus on Christmas around an axe randomly for some reason some unsupervised kid and then someone's got a my grandfather's ball and someone's got a wiffle ball bat a crappy father would pull stunts so he would pull stunts like he'd blow out his birthday candles and the cake would fall through the table he would just do crazy

[00:42:38] I mean Phil meant he'd blow the filming he was a filmmaker he would blow everything he'd blow his candles and then the cake would go flying across the room and smash into the wall and as kids were like oh my god oh man he does things like he put like a little pulley and a string underneath he said when I blow out the candles and I make the cake fly across the room the kids are gonna go nuts and it was always my grandfather every single year every single year and they still do it in our family you pull the rope because you will always put the trap for Santa Claus so the day after

[00:43:06] Christmas you pull the rope and you always get Santa Clauses boot and it's full of candy and that's what the kids do every single year and they still do it in our family because my grandfather started those traditions so great when you're like 14 you like this stupid yeah I think those things I like are in ingrained in us we had a great life growing up we had a fun life growing up we used to go fishing with our grandfather and things like that we just grew up close when did you realize just from the standpoint of strength you guys weren't normal I was in 11th grade and I had um so my knees were really bad and when I was in art that I was in 10th grade yeah and my my knees really there's always hurt and I didn't

[00:43:53] I had no idea why and so I went to the doctor and doctors ago you got these bone spurs and you're in your knees we got to remove them so you did this like arthroscopic knee surgery and I was had to be off my feet for you know a couple weeks or whatever and I and I did that but I was always in pain I didn't really know why it's because I had arthritis but I had no idea when I was younger and nobody diagnosed me with it at all so I was playing football at the time and I went to see this chiropractor who was also our strength coach and he taught me how to squat and so it just started out where Matt dog was going to the gym all the time he was playing football and he was really good and he could squat like 400 pounds or something I'd say what age he was 16 yeah he was strong like that it's pretty strong and aggressive it's pretty strong and by the time he's like 18 you know he was even a little bit stronger and my chiropractor this guy who was trying to help me fix my knees said well you know it to fix your knees you need to squat and I said oh no I've been reading the bodybuilding magazines that's the last thing you want to do it's bad for your knees and it hurts your knees he's like no it doesn't I've been a power lifter forever just trust me to squat and I was barely into even like working out so I started with a broomstick and I just prided myself and going back to that doctor every day every time not every day but like once a week saying like hey now I did a hundred pounds now I did a hundred and ten pounds you're how old here like 16 16 16 at this point yeah yeah and this guy squad 700 pounds that around waiting around 16 years old turning 17 about on a ship I started squatting a broomstick and within six months I'm squatting 315 for like eight reps people like what is going on with this guy you know people in my school this is weird you say that you are do at this point are you doing like top of the thighs are breaking parallel like squats pretty much there were powerlifting squats there was nobody really had the time but then pretty soon I was up over 500 pounds like in high school squatting over 500 pounds and squatting over 500 pounds for working out doing reps we responded really well to not doing a whole lot so we'd go in the gym and we do one heavy lift and we would leave I believe and our coach we had like a guy that was trying to coach us and he was like hell brothers just squat and lead he's like you don't even do any assistance work but I guess all we need keynesian and he had up squatting 675 that way at around 18 or 19 years old yeah so I I don't so we were like no we think it's working yeah I mean I think I you know I think the fact that less training stimulus helped and we were like really into Mike men sir we were just talking about him and Mike münster was our uncle's favorite bodybuilder and he was all about like doing less and getting away with like just going in and working really hard for a short amount of time and we took you know took those lessons but we realized that we were strong early on but for mark what was insane was there was day it's like this is sort of the day lifting started like the day lifting began like for you go into like a rocky montage if this was the movie of Marc's life there's this day where my cousin

[00:46:47] Steven came over to visit Steven's like I can't I know I can't bench as much as you but I know I can't even his age yes Stevens my age is like I'll kill mark and I'm like I don't think you will and he's like no I'll kill mark and bench I can bench like tools knowledge yeah I'll kill smelly and best messes and so um they get on the bench you start going it's like 135 145 155 we just keep going up and up and I'm like them I'm thinking mark is really getting strong like whatever we've been doing has been working we get up to around 200 that's not any idea how strong I am because he's only had me do set to like six to ten reps usually and as we were going up and wait we just kept adding fives and tens and five and ten five and ten I got him on this bench off with my cousin my cousin fails at like I don't know what he felt that but then like 205 or something and Mark did like 240 or 250 pounds at what age he was probably like 13 13 maybe 12 or 13 like young like like what the hell is going on here

[00:47:46] I definitely didn't look like I could do that my mom had been on the same day my mom benched 135 and she had never lifted in her life she just picked it up and it was weird to her like she just was like like this and laughing all in like sinking in there were boobs and everything yeah yeah and she just like smashed it out we're like oh my god yeah you guys remind me of a family I grew up with which is just and it's actually sad thing is it's an equally tragic story so not that anyone listening this'll ever I don't know if they'll ever hear this but their name was the stoop Herricks so there was Rob Matt Russ and there's one other stoop Eric and they were from another planet in terms of strength so you know even though boxing was my thing like I found a great place to lift weights which was this

[00:48:36] Dungy little gym at the University of Toronto that was mostly just grown men powerlifting and then there was me and my best friend from high school who were like you know they hated the fact that we were there but by the end they grew to respect because they basically got us into power lift and it's so funny everything you say reminds me exactly of this to perixx which were they literally only benched or squatted or deadlift nothing else and their strength was read on keyless I remember I think it was robbed at a weight of 185 he had hurt his shoulder so bad that he could only narrow grip bench and he's narrow gripping 385 410 like here it's like because my shoulder hurts too might rise yeah and these guys were freaks of nature and I don't know if any of this [ __ ] was true but the rumor was that they were you know they came from Viking stock and their mom could apparently bury any one of their friends in an arm wrestle if they brought a friend home that's great like you want to arm wrestle their mom you're going through that yeah what's in yeah it's like it's funny cuz we were like that but we weren't even strongest kids in our high school or we weren't even the strongest kids in our area come on in Poughkeepsie I think it's like in the water or something I mean there was there were people we were the strongest we were by far we'd kill people in strength but um we had dudes that were huge in high school that was like monsters that we went to a pretty big high school I mean when I went to school

[00:50:04] I was but you you were you were just smaller yeah well a lot of people did steroids khichdi so when I grew up in Poughkeepsie I had a belt that said roid sucked on it I said roids suck and it would make everybody in the gym mad cuz everybody was on the juice and I was stronger than all of them and they would get so pissed because they see me coming in squads that were on steroids then - yeah and they'd see the belt right sucks no you're you know you're on [ __ ] everybody would always say that I was on stuff and

[00:50:29] I just never was you know it just it just didn't happen so to me all growing up it was funny that we I ended up making bigger stronger faster because I have that I had that written in big block letters across the back of my belt roids suck and I end up making this movie about steroids and talking about how they maybe they're not that bad so how old were you Chris when you peaked and what would give me just give me well first of all let's take a step back actually what do you guys explain okay

[00:50:54] Don you're done it's all downhill what do you guys want to take the liberty of explaining to the listeners what powerlifting is what Olympic lifting is why those are sports in and of themselves let mark do that he's the expert all right mark tell us what they are so Olympic lifting is what you might see on TV when the Olympics come around powerlifting is not an Olympic sport

[00:51:14] Olympic weightlifting is a clean-and-jerk and the snatch those the exercises that you do basically involves taking away from the floor and figuring out some way to get it over your head there's different rules in both of them but that's the gist of it you get three attempts on both of those lifts and the accumulation of both of those lifts is called your total so in powerlifting you do a squat in this order benchpress and then a deadlift and you get three attempts at each one of those and accumulation of those that goes into what is called a total powerlifting is really difficult because it's hard to have leverage on all three of those movements Olympic lifting is very difficult but it requires a whole different skill set mobility becomes a big factor speed becomes a big factor you're trying to like basically move your body around the barbell whereas powerlifting is not even like a good move in the bar yeah powerless it's just not even a good term for it because it's it's not really a definition of power right Power has a speed component to it yeah right yeah you are doing it as fast as you can but it's so heavy it doesn't look fast yep yeah but yeah in powerlifting you know for the squat were required to try to get our hip crease below where the knee is which is always in controversy because the human body can't process looking in two places at once so that rule should have been changed a long time ago but it never has been so that's a squat when it comes to the bench press you need to pause the weight on your chest for a moment the referee will say press he press the weight back up to full lockout and the deadlift is pretty simple you just pick the damn thing up from the ground and until you're able to stand up with it fully erect as they say and then they just give you a down signal and that's powerlifting and you alluded to something earlier which your numbers are actually quite interesting so so I was not a pretty good power lifter I just did it as sort of ancillary training for let's saw numbers yeah so at a weight I weighed 158 160 my bench was my weakest

[00:53:16] I think my best was 270 or 275 respectable it's a 275 okay so my squat was about 495 I think pound for pound that was my best lift and my deadlift was about 505 this man here he didn't even give himself the 5 pound bump on the squat so you would agree though that I was more of a squat deadlift guy than a bench guy was a pretty weak bench guy actually all that like I was alive marks a day you can only be good at one and we were really good at bench press well that was our main yeah sometimes you get it too and sometimes like somebody might be somewhere in the middle of Road on all three and then they're able to raise up all three over years and years but your pr's mark are remarkable I don't have them here but if I recall you actually benched more than you dead lifted you had a PR so give me your PRS first of all there's kind of two parts to my lifting career or maybe even three parts but I guess to make it more simple

[00:54:13] I used power lifting gear which is supportive gear that gives the assistance that allows you to lift more weight it started out being protective and then the companies made things more and more extreme and so therefore you're able to actually lift more weight I did a thousand eighty squat 854 pound bench press and a seven hundred and sixty-six pound deadlift and that's all in equipped powerlifting when it comes to raw lifting in the gym I've squatted 700 pounds raw before I benched 578 in competition and I think my best deadlift might be like 7:15 I believe somewhere in that range so so right now that's that's an interesting distinction to be clear raw means no knee wrap yeah so the the raw powerlifting that I did was no knee wraps no squat so belt only belt only a belt wrist wraps okay it sometimes people still consider knee wraps being raw just because you're not wearing like a squat suit or shirt but yeah those were the numbers at that time

[00:55:15] I was so locked into what I was doing I did every and anything that I could to be stronger you know I've made the statement before and it might sound arrogant but I just said you know if you met me at that time I would Bend the most savage powerlifter you ever met because not because of my strength I wasn't the strongest guy in the world although I posted numbers that rivaled some of the strongest guys in the world for that time I was as strong as I could be I don't think I could have squeezed any more out of that I pushed it as hard as I could I got as big and as heavy as I could I tried eating healthy to get big I've tried eating disgustingly gross to get big I've tried to do all kinds of different things and

[00:55:56] I and I think I pushed that envelope pretty good I think maybe the one thing that could have been a little bit better is I could have slept a little bit better looking back at it but I was just so big it was hard to think he's right on that I mean I know we know a lot of people in powerlifting and he just put everything into it you know there was times where just like even the amount of food he would eat and stuff and I would say like aren't you worried about this or that he's like I'm just worried about winning you know like he wasn't worried about any like everything was so laser focused and on these big lifts and these big weights and the amount of energy and the amount of seriousness like it was and it was so dead serious in the gym all the time because like kind of was life or death when you're squatting a thousand pounds there'd be like a lot of fights and arguments and in the old super training because I it was highly competitive and people would you know like somebody would mess up like just getting the rack somebody would go to

[00:56:52] Raticate and they buddy wouldn't put the mono lose out on the wrong way or a yellow yell at each other is getting all fighting it was just so aggressive and a crazy lot of intensity it's sort of where you had to go to get there in in the sport of powerlifting it's so what were your PRS assisted so I did like 675 squat I never did raw powerlifting never came into the fray like as far as I was there but I was actually there it's not interesting I was there before the equipment was really good but not when it went raw so really like a single ply squat suit I'd be like 675 squad I did a 472 bench in competition but I'm bigger stronger faster in just a bench competition I did 501 in a bench shirt I think the best I ever did in gym was like 585 that's where the shirt the best

[00:57:41] I ever did I think Ron the gym is is 500 but you know now I blew out my shoulder and those things don't work like that anymore to give some people perspective you know everything in my gym is specialized the plates are specialized the barbells are specialized at the time when we when I was lifting those big weights we had a bar which is called the iron wolf bar and this this thing is so has so much crazy knurling on it it's like a cheese grater that it kind of ruined the inside shape of our squat rack because when you try to move the weight around and roll it at all it would shear metal off of there and if you went to duck underneath it to do a squat it would tomahawk you it would it would just frickin cut the top of your your hair right off I could just blow mica like a razor so everything in there is specialized and that bar was designed that way so it stays sturdy on your back and it was extra thick so that there was no whip when you're trying to squat because when you have that much weight on your back if the weights are flopping around it's gonna be really hard to try to stabilize and you're gonna end up probably fallen on the ground Martin also he had you know we use kilo plates which are super super thin or we had to buy always buy you know thinner 45 pound plates and they give people an idea of what some of this stuff looked like I mean it'd be very common to walk into super training gym on a Tuesday or on a

[00:59:03] Thursday night Tuesday was a big squat night Thursday was a big bench night and you would see six seven eight nine forty fives on each side of the bar one time just to do it just cuz I wanted to try it I could have easily used our kilo plates and stuff but I was doing some math and I was like holy crap I can benchpress 20 45 pound plates I'm like

[00:59:26] I'm gonna [ __ ] try that tomorrow and so is 10 45 pound plates on each side if you can envision what is that and now that's a special bar too because it has an actress 900 pounds plus the bar 945 yeah it's like not yeah right yeah and uh you know I did it off of boards and stuff in context for people like for me I understand these numbers cuz I just know like even just like I remember this like I was never even able to get to 25 for 10 I could never quite get there which I always thought was like an you can do 225 for 10 you're not actually benching and I remember like I could only get to about 8 and so I was just such a pathetic bench presser but I also know like how heavy that is so when the numbers you guys are talking about like I don't even understand what 857 benchpress means like how do we I'm just trying to think like you could benchpress the back of a car you could lay under a car and at least get the car out of its suspension right you know I don't know an easy way to try to explain something that's a little bit complicated to people that might not understand it all I know is that typically when you go into a commercial gym somebody might be moving around a plate two plates maybe three plates and the strongest guy at some of these commercial gyms sometimes are pretty strong but usually gonna see somebody use 405 you know four plates on each side it was very common that weekend and week out at my gym and still is very common to where there's groups of people you know one after another I guess where you can make a comparison is a friend of mine was a collegiate wrestler and he ended up being an alternate on the

[01:01:01] Olympic team and when he went to train at the Olympic Training Center he said he remembered there was some guys there after he was there for a while there's some guys there that would brag and they're like oh I'm an all-american from this place for that place or I'm you know Allstate from this college or whatever whatever whatever the thing was whatever does a championship was and he was just like we all are you know what's special about you know you're not a special snowflake you know and so inside the walls the gym as we were building up and making ourselves a lot stronger that's what we'd see day in and day out it was just commonplace to see somebody squat seven hundred pounds eight hundred pounds deadlift a hundred pounds things

[01:01:39] I think that was sort of I took it for granted as a kid that from my first exposure lifting weights which was starting at 13 till 19 I all knew that one gym yeah so I only knew exactly what you're describing which is all lean we were the weakest you know me and my friend were like the little babies there but you would see these guys who were simply from another planet and everything was only counted in plates right it was like is it six places at seven plates is eight plates and of course you know this was such a crappy gym that the bars were all bent like yeah you know what you had to know how position yourself under the bar to squat because the bar so Herrmann Utley deformed dangerous yeah yeah yeah it's just crazy and now as you say I go into like crunch which is where I lift weights when I'm in New York and it's like you don't see anybody really going above two or three plates typically and and and look there's still strong dudes but what you're describing is it looking back on it I wish I I wish I knew more when I was doing it looking back on it we tried to learn as much as we can as we were doing it but along the way I've gotten injured and being hurt is worse like to me now it sucks because I'm hurt

[01:02:42] I can't fix it so I got hurt from I tore my tricep just from pushing things too hard pushing pushing too much too hard every years ago maybe it was like five years ago and it just never healed right and it never when I went to the doctor to see if I needed to get it reattached as I got it it's torn but it'll probably heal pretty good and blah blah blah like you know so I just didn't get it reattached and also was right before I went to rehab so I wasn't in a good state of mind to go get it reattached or whatever and it just never came back and so I wish I knew more and you know now but what's what's nice about now coming back around is a lot of things that are injured I've been I've been able to rehab and been able to you know fix as well so I still pretty lifting pretty heavy but I just wish we had that knowledge back then of like you know not getting hurt so knowing what you know and and you guys have heard me talk about the importance of weight training

[01:03:34] I it's probably the only thing that for me is never compromised my life sort of revolves around weight training so I have to get in the gym three days a week and my hotels when I'm on the road are planned around where those lifts are gonna be and when and blah blah blah and yet doesn't mean that every week I can squat and deadlift and do all the things that matter but almost without exception so this stuff's important but the other thing I'm sort of fond of saying is look rule number one is don't get hurt so if someone's listening to this and either like you know these numbers don't mean anything or whatever but they still get the gist of it which is hey I probably ought to be lifting weights and let's say they're thinking hey I want to be able to squat and deadlift and bench I want from each of you guys a really you know sort of the most important thing that you know after all of your years of watching coaching and experiencing that you would pass on to somebody so let's start with you the hard part is rule number one is to challenge yourself rule number two is to not hurt yourself so that's where things get to be a little difficult as we get older a lot of times that shifts right but in the beginning you you need to get hurt it sounds foolish to mention that but we've all been hurt in the gym and we've all learned a lot from it and I'm not saying that you should haphazardly jump in there not warm up and stuff but the truth is we could sit here and promote warm-up and stretching and stuff and no one's still gonna do it well but you guys are big on warming up the glute

[01:05:02] Mead you've got you you sell a thing that one of the things I'm hoping you either have here or I'll have to buy it on the website but I like your little hipster shop your hip circle so I mean that was one of the most important insights of my life was you can't squat or deadlift until your glute Mead your

[01:05:18] TfL are working it's foolish to it's foolish to start a workout without warming up you got to move around if you're gonna do any sort of upper body stuff you got to get the elbow joint warm you got to get the shoulders warm and there doesn't have to be any science to it there's not to be anything in particular to it you're gonna squat you throw on something like hip circle you walk forward you walk backwards you walk side to side and maybe you do some sort of bending exercise where you're picking up barbell or plate you know and just bending from the hips basically but you have to warm up for your workouts but if you're not challenging yourself then you're missing out and a big piece of the puzzle because you're never gonna get the results you're looking for people always think that when they look at other people on social media when I look at Jeff Bezos the guy that owns

[01:06:06] Amazon if they look at Elon Musk or they look at the rock people are like that's so cool like that would be awesome to be them like must be easy like must be easier because they're them because they have that money because they have that freedom it is ten twenty thirty hundred thousand times harder to be them it gets to be harder and harder to be yourself as you continue to grow in fitness and so that's the reason why you have to challenge yourself each and every day you have to figure out a way how can I be better than I was yesterday doesn't always mean that you have to do more weight but you have to challenge yourself in something there has to be progress without progress I don't believe you can even have happiness and so when the progress is gonna be very very motivating to you as well and it's gonna be something that will help keep you on track before I go to you Chris I want to follow up more on that talk to me about some of the ways that you would monitor progress when you're already at the level of the world's best which you were the days are long gone where there's a PR everyday in the gym you PR once a year that's a good year so what are you doing to motivate yourself day in and day out when you're still benching every week and still squatting and still dead lifting like how are you finding out what are these incremental goals as you chase one thing something else starts to fall apart and there'll be tipping point you want to be really strong well maybe maybe you run into an injury just cuz like sometimes we're sitting there and trying to think about it or like what well you know I don't know maybe your your hips are tight or maybe it's like how about it's just you try to lift up seven hundred pounds and you be doing for the last three or four weeks and that's just that like that's just the way the body's going to be so there's always something to work on there's always something to improve you always have that kind of white belt mentality where you're like I don't know everything I don't pretend to know everything there's still so much to learn and expand upon and when you look around you're like are there other people that are better than me in this lift are there other people that are stronger than me of course there is are there other people who've gone further than me of course there is so that means

[01:08:12] I have a lot to work on there's always a PR to chase there's always something to chase it might not be on that lift it just might look like something different one of the magical things that I've learned in the gym and it's one of my favorite things is just and I share this with everybody do you know a way to get a PR every single time you step foot into a gym low standards start low well that's a that's my life right there low standards ya know to try to try something never done before you know what's your max set of seven with incline dumbbell press no clue right what's your max that is what's your max set of three sets of seven with one-minute rest on incline dumbbell for us you have no idea or machine or like you can get excited and you kind of make it anything you start to kind of make it into a little bit of a game and that's where it gets to be really fun oh yeah last time I tried this I did I think I only did 95 pounds I'm gonna try a hundred pounds I'm try 105 pounds and at first a lot of those things will go up and up and up and up and after a while they will dissipate but you can always think of well maybe I'm gonna try sets of 25 today just cuz I've never done it before so what what about you Chris all the hard knocks you've learned what's the what's the advice for the person listening to this who like wants to get stronger and doesn't want to be intimidated when they walk in the weight room yeah the number one thing for me that really changed my life altogether is my diet you know like what I put in my mouth affected what I did in the gym and I did never saw that correlation when I was younger because I just ate like crazy and was a power lifter but I can really see now that every competition that I won once I moved to California so I explained to you before we were even on the podcast I was telling me when I moved to California in 1993 I met up with a group of power lifters one of them was Mike O'Hearn and other one was my friend Ron fedko who is a maniac and he was a so Ron fedko was a power lifter he was getting as a degree in applied mathematics at UCLA getting his PhD and now he's the head of the computer science department at Stanford this guy would bench Pratt he benchpress 526 with no bench shirt he squatted 804 something like that and that lifted like he's close to eight something like that at 198 and when he met me he said to me you're too fat you need to lose weight like like one of the first things he said to me when I was like hey it was really weird stuff to in your life I said I wonder he told us about like the mitochondria and stuff oh yeah way back like my red blood cells are way off I should build a press that four more reps relate what yeah he's always like Ben she's 25 for 64 reps maniac so anyway he totally smart one of the first things he said was like you're you know you're just too fat to be a good power lifter like he just had no he's rough around the edges yeah rough around the edges but is like it you know but if you lost weight you'd be pretty good I have no idea how to like really lose weight I've been I've been trying to lose weight that's why I'm in the gym the entire time from the day I stepped in the gym my goal was to lose weight and I never been able to until I figured out this keto diet you know were you yes oh use you talked about how you were chubby as a kid Chris mark were you chubby as a kid I was fat too

[01:11:25] I got fat around I got fat around thirteen and continued to build because we didn't know anything about eating everything we ate was snack Wells and granola bars any weight is that bad yeah okay I was a little bit more in the middle I guess but like you know by around 16 years old I was like 240 pounds but I was like kind of saying a big kind of big and fat and then you know I started learning more because he was picking up stuff relaying information to me and then I started to kind of slim down and get in better shape but when I met Ron in 93 and I the very first thing he said was like hey go get a piece of paper and write down everything I said so I ran and did it I got the paper I was all excited I'm 23 years old getting information from this with great power lifter and he just says red meat and water and I write it down

[01:12:10] I'm going okay and what else that's it that's your diet red meat and water I don't even want to see you chewing a stick of gum and I was kind of scared of Ron so of course I didn't even chew a stick of gum and I went for like two or three weeks on no carbs just literally ground beef this is before grass-fed beef was even a thing I don't I don't think you'd be able to find it if you had to it was those big fat was around back then yeah those big fat tubes of beef the five pounder testing and I would just cut bone doors on and I did that for a couple weeks and lost like over 20 pounds won the powerlifting competition that I went into and then continued to do that down to like 198 weight class and the next meat after that I'd started around 240 and got all the way down under 198 and how much strength did you lose and when you rose 40 pounds you actually got strong way stronger yeah way stronger and the the thing is so because I lost weight I was able to grab the bar now I was able to squat better right I was able to get down to the bar and so it was hard doing like losing the weight and getting there but once

[01:13:14] I got there I was I stayed relatively strong but my biggest problem was that for some reason there wasn't any research on a keto diet back then there wasn't any research at all on a there was research but I didn't know how to get to it you know especially the internet wasn't even around 1993 right so barely around what I did was I I stopped doing it because I was I was afraid that the diet I didn't know anything about it I thought we needed carbohydrates I thought we needed so for me the biggest lesson I learned was that

[01:13:45] I should have never got off the original you know Kido slash carnivore diet that worked really well for me I'd gotten off of it for like 10 or 15 years until getting back on it more recently in the past two years but I feel like those years in between we're lost I feel like I ruined him I feel like because I wasn't optimizing my training along with my diet that had kind of wasted those years you know if someone said to you hey I want to learn how to squat but I can't come to you and your gym what do you point them to me and I typically point people to videos that repeat Oh makes yeah like who who are you liking on YouTube do you have instructional stuff on there he's got a lot yeah I have over 3,000 videos on YouTube so we you know we have a whole media team and we pump out a lot of a lot of him for the most exciting thing is that he's got videos from Idi cone on there had cold ice water ever you know and videos from

[01:14:36] Stan efforting strongest raw power lifter ever you know one thing I'm mark Roberto did really well is and people will bash him because they don't like there's a lot of people don't like the way that he squats but really what he's trying to do is he's trying to show you a universal way to squat and people are like I don't a very safe way to squash yeah yeah yeah it is very safe a lot of people say all he's leaning over way too much well most people can't squat in an upright position they just don't have them ankle mobility the hamstring mobility he's just trying to she's trying to to in a five minute segment mm-hmm tell everyone how to squat and I think people lose in lucite if people the benefit of the doubt CrossFit is a great place for people to start you know so that's interesting because there's some people that argue the opposite right which is CrossFit tries to take relatively untrained people and get them to do Olympic lifting and even when you look at Olympic lifters they don't do that much Olympic lifts I'll say there has never in the history of the world has there been a better fitness program and what CrossFit puts out nobody spends more time and more money on what they put together I know because

[01:15:39] I've been on the on the back end of it I've seen I've seen what they do I've seen what they do with their website I've seen what they do with all the different things I'm not even a CrossFit nut I don't even care about CrossFit really to be honest with you one thing I don't like that they do is the gymnastics element with adults is kind of a weird thing just because it's so hard to learn as you're older but so what it's a deeper and stronger challenge right but when you start to learn that they spend millions and millions of dollars obviously they make millions and millions of dollars but when they spend millions and millions of dollars setting up a fitness contest that has over 200 thousand participants and it narrows it down to the number one man and number one female in the world I think that that's [ __ ] awesome and that's one of the coolest human studies that's going on they also come in a little Tricia's that's when you go on the back end of their website if you try to take one of those coaching courses you will get absolutely slaughtered I don't care how much you know about fitness you'll get destroyed in that it is so hard to try to figure out how to like referee some of these things or how to even answer some of these questions that are on there they have done an amazing job and I know that they're reaching out to a lot of leading researchers when it comes to the nutrition aspect I know they used to have Rob Wolfe and they kind of have moved around a little bit I'm not sure if you ever spoke with them but I know some others that have and they do a good job of investigating and poking around and finding the right thing I'm not saying it's the answer for everybody but if you are somebody that just has no clue on where to start I'd recommend try a CrossFit box because they're everywhere they're all over the place also understand that your first experience may not be great just like if you went to a therapist or you went to a health care professional like they might suck right so I go and try another spot go and try somewhere else you should typically find that they're very encouraging the environment is very encouraging they want you to act sighs they want you to get better their their business model isn't that of a huge change in weather like we just want you to sign up for 20 bucks and never see again so I think CrossFit offers a lot teaches people how to squat teaches people how to deadlift I do wish that they paid a little bit more attention to people trying to gain muscle a little bit more like a little bit more bodybuilding stuff but they keep evolving and they keep moving with the times let's actually talk a little bit about that because you're in the process of doing exactly what you just described you're training for a bodybuilding competition that's probably by the time this podcast come out the bodybuilding competition will have already taken place because it's in a few weeks but you know I was saying before we started this I think you and I Chris we were just playing patty-cakes in the kitchen and I was like no I was like there are a few things I know less about than bodybuilding now which isn't to say that growing up I wasn't obsessed with it right like I freaking had every copy of every magazine I had pictures of Lee

[01:18:38] Haney all over my wall obviously I know every single line of pumping iron includes all the outtakes so you know enough no no I mean I know that but the point is I don't know anything about how to like make a person big like if someone came to me and said Peter I want to get jacked what should I do my answer would be I have no clue like I don't I think it involves what you eat and how you lift but that's about all I know so to me this is like a super interesting art so what have you guys learned about this and I want to specifically hear what you're doing first things first I would say a lot of body builders and a lot of people that are into bodybuilding get their start because they start lifting for football or baseball or boxing or whatever they're whatever else they're doing they start like lifting weights for to get prepared for something else and then they get bit by the bodybuilding bug so

[01:19:24] I think powerlifting is a great place to start for most people and I think it's where most people do start it's sort of late start I started benching for football and then I started squatting anime you know next thing you know I was in the bodybuilding so I think like a great way to just dive in and and get started is through some sort of lifting program that might aid something else that you're trying to do that way you're also killing two birds with one stone you're getting better at weight you're trying to do and then you know who knows this might be something that you enjoy and want to pursue and our lifting to me is I don't think I'd ever let my kids box I just I feel fortunate that I got out of it alive - the IQ points I don't have but I would love it if each of my kids at least spend some time powerlifting because whatever you go to do later in life you will have correctly learned the mechanics of the most important movements in the human body which primarily come down to tied down in your area San Diego is named Jeff Martin oh yeah Jack CrossFit kids okay he started yet like dissolve the name of yeah and now it's called X Brand

[01:20:29] X something but anyway so yeah his thing is great awesome he's got all these kids involved in powerlifting right so I went mark it's awesome marks company slingshot they sent me down to San Diego with a camera and said go film this powerlifting meet for kids and it was all kids from like I think ages like seven or eight up to like 15 and out of everything we've done on that channel and everything we did what marks YouTube channel that was the most fun I've ever had just hanging out with kids that were like you know between the ages of 8 and 15 and having them say mark bell changed my life he wasn't able to make it he had it like something else going on that day at the gym but to go there and be able to interview those kids and I would say ah Mark's brother they would get so excited that I was marched brother it's like no way you know mark my kids my brother like no way you grew up with him and to me it's like the joy of seeing these kids get involved in powerlifting was just exciting you know I did a seminar there and it was incredible to see the way these kids can move I was like oh my god I was like really apprehensive about doing the seminar cuz it's like what is that going to look like I go to all these CrossFit boxes and I get asked to come in and teach a seminar on how to squat bench and deadlift and takes me hours and hours on end because it's very very difficult to teach people how to squat meaning to teach adults how to squat who heaven who are tight in the hips yeah tight in the hips maybe they don't have a lot of experience lifting or they just have bad experience lifting and they haven't learned enough yet getting with these kids was crazy though I was so shocked their form on everything was impeccable I was like holy [ __ ] because he runs a tight ship down there he has the kids the first thing that you see when you walk in is first of all it says parents please wait outside for your child they don't allow the parents to hang out in there if you want to come and check the place out for a minute to make sure there's not a bunch of creepers around you obviously you can but they want you to drop your kid off there the end the second thing that you see is there's a room where kids go and they do their homework and so it sends a message like you know you're you're stopping here first you're gonna do your homework first we're gonna check in with you make sure you got all your stuff done then we're gonna go lift weights you gotta really have a feeling his kids are gonna end up at this Ramona so when I I remember when I saw my boy who I saw I have a one-year-old and a four-year-old and then I who are both boys and then I got a ten-year-old girl or almost ten-year-old and the boy who's four because he still isn't in school meaning he's only in like you know whatever like goof off school he doesn't actually never sits in a chair who fought school so anytime I watch him squat to pick something up I go whoa stop there I gotta get a picture yeah as it's like form is great the form is it's ridiculous years heels are down knees are open oh my god that hurt it's like he looks like a little powere he looks like a little Hercules yeah and then conversely my daughter who used to be able to do that now you know she's whatever just finished fourth grade her squats worse than mine like her form is horrible when I say Olivia get down and squat for me that's something I I look at all the time and I say how do we how do we maintain that in our children like huh I wish I could have maintained that and I think that that's something that somebody needs to figure out well I mean

[01:23:38] I think the answer is we're born with it is the first yeah sure we are all born knowing how to hip hinge exactly I would argue that sitting is the thing that cripples us it's a big part and so - how do you maintain it well you can't eliminate sitting but you can minimize it right so if every kid had a standing desk in school for example that's a step in the right direction because most of that sitting comes at school and then secondly it's like how you teach people the types of exercises to do there's people working on the standing best thing our friend Kelly Starrett is leading that charge Kelly and juliet's -

[01:24:08] Rhett yeah leading the charge to have kids have standup desks and they're doing programs where they're raising money to make that happen do you know Kelly Starrett mobility while he's a CrossFit guy and they've they've had great success they find kids do better in school and they stand to you know so they've been another big element of you know having children progress with some of those things rather than go backwards would be to simply have the physical education you know have a little bit more emphasis than it does it used to a real physical education and that and now you can't really do it anymore kids can't do pull-ups or push-ups or run a mile and everyone should remember the president should be able to do some version of that I'm not saying everyone should be like super proficient at it but you know when you start in kindergarten you learn your ABCs you start to learn some math and as you keep progressing your English progresses your math progresses you learn more stuff about history starts out with like George Washington and you progress to learn more about American history and so on but when it comes to the physical education not much really changes it's like it just is like playing and then it goes into like a little bit more stuff and it just completely fizzles out and now it's a lot of times not even in school anymore maybe we just have that presidential physical fitness thing right yeah actually was like a program that made sense but then they just completely like discontinued that kind of stuff and I I think that like getting kids to be active if they're at school all day and then like gym class is like nobody wants to get dressed for gym class and nobody does anything a lot of times kids out for take the kids out for a walk or something you know all around with a kid

[01:25:44] I would kick a ball around the cake that I mean if they're five six seven I do this it's not gonna turn that then with with my daughter when she comes in the gym with me in the morning cuz it in San Diego I did workout at home and one of the things I've got her doing which is a competition is what's her how long can she dead hang you know Jenna and she's you know I forget what her record is now but it's like you know the first time she did it she could only hold seventeen seconds or something like that and now she's like over two minutes dead hanging really yeah and you know she's light as a feather yeah but that's still pretty cool right so so now I hang for two minutes I die after 30 the fact that she's getting an idea of what that's doing to well and the funny thing that I love about doing it is explaining to her the mental fitness so that time she failed at 17 seconds she just went from hanging to failing and I was like Olivia

[01:26:31] I didn't even see you shaking I didn't see you suffering when the hell is going on here like yeah yeah like I don't think you understand the purpose of this exercise you are trying to test the limit of what you're capable of by definition that is going to hurt and the other thing this is funny maybe I was wrong and actually is interesting a kid does super healthy because sometimes in an in competition a kid may be more discouraged to swim next to the other kid next to them because they're like I don't I just think if I try harder I'm not gonna get any further ahead than kids still gonna whup my ass in this it's just her versus her which is cool yeah and and then I even should once she started to get the bug in her and she wanted to do it every day she would go in and do it and I was like look Olivia you got to take a couple days off like if you really want to hit this you need to rest and recover a little bit and we'll start planking and doing all those other things so you know I hope Calibri of major electrolytes and we need to get you really want to do this we're gonna push it you can be the Olympic hanging champion so what your first experience with bodybuilding was when now this is it this is your 31 years old so I'm dying to know like can I not look like a pathetic guy like what would I need to do if I want it to be half as jack'd as you bodybuilding is amazing you can make changes really really rapidly make changes really really fast for me I'm very fortunate I'm around a lot of people that have a lot of great information and so I have the ability to have some accelerated success with with the amount of people that are surrounding me in this in this effort but the diet is interesting the cardio is interesting we're in a country that's so fat that there's like studies that show that cardiovascular training is bad for you shows are like it increases your estrogen in your cortisol so much you can't release fat I mean just some of these things are it's really it's really it's really crazy to think that people are trying to even study something like that when you look at bodybuilding bodybuilders for years have done these certain things very specific ways and it works time and time and time again it just continues to work every single time bodybuilders are you know partially responsible or probably largely responsible for ketogenic diet even sticking around the first place because they we'll always introduce some form a low-carbohydrate living that's how I learned about it many years ago but the discipline to do all the things that you don't want to do when you normally don't want to do them is really really powerful stopping yourself from eating extra Jay Cutler came into our gym recently he's four-time mr. Olympia and he said on a podcast that he can you explain to people what the difference is between mr. Olympia and any other bodybuilding cop yeah the the mr.

[01:29:19] Olympia contest is the biggest Superbowl yeah that's what our what Arnold Schwarzenegger was that's what he was the same famous for during the eights and those guys so you know this isn't just some schmuck this is uh this is the world I and the best bodybuilder for four years yeah he said he ate seven times a day and I just sat there and went wow that's a lot of dedication to eat seven times a day it means you know all your meals are prepped and everything and he said he ate the same food at the same time every single day he did his cardio at the same time he did his weight lifting at the same time he would go tanning at the same time he would get a hot tub get a massage and so on and go to sleep all you knows all these things were regimented out so that way he never skipped a beat in that way he could be precise that way he could be the best as he was talking about all these things I kept kind of dwelling on that 7:00 meal thing because I've tinkered with some intermittent fasting and I've teetered with some different things but I was fixated on that I'm like as I got into this bodybuilding stuff I started asking some other guys

[01:30:23] I'm like well can you do this you can do that they're like no I'm like oh I I can have like I'm supposed to have like 150 carbs a day 65 grams of fat 350 grams of protein I'm like can I just have like a hundred grams of protein in one shot and have like a big steak meal they're like no and I'm like trying to figure out all these loopholes or like there's no loopholes this is the way it's gotta be it's 50 grams of protein at every meal for seven meals that's 350 grams of protein that's what you're supposed to do and so I finally got it through my fat head that's what I'm supposed to do but these things are lined up in a very specific manner now when I went and started try to look and poke around and figure out how many times a day the average person eats it was 15 times a day because there's so much snacking yes there's so much snacking and I just never I never even thought about it but

[01:31:17] I'm like I'm on a diet all the time I'm always trying to lose weight and boy do I sabotage the [ __ ] out of myself because I do that all the time I'll grab you know and it's stuff that's you know within this reasonable healthy menu almonds are oh cheese stick and you think you're so hungry and you think you need it to recover and you think you need it to be jacked but you just don't you can actually handle eating a lot less than you're currently eating is one thing to know and you can actually handle a lot more training now I'm not trying to suggest that you just get in this crazy mode of overtraining and develop you know body dysmorphia and all these things but I do think you could probably push yourself a lot further than you know currently and when you if you go from not implementing bodybuilding stuff to implementing bodybuilding stuff it makes a huge difference I know you've been on Joe

[01:32:14] Rogan's podcast we've been fortunate enough to be on this podcast as well he's the perfect example he takes somebody like that already has a good structure or yourself and you mentioned kettlebell training and mentioned some different things you know you were speaking with Daniel Rago and telling him some of the things that you've been doing I know and Daniel knows because we trained with Michael Hearn that if you implemented some body building stuff or not even some body building stuff if you if you just embraced body building period you'd be able to look so much different four weeks from right now so give me an example like a practical example you're probably up your protein - that's a usually one I don't know what it is now so I can't really say that but right now I'm in ketosis so my protein is pretty low it's probably about a hundred grams a day yeah you probably want more like 1.7 so the science that

[01:33:01] I've heard you know 1.7 grams per kilogram of bodyweight will elicit muscle growth right so we need at least that much for me it's 135 grams so I think it's just like finding that number sticking to that number and like Mark said incorporate some body building stuff for me the changes with extra protein happened immediately and like he'll tell you just changed it was like one day I was skinny fat and next day I was muscular and it was kind of kind of like that but you can is is this rule of 50 grams per meal times the seven meals I mean presumably that's because amino acids have a relatively short residence and you've got to kind of keep the exposure to those things high for a longer period of time right and I at least get the hypertrophy right right and that's specifically for me that's for my body weight that's for the energy expenditure that's for my age with a general understanding of so what do you know maybe taking a step back is I don't know weigh 230 pounds but you're getting close to competition so is you want to show up at the competition weighing what you personally I'm just gonna kind of end up where I end up but I would imagine it would be another ten there'd probably be another eight to 10 pounds of actual weight loss before now and then and they'll probably be another five to ten pounds of water weight that's dropped I don't really know what they have in store but I guess to made your body fat percent will be on the day of oh I don't have any idea but I think

[01:34:24] I'll probably weigh about 215 pounds or 210 pounds I think actually really the lower the lower that I weigh I feel like the bigger that I'll probably look without getting you know getting out of hand with that I'll go in at the peak of your building phase before you begin this taper how much did you weigh I didn't have one because I was just kind of just came straight out of powerlifting and yeah I just kind of got shoved into it because I was I was dropping some weight but I was probably about 240 245 so that's that's what I'm talking about it's a difference it's only been it's only been about 10 pounds but it's crazy because like even just on my youtube channel we posted a video a few days ago but it's from about three about two three weeks ago when I started all this since me working on some posing

[01:35:09] I just flat out look fat you know compared to now obviously not well how that but it's just fat flat out look fat yeah mark is like he said he's got he's in a position where he can talk to some of the best people in the world about training diet and nutrition and what he was doing was a podcast with Hani ROM bod who is the nutritionist for Phil Heath who's

[01:35:30] I said Phil wean will win last year yeah so he's now won seven consent item great and how many did Ronnie Coleman win eight eight that's the most have you seen Ronnie Coleman's documentary I know that it's like I should mention that because it was a really great Haney story as only well maybe one seven Oh Diddley went eight you're right eighty-four to ninety one and then Yates one like cigs both those guys one eight yeah so marks working late honey rambha who's helping him do his diet and stuff which i think is amazing to be able to have access to like the top people in the world and he was working the other day with Charles glass doing posing and Charles is known as the godfather of bodybuilding he's at

[01:36:10] Gold's Gym every day he trained Dexter Jackson for the 2008 you know mr. Olympia contest as well as like a ton of like o'herns an amazing person to you know hard helping us both a lot you hear different things about the guy but he just he trains at four o'clock in the morning he wakes up at about 2:30 he eats at 3:00 he makes sure he gets his ass to the gym when he gets when he gets to the gym he's not full of like motivational talk or anything like that but a lot of times one of his first questions will be would you eat this morning and if somebody says they didn't eat anything he's just kind of he doesn't even really say anything he just kind of like walks off but he's just kind it's it's almost like oh I guess you're not all in you know I guess you're not I guess you're not as into this as I thought because this is this is the method that we're going to use so the nutrition is clearly important and and I mean if there's one thing that's clear and everything you're saying it's just how empirically wise this this sport is right I can't even heat at a restaurant because I can't afford to have any oil or it can't I mean there cannot be I can't have a day where I have a hundred and twenty grams of fat it's I'm supposed to have you know 65 grams of fat in a day and for some reason something was off and I had 70 or 80 it wouldn't be the end of the world but I'm supposed to wait by buying percentage of macro what percentage of your calories are protein fat carbohydrate right now I don't really know that Danny would have to run the math over there but Daniel 3:50 in protein 65 grams of fat and 150 grams carbohydrates sometimes the carbohydrates are up a little bit from there but fats are 65 and you said the carbs 135 150 awesome math mom but uh you know it's like I said it's very specific and carbohydrates just to try to clear everything up for people that are listening so I know your Aikido proponent and we love the ketogenic diet ketogenic diets always worked really well for me because it's allowed me to keep control over the amount of food that I eat it's one of the few things that has burned off my hunger it's one of the few things that have burned off my cravings it's it's the only thing that has ever done that before we're in the bodybuilding site oh hang on 2600 calories what's the percentage is the macros we're getting some information from Daniel array go off screen here for those that are interested oh yeah yeah what's a peter want to know the macros for the the fats probably so its 2600 calories is what you're saying not a whole lot of calories but you know one thing on that is I don't feel deprived at all I feel like I'm eating because I'm eating every two and a half three hours and everyone keeps talking about how brutal it is now hard it is and I know that it'll get worse cuz you do start to calorie restrict and they you know everyone says like the last two weeks kind of feel like a zombie but I've been feeling really good and as I mentioned earlier the progress is the motivation is every day I see something new or different on

[01:39:10] I mean I'm like wow I just didn't even have any idea I could do any of this I've tore both my biceps I tore my PEC three times I tore my hamstring I've torn a bunch of stuff and I never tried to consider to really body build because I was like man if I died down I'd look weird because I've torn all that [ __ ] off my body people kept asking them for years when are you gonna do a show you should get you know you're getting lean and kind of thought I was done I was done powerlifting I didn't have a lot of direction and wasn't sure what I was gonna do next and so this challenge came it came at a perfect time and I don't that challenge came from a podcast with

[01:39:45] Hani right yeah he was like it was on his podcast and he said well why don't you do a show you look great well he said yeah he said he said it even more than that he was like I signed you up for one yeah you're doing it so where does the ketogenic diet makes sense for the bodybuilder what phase of you know is it when they're trying to get leaner yeah I see so for force for some of the like pro bodybuilder guys the ketogenic diet probably doesn't play into anything they really want to mess around with unless they've been destructive for a while with their behavior like if they if they have eaten if they've gone way off the rails and eaten but a pro doesn't do that professional bodybuilder somebody who's being serious who's trying to win money at these shows they would not be somebody that would be doing that so they wouldn't even need to utilize a ketogenic diet where a ketogenic diet would play into where it would really help even somebody like myself former fat kid is it will help me to kind of continue to tighten up and it will also give me some mental freedom I think one of the worst things you can ever do whether it's business or any aspect of your life lifting is get stuck in one thing because you thought at a time you're focused in on that one thing and you can't see anything else and so if you were always just doing a bodybuilding diet and if you were always utilizing cardio for 45 minutes every day all these things would become less effective so where the ketogenic diet can come in you could utilize the ketogenic diet to become technically works out pretty good on paper but I know how it works in theory would be you could become more sensitive to carbohydrates by dumping in a ketogenic diet at certain points and changing up the style of exercise that you do for a while did bodybuilding competitions obviously Olympia is not a drug regulated condition correct yeah so you can't compete at that level without lots of drugs alright what about at the level outside of Olympia so like this competition you're doing today is it considered a drug-free competition I don't even know much about I've never even been to a bodybuilding show so this is all very new to me I've only caught the tail end of a bodybuilding show at the Arnold Classic where you know I went to go see Bryan Shaw and some of the bodybuilding stuff was finishing up and it was it was impressive I mean it was it was pretty crazy to see those guys because there's some of the best that's effectively the Olympic level it says that that's Olympia level body but you got Dexter Jackson up there is 51 or 52 years old I mean there's some real savages there but uh yeah I don't even know like I I know the posing I've been working on that but I don't know like the categories and I barely know so for this competition are you using anabolic steroids or diuretics or any of the other sort of aids that one would you know as as in bigger stronger faster you know I talked about utilizing him from the time I was 25 I've been using them you know I've been I say in the movie I'm gonna probably be on and off from the rest of my life and that's what I believe it's direction I chose when you choose a certain thing and you like the result of it like I don't feel like there's any reason to go back and for me for now as well you know I get it prescribed which is a kind of added bonus to making sure that it's like I guess more on the up and up but to me doesn't really make any difference whether you grab it from some dude at the gym or whether you get it from a doctor I actually think that the

[01:43:11] I think that uh you know there's they're not gonna be all that regulated anyway no matter no matter how you slice it but but what are the again I don't know anything about how bodybuilders use steroids what are the what are the in body mass is the main thing so people get confused about what they actually do people get confused about what steroids do I think people think that's that steroids automatically make you strong and they don't necessarily automatically make you strong what they do in most cases is they allow people to gain more weight now there's some cases where people don't gain a whole lot of weight and they do gain strength but if you don't continue to gain weight at some point that strength will only level up so much so when you introduce steroids steroids don't multiply on top of themselves they only work to a certain level so you're you're on level one with your lifting and you progress and your genetics and everything allow you to get to level four you take steroids and maybe over a period of time it's like level six but you're still not going to be able to get to level eight nine or ten or these guys like Jay Cutler and some of these mammoth people are because of their genetics because of their environment as children because of x y&z probably just never gonna be able to level up to their potential but which is an important distinction because a lot of people your starting point so yeah well a lot of people look at you know let's just pick Phil Heath because he's the best in the world today and you think it's all drug it's all drugs but I don't think people understand like I could inject a human being with every anabolic steroid period beat like let's get the world's supply of anabolic steroids and injected into me yeah I couldn't look 1/10 of what that guy looks like right and the best coaching and the best whatever is people like to make things easy and simplify it and they can't come close to Phil Heath they can't even you know come close even with a ton of drug so they just want to say oh it's just steroids it's not it's not like oh this guy works harder this guy's better and I do think that steroids cloud the sport I do I do think that if there was a way to get steroids out of the sport that it could be more popular across the mainstream however well are the reason why it has become more popular because they do have like men's physique and they got some of these different categories now where you're seeing you're seeing more men and it's gotten more more mainstream with some of that stuff there's body types don't look as crazy right and now there's a category called classic physique and it's like it's interesting because like in the very first year of classic physique my friend Danny Hester he won mr. Olympia classic physique he's about a hundred and ninety pounds he looks awesome he's always he always looks awesome he's about my height 190 jacked shred it looks amazing and then the next year the guy that wins it's like 240 you know I mean he like this is not classic like yeah like what happened to the the little guys that were in great shape you know and the guy that won looked he looked amazing but it's and it's a different look than the bigger bodybuilders but it's not like an it's not yet a natural thing it's not like one guy's natural one guy's on it's like they're just on different levels right yeah so classic doesn't mean drug-free it means you're trying to produce a phenotype that is eternal warts measures is like what's funny is like now they have a category Arnold Schwarzenegger was mr. Olympius seven times he was considered in the Guinness Book of World

[01:46:26] Record the greatest male physique which is just okay but couldn't win a California body built that's what I'm saying can't win anymore like it so so they if you look like Arnold you classic physique now yeah which is kind of crazy so what's your favorite 70s 80s bodybuilder Frank Zane Mike münster Mike mentor yeah and Arnold Arnold's a really big influence manatorian Yates - you know we blood and guts a lot of that was my use like he was later right 90s oh yeah and men sir and Yates actually have quite a bit in common it was like they train they train together - and I trained with Mike men sir when I first came out here when I moved out here in 93 like you see people at the gym and your meathead first thing I did was I'm training with Mike men sir yeah I don't care he blew out my knee because he had me do these crazy squats in the squat machine and it messed up my knee for like six months but it's I still had got to train with him that which was cool but at the time I got to train with him I showed up at the gym and he was outside smoking a cigarette and he's all fat and there was this like oh this is Mike mentor now this is what he is you know and it's like you know you a lot of times in life especially me I've met all my heroes and pretty much everybody's let me down so it's just the way life is have you ever met a hero that where they exceeded your expectation um I don't know let me see have we yeah we have many times I'm sure I'm sure we have known yeah Edie cone Jay Cutler Stone Cold

[01:47:51] Steve Austin's one of my favorite people in the entire world he's be so intelligent Joe Rogan's [ __ ] he's so well researched like he just he's just awesome to be around like there's there's people like that I think we're we a Cutler was like Ronnie the rock is an amazing dude like when you meet the rock you're like well it's all probably just an act but the rock will look you in the eye shake your hand and say how's your mom doing like and he means it you know you could you know feel that he means it and and that's important especially when you're that big of a celebrity and stuff like that you know one of the things I struggle with and I was actually talking about this a little bit when I was on Joe

[01:48:25] Rogan's show I've been pretty vocal and open about my view that once I really spent like five years learning everything there was to learn about anabolic steroids I came to the conclusion that well I can't speak to what happens in bodybuilding because I think that takes it to a different level but certainly within the level of how they're used in cycling or you know more physiologic levels of use can't see any evidence of harm now EPO is different you can certainly take too much EPO and cause problems but once you start talking about testosterone stanozolol augs Andra loan these drugs that are typically used in sports again

[01:49:02] I was having a very hard case give you I'll show you right here my tricep it's torn I was bench pressing 455 after it my triceps hurt a little bit they were sore and then I popped my tricep I've never been hurt lifting in my entire life at the time I was on a ton of juice so you're so naive that you just didn't have the tendon strength yes early and I attribute that to steroid use for sure 100% so to say that there's no ill effects of them or no side effects or no yeah I guess I'm thinking more of the cardio metabolic yeah liver kidney cardio Mel well can you injure yourself you know I

[01:49:35] Joey Diaz one of my favorite people in the world he's hilarious he says he's like you see these guys in the gym and they're like fifty years old and they used to take steroids enough it's like like a bag of [ __ ] you know it's like I I kind of agree with that statement to that there are a lot of people that have taken steroids and abuse them and gotten really crappy skin and crappy like just you know things that uh that don't look good not aesthetic and probably not healthy I'm sure that they've driven a lot of people's blood in a bad direction which could which could lead to other things possibly right but but not definitely so

[01:50:09] I think that's where we're looking at like the detrimental effects of steroids would be among its like among the users that are losers if that makes sense it's like it's among the users that aren't paying attention to everything else yeah and I guess under medical supervision though when you're again doing these things within physiologic doses which is pretty different than what the average person is doing we're talking like something not a doctor would prescribe yeah it's like you well you know for example you take somebody who's testosterone is like two standard deviations below the mean and you revert them back to the mean or median level of testosterone if we're going in that respect I would have to go back and say that you're a hundred percent right I haven't seen anything like even a muscle hair on a normal dose but I was I was using pretty good doses I'm thinking well I was at the time I was using trend bolon and I was using testosterone together and I was taking some other orals it was like right after I got out of rehab them like I gotta get jacked you know and like and it's funny because they tell you in a a that if you're on steroids it affects you from the neck up and you're not allowed to take them so people got on my case about and how much to steroids just two hundred milligrams a week I've only stuck to the two hundred milligrams I never really went above that because I never wanted to get like puffy you know which is interesting cuz I don't think I've if I've ever replaced a person's testosterone which have done many times exogenously for patients who are low I've never had a patient that high and then 200 is not high from a performance stand I've seen guys show up look what is it usually a hunter I mean yeah if I'm gonna start a patient again I have it's much more complicated I need to know their sex and we're binding globulin their estrogen yeah free testosterone is really what we're trying to fix but very unusual that I would ever start a patient anything more than 50 milligrams twice a week it's interesting because everybody

[01:51:56] I know is on the same goes the same doctor has the same dose so it's existent well and again it's a very different it's a very different thing I'm where I trying to optimize forming my interest in replacing testosterone is resolving insulin resistance preserving muscle mass like it's a it's interesting that you say that and it actually gives me a lot more confidence in going to somebody talking to somebody like you is like I just know almost everybody that's on testosterone they all take 200 milligrams like I don't think I think

[01:52:25] I've once had a patient take a hundred twice a week so I think it was pretty high I think it when you're saying it is like oh wow you actually you actually don't give everybody the same dose you know first of all I don't even like I mean most of most patients that I need to replace testosterone in which is still a minority of patients I'm not using testosterone right my first goal is can you get them to end dajin ously make testosterone so you know the way I stand what are you utilizing to do that yeah so I start with the final thing I care about is free testosterone so a free testosterone is low and I define low as somewhere between one and two standard deviations below the mean of our reference range in the lab and symptomatic so you have to have these two things in my opinion so if the numbers low but I see no evidence of symptom meaning they're not having a difficult time maintaining muscle mass they don't have too much adipose tissue they're not insulin resistant libidos find all of these things then I don't believe in fixing the number but let's assume you have someone who's symptomatic and who's low so free testosterone is low the next question is is free testosterone low because testosterone is low or because sex and we're binding globulin is high because free testosterone which is what matters is proportional to testosterone and inversely proportional to sex and we're binding globulin so once you answer that question if sex one behind and globulin is too high you have to investigate why and there are really only four reasons for it insulin thyroid hormone estrogen and genetics so you you do your investigation you figure out what's going on if testosterone is too low the next question is is it too low because you're siphoning too much of your testosterone into either dihydrotestosterone DHT or estradiol yes or no if yes you can block both of those right you have 5 alpha reductase inhibitors you have aroma taste inhibitors if it's low not because you're siphoning too much away then the question is are you not producing enough and if you aren't producing enough are you not producing enough because you don't have enough DHEA which is a substrate or do you not have the pituitary signal is your FSH and LH to low so there are actually nine steps in understanding someone's testosterone and free testosterone level and we can actually impact every single one of those steps pharmacologically if we're trying to put this in service so so yeah it's it's a much different approach when you're doing it for medical manage this kind of blows my mind to because i'm theirs now so this is like you know you learn something new every day it's like

[01:54:42] I'm just used to people taking 200 milligrams of testosterone now you just turn me on to 9 different ways that I can increase it's like right you can give a person LH you can give them something that stimulates LH or FSH production so there's a there's a pre hormone that's a synthetic hormone that mimics well mimics basically an estrogen molecule at the hypothalamus that then tells the pituitary to make more FSH and

[01:55:04] LH that in many ways and now you're putting this in the practice clinically and you're seeing awesome results with it yeah and this is funny this is one of those things that we learned sort of from people who were doing this but it's now actually become I mean I would hesitate to say mainstream because I don't think people are fully mainstream and understanding this but now you're seeing this stuff published in medical literature that says hey there are really reasonable safe ways to increase a person's testosterone without even giving them testosterone well you can also starters than that even even without supplementation right there could be certain foods right there could be certain foods to avoid maybe maybe somebody does have a sound diet I mean a sound diet has to have to throw you out to me the first step in evaluating a male for hypogonadism which is just the technical term for low testosterone especially if the so this is a not uncommon finding the guy has low free testosterone but his estradiol is not too high his sex in Mumbai and globulin is not too high his DHT is not too high his DHEA is not too low he's not making enough testosterone but his FSH and LH are also low so what does this mean in

[01:56:08] English this means this guy's brain isn't making the signal to tell his body to make more testosterone despite the fact that his testosterone is low so that tells you where the problem is the problem is in the brain and the number-one diagnosis for that is sleep deprivation so when I finished residency my I don't I didn't measure free testosterone I only knew my total testosterone but it was 220 that was on a scale where 2 standard deviations below the mean was 350 yeah 2 standard deviations above the mean was 1,200 and

[01:56:45] I'm 220 yeah out of my hip replace when I was 49 that's where that's when I got on it yeah 49 you you I mean most women have a higher test on my doctor just said I don't know how you get out of bed yeah I don't know I just do yeah so in my case my testosterone went from 220 to about 650 by just sleeping once I went from not sleeping four hours a night boom that improves a lot of Americans are not sleeping because they're obese because they're heavy so if they could figure out a way to get momentum get the diet straightened out get to sleep a little bit better they could start heading in the right direction - yeah and the other thing is cortisol so if you have hypercortisolism packed testosterone production directly and indirectly what is hypercortisolism cortisol that's all this yeah in medicine we have to come up with fancy ways to say the short that makes so heal smarter so if you have too much cortisol one you have a you have a shunt right you have something called the pregnenolone shunt or steal where you start to steal pre-curved

[01:57:44] SURS of testosterone to make more cortisol so that's depleting you of substrate to make this but the I think perhaps the more the more sinister issue is these high levels of cortisol impair you from entering what's called delta-wave sleep which is where you make the FSH and LH to make the testosterone you only make this stuff when you're sleeping what about you know there's a lot of doctors that are like our prescribing stuff to people and they'll prescribe some of these cholesterol you know medications these statins yeah they're probably damaging right I mean some of these things are probably damaging towards just a natural male testosterone and and and even with the females and stuff aren't d'art these things kind of yeah I mean it's actually plaguing us a little bit too in theory you could make an argument that says if you take a statin which is inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and given that you need cholesterol to make sex hormones that should be depleting them but we don't actually see that in the data so even though I don't really know you don't actually see that now that doesn't mean that at extreme levels it won't show up I think I've been saying that for years well like it blocks your cholesterol and that's what make sure yeah it turns out that's probably overly simplistic the body's more complicated and more rigorous than we give it credit for so the body will prioritize its use of cholesterol for two things above all else which is forming cellular membranes because cholesterol is what gives a cell its fluidity membrane fluidity and then hormone production so particularly glucocorticoids and sex hormones so does that mean that you couldn't statin eyes a person into the next millennium end up suppressing no it doesn't you probably could but I think at the levels that most people are taking them the evidence would not actually suggest that we're inhibiting and dodging his testosterone production and I think like with what I do you know I was made the movie prescription thugs and then all set them like statins are bad like stay away right and then I listen to you talk and get a really intelligent conversation with dr. Ron Krause Ron Krauss right and you guys are all talking about statins the whole time like wait a second these guys don't know that they're bad and I'm like well these are the guys that actually know what they're talking about they treat people every day and so it kind of opened my mind back up to statins so I think like a lot of times when we're doing research trying to find out the truth or whatever like I was like ah statins are all bad and I just think all one-way and I'm trying to not think that way about things like where I'm thinking nothing's all bad nothing's all good and that's kind of the way to bring this thing full circle as we probably wrap up so we can let you guys get back to your day at the outset I said you kind of in many ways open my eyes to revisiting something that I just took for I just assumed was dogma steroids are bad if you have one milligram of testosterone sippin eight injected into a human being you will kill them that was my view and then I come away from bigger stronger faster and I'm like I don't maybe I got to rethink this yeah now it's not to say I have any understanding or expertise of how steroids are used in bodybuilding or things like that where I suspect they can still be harmful if it but certainly within you know medical physical levels to your life right now I honestly believe that anabolic steroids when used at physiologic levels are safer than tylenol yeah absolutely you know are far less toxic and frankly you know far less likely to lead into morbidity and so similarly maybe you'll leave this discussion thinking okay maybe it's not statins are all bad maybe this actually is they gotta have a time and a place overall overarching thing I've learned from making this movie about nutrition that Mark and I are working on right now is that nothing is all good and nothing is all bad and mark has been really illustrating that to me half as we go through he goes see carbs we're all bad right see they're all bad and it's like well no now I can see how you can use them as a tool right and then statins are all bad no no now we can see how we can use them as a tool we can keep people alive longer and certain people you might need this tool only for a couple weeks to get you to this point and then you can get off of it or whatever like it's it's allowed me to think more openly about everything that we put in our bodies and everything that we do to try to be better yeah that when we were inhaling some food before this and you shared your salmon with me which was fantastic by the way especially with that Himalayan sea salt that was damn good I can't take credit for life all the way to the Himalayas for that yeah the way if he cooked that up too so that was wonderful but that was a great example of I mean again I know you're in the midst of a bodybuilding competition prep but it was beautiful to just see how regimen it's like I'm gonna have this many grams of salmon I'm gonna have as many Japanese sweet potatoes and it's like you know what in this moment these molecules are the tool I need and I think that's the takeaway to me is a statin a carbohydrate or whatever it's a tool and and the key to me if you want to be a great carpenter in life which i think is should be are all of us should want to be the best carpenters in life is have the most tools know how to use each tool and know when to use each tool and when I have patients say to me dr. I am morally against fill in the blank

[02:02:42] I am morally against statins I am morally against supplements I am morally against XYZ I say okay I'll never force you or try to talk you into doing anything but that's sort of like a contractor coming to my house to rebuild it and me saying I just don't want you using the Phillips screwdriver or the saw you can do anything else but don't use those too that's strike can he still build the house of course but I've just taken away two tools and a lot harder and in the hands of a good carpenter that that you know that seems like a bad idea so you guys have opened my mind up to a set of tools known as steroids and open our minds up well very well open your mind guys we're so so tell me when's the doc gonna come out so we don't know I mean the one question I should just say a lot of people ask us when's it gonna come out and they also ask us like exactly what it's gonna be about or what we're trying to say I tell you I don't know either answer at all I have no idea so every film that I do is a journey I never know when it's gonna end it makes a lot of people that work with me Maddon and I just say well that's how I do it like if you go okay

[02:03:51] I'm gonna make this movie we're gonna film for six months and we're gonna edit for three months and then we're done and you you can do that that's like a way to to do it but I feel that for example mark and I started this movie he had no idea he was gonna do a bodybuilding show so but that's gotta be in the movie that's awesome that's like a really cool thing that's actually happening so what if I just decided like in the beginning of the movie when we first started filming I decided I only want to film this then we wouldn't have this whole bodybuilding thing which could end up being what adds a layer to it that makes it connect all the dots fodi totally makes it more nuance or whatever right so we don't really know but I would say that in general we're planning on it just coming out next year because we're not worried about it for this year and we're just planning on making the best thing that we can and so we like to encourage everybody like people send me a lot of information people give me a lot of tips and I'm open to all of it I listen I listen and read all my comments and everything because I'm open to whatever is gonna make the best film I'm not trying to set out to make one specific thing so between when this comes out and when this film comes out what is the best way for people to reach you Chris they can just find me on Instagram have big strong fast that's kind of the one thing that I check all the time so okay and what about you Mark Twitter - uh you can't get ahold of me as I've got too much [ __ ] to do but one thing I want to encourage everybody to do is really simple because nobody ever knows where to start and we don't get a lot of answers cuz people that are smart don't give you definitive answers because that's just the way it goes just try to start walking you know almost all of us are lucky enough to have the ability to put one foot in front of the other try to go for a 10-minute walk every day talk to your your son your daughter your mom your dad if they live close by or if you get a second with them do it after lunch do it after dinner preferably it'd be great if you can do it more than once once a day but it's just a great place to start a great way to clear your mind there's a lot of [ __ ] going on nowadays if you have an hour and a half or whatever it might be to be on Instagram all day you certainly can carve out ten minutes for yourself every day to go on a walk really really simple easy thing to do and because people aren't gonna be able to reach out to you directly they want to be able to take advantage of the amazing stuff you've already done what's your YouTube channel yeah it's the

[02:06:11] YouTube channel is super training oh six you can also check out at my Instagram which is at marks Millie Bell and you can also check out my website which has all my products a sling shot the hip circle some of the stuff you've seen which is Mark Bell slingshot calm and I wanted money as well one thing that we hadn't we haven't talked about but it'll leave it up to people to go watch it is my new film a leaf of faith which is about kratom that's right yep well we didn't really get to it but I'll

[02:06:38] I'll explain it really quick kratom is a plant that comes from Southeast Asia that a lot of people are using to get off of opioids and they're also using it just to feel better like for me every day I use it as a pre-workout just makes me feel great before I get in the gym I've gotten a lot stronger because of it

[02:06:56] I've gotten in better shape because I can focus better so a leaf of faith is available on iTunes it's available on google play youtube and amazon netflix all right it's on Netflix on August 27th and then when it comes out August 27th I think that's gonna be sort of the real launching point for it because with all my movies I put them on iTunes and they go around when it gets in Netflix that's when people start talking about it so I

[02:07:21] I'm a good segue into uh he and I have created a product together because we believe and create them so much it's helped us so much it's helped us manage pain has helped us to continue on our diets even sometimes in life you just need something else to do you need your mind to be a little bit distracted from your day-to-day grind and it's a great product it gives you some euphoria it's helped me with creativity in business and stuff like that and the products gonna be called mine bullet and you'll be able to get it at mine bullet comm all right so we're gonna link in the show notes to where people can find you

[02:07:54] Chris on social where they can see all the stuff you've put out I'm actually really excited to hear I didn't even realize I'm embarrassed to say that you had this YouTube channel with all of these videos because I'm always looking for ways if I can't plug one of my patients into a trainer that I trust to match them to correct mechanics I actually don't want them to just learn to squat on their own yeah I kind of want them to be able to see how it's done so this will be a great reference as somebody has contributed content to marks YouTube page I could say that he puts in more effort and time than a lot of people that I see that are putting out videos and they put out almost is it a video a day they crank out like a breakneck speed to like it's like a movie studio over there so he's just constantly cranking stuff out and it always features like all these people from the fitness industry that people love to see he's always got great information so I commend him as a filmmaker I'm giving my brother props for having a great we spend probably over a quarter million dollars a year just on our YouTube channels just to get information out there was over there it promotes the brand promotes the product but it's I really love trying to get that information out there to arm people give people you know give people information that they need anybody listening this podcast ever wants to come check out super training gym super training gym is free I can't always guarantee that I'm there but if you want to look up that Instagram it's at super training gym as well to hit up whoever answers questions on there and they will let you know if and when I'm around and then when you can come in but the gyms free in and of itself that it's just an unbelievable service guys I want to thank you both not just for your generosity and time today but obviously more importantly for all the work you guys have been doing over the past decade plus to share what you've learned with not just me so I'm personally grateful for that but obviously by extension many more people so well we recently grateful as well we're huge fans right back at ya and I love your podcast so I'm excited to be on it and be part of it well you guys are part of the inaugural set and if the podcast ends up sucking you guys will know that you were you manage to be in that exclusive sling wearing good companies I can go sucking vodka I'm alright thank you thank you thank you you can find all of this information and more at Peter
