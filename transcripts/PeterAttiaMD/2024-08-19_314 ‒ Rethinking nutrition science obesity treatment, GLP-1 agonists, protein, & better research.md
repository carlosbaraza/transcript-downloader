David Allison, a leading expert in obesity and nutrition, quantitative genetics, clinical trials, and research methodology, returns to The Drive to explore the evolving landscape of nutrition science and obesity treatment. In this episode, David begins by discussing the intricate relationship between nutrition, obesity, and body composition, emphasizing the multifaceted impacts of food beyond mere calorie intake. David provides a critical analysis of the complexities in nutrition research and their practical implications for tackling obesity. He critiques historical public health policies, addresses the trust issues plaguing nutrition science, and underscores the need for a paradigm shift to more effectively combat obesity. The conversation also delves into the rise of GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic and Mounjaro, exploring their ethical and practical considerations in obesity treatment. The episode concludes with an in-depth look at protein intake recommendations and highlights the significant research gaps that remain in the field.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The episode primarily focused on three main areas: the current state of obesity treatment (particularly GLP-1 agonists), the quality and reliability of nutrition science research, and protein intake/requirements. Dr. David Allison provided expert commentary on the challenges in nutrition science, the moral and practical implications of GLP-1 agonists, and the current understanding of protein requirements. The discussion highlighted the contrast between public health approaches to obesity (which have largely failed) and pharmaceutical interventions (which are showing unprecedented success).

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Public health interventions for obesity prevention have shown little to no meaningful impact according to recent Cochrane reviews [00:31:28]
- GLP-1 agonists are showing unprecedented success in obesity treatment [01:08:36]
- Traditional protein intake recommendations (0.8g/kg) may be too low for optimal health [01:43:15]
- No compelling evidence exists for upper limits of protein intake causing harm in healthy adults [01:55:10]
- Heart rate increases approximately 10 beats per minute in patients taking GLP-1 agonists [01:28:23]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal recommendations:
- Consider protein needs beyond minimum RDA requirements [01:43:15]
- Don't assume there's one "right way" to eat for everyone [01:52:06]

Context-specific recommendations:
- GLP-1 agonists may be appropriate for medical obesity but require careful risk-benefit analysis [01:25:38]
- Protein intake should be considered in context of individual goals (muscle gain, longevity, etc.) [01:41:50]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- Semaglutide (Ozempic) [01:08:36]
- GLP-1 agonist class drugs [01:08:36]
- Compounded versions of these medications [01:15:20]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
Limited discussion of exercise in this episode, though mentioned in context of protein requirements for athletes and active individuals.

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
- Discussion of protein requirements and optimal intake [01:41:50]
- Debate about protein timing and thresholds [01:45:20]
- Question of whether carbohydrates are needed with protein for anabolic effect [01:48:12]

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Heart rate and heart rate variability changes with GLP-1 agonists [01:28:23]
- Nitrogen balance studies mentioned in context of protein research [01:53:11]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Obesity and Energetics Offerings newsletter mentioned [02:02:19]
- Luke Van Loon's protein research referenced [01:40:00]
- Carolyn Summerbell's systematic reviews cited [00:31:28]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"There is no compelling evidence that any of this has had a meaningful impact" - regarding public health interventions for obesity [00:35:29]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Long-term safety data on GLP-1 agonists
- Optimal protein intake across different populations and contexts
- Role of GLP-1 agonists in sports and athletics

[00:00:00] and I think there's a lot of fear now among people who want Community intervention Public Health intervention who say I don't want our solution to obesity be let everybody get obese or let two-thirds of the population get obese and then we'll give them surgery or drugs for the rest of their life um it's too expensive it's not my ethos you etc etc um and I think they're worried that people like me who say look at the efficacy data we need to think about this more are implying that we should shut down all the other stuff and at least for me personally that answerers absolutely not true but I think we need subp Paradigm shifts within paradigms and what I mean by that is I don't think the Paradigm Shift of saying don't ever think about nutrition anymore only think about drugs and surgery is warranted I don't think the Paradigm Shift of saying don't ever think about Behavior

[00:00:57] Community intervention family intervention is warranted don't ever think about public health or policy that's not warant I don't agree with those at all what I do think we need to do is to say within the paradigms of behavior Community Family policy let's be honest let's look at Carolyn summer Bell's data and others and say there is no compelling evidence that any of this has had a meaningful impact you can cherry-pick here and there you can say this policy led to differences in how much of that food was purchased in this context even if that's true and sometimes those are a little shaky those conclusions say did it lower obesity rates and those have never been shown hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:56] AA David good to see you once again good to see you my friend um lots to talk about today uh the the world of uh nutrition and uh Health uh are are are always in the in the spotlight um in particular um around a class of drugs um that no listener to this podcast will be a stranger to uh called glp1 agonists um so I want to spend some time talking about those but I think before doing so I want to just maybe go back and talk a little bit about what we know and maybe don't know about the relationship between nutrition and obesity sure which sounds like it should be obvious so um tell us what you think is actually known about the relationship between food and body composition so I like the way you phrase the question and using the word body the phrase body composition as opposed to just obesity or weight there are obviously three different things obesity implies a threshold you're too much uh there's a judgment about uh the quanti or the the effects of the excess um then there's body composition the tissue how much is fat how much is lean where is the fat lean what is the fat composed of what is the lean composed of and then there's just weight which is just you know your your mass on this planet and those three things are highly related but not identical what we know indisputably and even people who sort of rail against something they call the energy balance model which you and I have discussed whether it's really a model is unclear it's really more of a constraint um it's really a restatement of the first law of thermodynamics which is the law of conservation that matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed but only converted it is a constraint by which all other descriptions of what happens with weight and mass and food intake and energy intake and energy expenditure must op operate it's not a description or an explanation of what happens it just says if you prescri uh if you describe any proposed explanation of what happens it's got to follow that first law of thermodynamics in order to make sense and that first law of thermodynamics in in the field of nutrition obesity often gets stated as something like changes in energy storage equal changes in energy intake minus changes in energy output or Delta energy stores equals Delta energy in minus

[00:04:31] Delta energy out food intake can affect those things alternatively you could say that energy intake is one of those things so it gets back to that descriptive thing now one of the questions becomes how does all the other aspects of food besides the mere energy content of it affect the amount of weight one gains or loses the body composition the tissues where they where the mass is distributed what types of tissues it's in composition of those tissues and then of course whether or not one exceeds some threshold there's every reason to believe that many many aspects of food from the marketing and pricing of it which then can influence the intake of it and other things as well to The Taste the smell the timing uh what you eat with what it's combined with phytochemicals in it micronutrients macronutrients all can affect energy expenditure subsequent energy intake um or nutrient partitioning which is what we a fancy phrase for where you stick the energy that you store in the body do you stick it into fat or muscle or bone or visceral fat or subcutaneous fat Etc so all those things can come into play now what do we really know the truth is I think what we know is modest and partly that's because it seems to me to be very specific that is we can do a study and even when it's honestly done and well done and honestly reported and we find that in this species with this delivery of this composition in this way this thing happens and then when you look in a different species or a slightly different food you get different results so there's many many studies saying well we got this with P protein and casine but not whey or we got it with whey but not casine or uh we got it when we fed

[00:06:46] It 2 hours before the test meal but not one hour before or we got it in men but not in women this makes me think we're talking often about subtle effects that may not be that clinically reliable and meaningful and so the really big effect seems to be how many calories do you eat but all these other aspects of food May then influence how many calories you eat either of that food or in subsequent occasions and those can seem to have big big effects but we're still sort of I think trying to sus those out do you ever spend time interacting with with physicists or chemists biochemists um who sit on the sidelines and sort of look at the field of human energetics and sort of Wonder to themselves why is there so much noise and why is there so little understanding um and I don't think anybody is standing around blaming the scientists and saying well you know in physics we have great scientists in chemistry we have great scientists in human energetics they must be subpar and that's why they don't know anything I don't I don't I can't imagine there's anybody that thinks that what do you think it is at the meta level that explains the obvious uh but important observation that our knowledge in this space is woefully deficient relative to the um effort that has been put into to elucidating truth wh why why just to restate that more poignantly for how hard the field of science has worked to try to get at the questions we're going to discuss today why do we know very little relative to the same amounts of effort that have gone into physical sciences for example I think there are many reasons some are perceptual and and some are actual um some of the perceptual do we really know know that much less and we we can argue about it um I think there's still questions in physics where we say gee we really don't know that exactly how is it that relativity and and Quantum uh physics are are compatible or is dark matter real or what have you I think there are questions there though I would sort of just interject for a second

[00:09:20] David and say another way to think of it would be if you look at the amazing progress that has been made that has been enabled by the knowledge of physics and chemistry right if you just consider what's happened in the last 100 years in terms of what we've been able to do you know just look at computing power look at you know semiconductors look at airplanes I mean look at technology that has been abled by engineering physics chemistry um we're we're multiple logs of advancement the same cannot be said of um what we're talking about now right our understanding of obesity a hundred years ago versus our understanding of obesity today while maybe greater hasn't actually translated into a multiple log

[00:10:12] Improvement in the outcome of Interest which in this case might be a reduction of obesity just as it might be in you know the the interest on the other side which would be computing power right yeah and again I think that's only half true um I think we don't give ourselves certain credit for certain things in physics there's not a lot of discussion in in modern times of the power of

[00:10:35] Newton's universal law of gravitation that was a pretty big deal and a pretty big accomplishment but we don't talk about it a lot because we it's been figured out a long time ago and we take it for granted that we know that now um in but do we even have the equivalent in energetics I think we do um simple some simple examples both at the Practical level uh in this country and in most industrialized countries there's very little food shortage um that's a big deal it is a big deal that we know that alcohol contains calories we take that for granted but Wilbur Atwater who's the person who stated that was vilified for it at that time by the temperance movement and um because they wanted to say uh and he himself was a tea Toler by the way that alcohol had no calories excuse me that alcohol had no um nutritional value and he said no it does it is 7 kilo calories per gr and so that's an example folate supplementation which has radically reduced spinabifida um uh iodized salt uh micronutrient deficiencies being maybe not eradicated in this country but radically reduced to among other things to supplementation uh greater food safety so we've made a lot of practical progress um we've feeding number of people through nutrition and agriculture that uh back all the way to malus but even more you know recently in the 1970s when we were told there was going to be a population explosion that would threaten our ability as a species to Sur but isn't that really more about agriculture than nutrition science it's it's agriculture it's food science but some of the nutrition science is more the micronutrients um all the way back to eliminating scurvy through the work of

[00:12:28] James Lind and figuring out eventually that it was vitamin C they first thought it was just Citrus in general that was the vitamin C um to the folate uh and so forth I think our Notions our understanding about LDL cholesterol which again you know more than ey about but which is very important um and the the role of saturated fats and that we're still learning more but we do know some things about that so I don't think we want to take for granted that we have learned a great deal in obesity itself until about oh I don't know maybe 5 years ago or a little more when I would give talks about this I would say we actually have learned a lot but it's just not all that clinically relevant and what's clinically relevant is mostly truly in the clinic not in the community and the population so I said we've learned a lot about genetics and that's true we have log orders I would argue mag magnitude increase in our knowledge about the genetic underpinings of obesity that we didn't have prior to 1980 but until recently we've had moderate improvements in the clinic and virtually no improvements in the sort of Public Health Community sort of domain if you allow me to be humored with an analogy though just because I'm going to keep pushing back on this a little bit um when the Wright brothers first put an airplane into the sky I don't think anybody would have said

[00:14:06] Aviation is amazing right like that was a proof of concept it was a wonderful example but I think it's safe to say that almost monotonically Aviation has become safer and safer and safer over the past 100 years and I think that allows us to say our understanding of Newtonian physics Bern's Prin Le Material Science all of the things that enable Aviation to be what it is today relative to 100 years ago are probably getting better and we're also getting better at applying them to a real world problem conversely if the rate of airplanes falling out of the sky were increasing steadily over the past 50 years such that you know in 1970 whatever you know 10% of airplanes fell out of the sky but today 50% of airplanes fell fell out of the sky I don't think anybody would be walking around saying we're doing really well we understand much more about the physics of the airplane yes it's true more of them are falling out of the sky and yet

[00:15:10] I would argue that in the presence of all of this knowledge that we have we're getting fatter and we're getting sicker right so how do we reconcile the fact that our knowledge is somehow increasing and we're so much more knowledgeable and yet the actual problem that matters seems to be getting worse not better right well what we don't have is again with a couple of exceptions we're going to get to later I think we don't have the the sort of sea change the real orbit jumps in knowledge of a utilitarian useful knowledge knowledge that helps us change the way we do things now that lead to better outcomes that we don't yet have so we have useless knowledge we have Contra positive of that we have knowledge that is useful for understanding and we hope we can build on to get to practical knowledge Steve O'Reilly gave a nice talk about this um about two years ago at the um at the um Royal Society meeting that he and I and others spoke at and hosted and he said as a physician geneticist biochemist uh who works in the field he looks at this and he also thinks about his early days in blood pressure and when he started his career a few decades ago he said we didn't really have a lot of good drugs and blood pressure and people kept hammering at the molecular biology and the biochemistry and the physiology of blood pressure and bit by bit things started to break and he says now we can treat blood pressure enormously better and he said I think that's where we're going to go with obesity and he said but we're just sort of getting to the breaking point and I I think that's what we're seeing now with the glp1 agonists as well as some other drugs so in other words we might get to a point in 30 years where we're sitting here and obesity rates are back to the level they were 50 to 100 years ago virtually everybody will be on a drug which we may or may not understand the mechanism of action for I think we will understand more of the mechanism action 30 and 50 years from now but it is true that today we don't fully understand the mechanisms of action uh there'll be interesting analogy though I think that's a reasonable analogy comparing it to blood pressure um we're comparing it to lipid management for that matter even 40 years ago we didn't really have tools to manage lipids and where is the investment going right so there the investment was going not only but heavily toward biochemistry molecular genetics physiology and pharmaceuticals we are now seeing an up tick in that we've seen an uptick and we're seeing more of an uptick in that because some success is being achieved and the Pharma companies many of which who over the last few decades would be you know tepidly in and out they dip their toll in the water of obesity wouldn't go so well they'd pull out now they're saying there's real success coming so um there were a couple of recent Cochran collaborations that came out discussing the success or lack thereof Public Health initiatives around obesity do you want to say a little bit about those and maybe also talk a little bit about the history of why I mean if

[00:18:38] I'm going to be blunt if I'm going to extrapolate from what we've just said one would say that public health efforts to curb obesity have been a failure um and the future of obesity management will be pharmacologic not public health related is that a fair prediction I think it's a very reasonable prediction I'm not sure it's one I will share completely I would share the first part that public health efforts to affect obesity in a meaningful way have thus far been singularly unimpressive we'll come back maybe a little bit to why and where that's going and where we should go with it um I do think that in the in the present and even more so in the the not too distant future clinical management including surgery and pharmaceuticals ever more will be ever more powerful safe effective and utilized I don't think they will ever become the complete solution and I don't think that there's no solution in public health but I think we've got to approach it differently so let's go back in time a little bit when I started my career sort of as a uh real Prof professional basically 1991 I come to New York the New York obesity Research Center at Columbia

[00:20:05] University in St Luke's roselt Hospital it's the only federally or NIH funded obesity Research Center uh at the time it's the first it's run by Xavier P the legacy of Ted van Italy cross the park you've got Jules hirs Rudy liel in that group at Rockefeller and it wasn't at the level of academic excuse me of public interest that it is now the topic of obesity what you had is these very interdisciplinary groups physiologists geneticists Physicians psychologists statisticians nutrition scientists Etc all working together on these problems many work had been working together for decades very academic but also clinical and you had the powerhouses that were in that region you had Mickey dunker over at upen you had Marcy

[00:21:01] Greenwood and others at Vasser uh and so forth and if a young person like me made some foolish statement in a seminar about some aspect of physiology or medicine that showed that given my training I had no understanding of what the heck I was talking about one more senior person would put me in my place but in a very constructive way and explain that I didn't know what I was talking about and the status Ians would argue with the physiologist and so on so you had a depth of knowledge and a real depth of expertise and an understanding then enhan 3 data came out and there was the sense of Crisis and panic Public

[00:21:43] Health that was what '94 uh it started to come out in the early 90s the midpoint of it like 9091 uh was was just starting tell folks what enhan is and what the data showed this is the national health and nutrition examination survey it was at the time only done every few years so first there was something earlier in the 60s called uh nephus I think at National

[00:22:05] Health and uh something else then they they developed the national health and nutrition examination survey they did two of them and then the third one was done I think between 88 and 93 maybe so I think the midpoint data they released around 91 if my memory is right and people started Ed using the word epidemic and they saw what looked like a jump whether there's a real jump or not around the late ' 80s or in the' 80s is actually not so clear if you look at skinfolds you see less of a jump and you see the increase starting earlier if you look just at BMI you look at increase it's been going up for hundreds of years uh the the data from the Nobel laurat Robert Fogle uh who wanted an economics he's since deceased but he a terrific generous guy and he collected all these old data on you know British

[00:22:58] Naval Cadets from the 18th century and um French Cadets and Civil War soldiers and recaptured slaves during the Civil War and looked at these different groups and you see that uh obesity levels in BMI have been increasing for centuries but they clearly did seem to be an acceleration and that caused a panic and then you had probably the most powerful voice at the time in this domain was

[00:23:26] Kelly Brownell Kelly had been a real devote of Mickey stunard he's one of Mickey stoner's proteges um mentores and he was a behavioral psychologist still is a behavioral psychologist doing behavioral treatment you know as a grad student I'd go to his lectures and learn the mechanics of how to do behavioral treatment cognitive behavioral therapy for obesity meaning CBT to help people eat less help people eat less exercise more and so on and then he had a change in the I guess this would have been the very late 80s early 90s he uh shortly there after switched to Yale uh he got the MacArthur prize the so-called genius award and he started to look at maybe concerns about the negative effects of obesity and he was one of the most powerful not the first but one of the most powerful voices to start raising questions about the effects of yo-yo dieting or weight cycling going up and down are we doing more harm than good are we just building false hopes up for people because obesity treatment is useless and that started to change and then he morphed into it's the environment and he introduced at least as far as I least to me the phrase toxic environment we live in a toxic environment you can't drive down the street he would say without encountering a fast food restaurant and so this is the problem we need to stop the individual treatment he sort of abandoned his roots and we need to go to the public health treatment many others were grasping that idea inspired Often by him but others on their own and the

[00:25:04] Public Health Community rushed in and the Public Health Community and and this was a community that was up until that point working on smoking or what what types of smoking food safety gasoline all kinds of things like the sanitation uh vaccination so on they rushed in and I think there was a lot of sense of this is simple people eat too much they don't exercise enough eating less is good eating more quote unquote healthy food is good is something about the uh some foods are considered healthy some are not and if you eat the healthy food something magical will happen um more exercise of course without any real understanding of this I've had Public

[00:25:48] Health people who said to me one person wrote and said well I think if we got people to not walk with their iPhones then they would walk a little faster and then they would expend more energy while they're walking across campus and that will help with weight loss and what do you think and I thought well we're still going to cover the same distance there's a nonlinear relationship between walking speed and energy expenditure and the amount of energy is Trivial and etc etc etc and I just thought nobody who understands movement science and energetics and kinetics would make such a statement but if you're a public health person and you just think I just need clever ways of getting people to behave the way I already know they should behave then you come up with ideas like that that's where if you're embedded in a group of people that doesn't happen right that wouldn't have happened at the New York OBC Research

[00:26:40] Center if I had said that in 1991 I would have been immediately educated by senior people who had been thinking about this so in other words the public health field wasn't really able to self- police uh ideas that were not grounded in science that's right one of the things that we're very proud of in our school School of Public Health and

[00:26:58] Indiana University of Bloomington is that we have a Kinesiology Department as in exercise science and we're only one of four schools in the United States schools of Public Health that have a named Kinesiology department now every school of public health studies physical activity but being studying physical activity and being an expert in exercise science are two completely different things we have actual experts in exercise science who understand this who treat it as a science and take it seriously we're very proud of that and they do great work so we got a lot of nonsense rushing in the field we we got a lot of things that never would have in the beginning you wouldn't have predicted to work but people tried them because they sounded good they felt good gave people a positive feeling vending machines farmers markets uh walking trails without really saying all right let's really work this out how many people are going to do it if they do it how much effect will it have will they compensate by eating more or less or moving more or less later those things weren't done so we've got a whole couple of Decades of lousy uninformative research but while the public health uh movement was taking hold what happened to the guard the Old Guard so to speak that you referred to Having learned the the the the the sort of the physiology uh of of obesity in the late ' 80s early 90s what what was their response to this were they a part of the movement were they distinct from the movement I think it's a mix as with any you know thing with many people in politics and money and careers and dominance and egos all kinds of interesting things happened so some of the real strong behavioral people rushed in did good science in the sense of things that were rigorous but um maybe not always well conceived that they were likely to be impactful um but there was grant money to be had and people went after it and still do and so be it what we' learn was this also just driven by funding was there a change in funding priority a lot more funding for obesity still not as much as many people including me would like not as much as perhaps there could have or should have been but definitely big increases there was the Robert Wood

[00:29:19] Johnson Foundation which didn't put a huge amount of money in but put money in whether it was intentionally or not in a very strategic way meaning they put in relative to what NIH or farmer put in they put in a small amount of money but it sounded like a big amount of money it had millions they made a lot of noise about it very successfully they got a lot of careers started they drew a lot of people into the field around Public

[00:29:46] Health around Community intervention around diversity issues and that's all to the good it's great what I think often happened is the amount of money they were dangling in again relative to NIH was small and so many people would rush and get started that way but then they'd go to NIH and get bigger studies so it did catalyze a lot of activity and that's good what we've learned you know you can make it you can make different arguments about it the very famous story with uh Edison where his backers come to him and whether it's true story or not I don't know but say all this time and money and you still have nothing to show for your efforts toward making a light bulb and he said no I now know a thousand ways not to make a light bulb um these two new papers you referred to earlier were from summerbell she was the the senior author not the first author um they're just out in the last week I just put up a LinkedIn post on them about three days or so ago what they do is one is in children 5 to 12 I think the other is an adolescence and they do systematic reviews very thorough very objective metaanalyses according to the cooch rain method and what they find is that for both groups there is no compelling evidence of what you would call a consistent reliable long-term clinically or public health meaningful effect on preventing obesity in either children or adolescence I included a lot of adjectives in there and those are important most important one is probably preventing it didn't say treating said preventing that doesn't mean that treatment of obesity in children doesn't have any efficacy the second thing is these are

[00:31:28] Community kind of diet exercise interventions by the way how do we um how easily do we distinguish between prevention and treatment obviously conceptually it's trivial uh you know prevention is reducing the number of new cases treatment would be reversal of but can you give a sense of what reversal of obesity rates look like with public health stuff I think it's I don't want to say it's zero because you just always have some spontaneous reversal you but you you said a moment ago that this article focused on the prevention side not the treatment side corre was the implication of that that the that public health treatment has been successful but prevention has not I'm sorry I see okay clinical treatment I think there's some evidence for Success more so in adults um but some evidence for Success does clinical treatment include drugs and surgery can include but it doesn't have to okay so um you know the idea of somebody coming to the clinic they go to see let's say a len Epstein at Buffalo they go to his clinic and he puts them in a study or what have you for weight loss I would call that a clinical intervention as opposed to Len Epstein saying I've got an idea I'm going to go out to the public schools and set these programs up um and we'll try to get everybody to be less obese and see if we prevent obesity those that's how I distinguish those things and Len by the way way is he's one of the sharpest cats around and um he's a very good skeptic and a very good commenter on what we really know and don't know in that domain but what sumerell shows basically is not only is there no compelling evidence for effects but the there's reasonably compelling evidence that given the methods we've used today the effects are either zero or trivial and so I think that's really important because I hear tremendous defensiveness now among people who are not practitioners of pharmaceuticals or favorable toward pharmaceutical so much in because of the great success of some of the drugs especially the gp1 agones related drugs in the same way as in the mid 9s I heard tremendous defensiveness from the behavioral psychology community and others about genetics because they weren't going to do genetics and the

[00:34:00] Rudy Li bells of the world and and the Claude bushards of the world were talking it up and it was going to be big and they were starting to feel threatened and often didn't know much genetics but would try to somehow minimize the role and I think there's a lot of fear now among people who want Community intervention Public Health intervention who say I don't want our solution to obesity be let everybody get obese or let 2third of the population get obese and then will give them surgery or drugs for the rest of their life um it's too expensive it's not my ethos you etc etc um and I think they're worried that people like me who say look at the efficacy data we need to think about this more are implying that we should shut down all the other stuff and at least for me personally that answer is absolutely not true but I think we need subp Paradigm shifts within paradigms and what I mean by that is I don't think the Paradigm Shift of saying don't ever think about nutrition anymore only think about drugs and surgery is warranted I don't think the Paradigm

[00:35:07] Shift of saying don't ever think about Behavior Community intervention family intervention is warranted don't ever think about public health or policy that's not I don't agree with those at all what I do think we need to do is to say within the paradigms of behavior Community Family policy let's be hon honest let's look at

[00:35:29] Carolyn summer Bell's data and others and say there is no compelling evidence that any of this has had a meaningful impact you can cherry-pick here and there you can say this policy led to differences in how much of that food was purchased in this context even if that's true and sometimes those are a little shaky those conclusions say did it lower obesity rates and and those have never been shown right none of these taxation none of the policies so H how do we how do we do that I I agree with you by the way in my own personal because I think everybody has to have a personal sort of bias if they're being honest my personal bias is that so many of these Public

[00:36:12] Health ideas on the surface just make a ton of sense like I I I I can I can I can simultaneously hold true the follow you know the following truths right uh which is on the one hand I can completely see why it was logical in the U early to mid 90s to say we have to change the food environment um again like you know Richard Thor's work right another Nobel laurate um would suggest that that's the answer you fix the environment you make the default environment better and people will opt into good choices by the way the default environment used to allow people to eat in a way that was clearly ad libidum and obesity rates were not what they so something about the environment 200 years ago or 100 years ago or even 50 years ago was significantly different from the environment today it's not that our genes changed right nobody would argue there's been such a genetic drift that the reason that obesity rates are 2/3 as opposed to 10% is due to a change in our species an environmental Trigger or set of triggers seems more likely and therefore Public Health Solutions towards those seem very logical so we can hold that truth here and then we have to be brutally honest with your assessment as well the same as

[00:37:33] Caroline's assessment which is this has been an abject failure I mean if at the end of the day you're only measuring the outcome of Interest it hasn't changed so you know we can say whatever we want but the outcome of Interest hasn't changed either people smoke less or they smoke more or they smoke the same and it that's the only metric that matters if smoking cessation is what you're after it's not do we collect more tax revenue are the commercials more or less favorable uh do people you know smoke less in restaurants versus not in restaurants no we care if people as a society smoke less or smoke more um so given that how do we still say and I'm not saying I disagree with this because again my bias is there should be Solutions in public health but how do we know after 30 years and billions of dollars with no effect that we should stay within the Paradigm of

[00:38:36] Public Health Solutions and just abandon all of the ones we have when we don't really have a sense of why they failed right so we definitely don't want to only rely on Public Health Solutions I would strongly oppose that I agree with you that there is a superficial sensibility to the public health arguments that were made for the various things TR tried and it was reasonable to try them but I say superficial Sensi s sensitivity or sensibleness because everything that's true makes sense as once we understand it if we're wrong about something then it didn't make sense we just didn't understand that it didn't make sense at the time some of that is assumptions and it goes back to that public health thing I had a wonderful lunch with the most generous interesting person Daniel Conan who won the Nobel Prize passed away right before he died and he and his wife were uh gracious enough to allow myself and

[00:39:30] Michelle Cardell who now works at ww was former student um with the group I led uh to take them to lunch and we talk about obesity a little bit and he's this great behavioral Economist and he says to me without artifice he says well I think this nudge stuff is really good and you know so you could put things on the menu and that would make people eat less and I say well that's a good idea and some things like that are being tried and have been tried and I said but the big thing is compensation yes you can get a person to eat a little less in this context but then if they go home for dinner and they just eat more at dinner goes away and he looks at me without artifice and he says hold it a second so you're telling me that there might be mechanisms in people that lead them to adjust for red calories and I said yeah and this was a revelation he said you've opened my eyes and I was an economist he didn't think about this he's great with math and he's great with

[00:40:37] Creative Study designs but this was again he doesn't understand physiology I think that was a big part a lot of things didn't make sense because they didn't take into account compensation and many other factors they didn't take into account magnitude of effect uh and so forth the second thing is the data themselves people uh published a nice thing about uh a metaanalysis of nudge type stuff in pnas proceedings of the

[00:41:04] National Academy of Sciences a couple years ago someone else just went in and redid it and said if you adjust for um publication bias it doesn't look like there's much holding up there so often we're presented with evidence and we may want to come back to this when we talk about some other things like especially protein intake we're presented with statements as though we conf itely know these and yet when you really start to open the hood and peel things back you say hey there's not a lot of there there on the data so the data that nudge works is actually shaky um so that that's the second problem the third is we seem to be unwilling to really learn from our mistakes that is or I shouldn't say mistakes unwilling to learn from the outcomes of our studies that is unwilling to say we tried the school-based thing and it did didn't get a big effect we tried it again fair enough let's try it a second time let's try it a third time as a certain point when you say enough so if someone were to come to me and I've been saying this for 20 years now but I'll say it even more strongly today uh if someone would to come to me and say we we've got this opportunity to invest in these big school-based community-based Public

[00:42:19] Health oriented trials to reduce obesity levels in children or adults and we have the money available we want to do good should we do it and I would say show me how this proposed idea is radically different than what's been done for the last 30 years and then let's talk and if it's not radically different why are we wasting our time and money on that so I think we really need radically different Public Health paradig we need to stay in the public health Paradigm but within the Paradigm we need a subp paradigm shift to say nutrition education modest physical activity build a little bit of a facility to allow people a little more activity these have been tried they don't work they don't have big meaningful effects let's try something completely different and it's worth a try that's what I think we need within the paradigms of Public Health policy and so on radically different proposals now if you were Zar of the universe and the ultimate resource allocator what percentage of resources would you put into a new and different form of Public

[00:43:30] Health I.E radically different approaches and what percent would you put into Medical Treatments for such as surgery and drugs so first I find it very entertaining to think about being the thear of anything since my grandparents spent a lot of time successfully escaping the Zars um but uh it's interesting that what I would say is probably a little more more in the near term on the clinical treatment because I think we can make more rapid gains in that while we need some slower longer term assessment of the others but also I would amp up the the non-pharmaceutical non-clinical non surgery a little bit the funding from the government because I think a lot of that funding for those other things will come from industry so you know if you look at a budget of a fizer or a lily or a Novo Nordisk and what they put towards certain areas then you look at what NIH can put to those areas we're not talking about NIH being this overwhelming big dog and in fact when you combine the

[00:44:37] Pharmaceuticals on certain areas they may be much bigger than an AG they they presumably exceed yeah again there's still something here that just philosophically doesn't sit well with me not morally so I want to be clear um I don't have a moral issue with the remarkable success of the drug class that is now probably going to be the first thing that bends The Arc of this I don't know when the next check-in will be the next en haanes check-in but it it seems now it's annual yeah so it seems likely that very soon if not already we're going to see for the first time in five decades obesity rates going down I hope we do so but but the reason that

[00:45:25] I'm still a little troubled is that from a public health perspective we don't have the answer to the question what was the what was the or what were the environmental triggers I mean we think we know the answer but every time we try an intervention against those things it doesn't work which makes us call into question what the answer is so clearly we did not get obese because of a glp1 shortage that is now being ameliorated with glp1 drugs right so clearly we have something that was causing the problem again multifaceted likely and then you have a totally different hack to work around the problem which is why you're saying I think what you're saying which is we need to do both of these things we still have to get back to this but if you had to speculate what is it about the world in the early part of the 21st century that makes um makes obesity and by extension type 2 diabetes a problem that it wasn't again the year I was born you know it just was you know it's a literally a log fold difference in type 2 diabetes a log fold that's that's hard to imagine in in 50 years I think there's multiple closely related factors um I think one is the food supply and its availability itself I think the second is kind of lagged intergenerational effects um just for fun I'm going to uh try to rebut you on the genetics Point uh but only only uh pedantically uh I think that we have seen genetic changes that epigenetic changes or genetic changes both but certainly I'm going to put more direct knowledge my my direct knowledge and confidence on the genetic as opposed to the epigenetic changes um and this is assortative mating differential mating are the do these fully account for the

[00:47:29] Obesity epidemic no of course not am I trying to say that they are the biggest influences no of course not but I do think it's important to push back and say these are factors and they come in through migration through differential fertility uh and through assortative mating we've written papers about all these and as have others if you look in things like Framingham you see that people in certain BMI ranges have more children than people in other BMI ranges and some will say but obese people have fertility problems we're not asking about how good you are in theory at producing Offspring we're asking how many offspring you produce and so if richer thinner people use more birth control and have fewer

[00:48:12] Offspring then and there's some genes for thinness you're going to reduce their prevalence and vice versa so through migration uh differential fertility and then the other is assort mating which doesn't change alal frequency but changes Gene frequencies you get like mates with like but if you had to again all of those things make sense I just stri as somewhat marginal though what do you what fraction I have to be a professor for a minute and get the pedantic points out Fair okay all right so now that's that's out I think that it is largely but not exclusively um The increased availability of a greater variety of foods of Highly palatable food foods of foods that are relatively modest in cost foods that are easy to acquire the uh control of ambient temperature which makes it easier to overeat Foods you don't want to overeat a lot if there's no air conditioning and you live in Austin Texas and it's 110 degrees out right but if there's air conditioning the buffet is okay uh and then I think there's some intergenerational lag effects that we or at least I don't fully understand if you look at the the Danish data torl senson and others have written about this they for over 100 years conscripted if that's the right word every 18-year-old healthy male into the Danish Army um and they have not only Heights and weights of each one naked kind of weirdly they have photographs of each of them naked um and what you see in these these BMI levels is you'll see a period where it's flat for a little bit approximately then you'll see a steep acceleration or steep increase and then it'll flatten out again a little bit and then you'll see a steep slope and this happen this has happened your three or more Cycles I think I don't think anybody exactly understands why um Diana Thomas's mathematical model she's a professor at

[00:50:19] West Point studies obesity her mathematical models predict some of that I don't fully understand how that works but we might ask her um it does suggest to me even culturally or behaviorally there could be some lags whereby the weight of your parents or grandparents is affecting you socially or genetically both right so the uite that formed you was formed in your grandmother so potentially through epigenetic things you've mentioned or others that could be affecting you then there's the cultural part you know and I I think about it when I was a kid and we went out to dinner with my dad and we weren't poor but we weren't Rich we were decidedly you know middle CL lower middle class creeping up um if we went out and we wanted over at the local Italian restaurant or something order shrimp you had to ask Dad about that the chicken parm you could order without asking shrimp you had to ask shrimp was expensive you can get shrimp by the bucket now at the local buffet for next to nothing so I'm prepared to eat a lot more shrimp than my dad ever would have thought of ordering or sitting down because of our changing Economic Times and so on now my kids think nothing about ordering dinner in from door Dash every night where I still think even though I could afford to do it as well as my kids could cuz they spending my money some of the time which is great I'm glad they're doing it um but I think ah that just seems excessive to me you know it seems too indulgent so I think there may be sort of levels at which one ratchets culturally as well as physiologically or anatomically so I think all of these things can be in play I also think we need to change some of the attitudes and this is speculative on my part I have no proof that this is true but I think one of the bad things that the nutrition field has done including um very much the Public Health

[00:52:25] Community which talks about the I used earlier I said the healthy foods that have magical effects but I also think the the the low carb Advocates and zealots who came up through the late 90s and still exist at present and have very powerful voices and yet others still I think there's the sense that there's a right way to eat nobody agrees on what the right way is but there is an underlying supposition that there is a right way to eat and if you just ate that right way then you would maintain the weight you want to maintain and the fat level you want to maintain without ever feeling lack of satiety or dissatisfaction or what have you you and

[00:53:10] I were talking about our personal diets yeah but what's interesting about that is that's actually philosophically not that different from a drug approach in other words if you constructed a lot of parallel universes it's certainly possible that if you put everybody on a perfectly adherent version of diet X Y and Z on each of those parallel planets you would eradicate obesity and by the way one of those planets you might say well we're also going to put everybody on tepati MH and so so you now have multiple different dietary treatments when perfectly adhered to that will dramatically improve obesity one of those will be just a drug maybe two of them will be a a drug another one will be a gastric bypass Etc it still doesn't answer the question what triggered the problem right it still doesn't answer the question and and I got I I don't know that we want to spend too much more time on that because these are unanswerable questions but it's a you know though what is the right diet to fix it doesn't mean that the absence of that diet is what caused it because even the most point I was trying to make is that by saying to people there is a right way to eat we may fost a delusion that is the real debate perhaps is not between the low carb guy and the the non- low carb guy as to what this thing is or the Lo eat locally or you know whatever the real debate may be is there a right way to eat compositionally or behaviorally time of day or something that will satisfy you not make you feel deprived in the real world we live in not an parallel universe we could construct and the answer may be no and yet by continuing to sell that idea we may continue to have people searching in the wrong spot instead of searching for how do I control or overcome my incomplete satisfaction with eating only this amount and instead they're looking for what's the way to eat that I don't have that dissatisfaction and I think what we probably what we may have to accept at some point is that for most of us there exceptions but for most of us to maintain a truly thin or lean body composition if that's what we want and

[00:55:37] I'm not saying everybody should want it but for those who do want it um that we may have to accept that either we're going to have to alter our desires in part through Pharmaceuticals or we're going to have to accept that we don't get to meet all our desires at times as opposed to you the what may be the charade that there is a way that you can just eat a certain kind of food or certain type of diet or eat in a certain way that will lead you not to ever feel dissatisfied so I think that's an important sort of stoic yeah approach right a little more stoicism um let's let's go back to something you were asking though about evidence earlier and

[00:56:24] I do want to make a point about this that we also need to increase the quality of the evidence and the standards we hold we spend too much of our research Budget on lousy evidence so in the childhood obesity field my my group for example often we'll write letters to the editor we just another paper was retracted last week because we found statistical errors in it and if you think about it this is a randomized control trial of a some treatment for obesity related uh I think so and we find it in diet

[00:56:59] Behavior Etc not usually drugs um and what we we see is you if you think about a randomized control trial at the low end a randomized control trial is usually over $100,000 to conduct at the high end it's tens of millions um the ones we're looking at that often we find these mistakes in and many cases are retracted especially in child obesity are probably in the multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars occasionally millions and then you think that's all wasted if they misanalyzed and misreported the data and got the wrong answer so we kind of feel like we're rescuing those dollars in some sense by getting the wrong answers out and the right answers in so we think it's an important service um but I think we need to hold our Fields feet to the fire much more strongly on doing research that answers new questions that answers questions well that honestly reports the data makes the data publicly available do do you think that that problem which

[00:58:03] I'm quite aware of of course is um disproportionately present in this field or um do you feel that it's uh both acknowledged and demonstrated at the same frequency in all fields of medicine um do do you feel that you know this is we we have a we have a brighter Spotlight on it here thanks to certain individuals how do you think this Stacks up all of the above uh and so what we know is that there are many anecdotal statements by Leading thinkers like

[00:58:39] Stuart Richie as one just one example Gary tabs our mutual friend uh who say nutrition is singularly bad and there some of these are wonderfully colorful statements Johnny Ani said we need to accept that nutrition epidemiology is a dead science and bury the corpse that's a quotation right so that's that's those are opinions those are not bits of data if we go further and we look at the Pew charitable trusts but but hang on that's

[00:59:06] I mean you you I mean one could agree with that on some pretty objective facts sure but the question I'm asking is more on the challenges of experimental research that you're talking about where real dollars are being thrown at experiments that are being done incorrectly or being analyzed incorrectly um or where the questions that are being asked are incremental useless uninteresting and unlikely to add meaningfully to the fund of knowledge like let's even let's just forget about nutritional epidemiology um but I but I want to talk about this other what seems to be more distressing problem um based on both the dollars that go into it but also I think the confusion that it sews and the noise that it creates right so it's clearly created that confusion noise and that's what the Pew charitable trusts have shown that in surveys now we're talking data in surveys of Representative samples of American population people trust nutrition experts clinicians purveyors of knowledge more than they trust nutrition scientists and they trust nutrition science less than they trust other forms of science so that's a fact we do have a trust problem in nutrition science now let's go to the last stage which is our research really better or worse harder to pin that one down there's not enough concrete strong comparisons to other areas we're trying to start some in our group uh but there was a recent paper that came out in economics now there's no it's not a onetoone comparison but in an economic

[01:00:44] Journal looking at reproducibility reproducibility and replicability are not quite the same reproducibility is can I get your original data run exactly the same an Anis you said you ran and get exactly the same result if I can I've reproduced your research doesn't mean your result was right maybe you ran the wrong analysis but at least I could do what you said you did and we do that in nutrition and obesity and we find we don't have exact numbers it's not a random sample of papers but we find what seems to be a not infrequent errors irreproducibility or what we call um verification problem meaning we could reproduce your result but it was wrong um it was wrong because you ran the wrong analysis we write the right analysis get a different conclusion and you might do how many of these a year more than a dozen and of the Dozen you run a year how many turn out to be not reproducible or not verifiable I would say probably again these are all approximations maybe half but keep in mind we're not randomly sampling understood what's the criteria upon which you select besides size of study it's usually one of two things it's interestingness or it's something doesn't look quite right so if it's something doesn't look quite right your preest probability is higher then we we take a closer look at it more often or if it's just very interesting we say that's really interesting and it was published in nature and that could be you know Paradigm changing I I'd be curious when you have enough data to know if you just look if you take out the that looks fishy sample and just said hey when we looked at the this is interesting if half of those are coming up uh uh unverifiable uh that's a crisis yeah and I I would say we should do it I hope there's there's a funer out there listening who will want to fund it and ni IH as you might imagine may not be always so keen on on answering uh having us answer this question and it's hard to to get that through but um yeah we'd like to do that and and hope we can do some more we're doing little spot checks in the area my sense is even within obesity if you look at pharmaceutically done randomized control trials you know and I'm not trying to say that people at pharmaceutical companies or pharmaceutical comp somehow morally Superior or not they're people they're just responding to their environment as well but their environment is a very strong regulatory

[01:03:15] Authority called FDA that holds their feet to the fire and so on do you think that's the reason that drug studies tend to be very rarely found uh to require retraction in modern times yes in Modern Times And if somebody said to me do you trust uh randomized control trials coming out of the pharmaceutical industry more or less than Academia infinitely more from the pharmaceutical industry yeah think about that for a moment let's just reflect that's a that's a big statement that I I agree with you but I think it's not it's not intuitive to the average person listening to us many people listening to us would say what the data coming out of fizer are more trustworthy than the data coming out of Harvard but you you know the point here the key point is that uh fizer has to answer to somebody the FDA who will uh you know bring down a much greater and swifter punishment if uh issues are discovered in methodology statistical analysis reporting Etc whereas the academic Community doesn't have that degree of policing basically and the funding so you know often people say oh the industry is so much more efficient than Academia because they have the profit motive I think it depends what you put in your denominator of efficiency if you say output per unit time no question industry in general and

[01:04:45] Pharma in particular blow Academia away but if you say output per unit dollar Academia probably blows industry away cuz we know how to stretch every penny right you are offer working on a shoestring budget exactly but that means often not much rigor whereas you know the the big Pharma company who's going to put their registration trial in is checking and double-checking and having professionals check and so on now there may be more I hate to use the word bias because it's not clear what it means by the way it might be worth also explaining to folks that when people talk about you know quote unquote a fiser study or a J&J study they're hiring cro to actually do the study I think sometimes people are under the impression that you know uh you know when Lily is doing a study on a drug it's like the whole Lily team doing the experiment as opposed to Lily providing the agent you know helping think about the experiment but basically having a clinical research organization actually do it and having independent folks do the analysis that's right and and I think that's important now that doesn't mean that there's no and again I was about about to use the word bias um I don't have a better word right now to use but um I use that one hesitantly but there may be more bias in some ways in the industry funded work and that's often in the question asked I was just about to say it's how the question is asked which determines how the study is designed to look for a particular answer for sure exactly so an industry group might say I'll compare my new drug to the worst old drug in class right where if a university guy did it he or she might say no I'm going to compare it to the best drug out exactly but once they've decided on the question then the design execution and reporting of the study seems to be enormously more rigorous in Pharma now that's not true if you said what about dietary supplement industry okay different different G more complex answer there so back to this I think we need better data

[01:06:53] I think we need to assess this I think Within the non-industry funded stuff typically um like the public health the school-based stuff the child obesity trials um it's going to vary a lot so the cluster randomized Community school-based childhood obesity trials tend to be quite poor and I think the the non- verifiability rate is very high whereas if you went to certain other kinds of

[01:07:22] Trials uh the NIH funded um clinical management of obesity trials will tend to be better so it's going to vary a lot and and just hopefully I'm not biased but I'm sure some of them will think I am and that's okay they're entitled to their opinions on this um you know I'll disclose that I have funding from all these groups so I've got most of my funding is government and

[01:07:43] NIH but I have funding and the school I lead is funding from industry including some many of the pharmaceutical companies to think about clinical trials design and biostatistics we're fun from food industry at times commodity groups so I just want to disclose all that so let's let's pivot now and kind of talk about um the current state of obesity which um uh is is is really seeing a success it's it's never seen um and it's been a relatively short period of time I think three years ago very few people knew what semaglutide was um or even OIC which is the trade name given to the diabetes version of that drug whereas today I I I can't imagine too many people haven't heard the words

[01:08:36] OIC um or some of its derivatives but I think OIC might be one of the most recognized um of these drugs so again it's pretty remarkable um it's also worth noting that these are not new drugs right I mean semaglutide and tepati are newer drugs but they've been around for a while at least semaglutide has and lde L glutide and others have been around for decade you know at least a decade um and they've successfully treated people with type 2 diabetes and like all things or is often the case you sort of notice something in treating one subset of patients that gives you an insight into treating another and so basically as people with type 2 diabetes were treated with this class of drug you notice that it wasn't just improving their diabetes they were also losing weight and that led to what became a set of dedicated experiments to test the efficacy of these drugs in non-diabetic obese patients and the rest is history talk a little bit about what you what you think is socially and psychologically happening at the moment it what why why are people so interested in this drug yeah I think it's it's fascinating I think people are interested for the obvious reason the obvious reason is lots of people want to lose weight and lots of people want to help other people lose weight and for the first time in in history um as you've noted we have drugs that are now powerfully effective and appear to be reasonably safe we've had drugs that were powerfully effective before but would kill you and we've had drugs that were reasonably safe before but at best modestly efficacious we now have ones that are powerfully effective and appear safe reasonably safe safety is a social judgment right not a factual determination risk is a factual determination safety is a social judgment and so it invites all kinds of interesting speculations um about cause what is the role of glp1 in causing obesity and is there a role just because it things involving gp1 treat it doesn't mean it's involving the cause um what's the um effect on stigma if we can treat it does that reduce stigma in the same way that Viagra changed many things around erectile dysfunction uh and interestingly you know I sort of didn't predict the full cultural impact of that which shows you it's hard to predict these things people didn't predict what vag was for it was being used for something else they noticed erections as a side effect and then they started working on it and in the early '90s when I went and visited one of my buddies who's a biostatistician at fizer and that individual told me they were working on this new thing and explain what it was to me I laughed at it and I said what are you wasting your time on something so ridiculous and unimportant why don't you do some important research shows you what I know um so I think here we're we're learning that again that we get surprised in science we're seeing a moral Panic this is subjective on my part but this is something I'm noticing a lot of old arguments that had kind of gone semi- dormant at least in the academic

[01:12:09] Community um over the years of well if you give people a drug for obesity doesn't teach them anything and therefore when you stop the drug the weight just comes back and this was said as a criticism as opposed to saying well who said it had to teach them anything who said that was the goal and for many drugs anti-seizure medications if you have seizures anti-hypertensives anti-diabetes drugs um Etc you're going to take those for the rest of your life if you're in the right class for that we don't say but the person with schizophrenia shouldn't get the drug because if we stop giving it to them the schizophrenia symptoms come back say no it's schizophrenia is a serious disease we need to give it to them with obesity this has come up again it sort of seemed to be put down a few that idea a few years back and now I'm seeing

[01:13:04] I'm hearing it again this kind of moralistic judgment about that we're also hearing the moralistic judgments come about motivation it's okay if you're motivated for health it's not okay to get the drug if you're motivated for something other than health which implies that assuming we have the same health issues the person would equally benefit from their health we make a moral judgment about your motivation but there is no evidence that I know of that people who are motivated for health to lose weight do better than people who are motivated for cosmetic or any ego business any other reasons so I think we need to get over some of that moral Panic once we get past the safety the cost and the availability issues and I don't want to trivialize those the safety the cost and the availability issues are big issues the safety issue is really and in that sense I'm defining safety in the sense that sometimes the FDA defines it which is safety involves risk and risk involves uncertainty as opposed to being risk involving known Factor right I don't just mean the probability that you get this I mean the fact that we don't know what happens if you take it for 40 years um so there is some safety issue some open questions no one's taken it for 40 years so we don't know what happens if you take it for 40 years right now it's very expensive our country is divided on how health care should be paid for there a lot of different opinions um and also there's an availability problem but let's just fast forward to a time when we say we've we've learned the safety and by the way say say a little bit more about the availability problem I mean I only realize it because you see compounding pharmacies now making semaglutide enter eptide which when I first saw that I couldn't understand how they were doing that legally because uh that's that's pretty clearly not within the statute of what a compounding pharmacy can do a compounding pharmacy can't make an existing FDA approved drug they have to make a variation of that drug for example they have to change the delivery mechanism if they make something topical that would only be available orally or something of that nature unless and one of the exceptions to the rule is if the

[01:15:20] FDA approved a drug can't be uh produced in efficient quantities then a compounding pharmacy can create the exact same drug that is available through the FDA label so presumably that is happening do we have a sense of why it's happening uh what is the manufacturing bottleneck obviously demand is outstripping Supply but that the the question is why is Supply not able to meet demand and then secondly do you have any insight into whether the quality control at the compounding pharmacy level it m is that of liili or

[01:15:57] Nova Nordisk so with respect to the first part why is there an availability problem I don't know the technical mechanics of it but my understanding is that the technical process by which these drugs are produced is different than some other drugs and the technical process is a slow one and so until they ramp up more and more production sites they just can't do it fast enough but they are ramping up more and more production sites um so that's good um

[01:16:29] Novo just bought bought catalon which happens to have a plant in my backyard in Bloomington Indiana so we'll probably see more of that ramping up um we uh the second thing is about the compounding pharmacies so when I first heard about it and I'm far from an expert in compounding pharmacies or the legal aspects but I too was skeptical is this okay was the quality control and you know is this a kind of shady thing and I started to hear a lot of reports about this and described as though it was a very shady Endeavor and again that moralizing came in again then I've talked to some other people who are experts in it uh and who are using these and I've said admittedly again this is their business so they have a motivation but they have said well when we do it and they've described and I said tell me your process who do you use how do you do it what quality control and then they've gone through say for this compounding pharmacy that I use we use it in this way this degree of quality control and I say wow that sounds to me again phys have not physically inspected the plants I'm not an expert it sounds to me like some very rigorous quality control so I don't think we should be dismissive of the concerns around compounding pharmacies but I also don't think we want to paint everybody with the same brush the question becomes as with anything is show me your data show me your evidence on your quality control your procedures and if they're good they're good and let's use them let's get over the moral

[01:18:06] Panic yeah I I don't know that I think of that as a moral panic I think the bigger moral Panic is the is less about the source of the drug but the use of the drug and and so you you you you brought up an interesting distinction um which is you let's take two people with obesity actually let me take that back let's take an individual who is medically obese um and let's take an individual who is and by the way metabolically unhealthy right so that's the key point

[01:18:37] I want to get out here so this is a person whose health is compromised by their weight um both from an orthopedic perspective and metabolically and then it's take another individual who's overweight but if you're looking at them objectively you don't see the metabolic signs of overweight weight they're not suffering um physical and Orthopedic issues associated with it so both of these people let's just assume have a desire to lose weight one of them to primarily ameliorate the medical conditions uh and also the uh aesthetic conditions and then the the the the latter person just for the aesthetic conversions right um okay we we probably look at those people differently when I say we I mean Society might make a different moral judgment on those two that's right you're arguing that's a false dichotomy I think it's it's a it's a legitimate dichotomy to see the situations as distinct situations but not necessarily implying distinct recommendations coming from those let's let's refine it to a 2 by two we've got people as let's just say four individuals come to you and we're going to say that you're the objective all knowing agent and meaning I determine who goes on the drug no you determine their state of being got it right half of the people are objectively at Medical physical risk because of obesity and would be objectively medically helped by losing weight on this drug half of the people are not at objectively Medical increased risk and would not be predicted to have a medical a major medical benefit within that each of those groups half of them think they have a medical problem regardless of whether you objectively determine they do and think they would benefit and half of them aren't interested in that they're want to do it for Cosmetics income other opportunities Etc stigma reduction quality of life and the question is how should those four groups be treated now it seems to me from an obvious point of view if we're concerned about expense and the expense is born by Society not the individual coming or if there's shortages and we're going to take it away from someone who's genuinely medically needed then going to the non-medically needy people is questionable but if we get over those problems if the person says I can afford to pay it for it myself and the availability is there and we think there's no big safety problem or even if there's some safety problem but we've told them y it's fully consented take the libertarian view it's their choice seems to me yeah and it's hard to imagine any reasonable person could argue with that position well one of the big statements that got in some news was a a a very reputable um entity major player in mainstream medicine who has an interest in actually promoting this and a three sort of step statement was made Step One is the drugs were intended and designed and studied for this use meaning treatment of medically needy people second the drugs were proved for that use third therefore they should only be used for that and the third part is a moral judgment not a factual J the first and the second are true and what they really tell you is therefore the cost benefit an analysis has to be viewed through the lens of that patient population in other words when you ask the question about risk and benefit you have to at least acknowledge that the long-term risk long-term benefit are studied in that population and as such this is what the data are these are the risks these are the benefits make your judgment conversely if you ask the question hey for a person who is subjectively 10 lb overweight um like me right you could argue I'm 10 pounds overweight right nobody knows but me basically but hey um should I be taking this drug so let's take an analogy patient comes to you they're very wealthy they're in good physical health they have a house they have a car they have all the material things they need they have a family family loves them they don't engage in violence and they'd say I feel miserable I'm anxious all the time or I'm depressed all the time you might say after you might try a few things explore it but assume you've explored it it's real maybe you tried some cognitive behavioral therapy didn't seem to work you might say yeah an anti-anxiety drug or an anti-depressant might be for you FDA approves those things we take the person's quality of life and their feelings into account why is it that the person who says I feel too fat and I want to be 10 pounds thinner and look good in my bathing suit or I want to get this job as the leading actor in that film or I want a promotion in my environment and I think I'm more likely to get it if I'm thinner MH or I'm hungry all the time and I don't plan to lose weight I just want to stop being hungry all the time why are those that person's feelings or non-medical desires any less valid than the person with depression or for that matter the person with an unusual but not Health damaging physical feature you know an unusual nose or something who says I just feel like I'd be judged better I don't think it is I guess the only thing I would suggest as the back stop to that is when the person who doesn't like their nose goes to the ENT surgeon or the plastic surgeon to have the completely non-essential but emotionally beneficial procedure if they're seeing a good surgeon the surgeon can tell them with unambiguous Clarity what the probability of negative outcomes is right and I think the same is true in the case you described at the outset about the individual with depression or anxiety a very good physician can explain to them what the risks are and by the way as you know well um very few

[01:25:38] Physicians would give you um a medication for anxiety or depression without also prescribing in parallel to it psych Psychotherapy the the data are pretty clear that medication by itself is nowhere near as effective as medic coupled with Psychotherapy so you have two things going for you that make this analogy not Apples to Apples which is in the case of depression we can say much more about the long-term side effects and we're combining it with a behavioral therapy that aims to improve the efficacy again I'm not suggesting that the person who wants to lose 10 PBS um doesn't have a legitimate concern I I think my concern is um we don't know enough about the long-term risk to tell them for their relatively minor Health compromise um is it potentially worth it is the trade-off worth it I think we could probably say that with a higher degree of certainty for the individual with significant obesity because even if we would have kind of a small bracket of understanding the downside potentially of the drug we really know the downside of having a be BMI of 40 right right like you know being insulin resistant having type 2 diabetes having a BMI of 40 uh has such a clear downside that you know the other side of that bed is a pretty easy one to take so I think that to me is the so so again for me it's not a moral question at all when I'm confronted with this question which I am all the time right every every week I probably or every two weeks at least interact with a patient who fits the exact description you're talking about right which is hey I would just I'd love for this to be easier and and again I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting something to be easier but my hope is we get to a point where we could give them the same degree of clarity around risk that the plastic surgeon can give the patient who under who wants to undergo a rhinoplasty right and and I agree with you on that and I think that's where you get into the moral questions come in around how do you receive of the role of FDA Society physicians in regulating choices and by the way to be clear that's why I'm not taking one of these drugs like I'd love to be 10 pounds lighter I would love to be 10 pounds lighter I would love to never be hungry like all of the things that these drugs do by the way they improve glycemic control all of those things are appealing to me but the truth of it is for somebody who is quite a risk taker and I am quite a risk taker

[01:28:23] I've seen am when it comes to my health I would argue I'm quite a risk taker but I've watched countless patients take these drugs and as I've shared with you and others without exception the resting heart rate overnight goes up about 10 beats per minute and I don't know what it is about that fact and the fact that heart rate variability goes down slightly that just has me asking the question for me personally is it worth a trade off do I really is there some underlying sympathetic parasym itic imbalance that results from this drug that is doing a whole bunch of other good things Visa my appetite potentially but you know what over the Arc of my life is it worth it and if it's you know maybe if it were 40 pounds and it was medically a problem I'd say oh let's

[01:29:11] I'll take the heart rate bump any day of the week so informationally I'm with you 100% And and in terms of the morality of the honest communication I'm with you 100% well by that I mean informationally we have a Fair bit of data that allowed FDA to make its decisions on the use of these drugs for particular indications in patients who are judged to be quote unquote medically needy of those drugs and we don't have a lot of data on the person who's thin but who says I just want it to be easier or the person who's thin but says I'd like to be 10 pounds thinner um and I think anything any treatment or provision of something to people without a full disclosure of what you know and an honest disclosure is not not right so I think if I were in your shoes I'm not a physician I don't prescribe drugs but if I were in your shoes and that person came to me my bare minimum is that I've got to say to them

[01:30:03] I want you to be aware that I have no data on this over many decades we only have a few years I want you to be aware that it was only tested thoroughly in these populations which is not your population and you need to know that there are the as Rumsfeld famous said the unknown unknowns then I think there's an issue of choice there are lots of things that

[01:30:27] I think it's acceptable that our society permits but I don't personally want to do them think freedom of speech I think it's perfectly acceptable and necessary that we allow certain people to come out publicly and make certain statements but I'm not sure I want to make all those statements um and I can imagine you saying I think it may be acceptable that somebody provides this drug to this person under these circumstances but that's not what I want my career or life to be and I think you should have that choice so I think these are things we ought to do and it comes down very much

[01:31:01] I think to this sense of um after we have the inputs we can agree on the facts we should be able to agree on the facts but then what we do with those facts that becomes we can disagree because we have different values and I think that's where it's how much of a paternalist is one the FDA is very paternalistic right they're going to decide which drugs are good for whom or how much are you a Libertarian where you say we'll tell you about the effects to the extent we can of this drug or this treatment but how good it is whether you should do it whether you want to do it implies values and you make that decision as long as it's a fully informed decision um and those are different views of how we should proceed all right let's consider one more Zinger on this topic you are now in charge of both wada and usada okay right so world anti-doping and us anti-doping thank you for AG defining those for me you have an obvious and clear hard line against drugs that improve performance so an athlete cannot take testosterone or growth hormone or EPO or anything that boosts performance now if you think about it a lot of sports have their performance improved when the athlete is lighter weight management is a big part of many sports cyclists Runners gymnasts if you think about it rowers rowers any sport that is cardiac output versus body weight those athletes and I used to be one of them you are relent you are just as focused on weight management as you are cardiac output should these drugs be banned by wada and usada are they indeed performance-enhancing drugs great question I hadn't thought about that until you asked it great question because it introduces a whole different set of interests prior we were talking mainly about the individual persons taking the drugs interest and a little bit about the provider's interest you a little bit about Society cost FDA so on here you've introduced a fourth party and that part party is the sport um all the spectators the people who own it the other participants the sport has rules and sport is very different than some other things where there's an arbitrariness to it right why does the baseball bat have to be this long and not that long why does the tennis racket have to be within these Dimensions well that part's arbitrary but what's not arbitrary is we want it to be equal we want everybody to have the same chance so in other words we don't spend too much time worrying about the length or weight of the baseball bat we worry far more that you didn't screw into yours and put cork in there and change the weight of it that's the thing we care about is fairness because that's the rule but the rule we even change the rules about the intrinsic things so we change the rules about in some places we don't condition on age and others we have age brackets some boxing we have weight brackets wrestling we have weight brackets we don't have height brackets in basketball and it's interesting some colleagues and I trying to write a whole paper on you know mathematically what is bias what do we mean by that and we use basketball as an analogy and I use myself as the example and say if I try out and and I don't do well for the basketball team because I'm short I don't call that bias because intrinsic to the idea of basketball is these are the rules we don't have springboards for shorter guys um we could but we don't we don't have height class and so that's not biased in contrast if you ask me to try out to be a biostatistics professor and the book is on the top shelf that you want me to lecture from and there's no step stool I would argue that's biased because you could have put a step stool there and it's not intrinsic to biostatistics

[01:35:11] Professor performance to be able to reach tall things and so we need to look at the sport and say what do you want it to be and if somebody says I want it to be things where part of the sport is being able to maintain your weight and so I don't want anybody to have a performance-enhancing drug then to me so be it I could also alternatively turn around and say um we just want you to be able to get the basket in the in the hoop or we just want you to be able to row the boat and you know if you do it by having more money and hiring a better

[01:35:46] Coach and you do it by taking OIC and you do it by um having good jeans All is fair and I I don't think there's a right answer there from the sport point of view I think you you just decide what is but given that the sport has already made several decisions right they've already said you can't take a drug that increases the number of red blood cells that you have M that's EPO you can't take a drug that increases the rate at which your muscles repair themselves after hard training that would be testosterone right you can't you know and go on and on and on you can't take a drug like a diuretic that takes body weight away from you um I just wonder where this is a this is not a philosophical question about drugs it's a qu it's a practical question about this class of drugs whose efficacy is as you said profound and its safety at least in the short term unquestionable um you know are we going to basically see at the Olympics this year in France if they were drug testing for it what fraction of athletes would be taking glp1 agonists of the sports where body weight um regulation is a key

[01:37:05] I don't expect many shots to be taking it but I do wonder how many boxers and rowers and Runners and cyclists will be taking it really interesting we should do that study let's work on it um but uh so I don't know the answer haven't heard about that before I think your speculation is is apt I think that that as a formalist I would go and say well what is these groups that have said you can't take testosterone and this and this and that what's they probably put out some underlying principle said probably said you cannot take a drug that enhances performance unless you have a medical need I don't know if they've said that but if they have then then it could get really tricky because now you say well who defines the medical need what about you know now is it fair if we take the person who's just below the threshold for needing it who says I don't get to take the drug but the person who's just above the threshold who does you have then also this idea of a fairness a disabilities issue if I if I have obesity and I particular I've got a strong genetic predisposition to it and um I can't manage to be not obese without the drug do I effectively have a disability and is this now prejudice IAL or violation of you know Americans with

[01:38:27] Disabilities Act or something like that or you know different countries have different variants but is there is there a fairness issue and again I I don't know that there's a right answer I think these these would be tough political and moral questions but it's really particularly tough because you bring in the interest of the sport then you're going to get also it's going to reflect back when you get into the health interest of the individual just just as with many sports we might say it's in the interest of the team or the coach or the sport itself to have this person at greater risk but of course it's not in the interest of their situation and yet we somehow accept that we allow people to play football even though there's concussion risk and we allow people to box and many other things um but are there some limits where we might say when not comfortable with your putting yourself at risk um for this we need to protect you as much as the sport all right let's pivot to something a little bit easier to talk about you've already alluded to protein um it's a it's a huge interest of yours clinically personally um it's a topic I've addressed a number of times um what do we know about protein and what do we at least in your view what do you what do you think we think we know that we don't know okay okay so you're as much more of an expert on the physiology and biochemistry of it as I but I will um

[01:40:00] Venture a few things so with respect to what we know we know some very basic things we know you can't live without protein without consuming some protein we know that the body is made not totally but heavily of proteins they're essential for functioning we know that proteins are made up of amino acids they're different amino acids that have different effects some amino acids can be synthesized in the body some can't be um I think you did a podcast with Luke vanloon recently which I found enormously educational and um so I'd refer people to that one and he knows a lot more about protein than I do and so I think we know that we need protein we need a certain amount uh we need certain amino acids and we can get them from various Foods or combinations uh animal-based Foods we can pretty much get all the proteins we need from them if we only eat plant-based Foods it's not impossible with the exception of maybe torine but whether we have to consume torine or not if you're a cat you have to consume torine but if you're a human maybe not um you could drink Red Bull there you go and still eat plant-based protein and you're fine so then we get into are there known things about the amino acids in terms of long-term human health and I I think modest so you know we see certain things about uh Lucine being important for skeletal muscle growth uh anabol anabolic effects we see um some things about isol leucine in mice maybe not producing longevity we see torine um supplementation in mice and some other species appearing to prolong life in VJ

[01:41:50] Ad dev's work we see methionine restriction in Rich Miller's work prolonging life methionines related to torine a lot of confusion what would really prolong life in humans is unclear whether the same things that will prolong or shorten life in terms of macronutrient composition in mice will do the same thing in humans is unclear and there are different outcomes this is Again part of why I railed against the idea of healthy foods so-called or unhealthy food so-called healthy for what you might want to be 10 lbs thinner I might want to be able to lift 10 more pounds on the bench press that person wants to live 10 years longer the three diets for those things may be different and so I think that after that after the idea that we need some protein we need some minimal amount we need the amino acids I think it gets shaky then some of the things that are said are in other words minimums and maximums were not necessarily a part of what you just described with much certainty right I think there's reasonable confidence and you've been a a great progenitor of this idea that the the old school recommendations for this much is enough were probably too low 8 uh grams per kilogram body weight is the

[01:43:15] RDA right and I think many people think that's too low that you can survive on it's not that you can't survive but can you thrive and that and that's sort of I think a big point of your book and and other people's lives you know your book outlive which is um yes we can think about treating diseases we can think about preventing diseases but neither of those are equivalent to optimizing our lives and our health and you know different people have different ideas of optimal is optimal optimal Comfort is it optimal length is it optimal ability um whatever it is it doesn't seem that that's the level the RDA right 8 grams per kilogram uh is the optimal level for health or longevity or anything else so it's probably somewhat higher next question is are there minimal thresholds at any sitting so don Layman and others have argued there are sometimes you hear 20 said 20 G sometimes you hear 30 said so 20 to 30 G in a particular sitting is the minimum to get anabolic is that true when I as a statistician here this I'm like really a threshold in biology you're telling me there's a step function and you know it now I don't really believe it's a step function but maybe it's sigmoidal maybe it's sort of a little flat and then it goes up steeply and then it flattens out a little bit and then I say how much sample size and how many different doses would you need to really get a fix on that and test whether it's there and then you look at the studies done and you go you've got to be kidding me we talked earlier about pharmaceutical company studies think about the numbers of people on which we tested covid-19 vaccines think about the numbers of people we've tested statins and now glp1 agonists now think about the numbers of people used in randomized control trials from the nutrition

[01:45:20] Community to look at protein needs and not all of us need to take a Statin a lot of us do not all of us need to take glp1 Agonist we've talked about that all of us need to De protein and yet the quality of evidence and the quantity of evidence we have is Tiny it's dust compared to what we have on these

[01:45:41] Pharmaceuticals and so we really need to ramp this up I would say I don't think that we really know that you don't get anabolic until you hit 20 or 30 but but again just to be clear I mean mechanisms that are described on those are based on small studies um and and they're really small by necessity just based on funding and complexity of doing these studies I mean these are amino acid labeled Tracer studies right where they give people various doses of protein and they look at muscle protein synthesis right and and so um again I'm not I'm not here to say that we shouldn't be doing bigger better studies but um the some of the studies that have been aimed at elucidating this are quite rigorous in terms of their their their mechanistic insights um and and so I guess the question is isn't it at least biologically plausible that there is a threshold and

[01:46:40] I agree it's very unlikely a step function it's more likely a sigmoidal shaped curve but it seems at least biologically plausible which doesn't make it right that at low doses you know at 10 grams of amino acids the liver itself might just prioritize gluconeogenesis and there's a saturation point at which it says oh well okay we have excess nitrogen now let's go off and do this other thing I think it's entirely plausible but we talked many times of plausible things turn out to be wrong exactly so we need to do the studies the I'm not putting anybody down for the studies uh some of them you know when I hear about what Don Layman's done and what what Luke Van Lon has done and others is there is really impressive and rigorous but as a statistician who's saying do we know the answer yeah I say not really um and um we're also interested in long-term effects and so there's you know that old saying there's many a slip T cup and lip um we what's the saying there is many a slip Twix between cup and lip so drink and you spill um you think it's a done deal if

[01:47:46] I've got the cup and I'm moving it toward my mouth I get the drink but maybe not uh the Tracer studies are important but they're not they're indirect right what we really want to know is if you do this for a year you know are you stronger are you bigger are you you know Etc um so I think we don't really know that unequivocally you did a great discussion recently of a study that was um uh in which Luke vanon was one of the authors that used up to 100 grams and looked at the the the other end of the threshold is there an ASM toote is there a level in which you don't get any more benefit right where conventional wisdom was 40 Gish was the ceiling and I think the study from Luke suggested that might be true for a very rapidly hydrolized protein such as wey but with casan at least his data suggested maybe not time release protein might be a value and meals like a steak might be closer to casan kinetics than whey kinetics right so I think we don't know that there's an upper limit we don't know the full duration uh you know some people said you only you're only stay anabolic for 2 hours after eating the protein I think that Luke's study shows more yeah so I think there are those things what about the maximum amount of protein again traditional thinking here is three grams per kilogram is the maximum and if you consume more than three grams per kilogram as a healthy individual you risk kidney damage right so this is something that's been intriguing to me um when I look at this and I haven't done a complete thorough check but I'm sort of in the process of working through it I hear it's going to reduce bone mass or could reduce bone mass um excessive protein intake that is could lead to kidney function problems um some other unspecified problems there's even this old thing called rabbit starvation which you know you can find papers going back on this at least 100 years and they talk about hunters and survival IST and so on out in the woods who can shoot a lot of rabbits and eat their fill of rabbits and yet starve to death because they don't have enough fat and carbohydrate to properly digest but if you say now can you let's go back and find the trials that showed this so you find a paper and it says here are the limits Steve heyfield and suaps has just had a wonderful nutrition 101 um commentary in New England Journal of

[01:50:20] Medicine and they talk about some of the upper limits and they cite some papers and they say some bad things can happen if you eat too much protein you go back to those papers they review papers they're not trials those papers say the limits are like this and they site a few things and you keep going back and we're unable to find trials where people do it all you seem to get to is somebody said well but there was this group of um hunters in this population who ate this many grams and they were okay so don't go above that but nobody said if you go above that something bad happens there's this study and I say

[01:51:01] Loosely of one or two guys who ate nothing but meat for 6 months to a year and they were fine interestingly there's a corresponding study from 1928 two polish scientists put two Polish people on a diet for 6 months of nothing but potatoes fruit and a little bit of fat to cook the potatoes and the idea was can you get enough protein and nitrogen out of the potatoes and the answer was yes at least for 6 months they were fine so people have been fine eating nothing but meat and no plants for 6 12 months again these are these are semi anecdotes they're intervention studies but they're not big randomized control trials or nothing but potatoes for 6 months as a protein source and they've all been fine do you remember in any of those studies how much weight was lost in each group in the potato study there was neither weight lost nor gained really yeah how did those people not lose weight they were probably thin to begin with if you go back to the classic studies of Ted van Italy and um Samy

[01:52:06] Hashim from 60s I think where they would bring in as they described them at the time lean Columbia University students versus obese adults and they gave them metrical which was sort of the the Boost or Ure of 1960 and through a tube where they could get unlimited Supply but they couldn't really see how much they were eating and what they found is that the obese people generally lost weight they didn't fully compensate or or the monotony made them reduce intake whereas the lean students all maintained weight so it's probably that the effects of diet on weight change vary a great deal depending on where you're starting anyway so the potato eaters neither gain nor loss weight and they had beautiful nitrogen balance from what I've understood I haven't study those papers as carefully but the all meat eaters at least for 6 12 months were fine so I think either way it can be done um what we don't what

[01:53:11] I have not seen is somebody who said to test this rabbit starvation thing we brought a bunch of healthy adults in and we fed them nothing but cooked rabbit for 6 months and something good or bad didn't happen I've not seen somebody say we fed enormous levels of protein to normal adults and we saw leeching of bone mass and by the way do you think that study would need to be rabbit because it's so lean or could it be ribey which is equally void in carbohydrate but at least is high in fat so from a macro perspective you're dividing things up I think it depends on what you think the mechanism of action is and it's not crystal clear to me that people have specified a crystal clear mechanism action there is some speculation and again there's some nice recent papers on this that especially for people who want anabolic effects bodybuilders weightlifters that when you eat carbohy excuse me when you eat protein you should have some carbohydrate with it that will enhance the anabolism because through the insulin exactly or you inject insulin but my understanding and again I'm just really entering in this but as I I've read so far there is no compelling evidence that that is true that is that you get more anabolic effect if you eat carbohydrate with your protein than if you eat protein alone so another presumption or myth so rabbit starvation bone loss kidney problems um and you know you must have carbohydrate with it all of these things are I think these things that are presumed known and readily talked about but I don't think demonstrated so I've not seen any trial data yet in normal adolescence or adults that suggests a negative health problem not conjectured but observed as a result of too much protein

[01:55:10] I'm not saying there isn't such a study but I have not yet found those studies if anybody else knows them please send them to me yeah that would be interesting uh uh and you know the let's just assume that those studies don't exist in fact um or if they do they're they're very very small and therefore probably not worth extrapolating to the ends of the

[01:55:30] Universe on what is the probability that such basic questions like this will be answered in the coming decade of nutrition science what is the appetite no pun intended for this type of clinical investigation especially in light of everything else we've spoken about which is hey the name of the game in nutrition Science Now is pharmacology it's not these sort of mundane questions about macronutrients for obesity treatment and closely related things diabetes treatment prevention I think you're right the name of the game um for other areas I think they'll be more interest so longevity promotion and you'll get something like the evolution Foundation weighing in which could conceivably do big studies but even there there nothing's unlimited um they may say well we're going to focus a big trial that'll be definitive and really give the answer but it's going to give the answer only in this age group or something like that um I think NIH will will fund some I think industry will fund some but NIH industry are likely to fund in most cases things that are small enough that we're not going to know the answer about every dose eaten at every period of time in every race age sex and health status group what we'll know is pocket answers so I think what we could get for example is a study funded in which we very very thoroughly looked at ordinary healthy adults uh over 60 years old who want to increase strength and muscle mass and we'll look at protein intake and we'll look at other upper limits I think that could conceivably be done and we could probably that answer but then you might come back and say well you've shown it safe or unsafe for a 60-year-old you haven't that doesn't mean it is for a 20-year-old and say that's true and you say when you showed it with caseine way but not with P protein and you know whatever that's true too so how compelling do you find the data that high protein diets reduce longevity uh there are many proponents of this view out there um often I suppose within the plant-based

[01:57:55] Community although again I don't think those are necessarily an overlap although that just seems to be where I notice most of the lower protein is better um rhetoric but but how do you assess the strength of that claim very low um I think it's going to depend on species and that's important because it leads to the extrapolation uh issue if you're a butterfly

[01:58:22] I think it probably does reduce lifespan and I think a higher carbohydrate diet may increase lifespan more if you're a butterfly if you're a mouse and you know we do have some butterfly listeners of this podcast but I'll be honest with you we've our efforts to increase butterfly listenership have largely been uh I I would just say they've been less successful than I would have enjoyed we we'll keep working on that but I think in humans there's no compelling in my view no comp ing evidence I I would even say there's some evidence and reasons to believe the contrary um some of that's going to be tied to wealth U wealthier people eat more protein than less wealthy people including within our country so it's hard to tease all this part epidemiology but if you look at the association studies even there I don't find it compelling then you can say well do you accept the association studies and not all that much um if you look at the mouse studies um I don't think I'm not sure there you see the full translation but also I'm not sure they're all that compelling that um lower protein so I think nothing that I know of would say to me there's very strong reason to believe even if not definitive RCT that higher protein will lead to less longevity and if anything I think there's more compelling reason the contrary now my friend and and an IU alumnist Barry Sears and you know talks about the zone diet and the idea of the zone is that there's not too much on this end you shouldn't be too high on this end don't be too low over here there's a zone of things in the body and in diet that are right you got to find the right spot and he very strongly believes that you want to upregulate ampk to live longer and you want to not upregulate mtor too much to live longer and I know you've talked about rapy which you know sort of has effects that would go along with what saying so he might argue from that point of view that too much protein would reduce longevity and again I can't say he's wrong I think it may also depend on at which period of time so what's good for you to to do or eat early in life may not to prolong life may not be what's good for you later in life um sometimes we call that antagonistic plot tropy and here we might say and John holl is found this in rats now I don't know if it holds up as one study but found that exercise in rats reduced mortality rate in the first half of life but it increased mortality rate in the second half of life and so if we accept that as causal and and valid and replicable then maybe the same things might be true for protein might be good to eat more when you're younger and less when you're older or less when you're younger and more when you're older I don't know but I think that we also need to think that longevity is only one factor um we talked about this a little bit the other day and you know um there's no right answer to this but if somebody were to say to me live this way and we our best guess is you'll die two years earlier but until you die you'll be stronger you'll feel more energized you look better I'd say I'll make that trade now someone else might say I won't make that trade and who's to say who's right yeah David one last thing before we go you um you you serve as sort of the editor of a newsletter that comes out every Friday obesity and energetics I've been a subscriber for I guess a decade maybe a bit more right when did it start it started kind of organically all the way back when I was just in grad school basically getting out and then there was no formal letter didn't of the internet

[02:02:19] I would hand my professor's paper I had read and said hey maybe we can talk about this or something then I moved away I would mail them and I mailed to a couple of people and it kept going and soon people started getting asking to be adding to my list then it became electronic then it became a formal web thing so now it goes out to uh over 100,000 people worldwide we don't charge anything for it it's free it's called obesity and energetics offerings we don't accept any commercial support for it uh it contains usually about a 100 or a few more links to mostly scientific papers sometimes popular media articles commenting on things and virtually every category related to obesity energy metabolism nutrition well I'm I'm a big proponent of it my team all subscribes to it um and uh it's one of the it's you know it's it's one of the not too many newsletters that I rely on uh again people ask me how do I stay up to date on things um and the truth of it is I have to rely on other people doing a lot of the aggregation and then I'll kind of go where my curiosity goes and sometimes go a bit deeper but anyway I just wanted to make a plug for people to subscribe to obesity and energetics offerings it's it's great um and you know one of the one of the fun things that I think is great for people learning is one of the sections is always called uh headline versus study yes and I just think if if if folks listening to us now are not going to read any of the subheadings there just read that one because it gives you a great sense of how misleading the traditional media can be um not necessarily because they're nefarious I don't think that's the case

[02:04:11] I think it's uh scientific ignorance and a misalignment of incentives um so one they're simply not qualified they don't have the scientific literacy to understand what a study shows and secondly they're really incentivized to get you to read a study and click through something and they have to come up with a headline that makes that appealing and as you point out every week There's a great example of one where the headline is patently false uh at worst and at best so misleading as to be useless so what I think is valuable for folks is to get into the habit of checking that once a week and seeing hey that was a headline I could see that headline I could see how I'd get fallen you know I'd get duped for that but oh there's the study that really had you know the headline could be something as outrageous as women are so much more likely to you know outlive their Partners if they have sex three times a week and then you look at the study and it's about this rare species of fruit fly that's sometimes mate with male fruit flies that die a little premature like you know me it can be so ridiculous well I really appreciate you're pointing that out and anybody can subscribe for free just type into Google obesity and energetics offerings you'll find it if not email me and and I hope Andrew Brown who's a professor and a former mentor of mine at

[02:05:31] University of Arkansas now is listening he took over handling that category a few years ago he does a beautiful job with it and so um he sets these things up and often finds these interesting things and and even got to the point where others picked up on his use of the phrase in mice as kind of like a standard thing which is is just as often a way of saying we found this in mice and but the in mice is often left off in the headlines so how many people are involved in curating that list each week it's uh in any one week it's about five people uh including me um so there's me there's an editor then there's Andrew who uh cleans everything up and then there's Cole Borland who cleans everything up and someone else who posts it that's a lot of work for um but it rotates so the editor rotates every week but the rest of us including me are on thank you for never asking me to be an editor on that I hadn't thought about it until now maybe

[02:06:33] I would no it is a lot of work but it's fun it's a labor of love Yeah well David thank you so much this was was a super fun discussion and I know that folks are going to get a kick out of it thank you Peter great to be here with you [Music] no
