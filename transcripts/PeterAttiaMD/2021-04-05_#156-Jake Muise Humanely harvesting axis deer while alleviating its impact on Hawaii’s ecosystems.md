## Description

Jake Muise is an avid hunter, environmentalist, and advocate for the preservation of Hawaii’s natural resources. He is the founder of Maui Nui Venison, a company which actively manages Hawaii’s imbalanced population of axis deer by harvesting them as a food resource. In this episode, Jake tells his unbelievable backstory growing up in Northern Alberta before landing in Hawaii on a volleyball scholarship where he fell in love with the islands and the people. Jake explains how axis deer—a non-native species—were brought to the islands and how they have since become imbalanced to the detriment of Hawaii’s precious ecosystems. He goes on to explain the incredible lengths that his company has taken to ensure the most humane harvesting techniques imaginable resulting in a food source that is as clean and healthful as can be. Additionally, Jake and Peter examine what makes meat from axis deer one of the most nutrient-dense red meats on the planet.

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:11] all right jake looking forward to uh to talking about a lot of things today here thanks for uh thanks for taking time out of work today i know it's a busy time of year for you guys oh my pleasure man i'm uh definitely looking forward to it so i don't even know where to begin man um i almost feel like the easiest way to begin this is to to sort of have people kind of get to know your story a little bit sort of the way i've gotten to know it um uh you know we're both canadians i guess we have that going for us for better or worse yeah um yeah i was reading my son a book yesterday about canada that one of his canadian cousins got him and i was kind of trying to explain to him canada is like the united states it has provinces instead of states and he wanted to know which one i was from and you know i'm like pointing to toronto and that at all this stuff and then he's looking at the northern part and he's like well what's up there and i was like yeah that's the arctic like yeah most people don't live up there but of course most people isn't jake so you're grown up in the arctic right which is kind of not normal um yeah i so we grew up in a small town called rainbow lake and rainbow lake was technically in the arctic circle right up on the northern alberta border closer to the northwest territories and who was i was just having a conversation yesterday with somebody about ice fishing like you try and explain ice fishing to your kid and they're just like wait what are you talking about like you just sit in a box like in a hole that's potentially like four feet deep oh that was the conversation we were having yesterday was i remember my dad at six feet tall having one of the ice augers where you cut that hole in the ice and him going all the way down like burying it at six feet and being like damn it and like pulling it out of the hole and not getting to the water like that's how cold it was um and we were it was a great conversation because i can't wait to introduce my kids to that it's such a it's such an amazing experience and obviously lots of resilience comes from living in a place like that but yeah we started out um my dad was in the oil industry and he we moved around a lot but it was mostly mostly in northern alberta and we ended up in a town called rainbow lake that was a seven hour drive from any other town meaning you were seven hours north of edmonton oh no we were we were 14 hours north of edmonton so you weren't going to like euler's games or anything i went to one oilers game i i got to i got to see i would have been eight or nine and we drove all the way down it took like a day and a half and i got to see gretzky and messier and like i can still remember walking in and not under understanding why they were so big like having never been to like a professional sports game before and and like just seeing on tv like you walk in and the players are huge like they just look like giants so yeah it was but part of that isolation was um my dad was a subsistence hunter and like i mean ultimately i think where this that's where this conversation goes but we like my dad every single year would shoot a moose and that's what we ate all winter long and we would go down to a place um closer to calgary for the summer just to get out of the like you remember you got mosquitoes like this big right just to get out of there um and i remember my mom having to essentially pack for eight months like eight to nine months she would be collecting groceries like all summer long and we'd had a huge trailer that we'd take back up with us to this small town i think it was only a couple thousand people um and part of that was she wasn't bringing any stakes like she exp like i remember telling her stories like we ate pheasant pablum as kids and moose meat and yeah so we were definitely we were definitely way up there um what kind of chores did you have as a kid because i'm like this morning i i asked my daughter to do the dishwasher and then it's like taking the trash out like these are sort of these are the chores you do if you live in toronto or austin yeah what are the chores of the arctic um well there was always the inside chores and i remember getting relegated to the bathroom and with three boys that was always a mess but like like i remember having to clean bathrooms but i remember did you ever have to shovel the roof no i never i i was the snow shoveler and i loved shoveling snow growing up because it was such a good workout it was amazing but i never i guess we never had enough snow that the roof was at structural risk so one of the regular chores was you had to shovel the roof and so you had to like get up there and you would like you could never do it like from the top because like if everything came you'd like do it the traveling yeah yeah and then you would of course strategically do it so you would pile it all up so you could jump off after and have fun but i remember several winters the like the snow bank connected to the roof and we were able to like snowboard off the roof into the snow bank and like we had all like igloos and it was such a yeah such an interesting experience to live up there and then you remember um like i can remember being so cold like you would stop moving like i think the early onsets of like hypothermia um and like having to like come in the house and get warmed up and then go back outside like i remember my dad telling us like if you start to feel tired you need to come in the house and he realized that was potentially like the early onset of hypothermia and we just thought like oh if we're tired we should come in the house um did you live in proximity to people who were generationally there in ui i don't know what we would call i don't know i mean we called them inuit when i was growing up i don't know if there's there's maybe some new politically correct term for eskimo inuit um no we didn't um i think we were primarily in these oil towns um i remember i remember meeting them because it was it was odd as like a function of diversity i mean it was amazing but no it wasn't uh it wasn't something that we were really connected to at that point yeah the reason i was asking is i had been so curious to know what their hunting methods were and what their you know because you want to talk about people who have truly adapted to that climate yeah and for for eight to ten months there's not a single leafy green available like you want to chew on a pine cone it's fine but and i and i think and i don't know this fear obviously the vast majority of their diet was meat um because that was the only thing available i i can remember the taste of moose meat like moose the nickname up there was they were called swamp donkeys because the vast majority of the summer they spent their time in swamps and they're eating all of these like legumes or lily pads or all of these things that were floating around and there was like a really distinct taste to them it was so interesting so and then all of a sudden everything would melt like it was this extreme melt off everything would be like absolutely muddy for an entire month like it couldn't move anywhere like it was such a mess i just remember my mom yelling at us about like mud being in the house and then we'd pack up and head south for the summer and it was this this cycle for several years before um i moved out to nova scotia canada on the east coast of canada when we were 16. yeah so the other thing that came out of reading my son this story yesterday was explaining to him that i'd never been east of quebec city which is kind of weird like i grew up in canada but you know go to montreal went to quebec city once never been to nova scotia which i always is something i always want to see because the east coast of canada looks breathtaking to me in many ways uh you know i'd love to see you know st john's i'd like to go to the very tip of canada um so nova scotia is obviously like you might as well be moving to the caribbean from the arctic um yeah but it's still cold water right yeah yeah it's i mean it's it's there's still like slush that forms in this like in the sea water during the winter it's still absolutely freezing and there was still tons of snow but the temperatures were just so much more moderate throughout the year there was like there wasn't these crazy you know ups and downs and that was where uh talk about freezing that was where we started i started surfing like you've you've exp you've experienced this in the great lakes like the biggest waves were like these wind waves and when like winds well on a lake was like the greatest thing ever as a kid you were just like these are the biggest waves of my life and we showed up and i remember like getting to canada and one of the first things my dad did was take us to the beach and i think he already knew what was going to happen and he took us to the beach and we just couldn't believe like the size of these waves and we were playing in the waves and then we thought we saw seals out at one of the points and then one of these seals stands up on a surfboard because they're in like a full black wetsuit and one of these seals like stand and i can remember it like they stand up on this surfboard and me and my like little brother looked at each other and we were just like like we were done we were like we need to do that and that started a long and um semi dangerous career in surfing in nova scotia it was just so cold and the best swell was always during the winter months and we couldn't afford like good wetsuits and we used to wear toques what are they called beanies here in hawaii we used to wear a toque in the water and try not to duck dive thinking that like that would help and how many millimeters were your wetsuits well we didn't have any to start so we would go for as long as we could like end of september october and then like you literally couldn't even get in the water it was so cold and then i remember getting the first the first wetsuit i got was an old navy dive suit and it was four millimeters and like literally could not move my arms like it was just like a it was so thick and um but we i mean we didn't my parents couldn't afford any of that stuff like i wasn't even i wasn't i couldn't extend my hockey career because my dad couldn't afford skates fast enough we were growing out of them like um the first surfboard we made we went to what is canadian tire went to canadian tire and bought a bunch of styrofoam and duct taped it together and that was like our first surfboard and then gradually things got better like we started instead of shoveling snow for money i started a little grass cutting company of my own in our neighborhood we started saving money and we were able to buy like our first real wetsuit and then buy like our first like real surfboard and um yeah it was and just fell in love with the ocean and then obviously i mean it's jumping forward but the move to hawaii after that you can imagine the university of hawaii calling and saying he wants you to come out here and i was like wait where where do i sign well so yeah let's back up for a second and all of this business where do you discover your passion for volleyball because that's obviously what got you out to hawaii yeah um the last year we were in northern alberta um you know how it goes you always do what your older brother does right you've you've got an older brother or is he young no i'm the oldest you're the oldest so whatever josh did i did and and josh started playing volleyball and um i remember just going to a couple practices and i don't know if it's because we jumped on the trampoline so much as a kid or i did martial arts for a while i did taekwondo we picked it up pretty fast because we were coordinated and then we moved and it was probably my saving grace when we moved to nova scotia because it was a skill set i had that let me meet a whole bunch of people and i think my parents just doubled down on it saying like we're just gonna stick him in a whole bunch of volleyball like whether it was you know middle school or club ball it was just it was just such a great way to integrate us into a new community at the age of you know 15 16 when it's pretty awkward so and and that was it it was just a sport that and i did i think every other sport under the sun like through high school but it was the one that stuck and it was one of those things like you know driving or bow hunting for for you like you just you you just never hesitated to do more and more and more of it so it was something that we fall in love with and got to do that at a really high level for like through the teens including like canada's youth olympic program and then like junior olympic programs and then it was actually at a junior olympic program that the university of hawaii saw me play and you know what was hilarious is i found out later what sealed the deal was i sent them so tino reyes who was like the assistant coach i sent him pictures of us surfing with icebergs in the background and and i guess they were on the fence about me because i'm small like i'm only six feet tall and um he had like he fought for me saying if this kid can do this whatever we're gonna get like the level of resiliency we're gonna get out of him is gonna be like it's gonna be worth it even if we're losing a couple inches um so yeah that helped me get there and i mean volleyball has taken me all over the world it's been it's been amazing so um so you arrive to this amazing division one volleyball school at literally the furthest place you can go i don't think you can stay in north america and go further than nova scotia to oahu can you i mean i guess you could have gone to you know uh or something yeah yeah yeah yeah but but um okay so you've gone as far as possible um how much of a culture shock is that and how quickly do you kind of assimilate uh because there's actually kind of some similarities i think in the culture as well right yeah absolutely i think the initial shocks were tiny like i remember oh here's a good one when i came on my recruiting trip they were obviously really smart they were like here's the university here's this amazing stadium that holds 10 000 people they got like the best attendance for volleyball in the country and then they take me to the beach and they're like here's a pair of board shirts and here's a surfboard go for it we're going to pick up like tomorrow and they had dropped me off at my hotel and you're you'll love this as a canadian i go to put the board shorts on and i'm like well where's the liner like where's the where's the white stuff like where's the liner and obviously every pair of shorts i'm wearing like we didn't even board church didn't exist in canada in 1999 and like i remember like being so confused and i was like what must mean i have to wear my underwear with these things which of course you're not supposed to do so i put the tidy whities on underneath the board shorts tie them up head out to like kaiser bowls which is like a straight local break like it was right in front of the hotel and then paddling out with like the tidy white he's hanging out the back and like locals are looking at me and just shaking their head like oh what are we like and pasty white so like there were definitely some incremental culture shocks including realizing that your shorts didn't have to have liners in them um and and then when i got when i got to the university of hawai'i so that would um recruiting trip was the spring before and then when i arrived in september also like a accidental shock which turned out to be the best probably the best thing in my life was they they messed up my dorm assignment and they put me and this is where like all of the folks you know come into play they put me in the dorm for all of the local kids that didn't have good enough grades so they were taking the summer program to get into school and they happened to throw me in the wing with all the molokai kids and i mean hey like i had never on the recruiting trip was so short like i remember seeing different things but like i had never been around a polynesian population before and you're like you're astounded how big these people are and so i remember walking in the front door at johnson hall and opening up the door and they're all sitting around playing music they're playing like playing their ukulele and one of the like the the biggest person i've ever seen in my life like six two three hundred pounds had an ukulele that looked like this big like i don't know he's playing music and they're like are you in the right place and i was like johnson hall b they're like yeah i was like room 201 and i was like yeah and there's just like dead silence and there's like eight of them and they're like the biggest one was like boy we're gonna eat you and i was just like and true molokai fashion true aloha fashion best friends like literally after that statement they're like well you're here we're going to take care of you and that's like there's this resounding theme here that they'll always give somebody the chance up front they will always assume you have your like everybody's best interest in mind until you don't and it was the best thing that ever happened in my life like they they took me under their wing and i mean everything like all of the best parts of my life have come from walking into the wrong dorm for sure let's uh hit pause for one second and give people a little bit of an understanding about what is so unique about molokai because for many people listening to this podcast they'll certainly understand the big island kona and most people have you know if they've gone to hawaii they've probably been to maui and uh people understand that you know honolulu sits on oahu and that's the most populous island so you know you've sort of got these three islands that get all of the attention um but then there's some other islands that are a little less understood and and sort of you know you go into the more exotic you go out to kauai and people would maybe even go to lanai but molokai is very rarely touched i feel privileged to have been there several times it to me is a very special place but i don't think uh i think it's worth spending a few moments diving into what you just talked about which is tell us about this island both from its geography and perhaps more importantly its culture and why you would you know why that would lead you to conclude what you've concluded since sure i mean no part of what i'm about to say is going to justify how special that place is so i'll start there it's 10 miles by 30 miles i think it's about 180 000 acres and there are 7 000 people and that population has i think stayed the same for for a long time and of those 7 000 people i would guess 6 000 of them are true locals like it is very much an island of like a local population and a loca and certainly a one of the higher pear density populations of hawaiians as well it is what makes it so special is they have fought for years and years and years to keep moloka'i the exact same way it has always been there isn't like there's no there's no stoplights there's no major resorts like me there's a few that came up in the 80s um no no escalators there's actually a town ordinance that says no building can exceed the height of the tallest palm tree on the island yes and the people there are so active in maintaining this community there's there's no people in moloka'i that are hungry like you don't see homeless people downtown it's an extraordinary place they really do like care for all of the members of their community as best they can and on top of that is i think the vast majority of the food there maybe not vast majority but i'd say 50 50 comes from the ocean or comes from the land so they're either like either a subsistence hunting so there's there's deer black buck goats and pigs on that island or or more importantly they're the ocean they have the longest standing reef in hawaii on the south shore of moloka'i the ocean is teeming with or i mean it's still teeming with fish and and people are constantly eating it so all of these things like they've they've fought to protect all of these natural resources they fought to protect their way of life because moloka is beaches are extraordinary like there's no they're probably the nicest in the state like you could easily put up a ritz carlton or something else there but the community has said no and they've taken there was a failed attempt to put up a fancy resort on the north shore wasn't there yeah yeah la al point um and they fought for years and years and years and they won and and and that comes with you know consequences as a function of economics and they don't care like everybody said this is like this is the way we want to live the community at large has said we don't we don't need to look like a waikiki we don't need to look like a maui um and and coming from northern alberta coming from a place that like you're eating there were so and canada as a whole i think um there were so many similarities in culture i think that's what made it really easy for me to assimilate into that place and like find so much comfort in those visits and part of that was the east coast of canada was so damn far that i couldn't i couldn't i couldn't afford but i couldn't go back it was just too much of a hall to go back and forth so every like every long weekend or christmas break or any like they picked me up and like the family said you're coming with us and they it was just an overnight um they call it hanai it's the hawaiian word for adoption so i was denied by the same family as you know mike good friend of mine incredible human being incredible hunter so i was hanaid by that same family and i mean it's history like they've i've been there i've been a part of that family as long as i've been a part of my you know that family in canada so yeah just so lucky and so fortunate to get to be a part of that place and and have have it i mean i grew up i think part of my adult life like i grew up as a as a function of that place and the cultural values it has yeah well we're going to come back to mike i'm sure because he's he's certainly one of my favorite people on the planet and uh some of my favorite images are just the thoughts of mike as a teenager like the concept of high school mike is so funny to me just oh man it was the best yeah i loved that i did and yeah uh we can we'll definitely get back into that for sure so um so let's just briefly kind of get through so you you end up having a very successful career at the university of hawaii do you do you guys not do you guys win the nc2a title during one of your years right oh man yeah we we win it and then it gets taken back oh i don't think i knew that part a little bit of us like well it's a long story but we win the title some rules get changed after the title is won for political reasons then they take the title away um it was a it was a mess but yeah we we were we were top three in the country every single year um an incredible program you know in integrating that into like just regular college life as a whole uh tossing on top of that like a student athlete schedule i think lots of lessons learned there as well um and then obviously post college i continued that career into europe um but that entire time like being you know being able to go to moloka'i and learning more about that culture learning more about axis deer um yeah it was it was it was an amazing experience and as an athlete and i don't think i really realized this till like the third year because your first two years you're you're still 19 and 20 you're probably you're an idiot anyway like um i remember in my third year thinking i feel so much better when i have deer meat in my freezer so we were going back and hunting and bringing like we were broke like how to starve through college without access deer like we were going back hunting jumping on like the super tiny plane like filling up coolers that were way overweight and then like bargaining with people on our floor for freezer space we're like hey we'll give you a couple pounds if like you store 10 pounds in your freezer um and i remember in my in my third year as i like i think i started like realizing how the benefits of building strength and lifting weights and all of those things and i remember thinking like man i feel so much better when i have access to your here um yeah so it kind of all got intertwined and and um college was yeah college was just such an amazing experience to combine those two things you know obviously we're going to talk in such depth about access deer yeah at the time how much did you understand was it frankly just like oh yeah this is kind of a local pest here and you know this is something that we hunt here because it's so prevalent or did how much did you understand the history of how they got there and what the true significance ecologically was did you did you know any of that at the time i honestly didn't it was it was it was entirely recreational it was only later it was only later when i saw like the first instance of like there's these there's these periods where there's too many axis deer and essentially they'll lay down and die they don't have any feed it was only when i started seeing the impact that i started saying wait a second because that that animal on the island of moloka'i is is is revered like nobody's running around moloka'i calling it an invasive species um that's been a part of that culture for a hundred plus years they find extreme value in it they understand the detriment that it's there and i think there's hope for better or better management options in the future but the family when the family introduced me to it they didn't introduce it to me as the idea of it's an invasive pest we need to control it was introduced as this is an amazing resource that we get to utilize and something we really enjoy recreationally and so that and i didn't know anything more than that it wasn't again it wasn't till i experienced or saw some of those things that started to kind of put it together so post college you go off to europe you're playing professional volleyball and you you decide you're going to try out for the canadian olympic team obviously you don't get you don't get to make that choice just willy-nilly you have to be invited you're good enough you you go to camp and you come up one short right yeah which by anybody's standard is remarkable right to be the to be the the last guy that almost made it to the olympic team and canada's a very good uh uh team in volleyball right like it's not like yeah you know it's sort of yeah i always say like top 10 in the world yeah it's like in swimming in the united states that poor person who finishes third at the olympic trials because the only united states only takes two per event that person who finishes third would easily be in the finals for most events in swimming so it's sort of similar yeah um is is it how heartbreaking is this i mean i was i was honest i don't think i've ever talked about this with anybody i was devastated like i flew i closed my contract in um bali uh a month early flew back to canada to like make it to tryouts i thought i had like an incredible tryout and they just had this guy that it and his guy had looked up to he just had this guy there for eight years and he was so calm and such a phenom and canada had one of its best teams ever so it wasn't like this is gonna be a building year this was like we're gonna try and get our best placement in the olympics ever and and they did um and they just yeah they said you're one short and it was amazing because that was the last goal i had like that was the last goal i had for my volleyball career after who even knows hundreds of thousands of hours i just remember thinking like well what now like and the first thing was well i'm going to molokai like it was i had zero plans like my plan was i was going to stay in canada for the in indefinitely and train with the olympic team like that was the plan had you thought past that this was 04 i'm guessing yeah yeah so this is athens game so was you did you think that okay i'm going to make the olympic team we're going to go off to athens i'm going to come back and then i'm going to do what did you think i want to coach or did you always think you were going to go back to hawaii i so i had to take a little step back because my my capstone class in college for marketing and management i wrote a business plan that actually won to mimic the model of new zealand and domesticate access deer and and so near the end of college i started to formulate these ideas of how i was going to manage or what what could we do that was a better option and so the two years in europe i started i started a non-profit called the access deer institute and well you're a good buddy so i can tell you this it was a complete it was a complete farce because nobody would give me any of the studies out of india so you know you get like those little snippets when you go on google you can like pull up a study and you get the snippet but you can't download the whole thing well like through the capstone class in college i was trying to collect all of this like population information on axis dear biological like i was trying to like i was trying to figure it out and nobody would give me any information so i started a non-profit called the access deer institute so when i emailed somebody i could say hey this is jake muse with the i'm the executive director of the access deer institute i'm still in college now we'd love to get this study to incorporate with what we're doing here in hawaii and all of a sudden like i just like all of these studies started flooding in i was like this is amazing so i had all of this information and that came with me to europe that was like kind of my past time in europe was digging into all of those things so to answer your question of what was the plan after that it was at that point it was okay what can what can we do that was like the next obsession and passion was what can we do to better manage access to your so that was already a thought part of the thought process so there was a little bit of a backdrop when you know i remember sitting in front of the two coaches and them saying yeah you're you're not going to make it and like i didn't even have a return flight because like this is one way and i called my mom and i said i'm going to hawaii and interestingly enough i landed went straight to molokai and four days later met my wife on molokai um and that started i mean started a whole bunch of things but spent the summer there played another year in europe and while in europe she said well what are we doing like let's go home and let's go home and do this thing let's make babies let's just do it and that was it like that was the trigger to say okay like we're going home um so that's how i found my back my way back to hawaii permanently was i mean through that like through molokai and my wife is from molokai and accessteer was already like it was already there um well i didn't know i didn't know what i was going to do but it was there so let's let's now go back and explain to folks what these access deer are how they got to hawaii how many of them there are where they are um because again now it starts to kind of dovetail into my obsession which is relatively new this is an obsession for me personally that's only been going on for two years and uh that coincides with when you and i met um so before you give the real story i will just say at a distance that my attraction to access deer can only be described as a love at first sight it's you know growing up in canada you see whitetail all day long i mean i basically just saw them as things not to hit with your car that is basically like you know this is like this is a thing you don't want to hit right and uh they weren't an issue in toronto where i grew up but because my dad had a quarry outside of toronto my dad had a couple of quarries north of toronto where we would spend some time that's where you would really see you know the whitetail um but it was something very different the first time i laid eyes on an axis deer which was oh that's a totally different animal like that's regal right that's that's breathtaking um and obviously as we get more and more into this discussion when you start to talk about what it means to hunt that deer and what it means to harvest that deer and what it means to eat that deer again it just lives in kind of its own category but this is obviously not a species of deer that is native to hawaii so how did it get there and where did it come from oh okay 1868 king kamemia v hired the matheson trading company to get them out of india my my wife um she translates hawaiian newspapers odd odd sidebar here only five percent of hawaii's newspapers are translated so 95 of their history is buried in there so she helps translate newspapers but she's found she can search them digitally by hawaiian words so she's found all these incredible articles and the article explains them like coming down the yangtze river on a boat called the loch nagar them arriving on oahu there were there were two bucks and five does and just for folks who maybe don't aren't familiar with deer the bucks are the males the females are the does yeah um and so they they stay on the ship on oahu and then actually on the way from oahu to moloka'i us a a baby buck was born and they named it king commander the fifth and they arrive on moloka'i and so they're only placed on the island of moloka'i none were put on oahu uh and they put a kapu they put a restriction on harvesting them for the local people there they were there at that point the king's deer and they didn't understand like they didn't understand this animal i don't i still don't know why he sought this particular animal at that point hawaii was trading with like people all over the pacific and they could have done whitetail or el i mean who knows um so it's really interesting to unders like i don't know why he picked that particular animal but i mean it is beautiful it's it's a exactly yeah and maybe that's what it was um [Music] but they get through this small idea of moloka'i and they start to proliferate very quickly and i think as early as i think it was 1898 there's articles about them thinking there was estimating there were 7 000 deer and they were already decimating what they were like describing in the upland forests and the subsequent year there's an article about them hiring shooters they called them sharpshooters from california and the sharpshooters from california recorded killing five thousand deer and it's it's amazing like at the same time a couple years later there's an article in the then what would have been like territorial government about them arguing over the management of axis deer and two of actually the hawaiian reps were saying we have to do something about this like they're going to continue to destroy our upland forests so as as far back as what is that that's a hundred years ago as far back as a hundred years ago people were already recognizing the the impacts access deer were having on the communities what's their replication cycle uh how long uh is their gestation cycle how many uh babies and you know blah blah blah gestational period is 238 days it's very similar to humans yeah right yeah so three three fawns so three baby deer every two years they don't do twins but what makes axis deer so prolific and they're one of the very few deer species on the planet that are like this is a deer every year is called casting their antlers so a deer every year their antlers fall off um and during that period where the antlers fall off their testosterone levels drop and their sperm is not viable for reproduction and so you'll see those long periods and i'm sure that's evolutionary through so throughout the winters et cetera et cetera so access deer are a tropical species and when they cast their antlers their testosterone levels stay high enough to breed year round so their population dynamics look like 33 a year like they look like those hockey stick curves once they get started and i'm sure king kamehameha kamehameha the fifth had no idea that was the case um and you toss in extra i mean you've seen these animals they're extraordinarily healthy the worst we take data on every single animal we harvest and of the 15 000 year we've harvested of the of those does of those females 89 are lactating or pregnant at the time of harvest so they are such a prolific species and then you put them in hawaii where there's obviously no predators perfect feed they can jump six to eight foot fences and move wherever they need to to maintain their own health and you've you've got a pretty astounding well invasive species but also resource so well that's that's part of the thing too is they you know i sort of try to you know the other day i posted something on instagram something archery related and you know someone asked a comment which was i don't see the sport in this like i don't you know how hard can it be to shoot a deer with a with a bow and an arrow and but they didn't they were they were actually very inquisitive like it you know again i'm not normally one to get into discussions on instagram but you could tell this person really asked from a point of inquisition and that's not an uncommon question and um i say you know i didn't get into it on instagram but if i mean if if someone asked me that question i typically say look you're absolutely right i mean there are some animals where you know shooting a pig isn't the hardest thing in the world but every animal does have a super power and you need to know that so for example with pigs their superpower is smell they can smell you at a very great distance and so if you are not downwind of them they will sniff you out you don't just walk up to a pig and take a shot at it you have to at least use uh this the the smell its capacity for smell which is so far in excess of ours your advantage we've talked about muflon right mufon have a superpower of sight it's sort of comical what they can see the thing i sort of explain to people when they ask me why are you so interested in this axis deer is i say as far as i can tell they have three superpowers their sense of smell their vision and their hearing they're they're pretty natural i mean the this animal is so superior to us on at least those three senses that it's about as hard as any animal to get within 100 yards of it's it's you know it's it's you have to be doing everything right to get within 100 yards of it and that's not close enough to take a shot by the way with the bow so then you really have to do something heroic if you want to be able to take that shot so that's sort of an aside but i think it comes to this point which is this is an animal that spent a billion years evolving to escape tigers and you know and jaguars yeah so it's like it it honed its skill in an evolutionary environment that was remarkable and you know when you consider how clumsy we would be relative to the animals it evolved to avoid that you know in some ways you know it's it's amazing we can ever get near them yeah and it goes a little bit deeper because you look at i mean tigers are probably one of the most efficient predators on the planet but then you look at how axis deer like what their natural habitat is and they're these there are fringe grazers throughout the indian like forests and plains so they had to evolve all of these evasive skills in thick jungle and like i see it some like i think there's a fourth sense sometimes because i'm like they didn't see me they didn't hear me the wind's perfect i'm like they're like there's no way and i think they like to evade tigers in dench brush and foliage and like they would have had to have such incredible observational skills and i think that's where you see it in like in india they team up with um monkeys and they use like monkeys as alarms in hawaii they'll team up with like minor birds like they are so advanced and you're right like 100 yards and you're like this is amazing and then even if inside of 50 yards they can dodge an ariel unless they are completely oblivious so you i mean we've how many times we'll come back to that yeah yeah yeah we we will come back to that for sure i agree with you by the way i think there's a pattern recognition that they have that other animals might not have to the same extent which is it's like they know in a certain situation even if they can't smell see or hear you there's the potential risk that something could be there and that's enough to make them skittish and yeah they are that's amazing they are relying on third-party information like they're not relying on just their own they're so tuned in to their environment and i think it plays into they have one of the smallest home range of deer as well so they encompass and they're highly opportunistic so they'll bounce around from area to area so i think when they find places that are safe and they recognize that both as a function of probably like feed and water but what inputs they're getting from their surrounding environment they stay there yeah so to the person's point on instagram i mean you you hear this from every hunter like if you can successfully harvest an axis deer you can you can with a bow you can do almost any other animal on the planet um so and to your credit you're getting pretty pretty good at it my friend so when did you so so let's go back to your arrival to to molokai um are you now back in contact with mikey have you guys decided hey like like what what is he doing at this point in time and and um because obviously i know where i want to go with this story is how you guys get into basically the rescue side of this um and the most amazing story is where we're gonna go with those access deer that make their way over to the big island um so so help me you know help me with that path um well mikey's always my first call and so and so for the folks listening like mikey is the second adopted son to this family so we're both like an adopted son to this family um and mikey's my first one of my first phone calls after knowing i wasn't i was going to moloka because i'm like mikey what are you doing i'm coming home the plan was we were going to put our backpacks on and we were going gonna go hunt at least four or five areas that we'd never been to we weren't even sure if you could walk to but we're like we're gonna find out what's over there i met my wife and mikey was like what happened to our plans and i'm like well but the the mikey was always that first call for me he was he was my partner and so in in coming back it actually took a little while i there was no opportunity right in front of me and i didn't have like i had a little bit of money saved up via um via volleyball but there were i also didn't have like the answer yet i didn't i didn't quite know what what was gonna do so like it was always this like instance of learning more and mikey was my hunting partner and mike actually great story um i actually bought and sold a real estate publication for a year who knows i then got a job managing a pest control company and the the so doing fumigations those huge tarps on your back and the place was a mess guess who the first person i called was i was like mikey you're going to be my lead fumigator we're going to show everybody like mikey's putting like 200 pound tarps on his back and like going up and down ladders like he's a squirrel um and we me and mikey crushed that business for three or four years or about three years and then in and amongst doing all that somebody the access dear institute was still going we were collecting all of this information we're starting to actually help other folks better understand accessteer with the information we were collecting and then somebody illegally dropped off deer on the big island which is you know all of the islands can fit within the big island it's the big island for a reason is hawaii island somebody illegally drops off axis deer and we happen to be you know the axis deer institute but me and mike happen to be the experts on axis deer maybe accidentally okay wait just hit pause i want to come back to this right away but i i don't think i knew that i think i didn't know the story about you being the access to your institute i love that and we're going to come up with a logo um nick is going to come up with a logo for that i i've got a t-shirt it's old you can have it like i actually like made t-shirts but but i think one part of the story we missed was that by this point in time two other islands are now inhabited by axis deer lanai and maui sure how and when did that happen relative to the 1860s with the initial introduction to malachi yeah great great step back um in the 1920s the then i the then owner of the island of lanai a really amazing story about how they round up all the deer but they chose to introduce deer from moloka'i to lanai and lanai is half the size of moloka'i very very shortly that population became fully established at what we can like what we call carrying capacity the overall population of deer is only going up and down each year with available feed and or how many fawns are surviving and a survey uh five years ago there was twenty one thousand access deer on this very very small island um which topographically doesn't have anything in common with molokai i mean molokai i believe has the tallest the highest freshwater waterfalls in the world i mean it looks like something out of jurassic park it is not it is not anything like what people think of when they think of hawaii yeah so yeah absolutely and and i think to that point shows how adaptable access deer really are to become established so quickly regardless of the environment so the next phase which is really interesting so deer are introduced to maui in the 1960s but under controversy you think by now there's common knowledge that this is not like there are issues with this animal and they had if i remember it correctly they had about 20 deer in a pan on lanai and 10 of them were slated for maui and 10 of them were slated for the big island and the cattlemen's association on the big island and i remember like reading stories about like national park reps from across the country like there's this huge outcry on the big island that said no way we're not bringing this animal to the big island it'll be detrimental and this is the state now so this isn't like a private introduction this is the state saying we think it's in the island's best interest to move more of these axis deer around um so long story short the big island says no they get introduced to the island of maui maui is i'm always 460 000 acres so the population on maui is still what we consider an emerging population so they're continuing to grow they haven't reached carrying capacity and in so this year we estimate the population on maui to be about 60 000 year but the population will max out at 210 000 dear and essentially maui is another very dynamic landscape that looks in some areas completely different than molokai but they'll find all of those places and they'll they'll feel themselves in unless we're able to you know get ahead of that so and just to round it out where is malakai today population wise it's an estimate so because we don't have a full survey but i would say moloka'i is at about 60 to 70 000 deer and remember there's only 7 000 people and probably the best way oh this would be really interesting how far are you from what they consider texas hill country isn't it outside austin yeah we're three hours from i mean we're we're depends but we're three hours from where the access deer are in texas which is i think the only other state that has access deer right i don't think any other state castle in the u.s has access here besides hawaii and texas no where i'm going with this is i remember reading a whole bunch of studies on deer densities per acre and texas hill country had the densest deer acreage or densest number of deer per acre at about six per 100 acres and like wisconsin and mississippi was behind that hawaii in established areas has 25 deer per 100 acres so at least three x whatever the densest deer populations on the continent are well um so so yeah that's how they get to the three main islands um and then in 2000 and i think it was 2010 or 11 um was when that introduction by private individuals it wasn't the state um they decided they were gonna trap deer on maui fly them to excuse me the big island via helicopter drop them off how many deer did they take they dropped off four two and two and uh three and one three does in a buck and nobody and they do it quietly and nobody finds out about it till about a year and a half later um and that's when it started like that's when there was like weight there's a camera trap image actually a rancher saw it they called me and mike because we were already closely tied to [Music] i mean both my wife's family and my hanai family are in the conservation community and so we found out about it right away and everybody said if you got any chance of like finding these things here's the two guys to ask and we went out and looked in the area now remember it's actually i remember doing this the area they dropped them off they didn't know where they were somebody had just seen one in passing on the road the area was the size of molokai it was 70 square miles was like the management area so i remember like getting to the first one and being like we think there's deer in here and it's like a 70 square mile area and i just remember thinking how the hell are we going to find these animals and where and me and mike already knew how how extraordinary these animals were to find even when they were there's thousands of them i mean it's safe to say at this point you and mike know almost as much as any two people about their behavior now going back to mike growing up on molokai i mean literally walking to school every day hunting eating this animal every day i mean and i've hunted with mike which is you know one of the most remarkable experiences anyone can have um this is basically a guy who knows everything they this is the closest human to an axis deer like he's he's almost able to sprout antlers of his own that's as close as we will get in our evolution to them he just knows where they go yeah um so they reach out to you guys but this is the government that this is basically the state is saying we have a problem because we've got these three potentially more deer on the big island and if this thing's left unchecked it's it's going to be a catastrophe millions of deer yeah yeah and the big island being like our primary ag hub our primary food hub for and these obviously exit deer eat almost anything so it started a three-year project and it took us three years to find those animals and i mean you you know how difficult it is like to wake up every morning and either like walk quietly enough and then tune enough to like assume you're gonna see something or sit quietly enough like so you can like the the level of like i just remember being so exhausted mentally and we went a year and a half before we saw a deer and you don't mike like so it's like they're not here there's no way like it was this constant mental battle it was like we literally hunted almost every single day for a year and a half without seeing an animal yeah what i think is amazing about that is everything you just said which includes the idea that at some level in the back of your mind you have to be entertaining the thought they didn't survive right and you could be sitting here looking for a skeleton yeah and and i remember like sitting across like i remember me and mike being probably the perfect partners for this because whenever i was like there's not a chance man we've walked this place eight times but part of it was so big and it it's these it was an area that has it's very very windy so there's wind-blown trees over the vast majority of the area so think about a briar grove or what are they called um it literally was like doing yoga all day long like you were crawling in and through all of these trees which dear love so it was like physically exhausting but then it was mentally exhausting because you were only covering a certain amount of acres you're looking for like a single piece of scat or like deer feces you're looking for like a single rub you're looking for like anything that would tell you that they're there and what we didn't know was they had found a safe spot and were encompassing like it was less than 100 acres peter and so we were looking in like but part of i think what's important of this story is at the point we were like there has to be a better way that's when we learned and started like working with the military for the fleur equipment and the fleur equipment was ultimately what found them for us so flurry equipment picks up infrared or heat signatures from bodies and then they'll translate that into an electrical optical image for you to be able to view and the military was involved like it was such a big deal and the military loaned us one of their binocular units and me and mike were like it was that instant realization like how did we ever do this without this thing and that ultimately over a period of a couple months we were able to start chunking off huge areas of land in being able to view with great detail these areas from a thermography standpoint and that's how we found them you remember that first that you actually saw one oh it was crazy because mike was looking through it and it was we're doing all of this in the middle of the night because you can only really use fleur effectively in the middle of the night and i'm kind of have like my seat back in the tacoma and and i see like mike take his eyes off the binocular unit and then put his eyes on and then take his eyes off and he turned around and he looked like he'd seen a ghost he looked so like i didn't even know what it was like i thought he saw like a dead body or something and he's we saw and the only reason we saw it it was a bucking velvet and the velvet antler has so much blood in it so hot and it was it was like five miles away wow and we just saw like this velvet antler in this super dense cover and mike was like that's a dear like i think that's a deer and so i got on the binocular and we had been training for like i think like been training for this forever and so i stayed there and we like hooked up via radio and basically over the next four hours mike went down i guided and i'm in like via binocular unit and while he was going down there we saw several other deer i think it was two three more and yeah mike was able to find and get that buck he just missed the doe that was with it but we then knew like it was a brand new realization like they're here how many deer were there were there at the time was it still just four or they reproduced like crazy it was still just four actually it ended up being five but at the time we there were only four that we knew of and it still took you another year and a half to capture them all yeah because we weren't we weren't smart enough we bumped their home range and they moved several miles away and we had to go find them again like i mean at some point has the state of hawaii forgotten that they've hired you to do this like i mean this is three years this is the longest contractor job ever right i think i think everybody assumed we weren't going to do it and for a couple reasons one and this is not me i don't want to talk poorly about invasive species are such a prolific issue here in hawaii you think everything evolved here over millennia like anything we introduce is just like it's such a disaster it doesn't matter if it's a frog or a plant there's so much money spent on invasive species every year and the vast vast majority of it i would say the projects aren't what we would consider to be successful like we don't eradicate that animal and then you talk like on top of that you like everybody's basic knowledge of access to you were like these things are impossible to find um i think everybody assumed it wasn't gonna happen anyway so we had like a minuscule budget because me and mike rolling around like in an old tacoma that we actually was like that was lended to us with like half-assed equipment me and like mike's shoes have duct tape all over them um funding boosted pretty quick after we got the first deer but um i think everybody just assumed we would fail and and i think we would have had it not been for like i think just some of the resiliency with came with my and mike's partnership like i would be like there's no this is it like there's this is a waste of time and mike would be like ah let's just check over here and then mike would be like this is ridiculous like we're not gonna find anything i'd be like you know what let's like and i think that partnership was what ultimately got us to the first year and then once we like once we knew there were more deer it we could took ten years we were gonna find the rest of those deer and so part of that process with that floor equipment was now we were able to and we didn't realize how important the floor equipment would be for us in our lives but is that because you didn't appreciate how nocturnal they were or you didn't realize what an advantage you could have with that asymmetry of information at night you nailed both of it we didn't understand how much more active they were at night we didn't understand all of the behavioral cues of what was happening at night and then on top of it we started to realize really quickly through repetition wait that's the same pig we saw via like we're doing these surveys via helicopter that's the same pig we saw three days ago wait that's the same goat we saw three days ago so there was like we started to then realize how accurate the equipment was in its detection rates and so on top of being able to find more animals we're also getting significantly more confident in what we weren't seeing that we weren't missing anything so we were able to start a certification process to be like we know they're not here and ultimately when me and mike realize wait this thing is accurate enough that we can trust it it started like narrowing down like hundreds of thousands of acres to like wait they're not here we know we can go to the next place when when you're walking on the ground and me and mike are 20 feet apart and i can't see him like you're constantly questioning did i miss something right so that was ultimately what led to finding the rest of those deer and then that tool equated to like developing survey procedures for it which didn't exist anywhere else and i remember and that ultimately was what brought us to maui but i remember like finding and like removing that last deer and me and mike looking at each other like and we knew we were like oh [ __ ] we got them all how did you know that was the last one because it would suggest that these animals were so under stress that they didn't reproduce if they were together but not i mean they certainly had ample time to reproduce right yeah um we we're confident that was the last one in that area during the process of those three years we had sightings all over the big island that people thought were dearly there's no way i can say there's no deer on the big island i can confidently say at the time we were done that project we were well the guy the helicopter pilot that dropped it off who ended up being our best friend got for his restitution was 300 hours in a helicopter with us so like think about when you sit in your car like how much area you can cover like we can cover 10 000 acres in an hour we were we were recertifying acreage almost 10 times over with equipment we believe was like 95 accurate in detection rates we knew we did like we were getting so confident like we were getting so good we're we were marking beehives as our detection protocol okay we're going back into this area if we find the same beehive we're at a thousand feet in the air if we can find that same beehive in this area we'll consider that we didn't miss anything wow so so we're starting to yeah i think ultimately that's what gave us the confidence to say we're done and i'm not sure but anecdotally now eight years later there hasn't been another sighting in the area and man talk about life lessons like waking up every morning or actually to the second half of the project waking up every night at like six eating dinner with your family and then rolling out for 12 hours of using that floor equipment like not knowing what you're gonna find you know for for three like a three year hunt it was um any yeah apart from athletics i think any level of resiliency i have probably came from came from that project for sure what did your wife think i mean was this what she had signed up for the uh the nighttime working husband uh and you're on the big island was that something that she was that is that a has she always wanted to stay on molokai um her family uh in her teenage years some of them moved to the big island most importantly her mom and her mom are very close and we love molokai but it takes like there isn't there wasn't there wasn't any opportunity at that point like after we were married we were married on molokai like there wasn't there wasn't anything for for us to do like there were no there's no jobs on locally like and if they are they're they're like somebody's already lined up for whenever that position opens up so part of it was we needed to we had planned to start a family and wanted to start a life and we knew we needed a little bit more opportunity to do so we went to the big island a lot of our family were here so we did that my wife and i'll give her a shout out here and maybe you know it's interesting because i remember you telling me something about jill like unrelenting support it like there is no way i'm where i'm at i think i could probably say this about you without that level of support like it was always if that's what we're doing that's what we're doing and she is extraordinarily talented she's one of the best writers i know she's a graphic designer she's a genealogist like she constantly is putting things aside for and now and she's she's our co-founder at this company and one of our most important people but she constantly put things aside for what this was but part of it was these were huge ecological and community issues and and she was behind me a hundred percent um yeah it would have never happened without her because no i mean convincing any significant other to sleep by themselves every single night and then you roll in an absolute mess in the morning is not it's not conducive so and and i remember you telling me a long time ago that you didn't even take a day off for the first year right oh yeah it was seven days away it was a contrast yeah yeah because well i mean we thought we were gonna find him in the first week we're like oh they saw him over here me and mikey were like we're gonna walk every single day for 12 hours till we find them and like i remember like finishing the first month like by the end of the first month we were already like oh there's no deer here that guy didn't see something but what what ended up spurring on the rest of it was me and mike look through the entire and this is why mike is so good mike said if there is a deer here it's going to walk right there we're going to put up a camera trap so not like we're going to put up 100 camera traps and see i think we had three camera traps mike was like if there is a deer here he's gonna walk right there thinking like thousands of acres and sure enough like month four we got a camera trap image of a deer and that's like that was hard evidence and we were we were honestly as surprised as anybody at that point and we're like there's deer here um and so that obviously spurred on everything else that went along with it so it was yeah i mean you think how me and you've done some really hard four-day hunts together and at the end of that four days you're just like it was it was it was now i have a better understanding of why after a hard four day hunt that's hard for me you look like you've been sitting at the beach all day um so you guys go back to maui and is there something about the burden of access dear there that has you start to focus your effort and refine your thinking about what you and mike can be doing specifically there because at this point in time it's safe to say there's no real concerted strategy around what to do right you have this animal that and by the way in maui i don't think correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think the relationship between the people of maui and the axis deer is as affectionate as it might be on molokai right i mean i think the destruction is much greater yeah um i mean the first meeting i went to on maui they were won't mention the person but calling them spotted rats like i think they had already for sure found value within the subsistence community as that but they were dropped off in the central area for all ranching and so they they obviously directly compete with cattle for feed and they break fences and and they started to see that that population grow pretty quickly and so the excuse me the move from the big island to maui was primarily because of opportunity what ended up happening is the ranchers on maui who were of course watching this closely and saying don't let these things get established on the big island one particular rancher on maui said wait you guys actually got it done like you guys might know what you're doing like right as we close that project they said we've got tens of thousands of deer over here we don't care what you do with them just come and shoot them and i mean we couldn't do that like all of the all of the learnings and experience and like cultural values that we like that came from molokai were still very much like a part of who we were and and so for a rancher to be able to say like we'll just shoot them all like bury them we don't care that was like and we had already had like already done some research on like europe has an extensive venison industry new zealand has an extensive venison industry um and already had like thought that thought process and that but that was the trigger to say wait there's got to be a better way because by this point that was already happening on other on lanai they were basically shooting these things out of helicopters and just letting them die on the i mean it it sort of became this issue of look these things are causing so much damage and i also want to get into some of the specifics of the damage because as i would learn and i was surprised to learn this it wasn't just hey they're competing for the same resources as the cattle which is the you know the business here but it's how that would even trickle into the ecology of the ocean that was completely new to me and i i simply wouldn't have understood the nitrogen balance and the change in all of that um so yeah it's the the farmers understandably are saying look i don't care what has to happen if the government is willing to get into helicopters with ar-15s and shoot these things out of the air i'm happy to have the carcasses laying around and and explain a little bit more about what the full extent of the life cycle is in terms of the disruption to the native species there from basically land to water um yeah so i mean we have to take a little bit of a step back in terms of evolution in that hawaii is the most isolated landmass on the planet everything here evolved a kind of textbook adaptive radiation like everything over here has evolved over millennia to to be best suited for its environment right here which included no large mammals apart from a bat and certainly no grazing herbivores so like we have mints that are mint-less like we are and now we are the endangered species capital of the world we have more endangered species per acre here than anywhere else in the world i think we're i think 30 of the endangered species list in the u.s is all plants birds from hawaii and that is a function of the introduction of non-native species and how they affect biodiversity so the impact of axis deer you know peter probably the most influential impact to our like communities as a whole is at the very top of our mountains and you've been to one of those places they are again as one of the most isolated land masses water is probably i mean you guys had some issues with water this week like water is one of the most important things for us as a community you guys had snow on haleakala recently right we still do yeah yeah um amazing water is and the hawaiians knew this the word for wealth was viva it was water in in like for four native hawaiians our watersheds are our most important resource and those watersheds developed it was it's almost like in this permaculture fashion where there's these three layers and they've developed to capture all of this fog and rain and they go directly into our aquifers any ungulate deer included angular being a cloven-hoofed animal so goats pigs deer et cetera et cetera any ungulate in our forest it might as well be a salad bar like they like they literally can eat anything there are no protections those plants have developed no protections for themselves and once those animals affect the efficiency of our water feds they affect how much water they capture at a significant rate so their their most profound effect is in our mountains and affecting how that ecosystem collects water and so as we come down the hill that's when they start interacting with our ranchers and farmers and like we talked about they directly compete for feed at a rate of about seven to one every seven deer equates to about one cow but there's a lettuce farmer can lose 10 acres of lettuce overnight when a herd of a thousand deer come in like they'll absolutely decimate and fencing is optional for deer like we've seen deer hop over six-foot fences like nothing so this downstream effect of them impacting how we capture water and then them impacting our food systems all the time they're also degrading the un like the understory and what happens when we have large rain events is all of the sediment all of our soil i mean if there's anything more valuable than water it's soil all of the soil that have taken tens of thousands of years to form on this tiny island especially like coming from lava rock all of the soil all this incredibly valuable topsoil will run off into our oceans and it doesn't even stop there there's like deer scat are extremely high in nitrogen you kind of mention this like the downstream effect of not only the soil depositing on our reefs but also the impact of like the nitrogen from like thousands of deers feces starts to bleach our reeves as well and and i can't say for sure there's a direct link between like that nitrogen and how it affects it we know that may be the case with soil but more than anything thousands of pounds of sediment come down in these of in these events and when you when you fly over our islands i fly every week you just see these crazy plumes like miles and miles wide of this red dirt that is just going out and covering the reefs and we'll guess what's important about our reef systems apart from obviously the incredible ecosystems they support food like we've lost significant amounts of reef and the fish that then go along with them so there's this this they call it mauka tu makai there's this downstream effect of their impact that is i mean i don't think we completely understand um the cumulative impact like but it's we can see it every time these events happen and we can see it when we're in watersheds and part of understand like yeah and then so that understanding was obviously what spurred on you know the want to better manage them but along with it is like we talked about they're a food resource so they're not only a food resource but they're impacting our food security and so it's just like when they're imbalanced it's a double-edged sword in that they're being they're significantly detrimental and they're impacting our food security here as the most isolated landmass on the planet so it's just all the vast majority of their impact is not a net positive for our communities when you're at such imbalance in these populations and as you're coming into sort of your deeper and deeper understanding of this you're also continuing to develop with mike this unbelievable credibility with the community in terms of like it just blows my mind what you guys continue to do so now fast forward to the volcano eruptions and oh man so so so let's talk a little bit about what happened and what what type of a threat that was to livestock and what you know you guys are doing with helicopters i mean this this this is the stuff that's out of movies then again i think i'm not asking you to tell the story from the sake of boasting about what you've done but i think i think it kind of continues to round out the story of you know these are guys who uh first and foremost are here to protect hawaii yeah um we yeah i mean with mike as a partner we just develop a knack to get things done and like there was so much problem solving and as we developed solutions for axis deer and what one of the a couple years in we had a large eruption on kilauea on the big island and we had already developed it was the first of its kind it was a live cattle net capture system you gotta imagine a cow is a really big thing and basically what it was if i can explain this properly was it was it was a large metal frame a circular frame with a triangle net and there was it was attached to the tip of the net so the top of the cone and it was attached to the frame of the circular structure and what would happen is via helicopter we would put the cone over the animal we would release the top of the net the net would fall down the anode would walk out to the end of the net and then we would pick up the frame and it would be sitting in this like perfect cradle a little hammock and yeah so it had like it was a little hammock ride well we had a uh several years ago we had a very unexpected and very quick moving lava flow we're talking it was about 500 yards wide moving at 50 miles an hour and it and it ended up completely destroying an entire community like it's gone there are no remnants of it it like it just completely wiped the whole community out and there's this amazing community it's there's still it was a significant loss for the community but in the process two lava flows formed and they cut off a huge portion of a ranching area and including homes and a bunch of things in there and the state needed a solution for they wanted to find a way for these animals not to die and me and mike of course said well we can do that having zero context well we can go and do that and i remember driving out the first morning so we bring in all of the equipment like got it in the back of the truck we're driving out early in the morning and it looked like armageddon like the entire sky in the middle of the night was red and roiling and like it was creating there was so much heat it was creating its own weather system it was lightning like it was it was such an odd experience to be driving towards it with the idea that we were gonna fly around and pick these animals up flying over these 50 mile an hour lava flows but me and mike were like yeah we can do it and at that point we ooka was already a part of our team and you've met with so now we're talking the dream cause like and uk is like boys we're gonna be lava cowboys and you know i'm just like oh man um but i think we needed that level of positivity like what we were facing was was fairly substantial and it was it was risky and i was never going to risk any of my guy's life all of me it was ultimately it was my responsibility i wasn't going to risk any of their life for a cow but long story short we get on site we use the fleur really quickly to figure out how many animals are there and where they are and then we come back and we hook the net up and there's lots of good stories but probably the first one is is probably the most interesting we go over to find the first one and we were working with a helicopter pilot we'd only worked with a couple times before but he was he was amazing and he goes and he puts the net over how how long do you have like what's the distance how close do you need to be to the cow well we need to be it's a 100 foot line oh my god under the so it's this this cone is hanging under the cow and there's like your eye level with like lava flows and there's there's something called fissure eight there's like fissure eight is blowing in front of you like a couple thousand yards like and you're seeing like chunks of magma going everywhere and like you're seeing the ground heat up on two sides and how is that the pilot's going to like not interfering with what the pilot's able to do in terms of stabilizing the helicopter because the cows had moved themselves into the internal area between the two flows so we were coming over the first lava flow and like the helicopter went like this pink like there was so much heat coming off the floor it was like like it was tossing the helicopter three four hundred feet in the air like almost instantly and so we get to the inside and constantly they're like are you sure we like we're good i'm like if you're good i'm good and there's gopro video of all of this um so he makes not the mistake but the cow he happened to catch first was a huge bull and it was right at the max lifting capacity of the helicopter but once that bull is a 2 000 pound animal once that bull is in the helicopter or in the net system it's fairly difficult to get out by yourself and the well it wasn't co2 i can't remember what the what chemical we were most worried about or what gas we were most worried about but we all had like indicators while we're wearing like indicators and like i remember like having to get on the ground and like seeing blue spots like the gas levels were fairly dangerous as well so we didn't want to get on the ground we wanted to be where airflow was good and so he says like he goes to pick it up and he can get it off the ground and he's moving and he's like what do you want to do and i was like can you get this thing across the lava flow without me getting on the ground and he's like i think so i'm just like you son of a [ __ ] like he's like here's what we're gonna do we're gonna use the heat from the flow to lift us up and i'm thinking what if that doesn't work like we're gonna barbecue this cow like and and he was like he was confident and i've learned along the years like you trust your pilot like they're the ones that's going to keep you safe and so this cow is flying under the helicopter at 100 feet so we're only 150 you know 250 feet above the ground and as we get to the flow sure enough the helicopter just goes poop and it lifts straight up and i look down and it's like depth perception is pretty tough at that point when i looked down and the entire cow i thought lit up with smoke and i had thought i thought a whole like i was like what did we just do like we just burnt this cow i cannot believe like and like state officials humane society everybody is at the corral system on the other side where we're bringing this cow in and i'm just like i didn't know what to do like this is gonna sound terrible i honestly contemplated like if it was dead it's dropping it in the lava flow um and so we're flying over this lava flow and like all i see is smoke coming from this cow and what i didn't realize is it was steam i had forgot that it was raining and the cow had water all over it and i realized as we got over the flow all of the steam came off the cow and the cow was fine like it's just sitting there in its hammock and and we we brought that cow in so the way it works is it's it's hanging in its cradle with the frame above it like this and you put it down and then you put the frame right back over it and it just stands up and walks out and so this cow just stacked and we have all of this on video this cow just stands up walks out like nothing wrong walks over starts grabbing some feed like that's on the side and we had never done it before and like and mike are looking at me like i was the first one in the helicopter like is it gonna work i'm like it works and then we spent we had four separate missions to get out all of the cows over a period of like a week or two and i think we ended up doing 40 or 50 cows and like the the stories are just like you imagine like every morning thriving on this like lava like he had like lava cowboys on his coolers like it was but to the rancher that was potentially going to lose it all and two communities that were seeing all of this loss like there was not like there was just all of this loss from this flow it became this really interesting rallying point for the local community there's like a it was probably like fantastical to see but b like it's like wait we're like we're not going to lose at all we're going to get some of this stuff back [Music] and i think it's yeah a long line of projects and innovations that are like yeah we can i think we can do that and we just we just had a knack of like figuring it out as we go because there were certainly some bumps in that road imagine like me mike and hookah standing around with no like with very limited math experience between the three of us and we're looking at this huge cargo net and like these pipes and we're like i think we argued for like three hours before we built this thing i just i just i just wish i was there for that like that is cause i know how much fun it is to just be sitting around the campfire talking about the that stove that we like that the the shore stove like it's called and getting into the math of that so this is you know talk about the stakes being high so so how do you go from that to where you are now which is you've created this company called maui nui which is effectively an unbelievably efficient humane way to oper to operationalize the harvesting of access deer for for food at a usda certification which is uh it's important for people to understand like you and i could go out and hunt access deer but that doesn't really mean anything because that's even if you had a hundred people hunting these things you you can't sell that to somebody like a restaurant isn't gonna do that there's food safety issues so um how did you get to the the formation of what it is you're doing now which is by that point this is about now when you and i are getting to meet each other yeah um well it was a little bit a little bit before a little bit before then because after we finished the project on the big island and we went to we were getting those inquiries from maui and like the light bulb went off like hey there's got to be a better way so we understood population dynamics we understood what we were dealing with like from an animal standpoint the question was like why can't we eat these things and we understood the legality of it so in on the continent all native game mammals are owned by the public so you know somebody a resident of bozeman montana owns the elk that's on private property in on a ranch somewhere else like the state owns that animal and therefore you own that animal as a non-native invasive species in hawaii the ownership of that animal falls to the private landowner where that animal lies essentially and also the management of it so you can ask but the state isn't responsible to manage that animal on private property the state is really only responsible to manage that animal in on in public spaces so we we are not allowed to operate on public land so we only operate in privacy and i think it's really important to understand the difference so we knew that the landowner owned the animal and so i remember one of the first calls to the usda where i was like hey we want to be able to manage these animals what rules would we have to follow and what would we have to provide in order to have this animal be usda inspected and the guy i remember the guy he actually laughed he just said here's the meat inspection act from 1930 it's the federal meat inspection act if you can follow these rules somehow we'll give you guys a shot and so it's this thick and so i remember like reading it non-stop for several days and like finding the couple of spots in there that require humane handling and all the things that come into the process of like um harvesting an animal or like rendering an animal and i was like i think we can do this and i i called them back and explained the process like we have this amazing floor equipment where we can see these animals i believe we can render these animals so one of the most important things is we have to follow all of the rules of a brick and mortar facility but in the field for wild harvesting which the most important thing is how that animal dies and it has to be done it has to be the terminology is rendered immediately unconscious but it has to be shot in the head it has to break the skull cap so it dies immediately and they doubted whether or not we could do that and if we couldn't do it efficient efficiently they essentially shut you down overnight it's one of the most important things and the other part of that was we needed a usda certified slaughter facility and when i did the math on it all um it wasn't possible to use the current facilities on maui so there were two major hiccups to start was like hey can we do this efficiently enough and b well my wife let me remortgage my house to buy a slaughter facility a mobile slaughter facility and at the beginning both those answers were null i did i wasn't willing to remortgage the house knowing that we might not be efficient enough to harvest these animals because we didn't know yet right so the way we started that venture and it wasn't perfect everything we do isn't perfect the way we started the understanding and moving forward to be able to help those ranchers was just through pet food so we were able to test a lot of these theories create it wasn't a lot but like a super tiny margin for me and mike to operate and get to understand what that looked like and then it was only after six to eight months of keeping data every single night on like i was huge on this like keeping data every single night on proficiency rates and miles and occurrences like it was until i could justify the requirements for the usda that i called the usda back and said i want you guys to come view our process and if it's approved i will get the usda slaughter facility they came out they were blown away by our process so a combination of flurry equipment to view the animal and again this is happening all at night yeah let's let's let's actually explain to people what this is and and you know at the outset of this podcast in the introduction i explained that we're going to get a little bit graphic here and i i think you know this would be one of those moments in time where if you're you know if this if this is a subject matter that's very sensitive please hit a little bit of forward um on the podcast but um unfortunately you know i think if you if you choose to eat meat which most of us do i think you need to be familiar with what that entails um and i and i i always feel that it's it's it's wrong to consume meat without having some sense of what's involved and if you go to a grocery store and you buy a piece of steak you can't just assume that piece of steak you know just showed up there without a lot of work and and um and i think when you contrast how that piece of steak showed up there or how that chicken breast showed up there with the work that you guys are doing in the field you get a real sense of what the difference is and why a usda inspector can show up and say which i know he has said i've never seen anything like this ever in the history of the usda so so what was your strategy so so how is it that you can most humanely hunt an animal okay um we have to follow a certain set of rules so the inspection portion of what we do in the field is called an is called an anti-mortem inspection and in that inspection process the inspector has to be able to view that that that that animal is healthy it has to be able to view that is it's both like at rest and in motion and typically that is done in a corral so if you think about what a typical bro like brick and mortar looks like there are a whole bunch of cows that get trailered in from somewhere else they're sitting in a corral system and the inspector is able to go outside look at these animals very closely view them determine that they're they're safe for human consumption they're healthy and then that animal unfortunately like this is kind of the graphic part is that animal goes into a shoot system goes into a press or sometimes it's hung up alive and then that animal is rendered immediately unconscious with a stun or a bolt gun and that looks like in most cases and i know people are trying to get better at this but that looks like in most cases an animal that is stressed and unhealthy to be like it's in this press and it's moving around and that animal and an employee has to then render that animal immediately unconscious we had to follow those rules our process for that same anti-mortum inspection is we don't pen our animals we don't bait our animals over a period of years we knew if we cover enough miles we'll see enough deer and have enough opportunities to harvest them so translation the animals you harvest are a hundred percent in their natural environment they're not in a high fence area let alone a pen they're not being baited you're not leaving food to lure them in they're literally just out in the evening roaming about yes um and i think this is probably one of the favorite parts about about what we do is and it's similar to hunting we're driving around looking for animals and if we come over a hill and that animal is this group of animals is 50 yards away and we scare them they hear the bike or they hear whatever else they'll run away that animal is not like that animal is already in a stressed state and it runs away and we're not able to harvest it but if we come over that same hill two night later and an animal is out at 200 yards and they don't hear us or they're not stressed and they stand there that's the indicator for us that we're able to start the anti-mortem process and what that looks like is that same fleur binocular unit that can pick up a deer at six miles we use that for inspection with extraordinary detail like we can see abscesses we can see old scarring we can tell if they're pregnant like the level of detail is actually better than an inspector standing looking at an animal in a corral to determine whether or not it's healthy so the inspector is staring at this screen all of the lights are off and he says yep all of these are healthy you can guys can go ahead so there's a pause there again that animal isn't stressed so it's not going anywhere and then what we learned over years and years is we we then have to render that animal immediately unconscious which is shoot it in the head but that animal is in a zero stress situation and dies immediately and which is important to distinguish from archery yeah in archery you know you think about like you've you've taken me on some amazing hunts where i've had what for archery would be considered a perfect shot where you go lung heart lung but that animal doesn't die immediately it takes 10 seconds to die and if you're anything but perfect in archery if you hit say one lung but not the other lung and or not the heart and the lung i mean it could be much longer but at least i've never had an experience in archery where an animal died in less than a millisecond it's always a few seconds even with perfection and that's i think in part because of the nature of archery the type of death that an animal suffers from a from an arrow is that of hemorrhagic uh shock so they die from blood loss now there's exceptions to that rule you can die from a tamponade but it's still some form of hemorrhagic shock but this is different from the wound that you inflict inflict on the animal because when you're putting a high power ballistic which is a bullet into the head that's a that's a central nervous system death so that animal is dying immediately because the brain swells and so so that's a brain death versus a cardiopulmonary death and that's why it's an immediate and instantaneous death and by definition there is simply no more humane way to die because as you point out that animal has absolutely no knowledge that that is happening um and the moment it happens they cease to have awareness of anything yeah and so not only are they not aware and great explanation um but the animals that are with them in a herd like they die like there isn't like they don't even jolt they just they literally just drop straight down and in almost every case the animals that are with them won't even move that's the part when you first told me jake i couldn't imagine because i assumed you came up on a herd of six animals you would shoot one it would die the others would scatter that was it for the night with that group you know you would have to then you know drive for another 30 minutes to find another group but i was amazed to learn that no you could probably shoot all of them because a it's so dark they don't see anything um and two there's no movement by the animal other than just falling to the ground and that must be a common enough sound to the other deer that it's not it doesn't alert them or frighten them yeah so every situation is a little bit different and it's highly dependent on moon phase and the amount of illumination and what they can see more importantly they feel safer most often not running i mean they don't have perfect night vision it's pretty phenomenal but they'll feel safer most often staying there and so in most instances and never heard of ten we'll we'll typically harvest three or four of those animals and so that inspector has viewed that soap process the excuse me the floor equipment is so good that the friction from the bullet passing through the air creates a tracer so the inspector is actually able to see the bullet path and it like and it hitting the head and one thing to to be clear on here is we're not we're not perfect we've tr but we've trained to be imperfect so we don't injure any animals and so what that means is typically where the perfect target would be central to that brain cap system we we train ourselves to miss 30 of the time a perfect evening of shooting is at 70 efficiency but the miss is always high the miss is always high and there's never any consequence of that so that was what we and that was hard for us to learn and develop the skill set that a perfect miss was still perfect because it's an odd feeling to be like oh i missed and then there's so much pressure that's around shooting each evening it we had to train ourselves to understand that imperfection was actually the best way to go about harvesting this animal um the other thing that amazing is in that case oh sorry go ahead jake not all i was going to say that's what allows us that imperfection is what allows us to meet the proficiency level of a brick and mortar for the rendering process well that's actually what's going to ask you is isn't isn't your level of proficiency better than any brick and mortar because from a humane perspective i think you said in the entire time you've done this operation there has only been one bullet that hit the animal but didn't hit it in the skull and it was a shot to the neck which still resulted in an immediate death so for all intents and purposes it was the exact same but it was off the target is that correct still yeah um yep we've only ever been written up again like once for that infraction and part of that is also so we we train for those imperfections but we also train for this scenario so i think me and you've talked about this like mondays when we're making the conversion from being awake to like working nights my expectation for the boys is to shoot at 50 and what that does is it increases their margin of error for something like bad not to happen because we now know through poor sleep it absolutely affects our nervous system and our reaction time and we actually i didn't completely understand that until you did that podcast with matthew walker which is so cool um so a brick and mortar facility is asked to operate at a 95 efficiency we are operating right now at a 99.99 nine nine nine nine nine yeah you're you're activating well functionally you're operating at a one hundred percent efficiency and to think that a ninety five percent efficiency is all that's being asked that means one out of twenty animals is not dying in a humane way isn't that what that means yeah or requires like a they may be unconscious but they might require an immediate and i think that's really different i mean that's gonna i won't speak about anybody else's operation i'm sure there are i think i'm sure everybody would aim to be perfect in those scenarios but anecdotally i've actually had the opportunity to work in a brick and mortar um an animal that comes into a pen stressed out and is moving around even at point-blank range is significantly harder than an animal that is at rest and just like unaware and staring and part of that's also is we have such a the shooter has has to have such an intimate understanding of access to your behavior like a right ear starts to dip and you know like the head is going to go like a nose starts to go up and you know it's going to start nosing like there is there are half millisecond instances that you have to understand this isn't something where i could bring in a military sniper and you can operate at this efficiency i need a military sniper plus an access to your expert in order to take those shots and that's why for so long that was mike and me and now you've met kalenna like it's it requires a very specific skill set and what's the typical thing you're 100 to 100 or 500 yeah a hundred to pro now it's it's about 200 max okay so what we're turning very close with the you're using a 308 308 yeah and it's not because we're not effective past that range we're only given a three hour window to harvest at night what we've learned in collecting data is we carry almost every single one of these deer on our backs and it's an awesome way for the guys to connect with each animal as we're doing the process but there's also it's also very technical in that we don't want any bruising we don't want to we go to all this effort like we don't want to like affect carcass quality after all of that work and so you're carrying i mean like that last buck that you shot you saw me do with that process you're carrying a 200 pound animal on your back over extremely varying terrain and the record should show that's why you had to carry my buck because i couldn't carry this 200 pound buck for that first part of the terrain there was it just speaks to how pathetic i am yeah no no no but um i mean we've developed like the perfect way to pick up a deer like it took us hundreds if not thousands of animals to figure that out and so back to my point of of range at 200 yards for with a 200 pound animal you're getting back to the bike or truck exhausted and so what we learned was we could actually harvest more deer in a given night skipping the animals that we're seeing out past 200 yards assuming and we knew this through data collected we are gonna see more animals at closer yardage so we have like all these parameters in place these harvesting systems in place that that allow us to be in a situation where in starting and even we really don't know where any animals are like like we talked about we're not baiting them and we have this very stringent process with the usda we've had to collect crazy amounts of data to be able to like do so efficiency on a nightly basis and even then it'll vary i mean the usda just continues to be amazed by your process because you're basically self-imposing things that no one else really would think to do um yeah and i think that just continues to amaze me i guess i want to shift gears for a moment and just now talk a little bit about bringing it back to sort of my interest in this type of meat which was you know like i'm still relatively new to hunting but as as you know i've taken a real keen interest in the harvesting part of it i'm very fascinated by the anatomy and and just the the the differences in the meat and there's something that's very different about access deer um in some ways it sort of spoils you with respect to other types of meat um it seems infinitely cleaner healthier the animal itself seems to be you know very clean there seems to be something about its meat that's unique now as i've gotten to learn over time a big part of that has to do with the intramuscular fat content um you know most people who have tried venison say oh you know it's okay but it's a little bit gamey you know certainly black tail more than white tail and you know probably um but but but access deer sort of exists in its own camp which is not particularly gamey at all um and i suspect this you know it's basically 0.4 intramuscular fat i mean it's a very unique animal in that regard um how much have you been able to learn about their eating habits and how that contributes to what you're seeing in terms of the meat quality beyond what you just said so everything you just said speaks to why they don't have these high levels of cortisol and lactate at harvest which which definitely contribute to the to the sort of some of the taste that you can have in wild animal you've basically eliminated the lactate cortisol response completely but now we're talking about something that's much more long term you know plays a much longer term role in the development of the muscle yeah um yeah and and to your point there the that conversion of glycogen stores as that animal goes through rigor mortis and what and you can walk me through this but what i assume is like that muscle trying to continue to do something so pulling on atp and that atp like a function of that process being lactate and that lactate is so important as that as that animal that rigor mortise process gradually takes place over 16 to 24 hours and the ph level of that meat the ph level of that meat in like it completely changes color and texture in animals that are stressed and don't have that gradual process to go through so yeah it's amazing there but to to the point of what they eat man um didn't you guys have a camera on on a deer once yeah so there's so many i'm just trying to figure out where to start um so we so we've done two what are called satellite telemetry video callers the company called the company was lotex it was the first some of the first like iridium satellite callers and what that allowed us to do was a understand home range and and like how often they're drinking and when and where they're resting but there was a tiny little camera that sat right under the bottom of the collar and we got in 10 second increments 48 hours of footage of what they were eating and what was astonishing and we already knew this based on like studies in india they are primarily grass eaters which is not the case for most deer species which are primarily browsers um browsers being they're looking for legumes and shrubs and trees they're constantly pulling on different plant species axis deer are primarily grass eaters and i think when you talk about what like little intramuscular fat they do have it's interesting to see and we're only learning this now like there's high omega-3s in there because they're eating so much leafy greens and i think that's attributed to them primarily being grass eaters but what's what's crazy and we've seen this via the collar and we've seen this like anecdotally is how how intelligent it's awesome i never get to have these conversations it's how intelligent of an eater they are and i think that comes down to like these a crazy acute senses so for example we've seen me and you together have seen after walking three miles down a hill with dew all over our boots we walk through an access deer trail which for all intents and purposes there should be no scent on our boot our boots are soaked and i'm wearing boots and you're wearing socks like that's another story um and an animal not even in interacting with that specific spot but five yards away that deer is picking up the scent from that boot mark which was three hours earlier and we see this in like the both the satellites they are so picky in what they're eating not and not even between different plant species but within the same species so they're going up to one of their favorite little legumes is called glycine they're going up to a patch of glycine and they have unlimited feed so they're not eating like voraciously like a cow or something they're going up to a particular like group of glycine and they're saying like they're smelling smelling smelling saying oh i'm gonna eat this small patch right here and i think what we don't understand is an animal that is that intelligent in what it eats how that impacts its nutritional value and we're starting to kind of see that with some of the results we're seeing but i think that plays into how extraordinarily healthy they are the vast majority of other animals look at like a you've seen a pig now in a field or it seems like some goat a pig plowing through a field it's not stopping to plow in particular areas it's getting started and it's just gonna bulldoze its way through the entire thing um yeah i think this this is this was a really transformational thing for me so i think i've talked about this on the podcast with with john dudley once but i took up archery because i wanted to do archery that was all i wanted to do like i just wanted to shoot a bow and it struck me as the type of thing that you know you could spend a lifetime never coming close to perfection and it was you know just it scratched every itch for my obsession um it was only two years after i took up archery and all i was doing was plowing target after target after target after target that i you know got invited on a hunting trip which i'd been invited many times prior to and was like why would i go waste four days to go and take two shots when i can take 150 shots a day in my backyard didn't seem like a good idea but i got talked into it and jr as you know close friend of mine was like no this would be good for you so let's do it so we go and we do this thing and as you know it just sort of changed everything for me in many ways but among them is it really changed how i thought about food because i got to see on that one first hunting trip you know i'm shooting pigs goats sheep axis deer i mean i got to see everything from the lowest to the highest and eat it all and realize it's hard to be healthier than the animal you're eating and it's hard for the animal to be healthier than what it's eating like you know this is not an accidental process and it's never been the same since and i was talking about my wife the other day my appetite for store-bought meat has never been the same since that trip and i think that's true for a lot of people that experience really good wild game be it axis deer or elk which would be for me personally my two favorite i think axis deer and elk live in a different category from every other type of wild game but like even chickens right like we had chickens back in san diego they couldn't have lived a better existence i mean you know the the the amount of space that they had the amount of care we took of them they're eating some organic ridiculously expensive overpriced feed plus our leftover fruits and vegetables like they're living large they're making us these beautiful eggs i had zero desire to eat one of them because they lived in filth i mean all they did was eat their poop all day right it just didn't appeal to me um even going to the store and having a steak it's like yeah it's not that i don't eat those things anymore but like the idea of my appetite for the 32 ounce ribeye has pivoted a little more towards the eight ounce fillet whereas if i can eat elk and if i can eat access deer that that to me is far better and i think part of it is the taste acquires once you kind of start to understand what's going into it but i also think a part of it is just you can't disconnect from what the process was like to produce that food that winds up on your table and i just realized even if i'm buying the most organic grass-fed beautiful steak it didn't have the same stress-free existence that that access deer had or that elk had but again with elk it's a different situation you have to go and hunt it yourself you don't have the luxury of you know doing the usda certification so i mean did you experience that or was that is that so far in your rear view mirror that what i'm saying doesn't make sense no um definitely and and anecdotally i think it was my third year of college and i cut i think i mentioned this before when i stopped pouring in hawaii axis deer for most folks is just teriyaki so like you pour a whole bunch of sugar and you pour a whole bunch of shoyu when i stopped doing that and i started eating it like just straight steaks every night and it admittedly it was because i had ran out of money you couldn't afford the teriyaki sauce no i couldn't afford the cafeteria anymore so i i became a dorm advisor to try and like anyway i ran out of money and at a 60 bucks a pop for the plane flight and being able to bring back a hundred pounds of meat it was like a no-brainer and so by no means was it on purpose but when i started eating it the right way i started noticing it and i think at the age of what would have been like 20 i started getting stronger and i was really challenging my body as a function of like my vertical and like i realized as a small player like i needed to start taking some of that seriously if i was gonna like take the next step um by the way what is the vertical of a six foot tall national level volleyball player at its peak it was 43 i was going to say is it possible it was over 40 inches holy cow yeah my vertical's 12 inches it's not yeah it's not the case by any means anymore but i can i think fondly look back at pictures when i was playing in the netherlands netherlands already being the tallest people on the planet i had two players beside me that were six eleven and seven feet and have these really cool pictures of blocking so you're jumping up and putting your hands over the net and our hands are at the same height and our heads kind of match and then our bodies start changing proportion and my feet are at like their mid thigh and hip level and it's just like these comical anyway the i started to notice like i was recovering better and at that point and it almost happens simultaneously i think i've told you about this we we had the opportunity to train with the olympic sprinting team and i don't recommend this for anybody but they did this workout called gravity drops and so they were incorporating gravity into all of their workouts where we would be squatting and you would fall to 90 degrees and you'd try and stand up as quickly as possible and never in my life have i felt like every day i was sore and at that point it was hard to make like these physical gains and every day i was sore and then i like i remember making this transition to like i just needed more food like i could feel it and i started eating the right way and then i started noticing like i got so strong and i went from 190 pounds to 220 and it was all muscle and as a function of this workout and i think the use of this ingredient well that's interesting because very recently like meaning in the last four or five months you sent me the nutritional information from the company that has been looking at the bone broth because you know one of the things that you've done with this company that i think is so amazing is you've taken this notion of nose to tail to a whole new level right so it's like okay there's a 200 pound axis deer that yields what how many pounds of meat for the human yeah i mean the bucks are on the big side a typical axis deer is about 60 pounds whole carcass and will yield about 50 pounds for a typical human but there's also hides and hooves and awful and all kinds of things yeah yeah so you've got the pet food you've got the dog chews and then i i remember saying like where's the bone broth and then all of a sudden i you know you start making this bone broth and what did they say what how did they evaluate that bone broth which by the way i can't stop i can't stop drinking it yeah i i've never been a bone broth yeah it's amazing so we have to send all things into the usda labs for testing and they evaluate that and then they'll put that on your nutritional panel and we sent in the first batch of bones and they called us and they didn't call it out right they had thought we adulterated the bones they had thought we had done something because they tested so high in protein per ounce and and it was statistically like an anomaly and so we didn't know what was going on so we sent them i think we sent them a second batch or they retested it and in the end it tested 33 percent higher in protein per ounce than the best regenerative beef bones on the market and i and i say regenerative because there there is something to a regenerative agricultural process with cattle where there's additional soil health and i believe that soil health translates into your food but that animal is still given the grass it's going to eat it doesn't have a choice so we got the results back and we were and like we we didn't have an explanation for it and i mean that's a statistical anomaly i think the like between what we call like conventional beef and regenerative beef is about three percent usually they'll see a difference but 33 is and so essentially at like you know 25 grams of pork protein per i think it's 100 ounce 100 ounces or something no i think it's less i don't know i think it's less volume oh yeah much less it's yeah it would be 16 ounces or something 20 16 ounces yeah yeah you're in like you're in protein powder care category as a function of protein per calorie um so we're i think we're just and i'm not a nutritionist like i'm not a biologist i only know what i've seen over like thousands and thousands of hours of like interacting with this animal coming back to the previous conversation is i think their level of intelligence in what they eat is translating to their nutritional value and we're just starting to see that like me and you were emailing back the other day like i don't even know where to start to better understand their fatty acid levels and how i know there's important ratios of like omega-6s to omega-3s i don't know enough about it but i already seeing indicators that we might have something special there as well and why when we're eating it i don't feel like i need to go get like a slab of salmon even though like i'll have one every once in a while like i feel like i'm getting a complete nutritional profile from that animal when we're eating it and my wife my wife laughs she calls us weegans now so if it's not wild and it's not vegetables we're not eating it and so that's actually funny because i'll tell you one of the one of the great joys i have is introducing people to this and people fit into different categories right so you've got you know just your friends who are over for dinner and they'll eat anything and whatever and then that's great and in that category it's usually hey we're having venison and they're like oh you know i don't know i don't love that it's a little gamey and i'm like you know that's cool just tell me what you think and then they're always like no that's totally different than anything i've ever had but truthfully one of the more enjoyable experiences that i had was during our quarantine when um you know our nanny was staying with us this is at the early part of the quarantine when for two months we all just sort of hunkered down and um you know our nanny is a vegan and so you know luckily we've got an infinite supply of vegetables and you know non-non-um animal matter and stuff like that but we would you know sort of she'd have her dinner we'd have ours and we were at the time i had 500 pounds of access deer in our freezer so we were basically eating this every single day um because we had just come back from that huge trip like in december and yeah so but eventually she was like you know she wanted to try it because because we would talk about it over dinner you know we would have this type of a discussion and i think for for totally understandable reasons her opposition to eating meat was look she had some health concerns but she also had you know great concerns over how the animals are treated and so you know night after night she's sort of asking questions about this asking questions about this and and then she's like look can i try some of course and and you know i mean needless to say she loved it she had these two awesome dogs that stayed with us and it was like hands down like it was crack to the dogs um so i became like the dog's best friends because i'm giving them like venison treats every night but but to me that was like it was very special experience right it was like look everybody's you know i respect whatever choice a person makes with respect to what they want to eat and don't want to eat and what their reasons are um but it's also important to understand not all meat is created equal and i think this is just sort of an example of that i think we share i think we we share that experience in like i had seen that in the past like personally and people like and it did it really took them like listening and understanding and i think they i think they recognize the like the crazy lengths we go to to make the process like technically humane but like we love these animals like the the relationship with them started in this place where there was nothing but respect for them we didn't understand the negative portions of that relationship to our ecosystems and ecology and and and that's still very much the case for me it's a continual drive to like how do we better manage this animal before it's a net positive but now with maui nui we're seeing these testimonials coming in and most of most times it's like them writing to us individually like via the website or i get a phone call and they're just like it's been 20 years and i decided to have meat after watching your video or after hearing you like talk here and i mean that's not to my credit like i've had amazing people help us along the way but i think i think and they'll mention like oh i watched cowspiracy something along the way told them it was no longer okay to eat meat and it's been such an amazing experience for them to see our process and i think the intent in what we're trying to do and be like wait this is like this is an opportunity to eat meat again and i completely respect like everybody's body is different and you know this better than anybody and and maybe like being a vegan works in in most instances but i think for the vast majority of people it's important they get this protein right and again you would know better than me but it's been yeah it's been such a it's been such an awesome experience that like have somebody come to you with that level of trust and be like i'm going to introduce this into my life again after 20 years and you'd be like wow like thank you so much like we're so glad we can like do that for you and and help bring that into your home and that's the big part of this is our mission is to balance populations our mission isn't to get rid of these animals like we find them is an incredible resource for our communities when balanced and the only way we do that is people need to eat them so what does balance look like jake you you know lanai is in balance at about 20 000 animals you know molokai he said it's about 60 000 it's out of balance right now it seems that's that seems to be past capacity because my recollection from talking with you and mikey and others is there's basically access deer dying on the side of the roads in molokai so it's it's past that capacity um and then maui i think you said was one it was 60 on the way to 210 was that right yeah so yeah what does sustainability look like so it's a super nuanced subject because we don't we don't have the capacity to manage deer on all lands so like we talked about we're not we're it's illegal for us to operate on public land and honestly i support that we don't ever want to affect resource availability for a subsistence hunter and anecdotally we see on public lands on maui it's pretty hard to find a deer like i think there are like i think there's a scenario where subsistent hunters play a huge role in what balance look like and but we also don't dictate balance on a private landowner's property either they own that animal what we're able to do is say here's how many animals you have you look we understand how they what they're doing as a liability as a function of dry feed or watersheds or fencing or like our roadways oh what a mess we say this is how many animals you have how many do you want and then they say to us well let's let's try and bring this from 6000 to 2000 and see what it looks like and because we're able to manage them with such precision via these aerial surveys we're able to toggle that balance based on like we're going through a pronounced drought right now we're bringing down numbers in the areas we're working in but one of my favorite things we talk about like you know apart from like these this vegan conversation one of my absolute favorite things is we walk into a meeting with a rancher that is calling an animal a spotted rat and it only presents liability to them right like of course their cowboys enjoy harvesting like there's there's of course value in in them as a as something being able to hunt by the time we leave that room that animal has value because our harvesting process we pay it's not a lot but we pay them a small amount per pound for that animal so that they find so that they find value in that animal and we didn't have in other words it's more valuable for them to let you harvest it humanely than for them to just you know shoot it and leave it you know leave it sitting there exactly so at balance so in varying this balance each year with rainfall and ingress and all of the different things that happen at balance the rancher is happy because more importantly he has optimal soil health and no runoff and he's not losing feed but he's also making like is he's seeing a small amount of additional value from this animal and that combination when we talk about like what balance looks like on a large scale we have several ranchers that are saying like come help us we just we're not there yet we need to grow so a we need to like grow our harvesting capacity and we have the system to do that now but b we need more people to eat these animals with us and bring them into their homes and in in that scenario we'll be able to achieve balance by both growing and then working with all these private landowners and each one that's the best part each one's going to make their own choice that's not up to me to decide what balance looks like for that family or individual or board or whatever it is that's up to the private landowner what we do know is if we're able to grow large enough and we are able to operate on most of the private lands between all of them we can find a population level that is also best suited for our community because i mean molokai is a great example i mean maui as well right now too but the lights like sun goes down everybody on that place is doing 10 miles an hour there are so many deer on the road like the the the risk to like hitting a deer is like at those densities we discussed is profound and you know on maui you can do 5565 miles an hour so as a function of like our watershed health and sediment like the net present value of this species that balance makes sense it doesn't make sense to eradicate them we talked about food security i understand this is like a hard conversation too because we're also the endangered species capital of the world so there's a very real conversation if i was a conservationist i would say get rid of all of these invasive species and let's work to bring back or rehabilitate the endangered species in these same spaces is it even technically feasible jake if if the hawaiian government decided tomorrow we don't want a single access deer here by 2030. could that be done technically no way they're they're just they're too smart i mean we were able to accomplish that because they were in such low numbers um on on the big island there's no i don't believe there's a way to do that so there's no choice but to find balance and balance looks like i support the idea that there shouldn't be deer in our watersheds there's nothing more value as an isolated landmass and a community trying to be self-suspicious especially through covid like there we've donated 50 000 pounds of venison like over a hundred thousand meals through kovid because food banks were empty like like hawaii's economy teeters on absolute disaster because we're so dependent on tourism and when covert hit and we shut the door like the vast majority of our community was in trouble so there's there's this nuance between yes like there's ecosystems and ecology we have to respect and every native species has a right to exist in its own place but there's also economics and food security so it's it's finding a balance for where these animals should be in the long run and that's where we produce food it's not in our mountain where we depend on water and that's just my opinion but yeah so the conversation of balance isn't just like what's the deer density in this particular place the conversation of balance is like how do you interact with all of these things across your communities and ecosystems and all of these other things and i think that story about you know the the amount of food that was donated during kovid um is kind of another example of this i think it's part of why maui nui has been in such high favor with with local people because you know that's a big step back for a business that's trying to grow to basically give away you know an enormous chunk of its product uh you know it's one thing if you're nike and you're you know 50 years into your existence and you're gonna give away five percent of your shoes for free or something this is totally different um but at the same time it was sort of a no-brainer um yeah because it you know it basically just meant look we're going to delay the growth of the business by a year and a half but um we're doing the same thing um and it's it still serves the same mission which is you're feeding people and you're managing a population yeah and you're right like there wasn't even like a choice and two everybody's credit on the team because because people have to like we need to grow at a profitable healthy margin so we could scale and achieve that mission of balance but it was like an overnight like was it was like an instant decision because a hunter can't in hawaii a hunter can't go harvest an animal and take it into the food bank for a donation it's like the the food safety requirements are far too stringent and so probably one of the things we're most proud of is we had created this system and tool that in a time of need as a function of food security we could call on it instantly yeah that's the point if you didn't have that usda certification already set up you wouldn't have been able to have you could have all the deer in the world you couldn't do anything with them yeah and that's not to say subsistence hunters didn't rally to harvest more animals themselves and get them into the community but doing so in a at a at a recreational or subsistence level versus a commercial level is like 50 000 pounds of food in eight months is like that's a lot of that's a lot of meat and that's not possible in without like systems for food safety and slaughtering and all the other things that go into it so as we look to our communities 20 years from now and either whether instability or governmental ins all of the different things that are happening in our world economy especially like the conversation of domestic production like having it at home in hawaii and a resource we can always call on it's important and when we look at the total value of access dear for our communities that's important um and that all interacts with this idea of balance like and again there's no perfect answer one way or the other but man were we happy like rolling two full pallets of venison into the food bank with an empty freezer we were just like the boys you've met the boys like you imagine the smile on like big eddie's face who's been like a community member for you know 40 years and him being able to like have this impact like a time of need it's it's awesome like you feel amazing jake this has been um it's been amazing for me to sort of be a a minuscule part of this journey alongside for you know a couple of years and getting to know you and um you know you know having you share this story uh has been has been great um because i've never heard it in one piece and they're even pieces of this that i hadn't heard before so i know folks are gonna um you know have their curiosity peaked by this and and and maybe some belief systems challenged but that's if you're not doing that then what are you doing yeah absolutely and and i think you under i think you underestimate the impact you've had um you know it took us seven years to figure out a harvesting system but being able to take that next step in understanding how you move this into somebody's home and what e-commerce looks like and all of these other things like the resource you've helped us find we would not be here without your help and the rest of the group and um we can't thank you enough for that and and we're i mean we're just excited to see what the next couple years look like and how we can move that mission forward and and what continued good we can do within our communities and yeah we can't thank you enough but i really appreciate it well i need more bone broth because like my wife has pretty much consumed all the bone broth you send she doesn't even let me have it anymore it's sort of like her little secret
