## AI Summary

I'll analyze this excerpt from The Drive podcast with Joe Liemandt focusing on education and learning mastery.

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on educational mastery and learning optimization, particularly discussing how traditional time-based education systems often fail students by not ensuring true mastery of fundamental concepts. The conversation centers on how gaps in basic knowledge (like fractions) can cascade into difficulties with more advanced subjects (like chemistry). Joe Liemandt presents compelling evidence that with proper individualized instruction and mastery-based progression, students can learn 10 times faster than in traditional classroom settings.

2. **Key Scientific Points**:
- Bloom's Two Sigma paper demonstrates that personalized tutoring with mastery-based progression can improve student performance by two standard deviations [07:02]
- Students can complete an entire grade level of material in 20-30 hours with AI-based tutoring systems [05:35]
- Strong correlation between fraction mastery and algebra performance [03:24]
- Traditional classroom settings require approximately 200 hours per subject per grade level versus 20-30 hours in optimized learning environments [05:35]

3. **Notable Quotes**:
"Chemistry is just algebra with advanced word problems. Physics is literally calculus with advanced word problems." [03:24]

"Kids can learn 10 times faster. The remediation on this stuff is no time at all." [04:18]

4. **Key Insights for Implementation**:
- Focus on mastery of fundamentals before advancing to more complex topics [02:28]
- Identify and fill knowledge gaps rather than pushing forward with incomplete understanding [00:28]
- Use diagnostic testing to identify precise areas of weakness [03:24]

5. **References & Resources**:
- Bloom's Two Sigma paper mentioned [06:40]
- Learning science research from Stanford and other institutions [06:40]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What specific AI tutoring systems are most effective?
2. How can this approach be implemented in traditional school settings?
3. What are the social implications of moving away from age-based progression?
4. How does this approach apply to adult learning and skill acquisition?

The rest of the requested categories (Supplements & Medications, Exercise & Movement, Nutrition & Diet, Biomarkers & Testing) are not applicable to this excerpt as it focuses exclusively on educational methodology and learning optimization.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] And I remember another story, Joe, that we kind of bonded over a couple of years ago, which was the the student that was really struggling in uh in entry level chemistry. Yeah. And I mean, I can I I think anybody who's been through chemistry can empathize with that. first time you're doing you're going through physical chemistry and you're trying to balance the chemical equations and and this this kid is dying and they think the problem is

[00:00:28] I'll never it's chemistry the problem is chemistry and you came in and said no actually the problem is fractions you didn't master fractions in third grade or fourth grade or whenever fractions are introduced and you're failing chemistry because you did you for this exact reason we're going to go back and fill the gap in chemist in in fractions and this will become easy for you and of course that's what happened and math science knowledge is hierarchical right and this is back to mastery which is we've why we do poorly we've given up mastery in this country why um we're a timebased system right at the end of third grade you're moving to fourth grade and at the end of fourth grade you're moving to fifth grade and we don't hold kids back we don't we just we've said we're just going to move kids through no matter what Um cuz it's time cuz there's all these other social issues, right? And you know, oh my god,

[00:01:24] I can't have my kid hold back the pressure on the school to relax the standards. You know, 80% of kids at Harvard get an A now. You know, it's just grade inflation. You know, grades look like this. Standardized test scores look like that, right? And it's just we've just got and for whatever reasons we've done it but in a timebased system you know and here's part just even grading you know there's this concept that you know okay you got a 70 you know you can pass and 80 is a B right that's great okay my kids a B student 80 the problem is you know if you only have 80% you know knowledge you're creating all these holes and it all compounds where eventually and it starts to when you hit algebra or chemistry right that you're you think it's the current mater material, but it's your prerex, right?

[00:02:11] It's your foundation. And you know, we talk a lot about parents because a lot of this is, you know, we all grew up in this timebased system and just the old system. And so this new way is very different, but the best analogies we always use that parents totally understand is sports, right? Just like game film, like review your test, figure out what's wrong.

[00:02:28] Mastery is the same one, you know, which is if you're the point guard and you lose the ball 20% of the time going down the court, the coach isn't like, "Let's work on the advanced stuff." They're like, "Kid, let's learn how to dribble." We don't need to worry about dunking yet. Correct. No dunking. Like, let's focus on right, get up to 99%, get to mastery that you know how to do the basics.

[00:02:50] Everybody in sports is like, if you're not doing well, go back and do the basics. Well, academics is the same way. And if you apply that same logic, right, but in a timebased system with a teacher in front of a classroom, right, you can't get every kid to mastery, right? And that's when we get into like the new solutions and and why we get these crazy, you know, kids can learn 10 times faster. It's because we're able to get out of a non-mastery non-timebased system or a a non-mastery timebased system that has a teacher in front of a classroom.

[00:03:24] Right? Teachers are great. teacher in front of the classroom's bad. Um, you know, that that dynamic. And so, uh, but and to your point, hierarchical, you know, chemistry is just algebra with advanced word problems, right? Physics is literally calculus with advanced word problems. You know, algebra is basically advanced fraction manipulation. You can give kids a fraction test and predict their algebra score, right? And then fractions are how's your division and multiplication tables? Do you memorize them to fluency? And so it just keeps going down the whole track, you know, all the way down. And so part of what you have to do to fix the system, right, is figure out age grade. Oh, wait. I'm an eighth grader in algebra and knowledge grade. Wait, I don't know my fractions are different. And so you know what? A teacher in the front of a classroom though, it's not their fault, right? I'm a teacher. I'm an eighth grade teacher.

[00:04:18] What do you teach? Eighth grade material. Yeah. and I have kids who don't who who don't who who don't know some third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh material. What do I do? Right? And this is why, you know, and um so many people hire tutors, you know, after school at private schools, right? There's, you know, it's crazy. We have all these people go to private schools and hire after school tutors because the school doesn't teach them. And you know, the tutors just like, okay, I'm going to go give you the earlier grade level material. That's it. Um, when we talk about kids, all these hundreds of kids coming in who are, you know, 3 years behind, seven years behind, the second part of what I tell the parents is that's freaking you out cuz nobody wants their kid this far behind. But it's so easy to fix. The remediation on this stuff is no time at all. That when you use these, you know, learning science-based AI tutors and the apps that we have, kids can learn 10 times faster. 10 times faster. So when you actually look at material there's 180 school days right hour a day plus homework so couple hundred hours most of grade one subject right per grade level takes our alpha kids between 20 and 30 hours to finish an entire grade level to mastery.

[00:05:35] So you can take fourth grade math and be like, "You got 26 hours, kid. You do an hour a day of homework. You're 26 days away, right? 22 hours is 7th grade and sixth grade. 22 each, right, for math." And Joe, would this work if and again as just as a thought experiment, if each student had one teacher, the private tutor? Yeah. If you could put a private tutor in front of a student for 22 hours over the course of, you know, whatever two months or one hour a day for 26 days, are you confident that that individual, and of course we'll talk about why that's not practical, but that that individual, if skilled enough, could navigate and weave that child through. if you give me a few more hours than what I just gave you because the AI can do a little bit better than than than most tutors. But yes, fundamentally the paper that was written when I was in high school about education like so learning science and we didn't you know learning science has been around for 40 years they've been writing papers there's 10,000 papers published by all the schools of education and you know

[00:06:40] Stanford and you know all over the place that is we know kids can learn two five or 10 times faster right we've known it in you know blues two sig blooms two sigma is a seminal paper and he just said if everybody got a personalized tutor was his First point and second they did it to mastery. They work to mastery.

[00:07:02] Right? So mastery based not tenure based. Correct. Just you have to know the material before you advance and there's an individual tutor to coach you. You will get two sigma better performance which is right. You're leftmost part of your curve. Your worst students are going to be at what today is considered the top 10%. In a two sigma performance.
