Holly Baxter is an accredited practicing dietician (APD), competitive bodybuilder, fitness and nutrition educator, and coach. In this episode, Holly discusses her experience as an athlete and competitive bodybuilder. She also opens up about her struggles with mental health, her long battle with an eating disorder, and the important steps she’s taken in her road to recovery. From there, she explains how she would design a nutrition and training program for a hypothetical female client wanting to improve her physique through the addition of lean muscle and loss of body fat. She explains reasonable expectations for gaining muscle and the value of a “reverse diet” for maintaining weight loss, and she shares her favorite exercises. She also talks through some female-specific training considerations such as programming, reps, volume, hormone replacement therapy, and more.

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode features a deep conversation with Holly, a professional bodybuilder, nutritionist, and trainer who overcame a 15-year eating disorder.

- Optimal caloric surplus for muscle gain is around 20% above maintenance [1:51:42]
- Weekly weight loss should not exceed 1.5% of body weight to preserve muscle mass [1:54:25]
- Protein requirements range from 1.8-3g per kg of lean body mass [1:49:10]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Focus on compound movements before isolation exercises [1:24:56]
- Take adequate rest between sets (heart rate below 100 BPM) [1:43:45]
- Progressive overload should be implemented gradually [1:17:49]

Context-specific Recommendations:
- Women may benefit from higher rep ranges due to muscle fiber composition [2:09:41]
- Consider menstrual cycle timing for training intensity adjustments [2:13:48]

**4. Exercise & Movement**:
