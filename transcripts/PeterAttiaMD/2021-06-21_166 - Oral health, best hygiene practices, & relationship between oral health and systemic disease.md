## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode about oral health with Dr. Pat:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on oral health, its connection to systemic disease, and best practices for dental care. Dr. Pat discussed the complex anatomy of teeth, the oral microbiome, and how poor oral health can impact overall health. The conversation covered practical recommendations for daily oral hygiene and addressed common misconceptions about dental procedures.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Teeth have complex anatomy including enamel, dentin, and pulp with extensive innervation [15:30]
- The mouth contains over 700 different bacteria species living in symbiosis [45:20]
- Periodontal disease progression varies significantly between individuals based on systemic health [1:20:15]
- Saliva plays a crucial role in maintaining oral health and microbiome balance [30:45]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Brush teeth three times daily, including morning [1:15:30]
- Floss daily - potentially more important than brushing [1:05:45]
- Visit dentist every 6 months for cleaning [1:25:15]

Context-specific recommendations:
- High-risk patients (diabetes, immune compromised) may need more frequent cleanings [1:26:00]
- Cancer patients need specialized oral care protocols [1:00:15]

**4. Supplements & Medications**:
- Fluoride varnish for high-risk patients [55:20]
- Xylitol-containing products recommended [1:10:30]

**5. Notable Quotes**:
"Most people don't floss really... if you ask people do you floss every day, most people don't floss every day" [1:05:30]

**6. Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal frequency of professional cleanings for different risk groups?
2. How does diet composition affect oral microbiome beyond just sugar content?
3. What are the best practices for oral care during pregnancy?

Would you like me to expand on any particular section or provide more specific details from other categories?

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:10] hey pat thanks so much for uh sitting down with me today i've been wanting to sit down with you for quite some time and i know we've been we scheduled and rescheduled on several occasions and between one thing or another uh it took a while but i am pretty confident it's going to be worth the wait how are you i'm good thank you i'm very happy to be here that's something that i have a lot of pleasure talking about oral health with mds that's my life is trying to to do this connection so i'm very excited to be here it's gonna be interesting because i don't know and i don't know much about what we do and uh and i think i can bring something new about uh dentistry and oral health and things which is so important yeah well i think it is important and that's certainly why i've wanted to talk about this for a while and i've been trying to figure out who would be the right person to speak with and you came very highly recommended um because i think it's actually a very under-appreciated uh part of health um i think it's easy to think of the mouth as this sort of thing and we go to the dentist and you know hopefully we don't have cavities and obviously we have a whole bunch of cosmetic concerns with the spacing of our teeth and the whiteness of our teeth etc but i'd like to sort of tie that all together um but i want to kind of start with a little bit of your background so obviously you you grew up in brazil i shouldn't say obviously but i recognize your accent then i uh i know your your history a little bit uh when did you when did you leave brazil wow so it was a long time over 20 years ago um so i had my dental degree in brazil and then i had my specialty in periodontics and implant dentistry which is one of the fields that is more connected with systemic health i always wanted that um and then i went i came to us mostly for personal reasons uh and i wanna and my passion for research because i that's what i do my whole life and i never went back because i got fascinated by the opportunities and um everything that i could have here that unfortunately we don't have the resources in brazil to do and i'm still doing research up to today many years so this is a bit off topic but tomorrow is a very sad anniversary do you remember where you were 27 years ago tomorrow no remind me sunday may 1st 1994 was the day ayaton senna died oh wow i remember that day really clear yeah wow where were you that morning i i were you like everybody watching the race on tv yes yes i was i was still there in brazil yeah yeah i i've um i have so many uh brazilian friends and and and we're just fortunate so many people in our life are brazilian our nanny is brazilian and uh i've never met a person from brazil who is who was at you know anything over about four or five years old on that day it's it's etched in in their minds forever yeah here's a big legend um and i think in a time that make made brazil so visible for the world and all those things so we everybody was always very proud of him yeah well he's uh he's my personal hero um and so for you today i wore one of my sena bracelets um so let's start a little bit with tooth anatomy unfortunately i have teeth that my wife refers to as a tia teeth which she jokingly means like i just have genetically horrible teeth like i always seem to be at the dentist for something something's always going wrong so um i i'd like to think she's exaggerating a little bit but uh you know there was a period in my life unfortunately of maybe 10 years when i didn't go to the dentist once and i think i'm i sort of ended up paying a bit of the price for that going on which sounds like a stupid thing to say imagine somebody not going to the dentist for 10 years but that's sort of what happened for largely much of my medical school and residency i just never made the commitment to go still brushed my teeth and did all that stuff but obviously wasn't getting regular checkups and now that i find myself taking dental care so seriously the first thing i realized is i had to understand the anatomy you know i had to understand what they meant by pulp and dentin and all of these things but i think it might make sense to give people um a a decent overview over the semantics of the tooth at the individual level and then sort of at the the level of how all of the teeth fit into the mouth is that can we start with something like that yeah okay of course uh i think which is strictly important they all have a reason to be so you have 32 teeth in your mouth uh all of them of course they have very specific functions so uh if you think about uh the anatomy of the tooth you can think about one unique tooth only which is the anatomy of you have the root carries you have if you think about between what you see in the oral cavity and what you don't see is like the ground and the roots as you see in this figure and then you have all the parts that surrounded the tooth where we call the supports where the seat sits on top which is the periodontal which is another very complex system uh as well so and then if you think about this whole system together and you have multiplied that by 32 then you have this amount of very unique set of different think about individuals inside your mouth and they all have very specific functions can you pull that slide up again of the individual tooth i have some questions about that yeah the first thing that jumps out to me is that there's a vascular supply that is quite high in the tooth it you know if if i didn't know better i would assume that when i you know look in my mouth and i see that white crown that everything inside it is a bone in other words i would assume the entire tooth is an avascular amorphous thing that serves one purpose and one purpose alone which is just to basically break down food so why is it that this tooth is so much more complex than just having enamel why does it have this dentin and this pulp yeah it's a very complex structure and it's for the reason so the enamel is minerals so it's a very hard surface it's actually the hardest surface on the human body it's it's the enamel and then underneath the enamel you have uh the cement and then you the dentin sorry the tentine and then i have the pulp and the cement is everything part of the peridone tune but this three layers of of the tooth itself they the enamel protects the underneath layers the second one that you see it's just like cushion and has a lot of tubules as well so it's hypersensitive um and then the heart of the truth is actually the pope so it's high you see a lot of nerves and they all connect to the body that's why you have a lot of tooth pain is one of the most detrimental type of pains that we have because you have all those nerves connecting everywhere and then you have the bone as well and the ligaments around the roots they protect it's that cushion that protects against the impact and it gives that gives you all that biological symbiotic so you can chill and you can function but why is it that we need a nervous uh connection to the tooth because it i understand that like if you had a dental implant obviously you've given up the nerve and vascular supply to the tooth correct so we can still we can still carry out the function of breakdown without that or well well uh so the first signs when you have of those loss right for example you start with educate and then if decay takes the pope then you have to excise the pope and you can still preserve the root so the main uh thing that we think the way we want to think in dentistry is that you want to preserve health as much as you want because you want to preserve function so you don't want to extract teeth because cheat they have a very precise reason because they need to hold this face you need to chill there's a lot of of things that uh that's part of the mouth so you need to have the jeep so you can do a root canal or if you don't have any more the crown because you lost to the decay you can take it out the ground you can put some metals and then you can put an artificial crown at the moment that you lose is infected and you have to extract the whole tooth then you need to put the implants on but not that implants is better it will never be better than your natural function in your teeth because it's a metal and it has many other issues and you still have periodontitis which is infection of the implant it doesn't mean that oh i'm going to take my teeth out and i would never gonna get inflammation periodontal disease right it's not true you still have that so i think my question is more that if you have an implant and therefore you have a denervated tooth it seems to still be able to carry out the function of breaking down food i think the thing i'm trying to understand is you pointed out something that unfortunately most people listening to this can relate to which is dental pain is some of the worst pain in the world and it speaks to i think that highly highly innervated pulp that you showed i'm trying to understand what the function is of having something so highly innervated like for example our fingers are highly innervated because they serve such an important function our ability to have fine motor control with our fingers is why we have so much innervation here so why is it that we have so much innervation in a surface beneath this enamel which as you said is the hardest surface in the body what what is the purpose that that innervation serves that's an interesting question uh it's the viral part of the truth um that preserves blood flow and uh and keeps the truth alive uh and it's a connection uh i now that i'm thinking through it's how you protect so it's a connection with your immune response if you have let's say if you have a caries infection so probably that's how your body might be able to respond and fight against infection inflammation so the moment you don't have there anymore so it's just a i see i see that's a good point so you're saying that's what i think now that we're talking about so maybe it serves as such an early warning indicator as a breach of uh a barrier basically an important barrier okay that's interesting i i just have to tell you having been through so many miserable dental experiences i've often cursed our evolutionary gods for giving us so much innervation in that tooth so you you've already started to talk a little bit about the pathology that can go wrong here before we do that i want to get a little bit more an understanding of the function can you show me again that slide that has all of the teeth and maybe explain yeah sure how how different teeth serve a different purpose in the mouth so technically you have the incisors so you have four of them and you draw in each part of your jaw and the maxillary and the mandibular then you have the canines there are another four so the incisors is mostly in your mouth so you can cut your food in any animal that's how you bite and how you separate pieces of fruit and then you have the canine that is a very strong that's the longer root that you have in your mouth that is cheerier so you can see animals when they are eating meat and all of that that's you tend to go to the side because it's a very strong uh anatomy that they have and then you have four we call premolars or bicuspids so that's where you start to break down the element the the food that you eat to to tear them apart and then the molars they do the whole duration that's what you have to chew and and when i always talk about chills because you know when the digest process starts in the mouth so it's very important that people chill their food and in contact with the saliva and all the nutrients that we have but it's a completely different subject talking about saliva but it's mainly to to chew your food to start a digestive product so then you can get most of the nutrients out of your food now looking at the lower part of this figure um it seems that the different teeth have different numbers of roots is that correct yes that's correct so incisors and laterals and premolars the one in front they have single roof then if you go to premolars they will have two and some the molars itself they might have three or four depending on how big the truth is so it's a much more complex because they're much more strong and they they they have to get much more pressure and and to to function so they need to be have much more like sustain sustainability so they can get you and and and and thrice our food i see so that actually probably explains another reason why these things are innervated which is to if the the harder they have to um oppose other teeth right so the molars would have the greatest opposition to another tooth um then they need greater sensory input to understand the relative spacing and force would that be part of the difference as well as well it's a you think like in your mouth it's like a bridge it has to be very well balanced the occlusion needs to be perfect because then you're going to hurt all your ligaments and cause inflammation in your mouth so it's a very elaborated system which all and if you think about the occlusion they connect they have to be very perfect aligned so you you don't have if you start having issues like your team they don't they'll have a perfect occlusion start losing your vertical occlusion and then you have a lot of other issues like uh pain on your face and headaches there are many other issues that can happen if you don't have a good function in your mouth okay um by the way i learned the hard way that i have four roots in my molars not three because the i've had two root canals and the first one they missed one of the roots they only went after three roots and i still had endless persistent pain until they figured out i and i went to finally then see an endodontist who realized i had a very hidden fourth root uh but we'll get to root canals later my least favorite procedure in the world um so so let's talk about what a healthy mouth looks like uh you alluded to saliva i i assume that that plays a very important role in oral health and i assume it does something beyond lubricating food does it does it play another role it's ex so they they all cabbage is a very complex uh system so if you think that you have cheap you have the gums you have the ginger crevicular fluid that is open and allows your bacteria to grow in and out you have your tongue which is a completely different texture structure you have a throat which is entrance to your body so all this whole complex system they need to live in a very uh organized way and on top of that you have the saliva saliva again we could have a completely other podcast just about saliva but in the context where we they preserve health because we know today that uh people with dry mouth if you have i treat patients with radiation they're going through radiation oncology we're gonna talk we can talk about that later but uh the moment uh you dry your mouth for any reason systemic conditions medication who causes rhyme out and many of them the causes or toxicities do cancer care radiation drives mouth it's a completely shift of the all microbiome in your mouth because that's how saliva protects is that bio food that's constant washing and and flushing your mouth and maintaining a very uh almost skeletons on the microbiome as well it prevents these bills on the um auto microbiome so this whole complex needs to be balanced on every single aspect that we look you need to have the teeth you need to brush you need to have a lot of saliva and you need to eat well so that it's a lot of it's a combination of a lot of factors that makes people uh say you have to be in health when you look at oral health but the primary is so simple it's actually oral hygiene uh if you brush your teeth you're gonna you're gonna be technically you preserve a little bit more of health than people who don't i want to go back to what you said about the the the um the dysbiosis and the microbiome of the mouth so my recollection is that the mouth actually has a a significant amount of anaerobic bacteria is that correct well they're both you have aerobic you have unaerobic you have facultative bacteria they can play both roles because it's strong they can change um but we have over 700 different backs here that leads in a perfect symbiotic uh habitat in our in a kingdom right we call that uh and they can live really well with the host without causing disease if you can maintain the state of health because what we are in the past people think that what causes disease or disease is the specific bacteria but it's not true we all have all those bacteria in your mouth uh it's indigenous to you is not that it's from something external you have that it's a their normal habit that is your mouth but for some reason you don't stop brushing or you start taking medication and your mouth becomes dry you have a health condition that allows inflammation to to be more prevalent you know my all those things might change the cavity environment and that allows some bad bacteria to grow and supersede the good ones and then all that's what happens what is the gym so it's we talk about two things abundance changes in abundance and diversity which is allowing bad bacteria to flourish and and suppress the good ones that helps us preserving health so that's mainly what's going on of course there are other so in an ideal state directionally what amount of bacteria are aerobic anaerobic and facultive what's the approximate distribution in a in a relatively healthy mouth it's probably half and a half between aerobic and aerobic um and another maybe 30 to 40 percent of them they can play both ropes um but those let's say a clear example uh and uh we can talk about that in a completely different section but like even children uh when i did my studies with the twins and then we asked them to stop brushing for two weeks all the periodontal pathogens pigeons valley children chico for scientists that we only see in adults with periodontal disease in two weeks they became abundant in their mouth so they were there that i couldn't see a baseline the moment they stopped uh flossing they became abundant so they are there but they will never cause disease unless you have a shift or a microbiome so let's talk about that study so how old were these twins so let me go back was a long time ago that's when i first started my research because i was highly interested in dental care's so they were between 12 and maybe 16 years old i wanted to have adolescents because they have that's they where they don't like to brush the plus you know it's a very hard population to do that so what we did we got so when you do studies i'm going to talk a little bit about the twain so i understand why we use the trends so they're the perfect model to do clinical trials that's my passion is clinical trials um because they share especially on that age the same households the same there is no confounders right we don't need to adjust for age the identical twins you don't even need to adjust for a gender because they share the same sex and they share a hundred percent of the genes so when you look at monozygotic and disaggotic twins the monozygotic twins they share 100 of their genes it's almost a perfect clones of each other right and to your point as adolescents they're still in the same house it would be different if you did this with 30-year-old monozygotic twins because at least there might be some environmental differences right and the environment takes place and then a lot of you know epigenetics might change even mutations so and then when you look at the disagree twins they're 50 they share 50 of your genes it's the same as surprises right siblings so there's two ways that you can do studies with twins you either get this twin set and then you do treatment a and b to see response to treatment because they're very similar or the way i like when you want to see trains and how a trait can mode be modified by genetics or environmental factors you get the same set of twin and you give the same drug medication or treatment because then when you look before and after if you don't see if you see that the identical twins they behave in the same way you're going to say well genetics modulating that trait but then if you look at both of them and say they're all over the place they behave in the same way as the identical and the fraternal twins and say well here the environment is playing a big role because genetics is not holding anymore right um so when we do the this flossing in twins that's how we did this study we got uh we want we didn't want to give separate treatments for the twins because they're going to the same house so and i did very controlled so for two weeks we asked the twins to come every day to the center and i'd have better hygienist and my clinical people trained and they do brushing or and or flossing because they're two groups one group we wanted them just to brush the other group he wanted them to brush and frost it and then so the hygienist would floss and watch them doing it was very supervised and controlled and when they go home i asked them to do at night at home but if you think about that's a very hard group to try to do because we had to bring the kids every single day with their parents to the center so we could actually watch them doing the intervention so when we finished the study what happens that that we saw is that the the children that stopped brushing ditching um they we saw a gingival bleeding and not russian sorry both of them were brushing the children that did not floss we saw elevated levels of gingival inflammation which was represented by a changeable bleeding we measured gingival bleeding and what was most striking was all those periodontal bacteria they they just uh came in abundance which ones in particular um overexpressed in the non-flossing group it's the three big guys uh we call pigeons valleys identical uh a a at a acting nominations they're very complicated names but it's the top bacteria that causes periodontal disease and gingivitis we found in in a very young population are those all are those all faculty of anaerobes or any of those yeah and anaerobic species most of the bacteria so cares and periodontal disease are very similar in the way they behave and they risk factors but they can be separated that carries is most aerobic species because they live in the presence of the oxygen so they're free on the oxygen because of the oral cavity most bacteria that cause productive disease they're endologic all the factors that they can go up and they can hide again inside the gums so they are nairobi that's why they love hiding in the periodontal pockets it's the perfect reservoir for them to just grow and cause inflammation and and tooth loss which is the end and just to be clear the periodontal pocket is inside the tooth and the gingival pocket is between the gum and the tooth it's all the same thing okay so so the way periodontal disease manifests is that first it starts with the inflammation around uh the gums so the way the periodontal works is that it's very seals by the periodontal ligament attaches if you were in health your periodontal ligament is very healthy it's like a muscle yeah it's very tight to you if you stop brushing which is the primary cause that uh your gums get inflamed you stop flossing or you relapse you're gonna immediately if you floss you're gonna see some bleeding that's the initial stage of periodontal disease but it's highly modifiable if you have only gingivitis you can refer to health so if you keep going and you continue with the traits of the disease the ligament is going to get inflamed and they're going to be attached to the bacteria is going to come in and then that whole process of inflammation bacteria and deterioration of the ligaments that's why you form the pocket and that cumulative like uh harm to the periodontal culminates in bone loss so the initial the acute periodontal disease you're gonna see someone is that they come to your office you take radiographs the gums are still somehow attached to the tooth they're inflamed very it bleeds a lot you touch it bleeds but if you go and look at the retrograde you're gonna see a big gap the bone is all done and then that's the pocket it's when the bone goes down and then if you put a probe you're gonna see three millimeters five millimeters seven millimeters it keeps going down now how does that relate to the carry because the carry typically occurs on the the sort of top surface of the tooth typically correct and everything you're describing is is often actually below the the the gum line yes well that's the next stage so once the pocket gets influenced the chronic periodontal tide is what happens is that the atrophy of the gums so the gums they're going to recede and they're going to keep going down so it's very typical that you look if i know i if i look at someone i know they have freedom to disease just by looking at their gums because you're going to see the teeth they become bigger and then you're going to see the gap uh that is going to expose the root so usually the roots of your cheek they're not mean meant to be exposed because once they expose kerry skin uh the bacteria can colonize and you can have root canals as well so you can add the coronal crease which is just on the ground of your tooth but when the root get exposed due to periodontal disease other forms of trauma malocclusion and things like that then you can get carries to take over the root of your teeth as well so in children um the the sort of typical carries that we see are on the occlusive surface correct mostly but one of the most common uh carries we call child early childhood caries which is caused by baby bottle children that like breasts not the breastfeeding but the bottle overnight and many times a day so it's mostly on the anterior teeth i don't know if you had a chance to see but the carry develop very rapid because the milk accumulates uh in that area and it's extremely uh painful it's actually one of the most common dental diseases they're the most common uh zines worldwide due to that carries everybody has dental caries why did you say it doesn't happen with breast milk because the breast milk we have studies showing that it causes much less decay than uh formula because every formal has sugar so what is it about sugar we we all grew up knowing that sugar was the worst thing for your teeth i've never understood or heard a con i don't want to say compelling reason that suggests i don't believe it i do believe it empirically but what is it about sugar is it the fructose is it the glucose is it the combination of them um that that leads to a rapid overgrowth of the uh the carry causing bacteria it's all of them it's uh fructose sucrose lactose more complex starch they're even worse um all the drinks today they have added sugar um you name it everything has sugar right but the the main mechanism is very simple actually is that um the the cardiogenic bacteria they love sugar they metabolize the sugars that actually energy for them every time that they see it so the the way they they have a very uh they have capability of attaching the tooth surface all this bacteria so they they get together and they stick to each other they and they have the ability to secrete that extra uh cellular matrix that is like a glue and the and we call biofilm and that attached to the tube so every time that you put sugar they take that sugar they metabolize that sugar as energy source and they multiply and they they grow with other food that we put it on on the other cavity as well but what happens that when they might metabolize sugar they secrete acids and that acid is the one who destroyed the enamel future so that's the cycle so that that that suggests that they're metabolizing sugar anaerobically to produce lactate if they're increasing the acidity of the environment presumably hydrogen ion is coming out with lactate they're doing this not in mitochondria they're doing this outside of mitochondria they're this is almost like the warburg effect um where whether oxygen is present or not they always choose anaerobic metabolism do we do we know if that's been looked at probably yes but i don't know uh i don't remember peter and also you say sugar but i just want to be clear do these do these bacteria have a preference for glucose over fructose obviously sucrose is both it's an equal mix of them but i want to i want to get very specific on this point is fructose specifically harm more harmful because if that's true then sucrose would be more damaging than say starch which would just be pure glucose i think the glucose is the worst especially when they do syrup you know when they they intensify and do with higher concentrations of sugar uh on that uh but technically all of them can be metabolized even the fructose from from fruits and vegetables they can metabolize that as well do you have a sense of how our species survived before we brushed our teeth how they survived yeah i mean when you think about it today if you if if after two weeks of twins not flossing their teeth never mind not brushing just two weeks of not flossing you're able to induce significant periodontal disease where you actually had gingival disease that would induce bleeding in the gums and now let's go back in time 300 years which our species look the exact same as we do 300 years ago it's not like we're talking neanderthals but presumably 300 years ago we didn't have toothbrushes and dental floss did we like do we know what oral care consisted of three or four hundred years ago um well we know that for hundred years ago we see from research that people have done to disease they have dental care this is not new right but like if i look at populations uh from developing countries for example i go to africa and i do a lot of research there they have like some plants they have like a stick that they use and they clean their teeth with that three is a three that they find so i'm assuming that people just use different devices to clean their teeth because if you think about removal of a flat is mechanical the brightness you need to just drop the biofuel what we do with brushing we're just trying to disrupt that matrix of the biofilm but they form again research shows that you clean you can have the mouth with zero black in two hours you have them all all formed again they they colonize back but we're trying to do with the brushing is just instructing that we don't let that accumulate and be like overall in in the other cavity yeah i just i i mean i i would assume that the that the food consumed somehow even though obviously people hundreds of years ago still consumed glucose and fructose maybe the form in which they consumed it was less concentrated and refined which i suppose we know it was and so they had less of an insult to the tooth but like every time i've had a bad dental pain i've said to myself how would i be functioning right now if this was hundreds of years ago and i didn't have modern medicine with you know lidocaine and a very good dentist who could take care of this like as you again i want to go back to this point earlier it is the single most uncomfortable pain imaginable you know to have palpitus or any of these things you know it's sort of you you can't function so you just highly preventable well yes we'll certainly get to that but but again i'm just i'm just constantly amazed that our uh that our our species would have had to presumably suffer quite a bit until we figured out this ability to clean these things yeah because it's it's it's counter-intuitive i i think now it seems obvious but you know if you're sitting in a cave 10 000 years ago i i don't know that it would have been the most obvious thing that you need to remove this thin film bilayer on your bio layer on your teeth right yeah and but i think the diet fibers everything was very different back there today with the modernization and the amount of sugar uh everywhere that you look it's sometimes you can't even buy anything because everything has sugar i think it's a big change on the culture and what we eat how we do things today uh i think it's much worse so let's talk about the brushing um i once heard somebody say um that the toothpaste is far less important than the tooth brush in other words you could almost brush your teeth without toothpaste but if you did a good enough job just using a wet brush to brush you were getting most of the benefit um is that true i i i tend to disagree i think both are equally important and i'll tell why because the toothpaste is the main source of poor right so the floor protects your teeth and harden the memo and protects against cavities especially in children it's extremely important that children get exposed to fluorite if they have high risk of care is that there is other sources you can paint you can have furnish you have a bunch of uh approaches that you can preserve oral health in children just by brushing and fluoride it's all about education so i and the flossing is a combination you have to clean in between your teeth you have to clean the surface you have to achieve and i needed to put food right and i'll tell you more now on my new clinical trial i'm actually brushing the oral mucosa to decontaminate against bacteria so i still think that is another neglected surface of the archive it is all the oral mucosa the tongue people don't most people don't brush the tongue and there's a lot of bacteria that accumulates in the tongue so i think it's a you need to clean every single surface uh and just the brush itself is not gonna do the job um when you say brushing the tongue is the purpose to remove bacteria or yeah okay and what about the rest of the oral mucosa do you mean brushing the gums as well well technically um the way that's not standard of care right so the way research has done and prove that you can maintain optimal uh oral health just by brushing teeth by flossing uh really well when having good nutrition and all those things uh of course there are phases in your life um where like in the specific case of my population they'll go undergoing radiation oncology they have a lot of ulcers in their mouth and they can't drink they can eat and or they cannot brush their teeth because it's so painful because of all the ulcers and then there is a whole just dozy that occurs in the oral cavity because on top of this has radiation and a bunch of things so on that specific population they need a more intense oral care program where we clean the periodontal we clean the cheek and with contaminating and brushing the our mucosa so it's it depends it depends on the risks it depends on the population that you're treating it depends on their ability to to to brush every oral hygiene program i think needs to be personalized to the person to the age to the risks that they have if they have dry mouth if they have have different diseases that affect the other cavities so it's a very unique is a holistic approach that not one regime would flip off is the importance of flossing the mechanical removal of food particles between the teeth or is it the actual transient irritation of the gum that actually provides the benefit because um you can imagine a thought experiment where a person subsided on an all-liquid diet so there would never be food particles that are between the teeth but where they might still benefit from flossing or more directly they might still experience a harm from not flossing at least that's my hypothesis which would suggest that the benefit of flossing is not just the actual removal of the gross large particle but it's the transient irritation that's created at the gum surface do you have a point of view on that yeah there have been research on that um some people on the opposite direction that my if you floss for example a mouth of someone who is immune compromised you might see nurses and doctors saying don't floss yeah what about non-immune compromised people i don't think there is any harm uh on on philosophy in in my give you more resistance to to those constant exposure to bacteria but mainly is to clean that anaerobic bacteria that it's really hiding in between your teeth so that's the main uh function of flossing and the brushing if you think about brushing it also stimulates the gum the gum is not different from any other muscle or in your body because it needs to be really strong and attached around your teeth so the brushing as well it helps a lot with that dynamic constant uh because it massages your your your all your gums you're paired on to and and i believe that it's a good benefit as well is there a benefit um or a rationale to flossing before brushing which for some reason is the way i've always done it i don't know why yes i love that because uh that's usually how we recommend actually i ask them you brush your floss and your brush again if you want to be perfect because when you brush you remove all the biofilm of the bacteria and your surface you have your teeth and you need to rinse your mouth well to just get all everything out and then you floss but imagine if you floss and then you throw in all that bacteria back in the other cavity they might populate and recolonize again so that's why i say you just brush your floss we either rinse your mouth really well after that or you just quick brush again that would be the the most uh the way if you want to be obsessed and then you need to brush your tongue because bacteria even the ones that you're flossing and throwing inside the mouth they might just colonize the tongue as well some people have fissures on their tongue and then allows them to get in when we do studies and i collect bacteria for example swabs from different parts of the mouth every study that we do we collect that buckle left buckle right thong floor of mouth throat every surface of your mouth you find your come back to you so your tongue has a different colonization from your buccal from from the floor of mouth from the troll throat we know uh colonized by bacteria and virus the hpv virus it's highly associated with oropharyngeal cancer so all those variations they they they do different things right um but you don't recommend also brushing the buccal surfaces or other surfaces if they're also a great source of bacteria i don't think i can recommend because it's not a standard care so everything that you recommend uh for example the trial that i'm doing right now i'm implementing an oral care that doesn't exist so no one tells people uh patients when they're going radiation treatment that they need to see a periodontist and do a periodontal treatment every week that's how intense it is they come we do they hold the brightness of the pair don't we clean their arterial closure we clean the teeth that doesn't exist and if you ask a dentist they're going to say why i need to do that so and that type of procedure as well is not insured so if you get a patient who are doing undergoing radiation treatment they can get speech pathology they go to see the oncologist they go to see their nutrition this is all part of the health care system and this is all they can charge the insurance or medicaid medicare oral health is not part of that so and i want that to be part of a magically compromised patient that the same way that they need to see a nutrition they need to see our own health specialists because that's going to help them respond to the cancer treatment they're not going to have the burden of infection inflammation in their mouth and of course they're going to perform better they're going to eat better because if they have ulcers they're not going to be able to eat so there's a whole benefit around that but there is no insurance would pay and that is not a standard of care procedure so i'm doing the research i'm collecting all those biomarkers and i want to prove the benefit of that and once i prove the benefit of that because now i did a clinical trial i might be able to push and get all the centers and other people to do it and that might become my standard of care for this specific population now is there evidence that cancer patients because of two things their immune compromise through treatment coupled with the increased susceptibility and the loss of immune barrier in the mouth are actually at greater risk of systemic infections that arise from the mouth yes yes there's a lot a lot of research on that um and that's what i believe as well and when they're going on top of everything that is going on with them they have horrible dry mouth week two of radiation they cannot two or three they can some patients cannot produce saliva anymore because the radiation damage the salivary glands and that's changed the whole microbiome allows opportunist organisms to prevail so they have a lot of fungal infection because of the issues that they have with dry mouth and that escalates a lot of local infection and inflammation burden on the oral cavity and affects them systemically because i don't have data from the trial that i'm doing right now but the reason i was i'm doing is that on my small pilot that i did to lead to this large trial that i'm doing now i saw that main inflammatory markers i i look at saliva inflammatory markers and microbiome before they started the trial in three months after they completed the last dose of radiation and then when i look at cytokines i sampled several cytokines in saliva most of them they are completely suppressed on the oral cavity they're all cancer patients but the group that i didn't do the periodontal disease they all had even increased on those but the ones that i did is very comprehensive they all gone suppressed on the negative so it's clearly showing that that's something going on systemically on those patients that is just because i'm brushing your teeth and and and the way my study started that's why i always say that it makes me so happy when i'm discussing oral health with mg like in smart that understands a lot about about those things is that i started my life when i was at nyu and i used to work with all the radiation colleagues and all the surgeons that are doing surgeries on the patient so they diagnose the cancer and because i was doing research i would go to the or collect the samples and take over the the patients throughout the whole research when they're looking for other cancers and all those things and i started looking at those patients now they said i can't believe that that is not a single doctor who is looking at their mouth they have horrible oral hygiene they got the cancer they're depressed they start radiation right after surgery which they already can't brush their teeth because sometimes they they lose they half of their jaw they take their tongue so they're highly their ability so they stop brushing and they're going to radiate when they get into radiation then comes with arching radiation also changes the microbiome and they develop horrible ulcers in their mouth and then they become immune compromised and so it's a whole cascade of things that happen in those patients and then i started one of them i came to the oral surgery and i said do you mind if i start cleaning your patient's mouth and i said why do you want to clean and he said well i know he's going to go into radiation let me do a dental cleaning i can't look at anymore the way this i said pat do it whatever you want to do it so i start doing my cleaning periodontal disease and after i treat it and they were going through radiation some of them i'd say well i'm gonna clean your mouth twice a week radiation is usually six to eight weeks so if i change clean your mouth every two weeks at least you're gonna get a baseline middle radiation and end and others will say well if he's not responding really well i always just start trying to say what can i do to to get a good oral health others i start every week and then after i tweeted like 10 patients uh i got a call in my office with the he was a head his name is nico sanfilippo he was the the head of the head and neck group and he said i never had never talked to him but he was the referrals from our patients because you have the cancer you'll have the surgery or not and then you radiation oncology is like a referral so you need to find a radiation oncologist that can see your patients so he called me and said pat can you tell me what you're doing with my patients and i was like scared because i knew that wasn't like a perfect like extent of care and then he said well i have maybe eight patients that you treated and they don't develop mucocytes and they're sitting on my waiting area and they're talking to each other well i went to see pat pat is doing that that's doing that and then i said can you tell me what you're going doing and i said nick you're gonna laugh but i'm brushing it of course it wasn't that brushing but it's oral hygiene and he was going to say pat can we do a pilot i'm fascinated by that and then we did we saw 16 patients that's the pilot that i submitted and we got the grant but that was how everything started was him calling and saying what's going on now how in depth was the oral care you delivered to these patients is it the type of thing that they could do for themselves if taught or did it have to be done uh while they're sitting in a dental chair and by someone who was highly trained it's a combination actually on the current trial i'm trying both approaches if i can just give a baseline cleaning because if they have a lot of if you someone has a lot of plaque in it for a long period of time and you haven't brushed for six months for example the plaque becomes harder and becomes touches no one can remove that unless we have a very specific ultrasound that vibrates an instrumentation that's what we do every six months when we go and get our dental cleaning they either scrape your teeth with very sharp instruments or they use the electronic one to disrupt and take the plug so at a minimum you have to do once in a dental office but in my trial i'm doing both because i don't know which one is better nobody ever did before so one group i'm doing mechanical debridement as a period don't just it's the same even i go sub gingival i'm trying to flush every toxins that i have sitting on the aura mucosa inside their gums all the gums on the tongue i i brush and floss it's that is not a single surface on the aircraft that don't clean how long does that take it takes one hour on the chair okay the other group we give them a dental hygienist come every week she reinforces the importance of brushing crossing and she flosses the patient's mouth tell them how to properly do that so it's just to blind the study they both come to the clinic they didn't have to pop because it's just a brush but we want to blind so both groups come to the chair and the hygienist does a light cleaning flossing only and and brushing or she doesn't holistic comprehensive approach that i put together um so which is something that is striking going on right now on that my patients in either group they're not the following the disease now now how just to make sure i understand how many of these patients are patients with head and neck cancer where they're developing um they're either directly receiving radiation to the mouth or this area which is resulting in the deterioration of the environment versus patients with other cancers whose chemotherapies are rendering them uh susceptible due to the mouth sores that are pretty common with chemotherapy coupled with you know the anticholinergics that can dry the mouth out well on my population because i wanted to do a more controlled clinical trial and they all had enough cancer okay uh scheduled to undergo radiation uh the head and neck cancer can be different areas of the head and neck but i have a very strict inclusion criteria that at a minimum of 50 grades of radiation needs to be delivered to the other coverage due to the cancer because i know that in this particular condition hundred ninety percent of them will develop myocytes and this is male and female male female and we have rt only and we have combined uh uh treatment our cheap plus chemo 100 got much size this is not a single patient if you have a combined uh program regime like that it's very aggressive they all and then on top of that they get immune compromised so but these are mostly squamous cell not lymphomas and head and neck lymphoma is correct this is mostly squamous cell yeah and how many of these patients are hpv positive probably 90 of them all of our angel oral cancer there it's very low incidence which is known by research as only the oropharyngeal cancer that has been linked to the age most most of them have hpv deposits this is an interesting epidemic that's getting very little attention and i don't know why but i think these hpv-driven squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharyngeal region really frighten me because we don't have really adequate ways to screen for them the way we can screen for hpv cancers of the pelvis in women um you know unless people are doing very advanced imaging like you know mris they're often caught quite late um what do you think accounts for the rise in incidents we're seeing of this cancer well i mean it's obvious that it's the hpv but but yeah is it just sexual transmission like why do we why are we yeah it is sexual transmission uh so we wearing condoms it's oral sex we know uh today that is sexual transmission um of course uh combined with poor oral health they might cause disease or not because we know there are like several product bacteria they they have a very symbiotic relationship they they allow virus to grow like the pg values there's several studies that show that they can allow other virus to grow immune system deficiencies as well we know that every time that you have your immune system is not strong allows viruses and bacteria fungal infection to go so you might have it over abundance as well um but it is it's it's just you need to modify habits so you can prevent i want to go deeper into this but before we do i want to actually go back to some of the more mundane stuff the the the real uh you know the blocking and tackling of dentistry and talk about uh caries again and what like what the stages of caries look like when the tooth can be preserved all right so so when you're just replacing a little bit of enamel and then what that next layer of damage looks like that ultimately leads to a root canal presumably once the pulp is irreversibly damaged and then ultimately when even that can't be reserved and a crown is no longer sufficient and you have to replace the whole tooth can you um i know you have some nice figures on that can we can we kind of go through those different stages of of dental care because i think it is important to see these images it certainly helps me understand what's going on so technically the first initial stage of dental decay is the one that breaks through the memo they're very incipient the case they haven't got to the second layer of the tooth and the those are the ones some of them even like if they we call white spot lesion you start the decalcification they can be reversed if you have a child you can have a very intense fluoride varnish application there you would reverse so most of those various supreme televisions we should be touching our tree and and to be clear um is this the type of thing where the dentist will use a little probe and say it's a little bit soft there but i i think it's okay or it's a shadow on the tooth but they're confident that it's yeah they're they're like some controversy on that uh in the past they would have that very pointy probe and they would poke and and do inspection today most people they would clean and they look with air because you don't want to break the enamel more yet right because if their neighbor is already with lots of minerals you don't want to be poking so you need to be very careful when it's a very superficial case like that because you might want to restore in a different way but this is not painful the enamel carries have no have come nowhere near the pulp so no one feels anything there's no cold insensitivity or heat insensitivity very very minimal most people then they they just don't even know it's there and then when it gets close the more it gets close to the pulp because it has so many nerves the more painful it's going to be okay the density now is very soft so it's more like a sponge that it's there with very rich and and inside so the moment it hits the denting it's painful so that's when you're going to start feeling like you get something cold and say something stiffened might too hot is more signs of inflammation if you feel the hot surfaces things that you put in your mouth uh or when it gets infected and the bacteria can come to that hole and start colonizing then it starts the inflammation and that pulsation that you feel and the pain now doesn't stop and and what is when you when you before you get to full-blown pain when you're just dealing with temperature and sensitivity is there anything that can be gleaned clinically between the the cold versus the hot insensitivity versus both yeah most uh if i'm not an endodontist expert but um most tests that they do uh to look for inflammation and infection uh when you have like more of that hot sensation that is painful you know that you most likely might need to do the root canal because it's highly infected inflamed uh the cold it's a little bit better um because it's not in more advanced stage and then when you go if the crack the decay progresses that's when you see on this other two uh figures is that it hits the pope the moment it hits the pope there is no way you can uh not do the root canal because now everything is already infected and most root canals are done when the pope it's true alive they just excise the pope uh and and clean it is in fact so it's not from a dead tissue that has been there for a long time because it it's it's hard to keep up with the pain but just to be clear that the dentin carry can be fixed without a root canal yes yes if it is not as close to the pope that we got to the point that is infected and you broke through you you can restore so this is my this is my this is my own personal misery the bo both root canals i've had were from what i now believe were denton carries so they were they were um the first one was actually a dentist that wanted to change an old filling that i had from when i was a child so i had an old mercury filling from when i was a kid and fast forward 20 years he said you know your insurance will cover the changing of this to a white filling we should just change this out keep in mind for 20 years i had no complaint of this filling whatsoever and the moment he changed that mercury filling over to a white one in the process of mucking around that tooth started really hurting and over the next couple of weeks the pain got worse and worse and worse and ultimately i needed a root canal on that tooth so needless to say i was uh very unhappy about that let sleeping dogs lie the next one i had um was was the same thing was it was another filling that um that the dentist thought in this case hey i think there's another little carry next to it it should be an easy fix and it it actually was on a wisdom tooth and but my teeth my mouth seems to be big enough that i'm able to tolerate having all my wisdom teeth so he said look we can do a root canal on a sorry this was before we needed the root canal this was just hey we'll just replace or fix the carry there but same thing it ended up hurting and hurting and hurting so they ended up doing the um the root canal i still have that tooth with a you know i didn't even they didn't even put a crown on that one actually um which is amazing on a wisdom tooth not to have a crown i assume um so um you you said something very interesting that's counterintuitive i suppose which is most times you do a root canal the pulp is actually alive but you still have to remove it all i mean they they still once they anesthetize you they kill all that pulp right they they yeah so so the process is remarkably crude um they're using these little fine uh i don't know what you want to call them they're almost like needles but they're a bit bigger and they're sort of serrated i remember wanting to play with these things after i had my root canal but it's like these little you you wind these little serrated jagged tools into the end of the route is that it's basically a very mechanical procedure it is but uh today they're very sophisticated uh they do all microscopically i think in the past they had a lot of the issues from a hundred years ago is because we're not sophisticated enough so they would put those fine things and they would break through the roots because they couldn't see well and they caused immediately like the inflammation the reaction because you're just perforating everything but today if you look today how they treat periodontal disease it's a microscopic surgeon so they just put the tooth under the microscope they're completely a septic environment because they put those rubber bands into to isolate yeah to not let the bacteria from their cavity to get inside and they do the whole excision of the probe they disinfect everything and they fill in with special materials to just feel the whole it becomes like just a cast the truth because there is no more vitality on that cheek but yet preserves function which is extremely important that's why you shouldn't be extracting audio team unless you really need it because it's not even the implants is better than your even without having a root canal is not better than your naturally yeah i mean i think that's probably one takeaway here which is uh and i want to talk about the the the concerns that people have around root canals because it seems to be one of these very controversial topics in some small circles but um if you're going to have a root canal it seems to me that you you have to have this done under a microscope by an endodontist i just think the days of freewheeling root canals where a dentist is looking through his or her glasses you know regular glasses and and and ramming these things through um just doesn't make any sense and i know that both of my root canals were done initially in that way ultimately both of them needed to be corrected by endodontists who did it with microscopes in a much more aseptic fashion ultimately one of them ended up um developing an abscess many years later that tooth needed to be extracted so yeah which by the way after that tooth was instructed i was i was relieved of so much pain that i decided in a temporary moment of insanity i wanted to in that moment have all of my teeth extracted and replaced by implants so i could never deal with this again of course that's an idiotic no yeah yeah no so let's talk about the the controversy around root canals right you know basically the controversies are root canals um are a dangerous procedure and they lead to kind of fill in the blank and fill in the blank is i've heard everything right i've heard people say oh root canals cause cancer they cause alzheimer's disease they cause sore toes you name it um what what is the what is the state of evidence uh about the safety of root canals or frankly the state of evidence that root canals are indeed uh potentially hazardous uh it's hard to say in a nice way but um i think it's a total nonsense it's been for it's a hundred years ago that all those focal theories that they they said that would exist there is zero evidence clinic that is no research there is nothing that can uh prove that this is true uh if you think about i was even the other day talking to one of my faculty because i said i'm not a endodontist so i don't know that i've had i've done for now but it was a long time ago but i was asking him what do you think about that and he said the same things about this there's no common sense on what's going on is that focal point of infection but what he said is that if you think about the most root canals the way they start is through the crowns and the same bacteria that colonizer to goes inside the pulp and then comes and goes inside the root and that's the infection that we're saying right that it's causing all those infections but this is all in your body already and if that's the case every time that you have a dental caries you need to extract the tooth because it's all the same route of infection so when i think about all those things and talking to him and said this makes no sense there's no way you can explain that and again i still think if it is well done of course there are a lot of root canals out there that people don't know what they're doing they don't clean well they leave things behind or they perforate and and we see with how many radiographs we take and we see a focal infection on the boat uh but that's because it's small cracks or someone oh no even they couldn't see well to do a proper way right but as a and today most root canals if you walk in the clinic today they all under a microscope and and i can guarantee is really well done uh the process and people don't have issues act after that if it is well done yeah i mean i guess the question is even in the cases of root canals which were not done ideally such as mine um beyond the local complication which is the need for subsequent root canals uh ultimately the need for even an extraction does that pose a systemic risk even when it's done poorly i don't believe so most have localized their few surgeries that they do and they open through the gum and they clean that area and you see that uh improve uh i i don't believe that they're like uh with this root canal for example there are another paper who's saying that people with root canal have breast cancer for example but then they look at a hundred of women that didn't have root canal and also had breast cancer so yeah there was a paper that said these these epidemiologic sort of i call them bottom of the bird cage papers um because that's that's about what they're good for um they're the papers that say well if you look at the number of women who have had a root canal on the same side that they get breast cancer it demonstrates the relationship but these papers always fail to fail you know they fail to look at the numerator which is all the women who develop breast cancer who did not have root canals they don't have yeah yeah so so it's it's true true and unrelated and it's unfortunate because i think it i think what bothers me the most about this type of pseudoscience is when a woman gets breast cancer it's already upsetting enough i think the last thing she needs to be told is this is because you had a root canal five years ago um and sort of that's that's probably the biggest issue i take with this sort of nonsensical um science and unfortunately it tends to aggregate from the same group of people who tend to have other beliefs that are very unsubstantiated such as vaccines causing autism and things like that so there tends to be kind of a core group of beliefs like that um so um let's let's go back a bit to the kind of broader theme of these systemic diseases um when you think about major chronic diseases is it safe to say that the greatest causal relationship we have between poor oral health and poor systemic health would be with cardiovascular disease or do you think there are and so i guess first of all how strong do you think that relationship is causally and how does it compare to others there is a lot of research showing association uh we don't know what comes first so they show the relationship that's proven with periodontal disease and diabetes you know those diseases in low birth weight proton to disease and heart that is a hypothesis of course it's all based on the insult of the bacteria causing inflammation and systemic health we know that um and other things alzheimer's for example amyloid in the brain and a few studies that we did uh showed uh markers as well periodontal disease and markers of alzheimer's so it's they're all associations but the only way you can say casuality is if you do a clinical trial right you need to treat those patients and see changes on those markets and then you say see i changed their behavior they're brushing their teeth now look how better they became so we need to do those things we have a group of people that i work with uh from nyu since i was at nyu moni di leon is his name and dr kamer she's been for over 10 years trying to make the point she has all those papers she saw for example children with um that have mortal skills or i think she her her study was in um i just blinked here now the name of the disease but we found in children uh that they have amyloid better envelope in in their brains accumulation because and we know this population has very poor oral health they have proton titles and six years old uh it's down syndrome so the first study that she looked it was down syndrome so we know because they have motor skills they have cognition issues and it's a very hard to brush so that's interesting so because we know that children with down syndrome are very susceptible to alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease in fact um people with down syndrome usually do not live a normal life span and they usually succumb to these chronic conditions much sooner as early as in their 40s or 50s so you're saying that um well again it's hard to know if the increase that she sees in amyloid is an independent process that's being driven by the chromosomal abnormalities that are found in in in down syndrome versus related to the poor oral care which could be true true and unrelated it could be that they have poor oral care because they're they don't have the life skills developed to to provide or care so an interesting experiment would be a longitude yes a longitudinal study of two groups of you know peers with down syndrome one that are provided intensive support for oral care and one that are you know uh sort of standard of care and but again those are very difficult studies to do because they're very time consuming well they are but they're it's all about prevention right how about if you intensify a very intense preventive approach so we don't let that child be with carries and pedophile disease and pain and inflammation and all of that it's not only that disease it's any people with disability um so like we just opened at uh penn right now because the gene's visionary he really he's really focused on prevention he opens a center for people with disabilities so any person who has any uh motor skills or have any disease that impacts uh cognition we're gonna create this program that we can do a lot of research how is the best way of cleaning toothpaste toothbrushes what can we intensify in this population we reach through caregivers it's a whole educational process because it's not them we need to educate people who are taking care of those injured middles to do an optimal oral hygiene it's simple as that can we just brush brush brush fluid right intensify because you can prevent all those things are highly preventable but i was looking for say what are we going to measure there is no outcome assessment that you can use for this specific population because they're so neglected but but going back to your earlier point just to make sure i understood did you say that if you took two groups of people and one group received excellent oral care and the other group did not and this is not in cancer patients let's just say patients who are not immune compromised and whose oral mucosa is not compromised so if this hasn't been done consider it a thought experiment one group receives best-in-class oral care which i want to come back and define the other group receives horrible oral care or mediocre at best would you expect to see a difference in inflammatory markers including cytokines and uh inflammatory cells macrophage monocyte-derived lineage cells across those two groups because if that's true that alone could explain the increase in systemic disease in other words that could be a causal factor it's undeniably well established the relationship between inflammation and cardiovascular disease you could take two people that have virtually an identical profile of lipoproteins but in one group the high amount of inflammation will lead to a greater burden of disease than in the other inflammation plays an important role in cancer and certainly inflammation plays an important role in alzheimer's disease so that to me seems i guess the easiest hype that's the occam's razor approach here which is poor oral health leads to poor uh uh to leads to poor uh or substandard amounts of inflammatory environment and that's the driver of these diseases that would be my guess yeah it's very simple nick but think about uh peter when did you ever go to a doctor you were md that the doctors ask you how's your mouth do you have periodontal disease how do you brush your teeth think about sure it's not it's not at all part of the doctor's tool kit ever so look what's going on with covid kovid is a infectious disease what is the transmission of kovid saliva is the mouth now there are papers coming up because of the the ac2 receptors which is the covet bind to enter the body they are highly expressed in your cavity look at the literature they're in the tongue floor of mouth gingival curvicular fluid they're everywhere in your mouth so a patient gets coded the two things that i i'm like very like surprised and saying why people are not doing anything so people get cold they go to the hospital the first thing that they do they put them a mask they never brush their teeth they don't look if they have productive disease how is the quality of the oral cavity they put on the subpoena position because they need to free up the lungs and that patient spends what a month some people more than that in a very critical condition do you think this is going to lead to pulmonary infection of course right if someone has periodontal disease and already have a lot of bacteria and pockets all the periodontal pocket is a perfect reservoir for the virus to drive and even like the new you know if you saw there is a publication that just came out only hypothesis because nobody ever tested that it might be if you look at the characteristics characteristics of kovi the way manifests the upper respiratory tract in terms of secretion how congested you have is very minimal you might have a stuffed nose but it's from the mouth goes directly to the lungs so there is a huge connection there no one is doing anything to tell people can you brush your teeth do a mouthwash clean your mouth if you have covered you have to have excellent in the hospitals give the nurses you have to ask this patient to brush because no one is doing that look at the committee so of course now science is going back because our new president they have they're very they're fostering all those prevention maps and everything look at the committee that we have that has been putted to support co-feed is that any one of them is a oral expert i'm guessing not uh or epidemiologist an oral periodontist is anyone there if there are anyone there that has them understands a little bit about the mouth if you connect the mouth with the body and can guarantee that you can prevent look what's going on in brazil china it's just ridiculous because there is no prevention the only prevention is the mask which we could do something better right um some are some argue that last year we saw a great increase in the rise of dental caries some suggest that it had to do with mask wearing uh to me it seems the most obvious explanation would be simply that people sought less dental care last year do you have a point of view on first of all is it true that dental caries went up last year well so what happened it's that we're still dealing with that is that when kovid hit dentist was considered uh not essential so they shut down everything that wasn't essential which healthcare and places that you can buy food and things like that so dentist was left behind so dental clinics i know because i had to suspend my clinical trials for three or four months i came back immediately the moment they allowed me to open the clinic but dental clinics they were closed completely close not

[01:30:03] [Music] so available couldn't go to the dentist you saw horrible things on the internet we had left our emergency clinic open only and we saw really detrimental things because people couldn't get access to care so combined with of course putting masks and if you're wearing a mask at work a whole day you forget to brush because you can't drink too much because you need to hide because you have to drink water or eat so everything is detrimental you might breathe more through your mouth because the mass people don't know how to breathe well through the mask so it drives your mouth you have dry mouth because you're breathing so this combination of for our hygiene you have dry mouth you have a mask in you so it's not the mass that is causing anything but it's just a cumulative effect of everything that is going on yeah that makes a ton of sense um you mentioned thrush earlier right so oral candida and you mentioned it in the obvious context of people who are immune compromised but from time to time i've seen people with a totally normal immune system develop oral thrush now i will say there's one there's usually something going on like they're usually on an inhaled steroid for asthma or something like that so maybe that's partially uh explaining it but but do you have any other explanations for how a person with a normal immune system could develop oral uh candida or thrush it's it's highly associated with candidate infection and it can be through i think the primary reason is lack of saliva because your mouth is dry so that's why mds they should look at their patients and how much how much education they have if and ask the question you have time they might have in other complications that you don't even know why um but primarily i i would think it's uh poor oral hygiene because if you have horizontal disease and poor oral hygiene you're gonna allow those opportunistics uh species to grow and medication um it's it they don't have a specific cause but mainly i would say medication and poor all have uh would allow vitals to grow we sit a lot in fungus yeah i've said vitals because virus and fungal they walk really well together like people with hiv they have episodes constant of fungal infection in their mouth so so there are lots of reasons why people could have dry mouth certainly the one of the most popular classes of drugs that would do it are anticholinergics it's also interesting by the way that there's some strong associations between anticholinergics and alzheimer's disease it hasn't been demonstrated whether that's causal but if indeed anticholinergics which lead to a very dry mouth would increase the or rather decrease the resistance of the bacteria in the mouth to the um the systemic system and that could play a role so it becomes very interesting but for an individual who has dry mouth is there a downside in using you know sugarless chewing gum or lozenges or you know sort of having something in the mouth to induce saliva is there a downside to that is that considered one of the effective methods that someone can use to keep their mouth lubricated yeah yeah i don't see any wrong uh doing that but never use anything that it's sugar uh content right there are a lot of sugar substitutes that you can do because you can stimulate the salivary glands and you constant moving your tongue and your mouth and i will say hydration it's extremely important as well uh if you don't like to drink just get a sip water all day long you're always washing the oil cavity the gas intestinal tract because it's all one system it starts in the mouth and go through the bacteria they they are all together so always hydration and drinking water i think it's very important for oral health as well now have you looked into xylitol specifically i've seen some literature to suggest that xylitol may actually not only not be harmful because i think there are lots of things out there that are not harmful um you know aspartame or any other things that might be thrown into gum that are sugar substitutes but that xylitol specifically could be beneficial and and so i've always kind of my practice has been to have some xylitol based chewing gum that if i'm out and i eat i can chew it for a while to serve two purposes one is you know get saliva there but two also kind of clean the food out of teeth do you recommend anything like that because a person can't brush their teeth four times a day presumably at some point it becomes counterproductive yeah they're the i they're the one that i like the most i actually did some research a long time ago where we're looking for mothers to child transmission of dental caries we know that as mutants can be highly transmissible from mother to child um for different things like the mom who proved the food and put in the child's mouth it's proven that and transmits transmit distract mutants uh the child uh they've done some research about kissing in the mouth they didn't find a huge correlation but they know that proving and tasting their food and which is you should take a look at nunnies and people who are watching children right um but uh i really like xylitol and we found that we prevented the transmission because we gave the xylitol to the mumps during the gestation time we ask them to chew on xylitol just to prevent that uh vertical transmission of of the mutants that's that means so it's it's it and it prevents decay 2 because the bacteria does not metabolize that that's that's great so i'll i'll plug my favorite brand of it i use i use one called pure p-u-r-e you can buy it on amazon and i i like the i like the pure gum and the pure mints okay let's talk about teeth whitening generally the two things people notice about somebody's teeth when they smile is how straight are they and how white are they um so so let's talk a little bit about the latter um is there is is is is the color of a person's tooth genetically determined somehow yes we can see that different braces they might have more white but it's a it's relative as well because let's say for this person with the darkest skin they keep they're going to become much more whiter so it's almost blend with someone who has a very white skin most of the changes on tooth color can either be done by some uh genetic factors that people who might have a lot of very yellow and that would never change but since uh they're born or uh sometimes they're like um in few countries they have floored floor in the water so excess of fluoride might have some stains on your teeth but mostly the color of the cheap is it's highly environmental uh determined um because uh we talked about my study with the twins uh where when we gave the same product for the two twins they they behave completely different so even they were identical a hundred percent of the music the kid who had had like eat a lot of drink a lot of tea coffee and things they have yeah much more staying their teeth and of course the whitening wasn't as efficient of another one who had less so the environment takes place and it's highly you can modify just with those whitening products brushing things like that yeah i have found that for me that the two worst actors by far in terms of darkening my teeth are black tea and red wine they will they will i've be i don't we're going to talk about whitening in a second because i want to ask you about it i don't whiten my teeth due to sheer laziness but um so so my approach has been to just try to minimize how dark they get by always rinsing my mouth out with water or chewing gum or something like that after i consume those things um so so is is whitening a safe procedure is it is it um you know is it something that harms the tooth in an effort to produce this aesthetic does it does it bleach the enamel away or do something that's dangerous yeah it's it's bleach right and it's of course in excess which most people do because they want to always have much wine uh it's it's detrimental because somehow uh it has lots of minerals because of this the product is very strong also if you're allowed to touch the guns uh he's very aggressive because you're bleaching and it cannot be for prolonged time so what i tell people is that if you want to do at home because it's less expensive ideally you should do at the dentist if you care about your teeth you do at the dentist they're going to protect your gum they're not going to apply the product if you have to adopt a disease if you have root cares and all those things they'll know exactly what is the population who can have that but people just go and buy out of the counter and they don't know what they're doing sometimes they place that and they watch tv they spend hours or every time they have a party oh i want my chief white they put again and then becomes that constant demineralization of course you're gonna have to start to do you're gonna harm your gums and things like that so if you wanna do talk to your dentist ask them should i am i can't date for that and do at the dance do it the correct timeline look at the prescription don't do cheap or produce they're not fda approved so all those considerations if you do the right way it's okay um it's just when they uh go outside to do things that they shouldn't but it still seems that prevention is is worth a lot here if you minimize the things that make your that really discolor your teeth it would at least reduce the need to to to those other things um i alluded to it earlier that one of my most miserable dent not one of my hands down my most miserable dental experience of my life went as follows mercury filling placed when i was whatever 10 30 years later someone comes along and says you really ought to have that removed because you your insurance company will now cover the replacement of these and you can have something white instead of something silver um and that damaged the dentin and or pulp enough that i needed a root canal that root canal and eventually that's the one where they missed the route i gotta had to go back and back and back and back and ultimately led to uh an injury that required the tooth coming up okay let's go back to the jugular question should we remove mercury fillings now if they're highly functioning there is no decay under there are several statements and research that has been done and that's the minimum they're afraid about the mercury that gets in there it's proven that there's no harm uh with that so if if it's working fine if you ain't functioning and it doesn't affect the appearance the aesthetics of you too just leave it there i don't think you should okay you also talked about fluoride earlier um this might sound like a naive question but does all toothpaste have fluoride in it no uh you have to look for and not all of them have the correct amount you want to like a thousand ppm to 1500 ppm okay a floor um so that's very important so you have to and the ada the american dental association if you go to their website they have all the toothpaste that they endorsed not for political reasons or anything because we've done research and we know they work they have the correct amount of fluoride that prevents decay so you just need to get from a good source and it's extremely important to have fluoride in any toothpaste usually child children before one year they they recommend not to put it on because they swallow all the time but as long as they have the first tooth in their mouth you can start putting very small amounts and start the dredging to to brush the child gets used to uh but other than that everybody should use right and is there fluoride at all in any small amount in drinking water it depends uh i know that u.s is very particular with uh fluoride in many regions uh people don't like to have most countries the drinking water is fluorated um but there are additional sources of fluoride that pediatrician they can give you like drops that you even when you're breastfeeding you can just put drops on the child um and or varnish which i think is extremely extremely preventive for children it's so simple it's like a varnish then paint in your teeth every six months and uh guess what it will develop decay because it's just protecting more and more so i do that myself also yes for any i have discovered that um i have one area in my mouth where my gum has receded just a little bit and as opposed to putting a filling there i just use every three to six months a little bit of what you said like sort of a fluoride varnish and it reduces any sensitivity and my goal is obviously just to you know prevent any decay there yeah the fluoride varnish if someone is highly susceptible to decay we have a uh it's a prescription based you have to ask your doctor your dentist to call is a one of the ones that we have in the market is prevalent i give to my cancer patients but they are highly constant creative fluoride and we recommend that they use once every night and for people who are high risk uh of caries which is people undergoing radiation and then you do a regular oral hygiene with the regular fluoride toothpaste your floss and everything and then you put that toothpaste um on a toothbrush and then you rinse you brush and you don't rinse with water right you want the product to just to treat the cavities and everything overnight right so that's very efficient as well um and mainly you know and it's a very fun story if you ask my son because i have two kids and none of them have never had decay how old are they uh today they are oh 30 34 so but they never had decay but if you think for instance which my youngest uh because i would tell the stories about uh microbial that they're gonna eat your teeth if you have food they're gonna eat the food they're gonna just go down and make holes in your teeth so i would tell them those stories overnight and how many times that kid in the middle of the night you because he would fall asleep and i'll put him like three years old in the bed and i would watch him in the middle of the night rushed the bathroom and brushed their teeth because they're afraid i always told them because the most important time of the day is actually night brush and never give the child baby bottles and things overnight because when you're sleeping you have a suppressed saliva production and that's the perfect environment to the bacteria to grow that's why child have baby bottle decay because when they're sleeping and they put the bottle in their mouth the milk concentrates all on the anterior teeth and they get severe decay so brushing before you go to bed and you floss you'd like a hood that you're having a pot more optimal or hygiene is really high and you're going to prevent right it's a very important brush in time what are the implications of children having carries in their baby teeth i mean for example i assume we would never do a root canal in a child you just yank the tooth out because you know that the adult tooth is coming right behind it um do do do people put fillings into children's teeth it's it's uh highly complicated to treat those kids um first because you traumatize them uh you cannot do local anesthesia they would never come back to the dentist to try to do that in a regular way because they don't understand they they're very young it's one two three years old that those type of decay appears so they do in the hospital under sedation the cheek that they can treat they treat they would extract the ones they're causing a lot of pain some of them just treat the pulp put some education there and wait until the tooth exfoliates just to preserve function because otherwise they're not going to be able to chill so every case they need to approach that is another type of fluoride as well um but even it's a highly concentrated that they put with a metal uh together but the chi becomes black either that's another resource that they have because they cannot open put a hole and restorations because the child would never allow us to do so so excessive fluoride darkens teeth just this specific time it's um it's mixed with a metal that the moment it gets in contact with this soft denture it hardens and becomes that very hard layer okay so it doesn't affect their adult teeth it's just a temporary barrier until the tooth falls out yeah our rest is dedicated okay in a very nice way but we need to tell the mom and say i know it's going to take the pain away it's going to rest and decay but the teeth is going to become black so it's a it's a trait because we know that a couple years later the tooth is going to exfoliate it's not going to be black forever so it's an approach that we can do for this age of children there's a an entire cottage industry of products out there like oil for pulling through the teeth and tongue scraping things are you aware of any research that supports the use of such devices you've obviously talked about brushing the tongue but any research that suggests scraping the tongue is efficacious or i don't even understand what oil pulling is although i've seen the oils and i don't i don't think i fully understand what the claim is about why oil pulling is beneficial are you aware no i honestly i've seen i have no idea there is no clinical or research evidence that shows that it's good or bad i've seen a few studies on the tongue scraping which is similar with whatever the brush is doing but i really like much better the brush because i asked the patients to put a little bit of toothpaste because toothpaste is also anti-bacterial and then you just brush it doesn't harm the cells or anything just brushing the surface um if i had to choose between this toothbrush brushing the tongue the scraping i'll say just brush um it's simple and easy okay is there a difference between the the types of dental flosses out there so the two most common that i see actually let's say three one is like kind of the ribbon you know it's like a very soft almost looks like a gore-tex like ribbon um the other is like kind of like a a you know a rope a miniature rope and then the third one would be like kind of a miniature rope that's coated in wax are they all basically the same and you just pick the one that is the most comfortable to you or do you do you have a preference for which type of floss a person uses well what i tell my patients i have like 10 different ones and what i tell them which one you're more comfortable using it's a mechanical the brightening it's disruption of the biofume and taking the food away from in between your teeth so they're people who have perfect very close together they might need to use the one that has the wax because they're going to go in and out very quick and you don't want to harm your gums trying to pull in something very strong and then it's going to cut the ground has to be done very carefully the people who have prosthetics or because they're like little brushes that they can put inside um the people who have like cheat they're connected to each other and they have another type of device that they can go inside the bridge and clean uh it doesn't really matter you just need to clean and you can clean most people don't floss really most people what do what does the literature suggest what percentage of the u.s adult population does floss once a day if i if i tell something i might not be right but i know by the whole population that i've treated it's like half of the people floss or they floss twice a week or something gets stuck they go in floss but if you ask people do you floss every day most people don't floss every day and another consideration is that floss costs money right so you keep need to keep buying all those supplies and you might not have the font might be used for different things so but if you think about flossing and brushing i still think the flossing is even more important than brushing wow because it's it's all the research that i did people can stop brushing and you recover health easily people stop flossing is the gingivitis inflammation comes so quick because the plaque that is in between your teeth you can never change or clean if you don't have a device the plaque that is on in your top of the surface your teeth you're eating you get an apple things that have fibers you somehow you just scream you drink water the saliva is constant cleaning your mouth the frosting is where they one thing is a bad bacteria because they love is the anaerobic aerobic bacteria that causes most of the systemic health such cardiovascular disease diabetes they're all an aerobic and they're the ones that are hiding there they hide in the tongue they hide in between your teeth they can hide back in your throat as well because they they like those niches that uh the oxygen don't go is a water pick an additional benefit to flossing is it at all a substitute i mean obviously um there are some cases where it's very valuable kids that have braces things like that um but how do how do you incorporate the water pick into your oral care regimen i i like it but i would say it's only if you're not able to use the traditional the brushing is the best because the water is more more if you brush then do the water pick don't do just the water pig without brushing because the water peak is that flushing of all the toxins that are in between your teeth and between your gums and all that but you cannot do just what a pig is a benefit but don't do alone any harm or benefit to using toothpicks this is just a personal obsession of mine i love toothpicks i um it sounds crazy but when i find toothpicks i like i buy them in massive quantities and there's like this one toothpick i got at a steakhouse 10 years ago and i became so enamored by it that i had to find out where they got it from and i found the company that made it but the minimum order was something like 20 000 packages so i had to buy 20 000 packages of this toothpick which i still have to this day i love them point is i always have a toothpick in my mouth am i hurting myself am i helping myself what am i doing i don't think you're hurting yourself they even had research in the past that they say that it stimulates your gums and things like that well honestly that's part of what it is like there's a there's a use case which is anytime i have food in my teeth i love doing it but what i've also realized is i love i find myself massaging my gums with the side of the pick so i put the toothpick in and i'm sort of grinding it on my gum surface and it just feels so good to me i still floss every day so it's not a substitute for flossing but that's what i was going to say yeah it's not a substitute yeah i still floss every day it doesn't do the same job because flaws that you can wrap it up go up and down but it's benign it's nothing that um i don't think any any wrong of doing that's good because i have enough to last me my children my children's children and their children for the rest of our lives this is people talk about generational wealth i don't have generational wealth but i have generational toothpicks um well um talking about that the electric toothbrush i like it a lot i was going to ask you about that okay so uh i'm an oral b guy i've tried the brawn and i've tried the oral b something about the brawn one bothered me i don't know if the frequency that it vibrated at resonated too much with my head but it didn't feel good yes but i love the oil okay so is is one superior i actually did clinical trials with both okay um they equally good the difference is that technology one is sonic so when you're doing that it's almost feel the vibrations in your head right and the oral b is much more like the vibration is much more natural mechanical and i love the mechanical because it stimulates your gum there are people who loves doing the other one um it's very fast and cleans very quick um i like the rob a lot that's the one that i have so bottom line is they're both efficacious if you can use them both and use the one that you enjoy more yes it is just whatever you're comfortable and whatever you know you're gonna clean your mouth that's what i say i've done anything all types of flaws all type of toothpaste and and it's a device that's just there for you to do your oral hygiene so let's now talk about the ideal reasonable regimen of oral care let's start with what i do and use me as an example of how i could do it better when i wake up in the morning i do nothing and the reason is i don't usually eat in the morning but i drink coffee so i don't know why for some reason i think it's a waste of time to brush my teeth first thing in the morning because all i'm gonna do is drink coffee so let's say i get up and i drink my coffee oh by the way i used to scrape my tongue i have one of those tongue scrapers i used to do that and then my wife got so mad at me because she said that's so disgusting it makes me sick get rid of that stupid tongue scraping piece of expletive so i still have it don't tell her but i don't use it anymore so i go and i drink my coffee and i kind of do all my i usually exercise in the morning and i usually don't eat my first thing until maybe 11 o'clock in the morning at that point i then go and i get my oral b toothbrush and i brush my teeth and as you probably know the oral b toothbrush has like this little 30 second timer that it does allows you to go two minutes so i'm very very robotic about this i 30 seconds on the top 30 seconds on the top 30 seconds on the bottom inside 30 seconds and then i'm done and then i don't do anything again except use my toothpick all day until dinner after dinner i then floss and i i like that i like both i like any floss actually i just love flossing so i'll use the little ropey floss and i'll use the tape floss whatever i've got and then i do the same thing with the oral b toothbrush by the way i'm using a xylitol based toothpaste for what it's worth if that matters um and that's it that's it has four it has fluoride that's that's my only oral care regimen i don't use mouthwash i don't use a water pick um i used to but then i gave it to my daughter because she got braces i figured she needed it more than i do um that's all i'm doing so what what what could i do to be am i getting 80 of the benefit uh a person can have am i at 60 benefit and what should i what else should i be doing uh so one little adjustment so usually back junior the biofilm it takes like overnight that's where you have the most suspicious bacteria they start growing in your mouth but all those reasons that i said your mouth is closed no oxygen um reducing saliva flow salivary flow is almost zero because you're sleeping and things like so people when you wake up you feel if you stop and thinking you're gonna see yes my mouth is dry if you cross your tongue on the surface of your cheek you're gonna feel the biofilm that's the only the biofilm is invisible to your eyes but you can feel with your tongue that's the morning that you're gonna see okay so there's nothing wrong a few i do that as well i like to take my cough on my bed i just read a little bit and i take my coffee without brushing i love that brazilian coffee i hope exactly espresso yes espresso so um so then you get out of the bed and you brush your teeth you have to wash out from your night okay so what so the the change you're suggesting is before i go begin my day do a do a first brush so i'm going to be now brushing my teeth three times a day i'm gonna do exactly the first the morning that's the idea okay and is it okay if that should they all be done with the oral b toothbrush or is there a time and a place to just use a regular you can use any toothbrush if you're out if you're in a place where you can brush you can use any uh if you can if you have that because the mechanical toothbrush they do such a good job although i have to be honest with you i've never been able to brush my teeth sorry brush my tongue with the mechanical toothbrush because i the no yeah i have to use the okay all right i got it you have find a i usually like i like children toothbrush yeah so you want a soft duracell toothbrush right it's soft soft for the tongue yeah just get a separate one and i tell people that every time that you use a toothbrush which most people don't do as well you rinse your toothbrush you can even rinse with soap like put water soap you decontaminate you need to clean your toothbrush oh i never thought of that so i you're saying like this you're really adding you're literally going to add another four minutes to my day you realize that four minutes to my day 28 minutes to my week you know how many hours you're adding to my year this is ridiculous well look it's worth it though so so i'm going to be healthy so i'm going to now be rinsing my toothbrush with soap and water if you don't want to put the soap just rinse with water well i always do that but now i'm committed to doing this maybe salt would salt water be beneficial you don't need you don't need no just even hand soap just rinse with water so and dry you have to dry because bacteria loves the moisture environment i hate the taste of soap because as a child my mom would often wash my mouth out with soap because of how foul a mouth i had so i'm still traumatized by the taste of soap it really it's an awful taste breeze with like hot water it is very hot so there is soap in toothpaste because soap just drops microbial okay like the kovi can be disrupted by soap you know that right so every toothpaste has soap because of that because they have most bacteria have the lipid protein in their surface so that's why we have but they put all the flavors they put the fluid right so that's why they don't feel that soap yes but that is so an antibacterial but and that's all any role for mouthwash which i don't i don't my wife loves it i don't i just it's one more dumb thing that i don't do the thing that i just like with mouthwash is that it kills every single it just wipes out all your microbiome including the good ones because they all antibacterial so i am in favor if you like in a situation that you're not going to be able to brush my much like a full short period of time let your body normal like recolonize with the good without any interference the same thing about antibiotics if you take too much antibiotics you're going to be resistant to bugs and bacteria so if you use every day in one point you're going to have a virus in your cavity but that's going to be very resistant compared to someone else that's very interesting is there any evidence that excessive use of mouthwash for example leads to candidal overgrowth or fungal overgrowth i mean that would certainly be one hypothesis worth testing i don't remember peter oh uh yeah so i don't want to say anything that i don't remember but i can i can go back and look but the studies that i did it changes the microflora so that's why i'm very concerned about changing in oral environment that is healthy so if you're healthy why are you gonna use the mouthwash right you don't need that okay anything else that we would consider best practices for the average person who is looking to preserve the quality function of their teeth and by extension their overall health besides what we've discussed well i think everything that we discussed and we talked so many times about prevention so dental care is a chronic disease and then it's through life people have dental caries their whole life the only way to control is preventing so preventing means every six months if you you need to go to a dentist and you need to do a cleaning at a meeting at that time they're gonna look do you have any cabbages because the cabbages is a niche for the bacteria to grow as well by the way is six months a magic number i mean the only reason most of us go every six months is because that's what insurance covers for free but if you decided you were willing to pay out of pocket would it be better to go every three months or every four months to do a an overall cleaning well there is a lot of research about if you maintain a good oral health you don't need to do more often someone who is a high risk you have a systemic health you have diabetes you can do three times a year for example um but the sixth month is how dentists recommended and it's through research that shows because we're going to disease is a very slow progression i see it's not a disease that you have today in three months you're gonna have two millimeters of bone loss unless you have something else in your body that combined with the inflammation that is triggering systemically then your bone is gonna do very quick go away very quick but i think because periodontal disease is slow progression and i know we did a study three years ago that we looked at people and we measure predominantly disease every two months we help the treatment we didn't do the treatment and we watched how people would progress and it's crazy there are people who progress very quick they're people who never progress and their people will take two years to progress wow so what do you think explain those differences systemic um because periodontal disease is a highly communi communicates with your body if you have a systemic issue it's going to exacerbate inflammation so wait so you you could predict the extent of disease a person has if you knew how systemically healthy or sick they were yeah you can if you have a lot of infections you have diabetes we know you're more susceptible to have periodontal disease so there are groups of risk that those particular group they need to see a dentist more often they need to do more cleanings and they need to prevent um but there there was a huge study that was done five years ago but was not conclusive it's all they'll never know this when they finish they say they don't know which way it's coming if it is the diabetes that three years of it is burden and their cavity that is treating their diabetes they couldn't uh dissect that i mean i i think the good news is they're both preventable diseases so um that again goes back to the point of prevention well pat this has been this has been super interesting uh just on a purely selfish uh basis i learned a lot so um that will immediately go into practice effective uh i guess tonight and tomorrow morning um so so thank you very much for the insights you've shared and uh i i think people will take a lot of uh practical information from
