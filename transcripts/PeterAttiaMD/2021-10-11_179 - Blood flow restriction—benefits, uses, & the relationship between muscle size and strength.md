## Description

Jeremy Loenneke has a Ph.D. in exercise physiology, a Master’s in nutrition and exercise, and is currently the director of the Kevser Ermin Applied Physiology Laboratory at the University of Mississippi, where he focuses his research on skeletal muscle adaptations to exercise in combination with blood flow restriction (BFR). In this episode, Jeremy explains the science of BFR and the mechanisms by which BFR training can produce hypertrophy using low loads. Here, he reviews anatomy and terminology of muscle structure and discusses the evidence that increasing muscular strength may not be dependent on increasing muscle size. Additionally, Jeremy goes into depth on how one might take advantage of BFR training, including practical applications for athletes and average people, as well as the situations for which BFR training would be most advantageous.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode on blood flow restriction (BFR) training:

1. **Executive Summary**:
The episode features a detailed discussion with Jeremy Loenneke about blood flow restriction training, its mechanisms, applications, and relationship to muscle strength and hypertrophy. Key topics include the physiology of muscle contraction, fiber types, and the controversial relationship between muscle size and strength. The discussion challenges conventional wisdom about the causal relationship between hypertrophy and strength gains.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- BFR involves reducing blood flow to muscles during exercise without completely occluding it [00:45:00]
- Optimal BFR pressure is typically 40-80% of arterial occlusion pressure [00:50:00]
- Type 1 (slow-twitch) and Type 2 (fast-twitch) muscle fibers exist on a continuum rather than distinct categories [00:15:00]
- Traditional belief that muscle growth causes strength gains is challenged by recent research [01:15:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Start with 40% arterial occlusion pressure for BFR training [00:48:00]
- Use lighter weights (20-30% of 1RM) with BFR [01:00:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For maximum strength gains, traditional heavy lifting (80-100% 1RM) is still necessary [01:20:00]
- BFR is particularly useful in rehabilitation settings [01:25:00]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Recommended BFR protocol: 30 reps, then 3 sets of 15 reps with 30-second rest periods [00:55:00]
- Total time under BFR should be limited to 7-10 minutes per exercise [01:05:00]
- Can be used with both isolation and compound movements, though isolation exercises may be safer [01:10:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"If you're training for maximal strength in getting as strong as possible, you probably don't care whether it's a mechanism or not, you just want to know how do I get strong." [01:30:00]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. Long-term effects of regular BFR training
2. Optimal pressure protocols for different populations
3. Role of BFR in preventing muscle loss in elderly populations
4. Potential applications in various medical conditions

The transcript provides extensive detail on these topics, but I've focused on the most practical and actionable information. Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect?

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:10] hey jeremy thanks so much for making time i've been looking forward to this one for quite a while you know both personally and professionally this is a topic i wanted to learn a lot more about something i've been playing with a lot myself including uh this morning um particularly painful session this morning of blood flow restriction which i might be doing wrong so i'm looking forward to maybe the end of our discussion when we can get into the practical aspects of it but i want to take a kind of a step back and get a sense about how you became interested in exercise in general obviously you've devoted your career to it so when did that become a passion great enough that you decided it was worth all of your study yeah uh thanks for having me on peter um i i wrestled early on in my life so i wrestled from probably the age of five through high school um but i i i wasn't really into training that much i was into wrestling but not really lifting weights or any of the conditioning and my coaches would always tell me that you need to try to get in the gym you need to stay in the gym get stronger get stronger get stronger and i didn't really listen um up until towards the end of high school and then i started uh one of my friends was really into bodybuilding powerlifting so i started training with him um and i do feel like it probably helped me a little bit in wrestling and then i i kind of got interested in just trying to see how to make a muscle get as big as possible and i started reading you know muscle magazines which is kind of the you know the common story training in a little bit then i kind of focused on exercise science early on in my undergrad again with a focus on how do i make every lecture was i was just trying to learn how to make a muscle bigger how to make a muscle stronger that's all i was trying to get out of every lecture towards the middle of i guess my undergrad you have to make a decision about you know obviously what do you want to try and do with your career and i was dead set on working with athletes um but then i did that and quickly realized that's not what i wanted to do so they suggested that i instead maybe you're really interested in research why don't you try and do an internship related to that so i landed at the university of illinois and that's where i met lane and a couple of other people and and that's where i really came across blood flow restriction um and that's where i started to really read a lot about it and then came back uh and started to really focus all of my time so i was around 2007 2008 so just about you know reading blood flow friction and how i might be able to do that so i started off with wrestling and then kind of got interested in bodybuilding power lifting and then came across blood flow restriction when i was up in illinois now you mentioned briefly that you did a little bit of work with athletes which was obviously kind of a logical uh at least place to to look but but you it sounds like you didn't find that to be what you wanted why is that you know i i think i'm a pretty mediocre athlete and i think i but i mediocre athlete but i always trained extremely hard and i think i had this mindset that you know everybody was going to train what i thought training was and how everybody was going to train as hard as i thought they should train and when i was doing a little practicum work with some of these athletes i mean they weren't world class elite athletes but they were fairly good collegiate athletes i didn't get the same vibe that everybody was into training like i was in the training at the time uh doesn't mean they weren't great athletes they obviously were it doesn't mean they didn't train hard but i my perception of how they should have been training was was not what i thought it was going to be so i i knew i wanted to be in the exercise world but i quickly realized that that's that's not for me um i i really kind of want to maybe do research and that's when i went to illinois and i was doing animal research but i didn't really like that either um i knew i was when i was there i quickly learned that i want to do research but definitely not with animals i wanted so i came back and and that's when i got into human research so where did you do your phd university of oklahoma and what was the focus of your dissertation looking at different methods of applying blood flow restrictions so looking at you know different exercise loads so 20 30 uh different pressures in other words we were trying to get at this idea of do you actually need higher pressures so in my dissertation we were doing a lot of acute work which has obviously a lot of limitations with applying it to adaptation but we were trying to really see kind of a short-term characteristic of what that response would give acutely what does this response give what does this response give and then try and kind of pick out two of the more promising ones and then study them head to head a little bit later on which is kind of what we we did once i took a job at ole miss well i can't wait to talk more about that and there's no shortage of questions i have for you but i was thinking about this last night that before we jump into a lot of the questions i have i think it will be important for people to really understand the ins and outs of muscle what's the muscle the structure of a muscle um not the gross anatomy of a muscle but obviously the micro structure the physiology of of a muscle so without worrying about going too deep i think it's okay to do that let's let's talk about a muscle um because i don't think we can get into what we're about to talk about if people don't know what a sarcomere is and what actin and myosin are and what the different types of fibers are so um if i were to sort of take a knife and cut down on my bicep and yank it off the tendon and throw it out there as a you know a muscle how would you explain to somebody what's actually going on inside that thing yeah that's a it's a good question um i think when we talk about a muscle so like just your the whole thing so it's like a box within a box within a box um so the the smallest unit of that is as you said a sarcomere which is acted in myosin and that's the kind of the proteins that we're ultimately synthesizing when we exercise so we're making more of those and if you make more of those than you break down then obviously the muscle will get bigger so when we actually exercise those actin and myosin interact and that's how we make a muscle contract and that's important because when actin and myosin interact and you have muscle contraction that's where you get a lot of this signaling for ultimate muscle adaptation so i think the the characteristics of muscle we have kind of two broad types is how we typically teach it we have type 1 which is more endurance based type 2 which is more force based but in reality those are probably on a continuum so when we exercise we can shift them we can shift the continuum one way or another depending upon the type of exercise that you're doing but in general when we become more physically active the overall fiber types shift slower so they become more oxidative they become more efficient that's the general kind of response so those are the different types of fibers the actin and myosin that's the functional unit they interact to make the muscle contract let's explain to people how that works jeremy so so [Music] you know you you pull out this sort of sarcomere and inside you have these fibers and you've got these z lines explain to people how the actin and myosin actually interact with each other relative to the z line what the contraction looks like and frankly even one of the more interesting things that i think is a bit counterintuitive the first time people learn it is which part of the interaction between actin and myosin requires atp uh yeah it's sort of it's a bit counter-intuitive when you're first presented with it right so when we decide to exercise we have a signal that goes from the nerve to the muscle basically we have a release of calcium and that calcium is going to expose the binding site so basically we have these filaments they slide past each other that's the that's the general dogma at least with concentric actions eccentric is a little bit more complex i think they're still trying to figure that out with titan but just in general when a muscle contracts so the myosin is interacting with the actin and it's causing it to pull in now atp is required to break that bond so the atb comes in it breaks it off it gets hydrolyzed which re-cocks it and allows it to be able to reattach assuming there's more calcium on board so that's the the the general basic physiology of muscle contraction so as long as calcium's there or as long as the signal is being sent uh those sarcomeres those acne myosin will keep interacting so they don't all interact at the same time otherwise you couldn't really sustain exercise but you have them you know in a textbook we talk about we have kind of like an image and we have myosin head but those myosin heads are on all the way around that myosin and they're all interacting at different times so that's how we're able to actually move through uh kind of a fluid motion and what's interesting as you said is that the atp is required to actually release the actin myosin complex which is we learned in medical school explains why a corpse is experiencing rigor mortis right when a person is dead and they're no longer able to produce atp they don't have the ability to release the actin myosin filaments that's why a body gets stiff sort of a morbid thought but it explains physiologically what's happening so let's now talk a little bit about this difference in fibers because again i think most people have probably heard of the idea of a type 1 and a type 2 fiber but as you said it's probably more complex than that and there's more of a continuum i think even by the time i was in med school the teaching was really it's a type 1 and then a 2a and a 2b and then it became a 2a a 2ab a 2b you could argue it's even more complex now let's start with the term fast versus slow twitch i've read conflicting things so i'm hoping you can clarify this for me i've read that there's no difference in the twitch speed um they all twitch at the same speed it's the force of contraction and the speed to fatigue that's being referred to so the faster twitch muscle has a higher contractile force but it also fatigues quickly hence fast twitch um is there actually a difference in the uh in the neurologic signal that's happening there or the speed of contraction for that matter yeah that's a good question i i think this is not work that i actually do um i have a lot of confusion surrounding this myself and a lot of it reading some of the work by andy galpin and some others a lot of it comes from the the old methods are still being used um and the limitations of those is that we don't have we can't do hybrids and some people say we should be using these new methods and i think it all depends on how you're actually identifying the fibers what are you doing to call it a fast or slow how are you ultimately deciding that with your methodology so i don't honestly know the ins and outs of all those the the general idea i think as you said the the type two fibers so for example type 2x those typically are bigger they're typically stronger but they fatigue much faster the type 2a it's a little bit more oxidative they're pretty forceful and you can they can sustain it for quite some time so in general when we exercise it's thought that type 2x usually transitions to type 2a and you don't have a whole lot of type 2x left over that's my general understanding type 1 fibers generally a little bit slower and they're not as forceful but they don't fatigue it takes a lot to fatigue those fibers so i think that that's the general characteristics i think how you go about identifying that uh you might get a little bit of different things but that's the general uh idea as i understand it at least and what accounts for the difference in contractile strength between a type 1 fiber and say a type 2x take two opposite ends of the spectrum so it's i mean sometimes using the extremes is helpful right so the type 1 fiber has lots of mitochondria surrounding the fibrils within the sarcomere as you said it is readily able to access glucose and fatty acid oxidatively conversely the type 2x fiber i don't even think it has mitochondria surrounding it it's purely a glycolytic tool meaning it's going to basically have to go glycogen to glucose to lactate what accounts mechanically for the difference i think most people would say that [Music] the perhaps the overall just size difference whether or not there are other things whether how how it may interact and and the the speed of it that might be different as well uh but i think those are i think the the the big characteristic difference at least in young people is that the size of the fiber is just distinctly different and i think when you look at fiber mechanics outside of the body and you test a type 1 or test of type 2 they will be different um how those interact within the body as a whole i think is quite a bit different um and that's always been an interest of mine with respect to dynamic strength moving the whole person not necessarily saying well their fiber is is still nice and strong but what about when the fiber is in the person what's going on then so i think there are i think both of those are very important i'm not i don't want to come across like i'm talking down to that type of work i think it's very important work but i think they're just different how genetically set is this it seems that there's clearly a difference in individuals capacity for work meaning aerobic work versus explosive strength anaerobic work but do you have a sense of how genetically diverse the fiber distribution is that's a good question that's kind of a question i always put forth to my class as well um i think you can look at papers and get some percentages but i i don't feel super confident doing that mostly because we have a lot not that those scientists don't know that but those are those are mass extrapolations from small bits of fibers and one of the things that i'm always interested in is you know the athlete that's thought to have like some of the greatest endurance capacities or cross-country spheres right and if you were to look at their fiber types many of them may have a predominance of type 1 fibers so the question is were they mostly born like that and then they gravitated towards sports that they're good at or was there some sort of shift with training if i had to pick one it's probably both but if i had to pick one i think there's a big genetic component there um and probably at baseline and then your response to exercise as well but it it seems to me that most people will gravitate towards events that they're pretty good at and they don't do the things that they're not good at so i think that makes it difficult to study this anyway but i do think that there's a big genetic component to it it doesn't mean again that they don't train hard or that's always the thing that i get when i have a lot of athletes in my class it's like well we train it's like there's no there's no question that you guys train extremely hard but it's also possible that there's something different about you already so that would be my my guess and you sort of already touched on it a bit but do we do we have data to suggest how malleable that is um you know we all know the extremes right like we know these sort of mesomorphic specimens that kind of look at weights and get bigger and stronger and then conversely we know that sort of wiry person who can't put on muscle no matter what they seemingly do but boy like you get them out there on a on a bike and you you can never catch them um but but when you take someone maybe who's not quite at the extremes how much can training over time and over what time period impact uh fiber type yeah i think certainly some i i don't think we're going to take someone like myself who's athletically quite average i i don't think any amount of training was going to make me elite in anything um but i do think that i could improve certain aspects of that for sure but i i don't think it's going to uh myself move me to you know up a couple notches now there could be certain some people who certainly can i think that this is um where there's quite a bit of confusion with kind of individual response data and things like that i think you know we've we've published a little bit on this topic about you know the the measurements that we have aren't typically good enough to say not only did this group increase muscle size more than this group but this individual increased more than this person but not quite as much as this person and not quite as much as this person that would require a very very good instrument so i think people often take that to mean so you're saying that there aren't individual responders i i'm not saying that at all i'm saying that we may not have the ability to appropriately determine who's who we can say overall on average doing this will increase this or that but i think that just looking around it seems at least pretty clear to me that there are some people who you give them a certain response and man do they look like world beaters a couple months later so that does tell me something is is different about them but i don't know that we could detect that with a lot of the measurements that we have okay i think the the other thing that would be helpful for us to understand before we get into the science of blood flow restriction is to understand what strength is and to understand what hypertrophy is um do you have a preference with which one we start with either one okay so if we measure the size of my bicep today you know we could do it crudely with a tape measure we could do it more accurately with an mri or an ultrasound and you were to prescribe exercises that we'll talk about whether with or without blood flow restriction we can get into load we can get into reps etc we come back and measure and again let's just use the gold standard we'll use an mri we'll come back and measure me in six months and demonstrably my muscle has gotten bigger what does that mean did i grow more muscle fibers did each fiber get bigger how would you explain to somebody what happened in that cycle of hypertrophy so there's a couple different ways that it could happen you could have an increase in fiber size which is hypertrophy so all the muscle cells that you have maybe not all but the muscle cell itself has gotten bigger the other so that's hypertrophy the other component would be you have an increase in the number of cells that's hyperplasia in general we we don't think that hyperplasia is playing a big role at least in adults and i wouldn't necessarily rule it out but it doesn't seem like we have a lot of evidence for that so we always just look at gross changes and assume that it's probably hypertrophy so what that when you're when your muscle was to get bigger following exercise what that would mean is is that the the individual cells inside that bicep have increased in size and we typically uh assume that that's due to increases and overall protein actinimizing and things of that sort you're obviously going to also have an increase in other components to help support the cell uh but that's generally what we mean an increase in cell size and you know when you think about like an epithelial cell or something like that we don't really pay much attention to the size of those cells right like i i don't know that anybody i don't know the dermatologist is looking at somebody's moles when they biopsy them and looking at the individual cells and talking about the size of them there we would concern ourselves much more with hyperplasia and and certainly metaplasia or dysplasia those are the things that really get people concerned but in this sense muscles are kind of unique in that they can have not just a non-pathologic but a healthy change in size so is it as you said do you think it's primarily due to an increase in the amount of actin and myosin within the cell or some other characteristic is it does the active and myosin complex actually change in size or do you just have more of it that's a good question i i think that most people would say that because they usually connect it to short-term measures of protein synthesis so myofabric which is actin and myosin so synthesizing more and more of those i think is the general is the general thought that you have more overall actinomides and along with other things of course let's talk about strength now so we can talk about sort of we can kind of break it down right into kind of mechanical strength and neurologic strength how do you think about that so again let's use the same example of you you measure my ability to do a bicep curl um and let's just assume there'll be two measurements you'll measure my single rep max so the most that i can do and then you'll also do a separate test for the most that i can do 10 times or 15 times or something so you'll measure kind of two different components of strength maybe absolute extreme and and sort of more of a muscular endurance test and then you'll have me do a set of prescribed exercises for six months and we'll come back and we'll do that whole thing again and my one rep max went up by 20 and the amount of weight that i could move 10 times went up 15 what happened to me mechanically structurally neurologically what explains that change in strength that's a good question and that's something that it's a question that i'm extremely interested in and i don't know why people get stronger i think the the general thought or how we teach people is the initial change in strength is due to neurological changes so um and that's up what that means what is neurologic mean i think is also up to some debate but we could think about a signal being sent from the brain through the spinal cord to the alpha motor neuron so the alpha motor neuron is the nerve that communicates with the muscle so there could be changes anywhere in between that so you have more excitatory input you have less inhibition you have lowering of thresholds that makes it easier to fire the type two fibers there's a lot of different things that that could be playing a role there for why someone might get stronger with neural adaptations so most people are okay with that part then the next part is people will say after about three to four weeks when the muscle is also getting bigger that that change in fiber size will also be contributing to a change in string and that's something that we have recently taken some exception to and there's been a lot of really good discussions about that part of it but yes i do come back to that jeremy because i've read the studies that you're referring to they're super fascinating and i was actually surprised at how little evidence there was in favor of the dogmatic view so i look forward to diving into that a little bit more and you can see why intuitively one would say well size must produce strength if size comes from more active and myosin which basically means more contractile units uh but but as we'll see i think when we talk about uh some of your more recent work that's not necessarily settled is it not in my opinion no um and i and to be fair it's not settled one way or the other um but i i do think that there's a probably a neural component but i think that there could also be some changes at the local level that might explain some of those changes in strength and i i think we can discuss that a little bit later as well but there could be some some you know changes at the mayas in head or changes in calcium release and things of that sort so i don't have any good evidence that that is actually happening but just some ideas behind why someone might get stronger following exercise all right i think that's a pretty solid primer for where we're about to go so i'll start with the story um i used to swim uh a lot and um oh god this might be circa 2010 so call it 10 11 years ago um i have a friend steve um munitonis who's himself a remarkable swimmer like truly a world class marathon swimmer and he was visiting san diego from where he lived in la and he came to join me for a workout at the masters club i swam at and after the workout he brought out these bands they were called katsu bands which we're going to talk about and he said okay peter i want you i'm going to put these bands on your thighs upper thighs and i'm going to put them on your arms the upper arm and i'm going to you know compress to a certain level and he he had what looked like a blood pressure cuff there that he could sort of calibrate the the uh the the occlusive pressure and i want you to swim a 50-yard butterfly all out um now keep in mind swimming a 50-yard butterfly all out under any circumstance is quite challenging um but totally doable right i mean you you would do a set of 10 50s a butterfly at 90 percent um you know with 45 seconds in between and be totally fine and i remember pushing off the wall and before i got to the other wall which is 25 yards away to begin turning around to come back i was like this is the hardest thing i've ever done this feels harder than swimming 200 yards of butterfly which is really hard so butterfly is one of those strokes where the longest distance it's ever swarm is 200 yards and even people who train to swim the race at 200 yards almost never swim that distance in practice you're swimming shorter distances perfectly because your form tends to fall apart so badly at 200 and here i was at 25 yards thinking i'm going to die and by the end of that 50 my body felt like it would normally feel at the end of a 200 yard individual medley uh or 200 breaststroke which would be kind of two of the most miserable things you could ever do to yourself and you know that began my kind of curiosity with this technique i read a couple of books about it and you know unfortunately i kind of just forgot about it i you know once steve went back up to la and i didn't have access to the fancy devices i kind of sort of forgot about it but you know recently it's now become sort of curious to me so what's the story of uh of uh yoshiaka so soda what was the name of the gentleman who who came up with this system sato sato yeah so so tell me about this guy and then how he came up with uh with this idea yeah so some of this is uh i'll say is of legend um but i think the story that he's told is that he was at a buddhist ceremony was kind of kneeling and sato was also from what i understand interested in bodybuilding especially in his younger days so he felt kind of a little bit of numbness about or a little bit of sensation that he felt when he was doing heavy squats so he kind of thought that there could be some connection there because he was kneeling and he was restricting blood flow okay right and i think that that led him to start kind of experimenting with different i different ways to try and restrict blood flow you know in his lower body and upper body etc i think that there's been some stories that his initial kind of ideas he actually harmed himself a little bit because he was maybe applying it too tightly but i think then he actually had a skiing accident and then applied it to himself and actually re have to himself with blood flow restriction and saw some what he thought was some pretty good kind of gains and i think that he really did probably develop a lot of the methods for at least the initial way we were doing blood flow restriction and kind of made it you know very popular and with uh studying and research and things of that nature but yeah i think he's probably the the one who made it more popular at least initially because they started doing research on that in the late 90s early 2000s at least in the published literature so yeah i think the idea is is that it it mimics something that he had felt before in the gym and he wanted to see how he could try and do that and ultimately he found that you can use very light weights low loads but make it feel like you're lifting very very heavy weights which is obviously useful you know if you have a ski an accident or you don't want to lift heavy weights or you'd have some sort of injury yeah i had a patient last year who was playing with his kids and tore his bicep had a complete tear so he underwent a surgical repair of that but we decided to have him use blood flow restriction during the rehab phase so that he could get back to training sooner obviously under a far less load and uh although it's anecdotal i mean it was a remarkable recovery that he made which further kind of peaked my curiosity around this so this this term katsu is kind of synonymous with blood flow restriction is it i mean i think it's japanese for like training with pressure or training with added pressure or something to that effect correct yeah it means increasing pressure so it's just a brand okay um it's the it's the one that's i i think it's fair to say is one of the first but it's just a brand so we started using i think a lot of people will use katsu as just kind of a generic name but it probably shouldn't be done unless you're using the katsu apparatus but yeah it's a form of blood flow restriction so we want to come back to the different types of apparatus but let's let's kind of talk through it now maybe uh chronologically in terms of the most insights like if i was to go back in time to the 1970s and i'm sato and i'm trying to think about how to test this hypothesis it seems like hands down the easiest way to do this would be to use individuals as their own controls and isolate and compress you know one side and not do for the other and have them do the same things or do different things and try to isolate the variables so was that the first experiment that was done yeah the the first experiment done on blood flow restriction at least to my knowledge on how we think of blood flow restrictions so you know i i always add a lot of caveats because some people will say well if you look in the 30s there were studies done where they applied a cuff but it wasn't done for for the purposes of increasing muscle function so to my knowledge uh with blood flow restriction how we use it shinohara published the first paper in 1998 where they had individuals that all they were looking at was strength but they had one leg do a certain exercise with blood flow restriction the opposite leg did the same exercise without blood flow restriction and they saw a treatment effect meaning the limb that underwent blood flow restriction saw a greater change so that's the the first study was looking at a change in actual function with blood flow restriction it was kind of amazing that that didn't happen until 1998 which is 30 years after sato began writing about this stuff or at least experimenting with it right yes the other question for me that's been very difficult to wrap my head around is what is the definition of blood flow restriction if i were to wrap a cuff around my arm and apply no pressure clearly that's no restriction if i were to create an occlusive pressure that was twice my systolic blood pressure almost certainly it would imply not a drop of blood is making its way past so there's no arterial flow and no venous return that would obviously blood flow restriction that would be blood flow restriction but like everything else you have sort of a continuum so yeah how do you think about this and maybe that's the wrong question maybe the better question is in the in the genesis of kind of the study of this how was restriction defined what methods were used and how much variability existed in the studies so the idea of blood flow restriction is to reduce blood flow going into the limb but not completely occlude blood flow so in other words we always want blood flow to be going in so there is a tremendous amount of variability in how the pressure was applied early on that's improved substantially at improvement in my opinion at least the early studies would take a cuff and apply the same pressure to every single person independent of their blood pressure independent of blood pressure independent of limb size independent of the cuff size that you're using so all of these things are important factors that you can account for by doing this one measurement that's that's how we do it now but obviously it's easy to look in the past and throw stones but there's certainly a lot of variability so given that the idea is to restrict blood flow but not occlude it completely during exercise what we started to do and others have started to do as well is before we do exercise let's just take the cuff up to the lowest pressure of which there is no flow at all so if that's 100 millimeters of mercury means that you no longer have flow going into your limb at all let's take a percentage of that so we know that you always have flow during the exercise so now do you determine that with doppler at some distal point to the occlusion yes you can you can use ultrasound we use just a handheld doppler probe that's essentially detecting the pulse so we'll look we can look at it here we look at it at the ankle so before we have anybody do any exercise we just lie them down we slowly inflate whatever cuff we're going to use because the cuff size matters it's going to it's going to totally change the pressure applied so we slowly inflate it until we don't hear any more flow and then we take a percentage of that so if the arterial occlusion pressure which is the lowest pressure of which there is no flow if that's a hundred millimeters of mercury then we'll typically apply anywhere between 40 and 80 millimeters of mercury in our lab at least yeah so so two points i want to make and or 1.1 question um the point i want to make that is a very important one that you just uh made is that this uh this idea of cuff size matters right because the pressure and the force are related by the area that that that that uh that cuff uh takes up so is it safe to say that the wider the cuff the lower um pressure you need to reach occlusion yes that's definitely true and i think some people interpret that to mean that does that mean that a wider cuff is better because the pressure's lower i would say no because it it's pretty much relative some would argue that the wider the cuff is you might actually attenuate some of the growth beneath the cuff but certainly the size of the cuff will change the pressure so as you said the wider it is the lower the pressure that you need but again as long as you apply whatever cuff that you're going to use to whatever limb you're looking to exercise taking one measurement can account for everything so then my question is when you say 40 to 80 percent that is a very wide range right that's like the difference between 40 millimeters of mercury and 80 millimeters of mercury when 100 millimeters of mercury is the occlusive pressure could be the difference between comfort and discomfort as an example right yes so typically we use forty percent fourteen four zero yeah okay that's the pressure that we use when all we care about is muscle adaptations in other words increasing muscle size and strength now you can see the same adaptation at 80 percent with a little bit less work because you're going to fail sooner but the discomfort is going to be much higher now i think the other component of that is that's muscle adaptation now we have some data it's very preliminary but some data that suggests that some of the vascular changes might actually require a higher pressure so vascular changes meaning uh kind of a change in form when blood flow or form conductance so that's a gross measurement of basically the vascular network so there's some indication that maybe you do need higher pressure for that but that's one study we did observe it in both the upper and lower body which gives me a little bit of confidence but it's one study so but with muscle i feel pretty confident saying you can use a moderate pressure 40 or a high pressure 80 to 90 percent and the the adaptation is going to be pretty much the same with respect to muscle size and strength the discomfort might be it will be quite different will be much higher with a higher pressure how much variability is there between an individual's tolerance for discomfort at a fixed occlusive pressure so i love the idea of using eighty percent of occlusive pressure because now it's not a given number it's 80 percent for that individual so in theory everybody is experiencing the same amount of relative occlusion but if you took a hundred people and let's even make it more homogeneous if you took a hundred fit people and you simultaneously applied eighty percent of occlusive pressure to bilateral upper extremities and just had them sit there so we'll do the first experiment where nobody does anything what is the what would the bell curve look like how tight would it be for the time at which a person cries uncle and the pressure is fifty percent uh you pick a number i said 80 but but i i okay 80 i mean i don't know the the minute we have done some discomfort studies applying 40 and just having people sit yeah so at 40 what's the answer it's it's pretty low the the you know we we stopped at four minutes so we didn't have anybody who couldn't do it but you are going to have some people who who do experience that as more discomfort than other people and but it becomes much greater when you obviously combine it with muscle contractions but yeah you're right so when we say 40 aop that doesn't necessarily mean a 40 reduction in blood flow either that's right so those are those are two separate things so somebody when we apply 40 of aop the reduction in blood flow might be different depending on how big the muscle is a variety of other things and the discomfort associated with that will also vary depending on the person there's some people who we have who you know they perceive almost everything as extreme discomfort whereas we have people on the opposite side as well but in general we see um i can't think of the actual numerical value but we have 40 percent is right here and then with 80 it shifts meaning that the average is certainly higher but there are certain people who you know the discomfort they feel at 40 is not different than it is at 80 because they already rated it so high so i mean that's the limitation of the scale but what is the what what is the approximate um blood flow restriction that occurs at 40 aop how much of the blood flow arterial flow is being limited and how much venous pooling is occurring yeah i don't know the actual the the percent drop off the top of my head um it isn't 40 it's on average is a little bit less than that um depending upon the position depending on what you're doing um but yeah in general i think during the rest period you probably do have venous occlusion because it doesn't take it's not thought to take a lot of pressure to collapse a vein so during the exercise you're obviously pumping it back out with the muscle pump but i would say at a most of the pressures that we apply at least at rest there is venous pulling occurring yeah today i finished my workout with a set of leg press um so did 30 reps rest 30 seconds 15 reps rest 30 seconds 15 rest 30 seconds 15 and i'm not sure what hurt worse just the 30 seconds in between or the actual last two sets the 15 reps on the last two sets i mean the whole thing was just so wildly uncomfortable again i'm flying by the seat of my pants not doing this based on occlusive pressure so i don't know how far off i am it's something i'm looking forward to diving deeper into i think you've already convinced me i should be more scientific in my approach because i'm sort of white-knuckling it and putting these things on and screaming for dear life so i'm in pain kind of before the i'm sort of i'm very uncomfortable before i start and even after that first set of 30 i'm questioning my sanity so who knows maybe i'm applying too much it would seem that um directionally would you have a nomogram of occlusive pressure versus expected number of reps at a frac at a percentage of one rep max yeah i that's also tough i i think most of the loading that we use is 30 and to be honest if we have somebody who's stronger they're not getting 30 15 15 15 there's no there's no question they're going to be at failure most of the time when we actually do experiments we just have people exercise four sets to as many as repetitions as you can that way we can at least hold that constant so we can control for effort but yeah i do think that you can use the number of repetitions as a as a as a weak surrogate of blood flow restriction so i would say that if you're using 20 or 30 you should be getting close to 30 repetitions each set no no for the first second so and then close to 15. you may get 12. but if you can't get 30 on the first one or get close to that the load is probably too high or the wraps are too tight i would say that if you're in pain before you're starting it's too tight and you know we've we've done a lot of work on practical restriction as well i would say that practical meaning where we don't really know how much pressure is being applied we're applying a knee wrap that's what i refer to as as practical blood flow restriction i i think if if you are rehabbing or you're in a clinical setting or you're working in that i think you really need to know the pressure that you're applying yeah i think if you're a healthy person in the gym who who wants to use blood flow restriction i don't think it's all that important to know the pressure assuming you have the discussion that we're having now where i know the load is low i apply the wraps i'm in pain well then the wraps are too tight so i loosen them up and then i can get close to 30 reps and then close to 15 on the last three sets now in the last one depending on how strong you are you might fail pretty quick in that fourth set that's okay so but i i do i do agree with you that i i think that you can use goal repetitions as a way to have some idea as at the level of restriction that's being applied so when you're at 40 occlusive pressure what would be the kind of maximum period of time you would let a subject stay under that pressure both in terms of the combined lift recovery period yeah i think if they're just starting out i think it one it depends on are they resistance training or are they doing kind of low intensity aerobic exercise if it's a low intensity aerobic exercise you can probably keep it on for 30 or 40 minutes because it doesn't feel that discomforting because you're you're exercising at a low intensity the cuffs are not all that tight you're not building up a tremendous amount of metabolites probably why you're not also getting a tremendous amount of adaptation but with resistance exercise i think if you're just starting out i think it's hard to have a minutes i think maybe seven eight nine minutes ten minutes or so i would say one exercise is a good place to start we've done it early on we did multiple exercises for people who are untrained and that's pretty tough but i would say you know start off with four sets of an exercise and then take the cuffs off or take the wrap off and then you might be able to eventually work up to a couple but i wouldn't with resistance training i don't think that you know you should leave it on continuously for probably more than a few exercises but if you've never done it i wouldn't go beyond one just so you can start to kind of see what it feels like and so if 40 to 80 percent of occlusive pressure is the technical way to do it um what other metric do you would people use if they don't have access to a doppler yeah i think for example if somebody knew their blood pressure i can see why that would not necessarily be i can see why systolic blood pressure would not be the same as occlusive pressure is it a reasonable proxy um not always it really depends upon if the size of the cuff that you're using is very similar in size then you could you could do that um and base the pressure as a percentage of your systolic pressure i think the average gym goer i think one of the things that you could do is you know apply the wrap as a percentage of your resting limb size so there's some data that's done that's used that one of the ways that we've we've tried to work with is condition people to feel what 40 supposed to feel like so you would have to have the device one day so we're doing this because there are some places that are applying this to clinical populations where they have only a a small amount of time with the patient and then they send them home to do exercises so the idea being is that you could be with the patient have them feel what 40 supposed to feel like and then say when you get home try to mimic this pressure so we've had some success with that we are able to get people to on average rate around 40 percent but the the individual level is anywhere between 20 and 60 of aop so it's not terrible but it's not very good yet one of the things that led us to that is that initially i was on a paper a long time ago that said you should rate the pressure based on seven out of ten because that can make sure that the pressure will be sub-occlusive and that's overall pretty much true the the issue is is that you have a tremendously wide range and it's not reliable meaning that on day one you might say 7 out of 10 is is 90 aop the next day it might be 10 so we don't really recommend that scale anymore we're interested in this idea of conditioning and or using a percentage of a resting circumference and or what we talked about earlier where you use repetitions as kind of a goal yeah that's um i mean the cups i have are super cheapo cups i feel like i want to invest in sort of nice ones but the one thing they have on them is numbers so i've got a sense of like on arms i you know need to be between seven and eight and on legs between 11 and 12 and sometimes i just overcook it and after the first set i have to loosen them if i have if i want to have any hope of completing the the exercises um and and then going back to weight 20 to 40 percent of one rep max is about the place you like people to be yeah i genuinely prefer lower uh meaning around 20 or 30 percent there are some people who creep up to 40 and so i i just think that the real utility of using blood flow attrition is the fact that you can use it with very low loads so i think that's the benefit we have we've tried to combine it with high loads in different aspects and other people have run training studies with it but it's not additive so it doesn't add anything more to high low training and it's probably because you know high load normal exercise is a maximal stimulus so it's hard to maximize something that's probably already pretty much maximal in a given training session so that's why i'm like if you want to lift with heavy weights didn't just do that i think the utility of do using blood flow restriction is with that you can use lower loads any um playing with the speed either concentrically or eccentrically and does that matter i think if you the slower you go the less repetitions you're obviously going to be able to do i i don't think that it probably matters overall too much especially for growth the the pace that we typically use is about one second up one second down so relatively quick pace some people use a second and a half so if you use a second to a second and a half it's usually a nice controlled movement so we haven't messed with too much in the lab but i i don't think it would matter too much i think it would i think it would alter how much work you were able to do and the load that you would be able to use more than anything and do you think that ultimately time under tension is all that's going to matter so if you do it slower but you get fewer reps it's still okay if you have the same time under tension yeah for the most part yeah i think because when we think about muscle growing at least when i think about a muscle growing where it requires a muscle to be activated for a sufficient duration of time for all those signaling pathways to be turned on so from my perspective there's a lot of different ways for that to occur you know you can use really really heavy weights you know repeatedly and that will do it or you can use low loads or you can use very slow pace as well i think all those are kind of doing similar things you're recruiting these more and more and more fibers activating them and signaling them to grow so yeah i think it would be very similar then how much rest are you prescribing um i i did 30 seconds today sometimes i do like a super set where i'll do you know one muscle another muscle another muscle and just go back and forth with two different muscles and not take an act or take a passive rest uh what do you what do you think about those approaches yeah i i think in general we use about 30 seconds that's the the standard one that we use in our lab i i think when i've experimented in the gym i think that super setting works really well especially if you are working out of muscle that's not necessarily directly under blood flow restriction so for example the chest you know there is some idea that just doing a standard bench press exercise with blood flow restriction around the around the arms would augment the size of the chest there's there's some data that indicates that to me i think a lot of that is driven by the fact that the muscles distal to the cuff the triceps are fatiguing and the chest is picking up the load so in the gym i like to experiment with that so do us do some chest and then superset with some tricep extensions or something like that but we haven't studied that in the lab but those are things that i've messed around with in the past oh it's interesting you know i've never thought to do something like a bench press with it frankly mostly out of fear is this the but i guess if you adjust the weight low enough it shouldn't really be that much of an issue what about is i mean once i did deadlifts restricted and uh i wasn't sure if it was a great idea i mean i was it was very lightweight it was probably like 135 pounds so it was not you know the type of weight i felt like i could ever hurt myself with but i was like okay well let's do 30 reps here of 135 pound deadlift under restriction you know truthfully i thought it was pretty freaking cool i think in the end i didn't keep doing it because i was like well look i don't want to develop bad habits dead lifting under such fatigue is there what's your thought on doing complex uh you know multi-joint movements there is data looking at bench press squat and they have seen some benefits i i generally agree with you i think that you can do those assuming that you're using lightweight i tend to prefer kind of isolation movements especially if the goal is growth but you could you could do them i think that you'd have varying success depending on the movement the deadlift i mean if it's a romanian type deadlift maybe i could see that having maybe some sort of benefit but i think i'd have a similar thought as you it's like am i going to change my mechanics somehow and then put myself at risk and then really require blood flow restriction in order to train because i'm hurt so yeah you can do compounds that there's certainly evidence that suggests that it can help with the squat help with the barbell bench press we tend to use isolation movements and for research purposes obviously but i tend to feel that a little bit better and i feel a little bit safer doing those type of exercises well let's talk about risks because i know that when people think about blood flow restriction i've had people ask me you know are you worried about rhabdo are you worried about nerve damage you know are you basically what what are the risks of this and uh what's what's the safety profile sure so i i think that's a completely reasonable kind of response when you're telling people that hey i'm restricting blood flow and i think you should might consider it i think the the first response that i would hope a person would say is what's the safety of that i think a couple things one it helps to understand that this is a very acute response in other words we're restricting blood flow for minutes not for hours so i think that that's important i think the safety profile overall is comparable to that of high load exercise or traditional exercise there are two concerns that people generally bring up first is blood clotting second is muscle damage in other words does it increase the risk of blood clots does it increase the risk of muscle damage and i think those are the way i stated that is how it should probably be stated so any time we exercise or anytime we wake up and live as you know there's a risk there's always a risk for something to occur in my mind the question the important question is not is there a risk but when we add blood flow restriction does it increase the risk and it doesn't appear to at least at the group level in in mostly healthy individuals so it doesn't increase the risk of blood clots and that has been looked at in some clinical populations as well which is good um it doesn't increase the risk of muscle damage you will get sore but when we look at the fiber it appears to be intact so it doesn't appear to be some structural damages at all and have have there been studies where they've measured ck levels and contrasted them with and without restriction and does there appear to be more breakdown at least measured by ck now generally when they look at most of those there's not a whole lot of difference between the same exercise without blood flow restriction there's certainly soreness that i feel confident about but i but but not necessarily structural damage um another one that's been kind of brought up is you know the blood pressure response to this exercise so it's so proximal to the cuff is blood pressure going up centrally in the heart the aorta the brain yeah and compared to the same exercise without it it usually is higher um but it's usually comparable to that if not a little bit lower than high load exercise so i think the the key component of that is of course it's probably going to be higher you're restricting blood flow but how high does it get and how quickly does it return back to baseline so i think that those are kind of two important components now when we've compared it to highlight exercise it's usually pretty similar and it usually comes back down to baseline within five minutes but those are healthy individuals now one of the there was a there was a paper written on it suggesting that that's great but there are certain populations where they may hyper respond to that and you know i think that's a good point so i do think that it might be something to consider you know if you have um some sort of clinical element you might want to you know if you might be hypersensitive to to that reflex that might be something to really think about in myself i would when i think about doing unrestricted heavy movements so you know five to eight reps of deadlifts or you know something where i'm really going for it that feels like i have a much higher blood pressure than the blood pressure i feel like i'm under doing blood flow restriction even though there's a much greater discomfort with the blood flow restriction i never really get the feeling like my head's gonna pop off my shoulders which i commonly feel when i'm doing a heavy dead lift right yeah i agree and i think that's you know a lot of the intramuscular pressure all over you know it's just a systemic well yeah because i think when you're really lifting heavily the intra-abdominal pressure is what allows you to do it and you know that's actually compressing the aorta so it'd be interesting if you really think about where the pressure matters the most um but i would say that overall it does appear to be very safe you know that's something that we're we've been interested in for a long time i i do think that you know as you as with anything when you give a a drug in a large you know clinical trial you start to see you know some side effects that you've never seen before so my guess is is that it when it becomes more and more and more popular we will find there will be certain rare events that we've never seen before but i think in the actual studies that have been done we see it to be overall relatively safe it doesn't increase the risk at least assuming it's done appropriately has the following experiment ever been done where you take um well in an ideal world i guess you take the same subject right so um you have them do the exact same exercises for the same number of reps so you take let's say 30 percent of one rep max and do the 30 15 15 15 but one of the arms is occluded the other is not so the one that's not is not hurting at all that should be pretty easy to do that in the unoccluded side correct correct or so you're exercising one arm under blood flow friction the other arm is not correct but you're using the same weight the same reps the same rest everything yes i i i think yes that the shinohara for example uh same workload one had blood photographs on the other one didn't that was within subject i think that those studies have been done i think the criticism on within subject studies is with respect to strength not necessarily muscle growth because some people think that and not some people i mean it is an observable fact that when you train one side but not the other the other arm oftentimes can increase in strength but i i'm not sure that that happens when both limbs train i think the limb actually responds to the local what it's been trained to do so i don't know that it's that big of a limitation with strength but yeah those studies have been done and what are they finding typically when they're under the same load one side is restricted one side is not is the restricted side still making gains in strength and or size yeah generally the blood flow friction will be better than a work matched control even if it's the same person with the caveat that it's not to failure and that's the the difficult thing if you're using 30 because 30 for some people you know that you'll be reaching failure almost on four sets in the non-occluded arm so i think that uh should be stated um i think when we have one limb trained to failure the other limb trained with blood flow restriction to failure we've done those studies lots the adaptation is usually pretty similar but the volume the exercise volume needed is much lower with the blood flow restriction limb yeah that's what i was sort of going to get at which is is blood flow restriction mostly just a tool to increase um or decrease the time to failure and therefore act as a more efficient means to fatigue the various fibers i think that's fair to say with a couple of of of potential things to consider i think blood flow restriction by itself so just the application of restriction and deflation in some acl reconstruction uh post-surgery environment has shown to have some sort of benefit so that suggests to me that there could be something to the restriction of blood flow same thing when we have people walk very slowly in other words they're not really walking to failure or even close to failure but there does appear to be some adaptation it's not close to what you see with resistance exercise but there's something that's a little bit more there so i i i think with resistance exercise that might be a very fair statement to say that you're just causing the muscle to have to activate more of the muscle sooner and fatigue sooner than a non-occluded condition i think that's fair but to say that that's the only thing that the only benefit of blood filtration i i don't know that we can say especially considering the vascular response i talked about earlier that the vascular network uh the the blood flow the resting blood flow to the forearm or calf it does appear to respond with a higher pressure but not a lower pressure despite that both of them are doing a tremendous amount of work so i think it might be fair to say with muscle with respect with respect to resistance exercise but i have some remaining questions before i would go all in so let's get back to something that we touched on earlier but we'll get to it in more depth which is the relationship between strength and hypertrophy it's very clear that they're correlated it's not clear which way the arrow of causation runs if it necessarily if there is a causal relationship between them what's the conventional thinking on this the conventional wisdom or the conventional thinking is that once you once muscle growth is there that it's probably contributing to changes in strength and i think that's the the textbook definition neural first followed by large contributions from muscle hypertrophy um and i i think doing a lot of research in the low load realm as we've done started i started to really see that maybe that's actually not the case because we almost always see muscle growth which is similar to or equivalent to that of highlight exercise but the strength assuming that we're not practicing the test repeatedly is almost always less and in my mind i had a a hard time coming up with a lot of excuses i i did for several years um but at some point i just you know talk in talking with my students we just started to ask the question about well where did this story come from about muscle growth playing a role and why do we even think it in the first place because i'm trying really really hard to make excuses for why we aren't seeing it but maybe we should go back to the beginning and and see why did we ever think it in the first place and that's where i think it really becomes difficult for people to have this conversation because everybody has learned the same thing that i learned it's neural then hypertrophy neural then hypertrophy um and they have a hard time kind of going you know taking a step back and going okay but were those studies ever able to actually make that claim yeah so what where did that hypothesis come from what is the evidence in support of the null hypothesis i think if you were to get a bunch of people together so and we measured muscle size and we measured strength on average people who are bigger will be stronger people who are smaller will be weaker and that that's that's true and we've seen that we've documented that ourselves but that's not an effective exercise because we see the same relationships in people who have never exercised in their life so the question sorry just to make sure i understand that jeremy you're saying that the correlation or association between strength and size is equally strong in the untrained as it is the trained correct yeah so the the question that's being asked by or or the question that we're discussing is when a person begins to exercise and then they get stronger is that due to changes in muscle size and that's where i have the the question i i don't question whether or not they're related i completely agree that they are but when we exercise does it change in one result in a change in the other so i think people i i think it obviously makes a lot of sense that it could for all the reasons that we said earlier we're increasing optimizing we're increasing this protein why would they not then produce greater strength but there's numerous times in the literature where we have shown greater changes in muscle size but strength doesn't even change so it that leads me to believe that there could be quite a bit of disconnect with respect to muscle growth and the change in string now you wrote a paper basically trying to you know go back to the root of this dogma and i think you basically found that there were sort of three papers that formulated this viewpoint two of them i think were from the 70s and then one was kind of a review paper of one of those papers am i remembering this correctly yeah so um the one that's commonly cited is more italian devries or devry and they had five individuals one armed lifted weights the other arm did not lift weights and they were basically inferring muscle growth off changes in service emg so they did measure arm circumference but that wasn't the that wasn't the variable they were using to quantify growth they were looking at changes in the slope of this integrated emg so if they saw a change in the slope they they inferred that to mean muscle growth if they didn't see a change in that slope then they said that was neural so that's where this can you explain to me how that work i don't i don't know enough about emg to understand um that inference one i think at least in my opinion you cannot infer growth off a change in amg but what they were doing is is that let's say let's pick a variety of weights so let's say 10 pounds 20 pounds 30 pounds and up so what is the emg amplitude so with emg amplitude is essentially an estimate of muscle action potential so how much signal do you get when you lift 10 pounds at baseline versus 20 30 40. then they would do that every couple weeks so if they lifted 10 pounds and the and the basically the amplitude was a little bit less they would infer that that was being picked up by muscle growth that's kind of the idea uh so the amplitude they're using to assess the neurologic signal and over time they're saying if the neurologic signal is going down and the and the effort is the same hypertrophy makes up the difference or for example yeah i got it and i i think one of the the points that we're always trying to make is that guarantees that at some point hypertrophy is going to be a mechanism you're not actually testing a mechanism you're just assuming that at some point it will be a mechanism so um that was the same thing with ikai and fukunaga which is the other the other study so they actually did measure muscle size and to my knowledge that's actually the first study to actually document changes in muscle size in response to resistance exercise so what i would call a landmark paper i really enjoy the paper but what they infer is is that if muscle growth changes then it must be playing a role and if it doesn't change and they got stronger then it must be neural and that's kind of the where we've been at for you know ever since in other words that when we run a training study if you get stronger but we don't document a change in muscle size it's neural if you get stronger and we measure changes in muscle size well then it was neural and hypertrophy so to me i don't think we can make that claim because you're just assuming that the ability to document it means it's actually doing something with respect to strength i i would like to see a little bit more kind of rigor in that i understand why people would think it i get all of that it make that makes sense to me as well but my question is is that does it actually and we've approached this through a variety of different ways but i think it does help to think about this historically where did this come from and it really does seemingly come from those two studies and then digby sale had a very really great paper reviewing kind of all the work that had been done where he suggested that most training studies are only documenting a certain aspect of an actual person's training age so they're they're never going to be able to actually answer this question because the studies are too short but i i don't know that that's fair to say because more time devries is eight weeks which is the same duration as a lot of other studies that have basically contradicted it so kind of rambled there a little bit but yeah you're right those are the three papers that are commonly cited for this neural first followed by hypertrophy even outside of bfr which seems to provide a very elegant tool to test the hypothesis as as you've explained and we'll get into in a little bit more detail [Music] it seems that you could do other experiments to test this even without blood flow restriction for example couldn't you you know have somebody do workouts where they only do one to five reps of exercises and they're basically always functioning and each of those is to failure right so if you're doing one rep it's a one rep max if you're doing two reps it's 95 percent of one rep max if it's three reps it's probably ninety percent if it's five reps it's probably 85 percent of one rep max and so you you you cycle through those workouts where you increase strength in fact i'll put a very practical example to this i know specifically athletes who train this way and they train with a trap bar and they do not do the eccentric motion so they lift the weight up and drop it lift the weight up and drop it and they're never going above five reps so they're really trying to maximize strength which comes more from the concentric movement and they're trying to minimize any hypertrophy because their athletes for whom strength to weight is the most important ratio so it's very typical workout for runners so they'll dramatically increase their strength without adding size and then you could compare that to the opposite type of workout where you do more of a bodybuilding workout you're probably never going below eight reps and you'll get bigger and i could imagine a scenario where you don't even get as strong as that other person i mean wouldn't that demonstrate how uncoupled these two metrics can be yes i agree with you and we've done this several times now we've we've tried to address this question via study design doing something very similar to what you said where we have one group that's training just doing the 1rm test that's it they come in they work up to about 5 total reps and then they go home because we're trying to maximize the strength signal but not get growth because essentially to answer this question we have to know if the muscle did get bigger and stronger what would strength look like if muscle growth had not occurred so when we look at the traditional training group we have them doing about 8 to 12 reps and this is a very simple movement the bicep curl in that group we see muscle growth and we see a change in strength now what previous uh or what what a majority of articles would do is say given that muscle growth is there that muscle growth must be contributing to strength in our mind we have to say well what would strength look like if growth hadn't been there and when we look at the other group that was just doing 1rms the strength is the same now it's not greater but it is the same i do think that the more complex the movement becomes the the greater that separation starts to happen so if we were doing a barbell bench press my guess is is that the group doing 1rm or close to a 1rm would be far better than the 8 to 12 but it's just the fact that the movement is very very simple so similar to what you said in our mind this does provide some method of trying to address this because we see a group with no growth compared to a group with growth but the strength is the same suggesting that that change in muscle size is not necessary for a change in strength nor does it appear to be contributing given that the strength is the same now there are limitations with that one of the the big ones is is that in order to get the that differential in growth we had to apply slightly different exercise patterns so one group was doing eight to twelve still a high load but not a hundred percent where we had another group training at 100 so some suggested that well that's not really that fair of a comparison there's more things that are different than just the muscle growth and that's that's true and they suggested that instead that we should follow that up with some mediation analysis where we look at how much of this change relative to a control is driven by muscle size within each group individually and when we did that we did not see any mediation meaning that none of the change in strength could be explained by that change in muscle size in either one of the groups explain that more for me i'm not sure i follow how you would determine that so there there are some statistical kind of approaches where you can do some causal mediation in other words you can look at the relationship between let's say we have these two exercise groups so instead of looking at them head to head let's look at them individually compared to a group that's not doing any exercise at all that way we can kind of really control for the random error across time so measurement noise random biological variability etc essentially what mediation is doing is saying okay we have this group here how much strength did they gain so they got stronger so that's a direct relationship so when this group exercises they got stronger now mediation says okay let's add in a variable here to see if we can remove this relationship either partially or completely so if we add in muscle growth to the model and then this group no longer correlates with strength then we'll know that that relationship is completely driven by this this other variable now we wouldn't expect for it to be completely right but if you but partially but that's we didn't see that in either one of the groups is the contra positive then that it's not at all coupled because if you were to ask me what my intuition is which is worth maybe a warm bucket of hamster vomit my intuition would be there is an association but it's not a cl it's not it's not a hundred percent causal so you know like the r squared might be 0.5 not 0.99 so in other words i would not guess that there is no association i certainly wouldn't guess a negative association um but i wouldn't guess that it's one-to-one causal can the mediation tease that out yes because it would be a partial mediation in that and you did not see a partial mediation no we didn't see any effect at all now there are other potential reasons i mean we have to think about random error across time with our measurement and things of that i i don't think that any of the work that we have done so far can can conclusively say that it plays no role but i i do think that we're having an accumulating amount of evidence that's suggesting that if it does play a role it is so small that we aren't able to ever detect it so i am not sure that muscle growth in response to exercise is a mechanism i've seen no experimental evidence that suggests that that's the case now for a practical pragmatic person what would that mean for them well i think what it could mean is is that if you are interested in maximal strength in getting as strong as possible you probably don't care whether it's a mechanism or not you just want to know how do i get strong i think we can learn a couple things from some of these experiments one that there's a huge specificity component meaning that if you want to be a very good squatter or a very good deadlifter and being very good squatter or being a very good deadlifter means you're able to lift as heavy as possible one time then that means you should be training at least a good portion of the time at or close to that 1rm now if you really believe that growth might be playing some role what that might mean for you is to say well i if it is playing a role it might be pretty small so maybe i can allocate less overall time to it which would be good for most strength athletes because that's typically what requires a lot of recovery because you're doing a lot of volume to see to make a muscle grow so i become more skeptical of muscle growth as a mechanism every year that goes by we're still doing more experiments to try and try and address this but there certainly is no evidence right now that suggests that it is a mechanism we have a lot of evidence that suggests that it isn't but i do think it would be premature to say well we've completely ruled it out i don't think that's fair to say at all so what are some other explanations i mean i guess nobody's disputing the neurologic component to this is one hypothesis that that is the entirety of it or do you think that there is another mechanism that isn't fully clear yes i think some people would say that some people are of the opinion that the exercise-induced changes are probably predominantly neural i i'm not there yet i think that there could be some local changes at the muscle um and that might be able to explain why some groups get stronger that's not just neural in other words maybe the muscle uh at the local level is actually getting better at responding to forceful contractions so maybe it's you know how it deals with calcium or how the myosin head binds maybe there's some alterations there qualitatively that aren't due to muscle size but i don't know what what those would be necessarily i can only offer potential potential reasons but um and i think that's usually the argument that's brought up mostly against our point is well if muscle growth is not a mechanism then what exactly is it and i don't think that that's a fair argument honestly because i don't know that you have to know for sure what something is to say we don't have a lot of evidence for this and there's a lot of evidence against this but that that's just my kind of thinking but i i do think that there probably is a huge neural component but i i don't know that there um there isn't something going on at the local level that is independent of a change in muscle size but but but it is still muscular perhaps so how common is bfr with athletes today i think it's becoming more and more common i know at ole miss for example as well as a lot of other division one schools in the athletic department i would say a large portion of them do have blood flow restriction devices so they are using it for rehab um and i know that i've seen you know players on espn in the nba nfl using blood flow station as well so i do think for rehab uh exclusively or do you see them using it when they're not injured as well i think there's a couple nba players just looking at some of the stories where they were using it not for rehab but just as an everyday kind of way to train where they were able to recover just a little bit faster and they don't have to have a as they've aged you know they want to make sure that they're ready to play on the actual court instead of just spending all their time recovering from their workout so i think that they they perceive this as one option to use where they're able to get some kind of workout in but maybe recover quite a bit faster than they they might doing normal exercise is the is the uh the speed of the recovery a function of less trauma to the muscle during the workout or why why is there recovery quicker that's a good question i i think i don't know that we know that but i it does appear that when they're able to when they when they are injured and they're working out with blood flow restriction they're able to usually to get a little bit more out of that compared to high load exercise or at least very similar to that but they have less pain during the movement so maybe they're able to get a little bit more out of the rehabilitation than they normally are because maybe they're before they're inhibited to a greater degree with by pain that's reduced a little bit through the application of blood flow restriction but i i don't i don't really know to be honest if let's take an extreme bodybuilder right where they're not being judged at all on strength i mean i have yet to see a bodybuilder who's not very strong but presumably due to that just the overwhelming amount of volume in their training but you know i even talked about this with lane on the podcast uh and he was explaining how look at the end of the day the volume is what's going to matter and you know you can do that with isolated movements you can do that with compound movements but you just need to get lots and lots and lots of volume across these kind of ranges so if the goal is purely hypertrophy which at least during part of the bodybuilder but the bodybuilder's cycle is the case um how would how would they utilize bfr first of all would it be a valuable tool above traditional training and if so what would be the optimal way to use it yeah i think it could be it could be a tool if the if that's how they choose to use it um i think for muscle growth i i think i agree with lane that it really comes down to personal preference because even without blood flow restriction we've seen from 30 percent up up to you know 80 percent or even higher can produce the same amount of muscle growth so i think that allows you to have you know some level of preference on based on how you feel that day or what you enjoy i i think that there are there are days where if you if you have a heavy day for example and you're going into the gym but you don't feel good or you not psychologically have it and it could be potentially dangerous for you to use a heavy weight because you're not focused then maybe that's a time where you might be able to implement some blood flow restriction because you can use light weights it doesn't require as much focus and you could probably see a lot of the same response at least with growth another component could be is that it just helps with some variety you know i don't think that variety is necessary per se for muscle growth to be optimal but i think if you're training for an extended period of time across your life things can get pretty boring if you're just doing the same thing all the time so it could be a way to to try and uh spice it up a little bit and then obviously if you're hurt it could be a great tool to use because there is a lot of or becoming to be more and more evidence that it's helpful in the rehabilitation world so i think there's a variety of ways that it can be used but i do think that it's probably important to to note that if a person's not comfortable with it they don't have to do blood flow restriction in order to optimize how much muscle that they that they can grow but it it is a tool that could be potentially quite effective for them yeah the actually the example you gave is exactly what happened today which was today's main set for me was a five by five deadlift so obviously that's you know a heavy-ish day and i took five sets to warm up to get to the starting weight that first set of five i was like yeah this i just i'm struggling second set still struggling third set struggled more fourth set i was like boy and i'm supposed to be escalating the weight and on the fifth set two reps in i thought this is the day you hurt yourself because i'm gonna break my form to get number three four and five so actually just stopped and that's why i went and did the leg press with blood flow restriction which was a very light weight i mean i don't even remember how many pounds it was but it was the type of weight that if i wasn't restricted would have you know i could have done 100 reps i'm sure um so but it was a great way to mix up the training and um and and that's the kind of stuff i'm interested in exploring i also kind of think of this as a tool for people who maybe don't have some of the the the technique to do heavier lifts um much in the same way i've sort of thought of the super slow lifting protocols as reasonable protocols for people who just don't have either the you know desire to train at higher volume and frequency and or don't have the the technical chops now that said i've always felt that the problem with super slow training is unless it's done to failure which is upsettingly painful if you've tried those workouts it's probably not nearly as beneficial as traditional training you know the the sort of super slow advocates will say it's on par with traditional training right you could do 20 minutes once or twice a week and have the benefits of six hours per week i'm not sure that that's true even from a hypertrophy standpoint but if it is true it's probably limited to the few people who truly can fail and i don't know if you've ever tried these super slow workouts but it's it's very difficult to truly fail i think you know um it it's very hard for i think most people yeah a long time ago but i i never did much with it there was somebody in my that i worked with and my phd was very interested in it for a while but yeah i was never really a fan for sure how come for the same reason or it just i never felt like i was gonna get very strong from doing something like that i'm just moving so slow and the weight is usually you know so light that i don't know how much that would be transferring over to something that i was interested in at the time which was you know to to get as strong as possible um but i it's definitely hard there's no question but yeah i i didn't enjoy that form of training so it's safe to say that the one place i think you really talked about this already but i just want to make sure we we put a dot on it the the one place where it's unambiguous that you need to be doing a traditional lift without restriction is if you're training for maximum strength of that lift which again i don't think most people are doing maximum strength bicep curls i don't think that's but but when you start to talk about a bench press a squat a deadlift a leg press for that matter if you're if you care so much there's probably no substitute for being in that 80 percent to 100 1rm is that kind of a safe takeaway yeah and you know if you do blood photoshoot that exercise with low loads assuming it's not extremely low like if you're around 20 or 30 percent you will get stronger but it will be much to a much lighter to a much smaller degree than you would with traditional exercise i completely agree now now sometimes and and i'll just add too that we get this a lot where it's like well you're doing you know bicep curls in your study it's like because we're using bicep curl it's a it's a it's a research model to answer a particular question we're not training we're not personally training people so i think sometimes people lose the reason why certain things are done but sometimes people will look at low load literature with blood flow restriction or even low low literature without blood flow tradition and say yeah but look at this study they found very similar changes in strength as highlight exercise and some of those studies do exist but the majority of those that that do find that effect if you look at the methods what they're doing is the low load bfr group is doing the one rm every two weeks or every three weeks and they're doing it in an effect to try and reset the load so they can assume that they're progressing but what they end up doing is practicing lifting a heavy weight so you're not actually studying low lows of bfr you're studying low loads with bfr plus one rm training and i think that that's a very important point and we actually reviewed this uh we published a paper on this topic where we show that when you only look at the studies with low loads that don't practice doing the 1rm test repeatedly almost all of them lose the high load exercise just again illustrating the point that it's about lifting heavy weight is the best way to get better at lifting heavy weight it doesn't mean that you won't get stronger lifting lighter weight but you won't be as strong as you were so how do we think well let me summarize what you just said because i think in terms of big picture there are really two areas where bfr shines one of them is in an individual who for some reason can't lift heavy weight but still needs to get stronger and potentially bigger and the obvious example is the person who's recovering from an injury and then potentially the person who just you know has a concern about lifting heavy weight either from a technical standpoint or injury avoidance or things like that the second place where bfr seems to really stand out is in hypertrophy most of these studies are demonstrating slightly superior hypertrophy response despite less total volume and certainly lower load is that it's at least as good in hypertrophy and in some cases better is my reading of the literature when it's compared to if you have a low load with bfr compared to a work matched low load group without bfr hypertrophy is better almost always and to make them equal you will just have to go more on the you'll have to go to a greater degree of reps on the unrestricted side to failure basically correct yep and therefore it takes more time to get the same effect so so it's a more efficient way potentially to generate hypertrophy it's probably more accurate than what i said earlier right and correct now the vascular adaptations again i keep putting that caveat in because it's always in my mind because i really expected that to be kind of the same across the board as well meaning that as long as you're doing a lot of repetitions it shouldn't matter whether there's bfr or not that's not what we found now whether or not that can be repeated i i'm not sure hopefully we can do that in the future but because my my thinking for a long time was similar to what you were saying earlier it doesn't really matter whether there's bfr or not if you do enough it'll be very similar the workload would just be less and i think that again it's true for muscle but i don't know if that's true for every single variable yeah so let's let's talk about the mechanism by which this is happening um my assumption which i don't know if it's right or wrong is that at least one of the reasons that bfr can produce so much hypertrophy at such low load is as is in response to the metabolic challenge that's posed and so one of the things i was doing quite a bit was testing lactate levels with and without bfr um and it's very easy to demonstrate that when you occlude your arm for example well distal to that occlusion lactate is going through the roof because you're exercising that arm and you're not letting the lactate clear out of circulation so i'm pinpricking my finger and getting very very high lactate levels and so you know that's obviously a metabolic byproduct of any time you're exercising and then especially when you're doing this type of exercise and so yeah i could demonstrate that i had a higher level of lactate doing uh blood flow restriction than not even when i was lifting slightly more weight and you know doing something traditional what do we think do we think that that matters in this equation do we think that that's partially driving this uh or what we're what and that's just one of the metabolites that we can measure easily there's plenty that we can't yes i i would agree i i think that there's kind of two schools of thought one is that the pulling of these metabolites in and of themselves is turning on some of these anabolic signaling pathways meaning just the fact that you're pulling lactate around the fibers that that's able to activate growth i i used to be interested in that idea we tried to test this using a different a couple different ways we didn't find an advantage to to doing that so we kind of started to say well maybe there's nothing to metabolize in and of themselves but maybe it's what they're causing the muscle to do so in other words maybe the way we think about it now is is that as you said you're exercising with blood flow restriction the metabolites are being trapped what we think is is that they're augmenting muscle activation so they're causing the muscle to have to work a lot harder than it normally would because you're pulling this lactate around it and you know you might fatigue some of these cross bridges so we have to recruit more and more and more and more fibers so that's where we think the benefit of metabolites is is that they're basically inducing fatigue which then leads to further muscle activation and muscle activation for a sufficient duration of time is is the name of the game at least in my opinion for making a muscle grow so one of the the big kind of questions always is are the mechanisms themselves different from traditional exercise if i do high load exercise is that going to be a different mechanism than when i do low load exercise with blood flow restriction and i don't think so and i'll i'll tell you why i think that the mechanism involved in activation is different but once the fiber is activated all the signaling pathways from what i understand are going to be very similar so when we lift a heavy weight it requires a tremendous muscle activation to even lift one rep if you are trying to do a bicep curl and you're only activating a small portion of your fibers and you're trying to lift 70 70 pounds if your 1rm is 100 pounds right and that's an enormous bicep i was about to say i i really feel pretty pathetic here yep but go ahead so um choose choose any lift right in order to lift that heavy weight you need to activate a large portion of your musculature otherwise the weight isn't going to move compared to low loads where you don't need to activate the same amount of muscle fibers initially because the weight is extremely low so when we exercise with low lows in bfr we're activating only a small amount initially but those metabolites as you discussed start to become trapped and we activate more fibers more fibers more fibers and more fibers and then by the end we've activated a similar amount of fibers as we did with high load exercise by the way is there an order in in that so if um if your you know one rm bicep curl is 100 pounds um and then without so so with no blood flow restriction you pick up 80 pounds and bang out i don't know 10 reps 8 reps compare that with if you picked up 40 pounds and banged out 40 reps what is happening from a fiber fatigue standpoint under those two scenarios in general um we have what we call the henneman size principle where you recruit type one motor units first and then as you as you require based on the exercise you recruit type two in addition to type 1. so when you lift a heavy weight you're getting to the type 2s very quickly because you need them whereas with with lower weight you're probably taking a little bit of time but then you are eventually getting to those type two motor units so if the person in my example fails at eight reps with 80 pounds and 40 reps with 40 pounds at the it's just that the 40 reps took a lot longer to burn through the type one fibers and then the type two a's and the two abs and then finally at the very end the 2x failed whereas the when he did the same exercise you know 20 minutes later at 80 pounds and failed at eight reps he just got he he did the same sequence but he just got to the 2x much sooner is that what you're saying yeah and i and the reason why i say that is if you look at if you pull out fibers following training type 1 and type 2 fibers have both been shown to grow in both high load exercise as well as low load exercise with and without blood fluctuation so they both respond some people have suggested that type 1 might grow a little bit more with low low training but i i'm not i'm not convinced on that yet i think that it's probably very similar to highlight exercise although i see the thinking but but yeah both of them will grow in response to both types of exercise in general at the extreme level is a bodybuilder's hypertrophy more explained by type 1 or type 2 fibers or are they both massive relative to anybody else yeah i i would say probably the the increase in both although i i don't i'm not there's not one thing i can point to that would uh suggest that for me but i i think that um in response to training my guess is that both of them would increase i i think you might be able to make an argument that people who might again go back to our argument earlier who start lifting weights and realize man i'm actually able to grow quite a bit maybe they already had you know more type two fibers to begin with which is some think that or is more responsive to to loading so maybe you can make that argument but i think in response to actually when a bodybuilder exercises i would probably guess that both of them are going to grow both types of fibers you'd mention very briefly passive bfr what's the application for that is that in a highly injured person yeah i and again there's only a small number of studies that have shown this and that could be for a variety of reasons one it could be because those are hard to do where you have somebody who had acl surgery and then we apply blood flow restriction to their limb um we inflate and then we deflate for a period of time couple times a day and that's been shown to slow muscle loss but there's only a few studies that have shown that now the again you don't see growth you only see a slowing of continuation of loss which is a big big deal when people undergo surgery now that's my kind of i'm very interested in whether or not that's true um one of the things that gives me a little bit of pause is that there's not more of those studies so in my mind i always wonder is that because those are again hard to do or is it because those studies do exist but they didn't see anything they didn't publish it so i i i'm i'm cautiously optimistic that that could be useful but i i do think that as soon as a person can exercise you know and we and we kind of published a paper on this idea a long time ago kind of what we view as a progression of blood flow restriction in other words someone who wants to who can't do anything how do we get them back to doing something so we start off with if they can't even walk we apply this restriction to slow down muscle loss once they can maybe walk on a treadmill or walk very slowly but they can't lift weights we start to transition them to that phase where they're able to increase muscle size and strength just a little bit and if nothing else maintain what they have but then once they can transition to resistance exercise i think that's where they're going to see the biggest bang for their buck and then they can go to highland exercise if they if they choose um but i i do feel like that's a very potentially useful progression to this technique i mean this is such an important question it's a real shame this isn't being studied like again when you like if i were czar for a day and i was in charge of where research dollars would be spent i would be putting because i don't think it would take that much money by the way but i would absolutely prioritize this question when you consider the extent of muscle loss that occurs in sedentary individuals following elective surgery emergent surgery and injuries so those are three very big buckets of people disproportionately by the way affected uh in the elderly where the effects are devastating i'm sure you're familiar with the literature of you know you take somebody in their seventh decade of life they can and you train them very hard for a year they'll put on you know x pounds of muscle and then put them in a hospital bed for 10 days they will lose all of it they will lose every ounce that they spent a year diligently gaining to think that there could be a tool that could slow that and we don't know the answer definitively uh strikes me as just an unbelievable unwise decision that's been made so i would hope somebody who has the authority over where those dollars go is listening to this and realizing that the morbidity and mortality associated with with muscle loss especially in the elderly is so significant and we you know one of the things we talk about a lot with our patients is once you get to be 70 and certainly 80 years old you're kind of one fall away from the end of your life even if you don't die directly right so there's the catastrophic fall where you hit your head you have a cerebral hemorrhage and you die that's not the majority of them the real fall you are away from your the end of your life is the injury that basically never permits you to get get back on your feet because even when you recover from the direct injury maybe a broken hip which is common you never get back the strength and stamina you once had and to you know again not to i just think bfr should be explored much more in this population that should be standard of care if indeed it is effective in both the passive and and then the the as you describe the progression right so passive low end aerobic uh you know low load resistance and ultimately if you can get back to high load resistance great right so if you had unlimited resources right now what what experiment would you want to do what's the what are the burning questions that if if you know francis collins called you tomorrow and said jeremy i've got this extra 100 million bucks we just we've got to get rid of it what can you do huh that's a good question i i think you know i would do something with blood flow restriction of course but you know if i had to kind of my interest right now is related to trying to figure out why people get stronger and i think i can always tie that back into you know blood flow restriction and be able to to to do things of that sort but i'm interested in what that means and what a change in strength from resistance training what that means for overall function of a person so when i get stronger with resistance training does that actually carry over to improvements in my walking ability and things of that sort so those are some things that i'm interested in um with blood flow restriction i'd obviously do kind of what you just stated i'd have to you know probably connect with our med school in order to do a study like that but i i would be interested in the application of blood flow attrition by itself i think that that is something that i've been interested in for a long time again i think it'd have to be not something we could do right out of my lab we'd have to work with the hospital of course but i'd be interested in that and i'd be interested in doing it on a large scale because all those studies that currently exist are extremely small sample size so for for of course for a variety of reasons but i'd want to see it i want i'd want to start answering a lot of these questions with large sample sizes that would be kind of my my dream studies you know whatever it would be whether it's strength whether it's this bigger studies longer studies and i i think that 100 million dollars i could do a lot for sure well uh amazingly that's a that's a fraction of a penny compared to the amount of research that goes into uh with the the fraction of dollars that goes into biomedical research but it's not necessarily always allocated wisely um nevertheless this has been this has been a super interesting discussion again you can tell personally i just want to understand this for myself for my patients and ultimately i think this is a very important topic for for anybody who's interested in any aspect of that continuum we discussed so jeremy thank you very much and i'm really uh so glad that lane connected us i'm sorry i didn't have a little extra alcohol i know elaine mentioned you always like to have a drink when we start a talk and i i should have thought to have sent out a nice bottle of tequila for you or is it scotch what did lane say is your favorite it's it's scotch 100 so you know i'll forgive you you know maybe we can do it again and we can maybe have scotch next time perfect single malt i assume of course yeah do you add do you drink it neat or do you add like the one spoon of water to it i drink it neat generally okay i have a friend from residency so i don't i'm personally not a huge scotch guy i love tequila and japanese whiskey um but i love talking to people who love who love scotch and can walk me through the ins and outs of it but this friend of mine obviously a single malt guy would import water from scotland from a very specific lake and he explained to me why you could the scotch would get a little better and it would open up a little bit more and be a little less anesthetizing to the tongue if you would add just this one spoon of lukewarm water to it uh i i don't remember the exact reason but it somehow had to do with diluting it just a little bit to prevent some of the um anesthetic effect but you you're a neat guy which i i i like tequila neat and uh japanese whiskey need as well so i can really yeah i'm not quite on that level of drinking where i'm importing specific water but i i do appreciate uh a good drink for sure i find it interesting by the way you know on the topic of sort of genetics i really do think people just genetically can like the taste of scotch or not and i don't possess the gene i think because i've i've sampled very fancy scotches and i've never found it palatable but i don't doubt for a moment that you or someone who does finds just as much enjoyment in the in the actual taste of it that i would for example and some of these other things i like it's interesting because my students make fun of me for this but i i can't i can't drink beer unless it's like a fruity type of beer so they obviously mock me for that but i can't drink beer but i can drink hard liquor for sure all day but the the beer stuff i can't do unless it tastes like apple pie or something else um then then i'm all but i'm on board but just standard beer can't do it i'm with you i think standard beer is about on par with urine in terms of palatability so i've never understood how budweiser stays in business but uh yeah i can't do really any of that all right jeremy well thanks so much this is this was a super interesting discussion i really appreciate it thanks for having me on peter thank you for listening to this week's
