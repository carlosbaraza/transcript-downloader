## Transcript

[00:00:00] now luckily with therapy there's a way to retrain your immune system but that takes regular interaction with the food every day not every week if you take it every week it actually boosts your immune system to become more allergic take it every day so there's something to the Circadian rhythm and the dial cycle which we haven't talked about this yet but what I love about the immune system is it can be trained and you just need to know how to train it and you can train it away from becoming allergic and and train it into becoming more protective hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:00:43] AA uh well Carrie thank you so much for uh for joining me today I I I don't remember the last time we were together in person but I feel like it's been probably eight years or so is that possible I think so it's been eight years and lots has happened Peter especially Co so it's nice to see you again yeah yeah and I I've always appreciated the the amount of time you used to make for me when I used to wander into your lab at Stanford just to pick your brain um and and so again I've always thought that the work you were doing was so exciting and I know that it ties into so much about what people are interested in around um food allergies even to some extent food sensitivities and I think also even based on your current role you've now left Stanford you're at Harvard um I I think it's also very to discuss air pollution uh I think this is um probably something that isn't getting enough attention with respect to health um I know it's something I feel woefully deficient in my understanding um though I try to pay attention to my my PM 2.5S I'm not sure what to do with the information sometimes so with all that said let's let's maybe just give people a really quick background on on why you're the person to be talking about this so you you you're an MD PhD and and what did your PhD dissertation

[00:01:59] Focus on yeah I was really excited to do my PhD in Biochemistry so I learned a lot about toxicology and biochemistry and I did my PhD in parasitology actually I worked on an enzyme in a parasite called the tranos which causes African sleeping sickness and another disease called shagas disease and I loved my work there because we were able to go to the very minute levels of understanding of a chemical entity to be able to create a drug to Target that entity to help people with that disease so it was a great PhD I loved it and I also did that at Harvard under Chris

[00:02:38] Walsh so that's what my PhD was in and then I did other work in immunology and um and animal models as well and then you're a pediatrician by training clinically as well what um what led you then to study the the the field that brought me to you uh as as a as a matter of Interest a decade ago around the field of food allergies yeah you know it's all a build

[00:03:04] Peter and we think of our careers all of these things mesh but there are certain Nexus points in our careers and I believe that typically for me it's been a patient and it's been an inspiration to be able to move forward in a field like food allergy so um I did my MD training also at Harvard and then uh trained in Pediatrics at Children's

[00:03:25] Boston as well as at Stanford and with that I had the opportunity to become a fellow in a field that I loved which was Allergy Asthma and Immunology and I had done a lot of Immunology work when I did my PhD and parasites because parasites are killed by the immune cells and especially this little molecule called

[00:03:44] IG that tends to kill parasites but it's not so great for allergies so this ying and yang of this molecule in biology as an immunologist for me was also really interesting but fast forward I was a fellow on the wards and I was about to see a patient that I was being asked to consult on for milk allergy and he was in the ICU and I was told that he had just drank a cup of milk and had had a bad reaction and by the time I arrived there the unfortunate event of his death had already occurred he was already being asked um his parents were already being asked to give consent for him to be a liver donor and so I took care of the the person that was the liver recipient who also had a milk allergy and so that really gave me pause and number one inspired me and really initiated my efforts in food allergy to understand the role of this molecule called IG the role of the immune system how food allergies get started in the first place how in the world did a child with food allergy who died then give his same food allergy to the recipient of his liver so all of these things really started to catalyze my curiosity and I felt very blessed and lucky at the time to be able to be in a lab and when you're a person that has this training I feel that we're obligated in a way to be able to use that training to best help

[00:05:17] Mankind and to best help those questions that parents ask us and so at the bedside of this particular young child that had died unfortunately due to a milk allergy I'll never forget his father trembling asking why the EpiPen didn't work at the time what can we do to help children in the future never have to die again and so I promised that father that I would do the absolute best to prevent further deaths in children and adults with food allergy as well as help really make sure that we educate about the use of injectable epinephrine devices and how to best use them to prevent deaths to food allergies so that's my why and ever since then I've always wanted to really help out in this field Carrie it would be impossible I think for us to have this discussion at the level of depth that I hope we can have it without the listener understanding how the immune system works under normal circumstances um you've already alluded to one of the immunoglobulines

[00:06:22] IG um does it make sense you think to talk about sort of the family of the imunoglobulin what they're there for how we acquire them and how they normally serve us well sure so we have certain proteins in our blood that help protect us and that's what they're meant to do and that's great and they exist in different concentrations just like in a milkshake you have different proteins that exist in different concentrations and they're all there for nourishment purposes um sometimes for Taste too but in our blood the proteins in our blood that constitute immunoglobulins are really helpful we learned a lot about how important immunoglobulins were to protect against Co for example everyone wanted to know their quote unquote titer and what that means is imunoglobulin so the main class IG imunoglobulin those are very protective those are proteins that are in high amounts and they float in our plasma and in order to be really healthy when when we are healthy we have healthy amounts of imunoglobulin to protect us the minute that someone is maybe what we call under a drug like steroids or under other drugs that could affect your immune system that also reduces the amounts of these immunoglobulins so we know that these immunoglobulins are really important it's important to have good concentrations not too high but good concentrations and immunoglobulins in general help protect us against infections and they also help protect us against allergies then there's another complimentary imunoglobulin Suite that doesn't just stay in our blood it also gets into our organs cuz you want to protect all of the surfaces around your organs as well not just in your blood the blood is great that's the highway into so many organs but in addition it' be nice to have some imunoglobulin protective molecules that actually sit around your organs and help so for example that class is called IG the other class was IGG this class is IG and we call that the secretory class that's also helpful in our saliva in our gut especially uh women who are pregnant they secrete it after pregnancy and their breast milk so these are things that we've learned as immunologists that really help protect and enable Health when people are missing IGA for example if they don't make any IG they actually have allergies and the other imunoglobulin class that I'll talk about is called

[00:09:01] IGM and IGM is kind of a special what I call the the Marines they're that is the type of imunoglobulin cell IGM that goes out their first call that they're there to fight infections but then the imunoglobulin G proteins come in afterwards and they stay for much longer igms don't stay for very long the final class is IG so IG unfortunately in the past when we were in the field and uh fighting uh animals and being out there in the wild IG was very helpful to fight parasites for example and it was very specific to parasites and now unfortunately IG still exists in our blood it represents 0.005% of all the immunoglobulins in our blood so of all those classes the IG is the least represented it's the least concentrated but it is unfortunately the most potent and I call it the match that lights the fire behind allergies and you think well why do we have such a skewed response why do we still have this prehistoric molecule floating around in our blood that truly all of us consider a bad actor and we think it's because of that prehistoric need to fight parasites uh but importantly now fast forward thousands and millions of years it's still there and it unfortunately has a skewed response in allergies so maybe just explain a little bit more about what the immunoglobuline does to fight off the and let's just talk about it through the lens of an infection so how what happens when you get a bacterial infection um and what happens when you get a viral infection those are two sort of different things but yet they both kind of still involve immunoglobulins even though we think of one of those threats the viral illness being more uh dealt with through the cellular immune system versus the humoral maybe even you can explain what cellular versus humoral immunity mean sure so in general what I'll explain today is how our immune system fights a virus or a bacteria or a fungi but there's always some exceptions to the rule but I'll just talk about the general pathway and that I think helps people conceptualize what happens and

[00:11:27] I'm always amazed at the immune system and there's a lot we still don't know so in all humility as an immunologist I learn every day what I don't know about the immune system but what we do know is that when something attacks us like a virus like a bacteria Like A fungi that enters into our lungs our gut our nose those unfortunate microbes they know how to get into our body so they get into our body and they go through either the skin or they go through through other organs and then on the other side is waiting for them a whole panoply of immune cells ready to attack and so if a virus gets in through the body now typically it doesn't we try to fight it right away but sometimes it does and so let's say a virus or a bacteria or a fungi gets into the body gets through our typical first layer like a Skin

[00:12:27] Barrier and it gets through then right away we have these cells called macroasia and they literally just eat up things so they bind on to the virus or the bacteria or the fungi eat it up and then eat it up into small little bits and then they expose those small little bits on their surface and then with those small little bits on the surface they actually then become the educator pieces for another group of cells called the t- cell and that's what we call the cellular C system macroasia antigen presenting cells these little bits are called antigens and then the te- cell comes along and says huh that's interesting I'm going to teach myself the te- cell I'm going to teach myself how to operate Within These Little antigens what are these things how do I train the immune system to get rid of this thing so then the te- cell says all right I'm going to start to understand what this new organism is that just attacked my body and I want to defend against that I don't want that bacteria or that fungi or that virus in this body so the te- cell becomes what we call a memory cell a memory t- cell then teaches another cell called the B cell the t- cell interacts with the B cell the B cell then starts to make imunoglobulin and that B cell makes the imunoglobulin thanks for the teaching cell to train that B cell to make the immunoglobulins for the exact little antigens that that virus made or that bacteria made or that fungi made so you have this little b cell the B cell makes these imunoglobulin and then they bind to the antigen now you have specificity in your cellular and your humoral immune system so the humoral comes from these antibodies that float in the blood and that's what we call the humoral immune system it's not attached to a cell but it was made by a cell so those humoral related antibodies attached to the antigen and then another cell again back to that macras eating cell that macras then recognize this whole system and we call it antibody dependent cell killing so now that the antibody recognizes this virus and it recognizes all the viruses that maybe you had across your whole gut or across your whole l L for that one specific virus it recognizes as foreign and then these other cells called the macras come back again and they chew the whole virus up and eliminate it from your body so that's a long system I just talked about things that take days to respond to months to respond to and it took many years of science to figure that whole pathway out this is not something you learn at the beds side uh with some story your mom tells you this is a lot of Science and that science has allowed us to understand the immune system to number one provide vaccines to people because of the same system we now know how to make imunoglobulin because of our vaccines and we know how long they can last for these memory tea cells for example can last up to a 100 years so I love the cellular humoral part of the immune system because it's very instructive to fight microbes unfortunately it doesn't fight all microbes some microbes need a little help with antibod with antibiotics with antivirals so the story that I showed you today isn't perfect so that's why you need to see the doctor you need to have other medicines for example to try to help your immune system fight infections because there's holes in the immune system and we need to help it why do you think our immune system is on balance so much better at fighting viruses than bacteria at least in terms of the clinically relevant ones in other words very few people will take an antiviral drug in their life outside of you know a handful of unusual circumstances most people will go through life with their immune system doing a very good job of lopping off the head of two to three viruses a year that actually reach the threshold of clinical significance and yet most people you know don't go more than two or three years without actually requiring an antibiotic to Aid in the uh destruction of a bacteria do you have a sense even

[00:17:09] teologico as well as from an evolutionary point of view as well as really understanding how did viruses start in the first place how did a bacteria start in the first place what do they need to grow on from the perspective of the virus why do they need us from the perspective of bacteria why do they need us same thing for fungi so when you think about a virus you know they kind of flp from one organ to one organism to the other they sometimes can exist out in the wild they don't necessarily need us but they do need sometimes like HIV it needs some of our cells to be able to live inside to be able to keep proliferating so I'd say in general um there are some viruses that are of course very severe and they can cause fatal disease so on the Spectrum like you said Peter typically though viruses aren't as bad as bacteria we don't typically need an antiviral because we can fight viruses it's a great question though because viruses can mutate in our body like we saw with covid and then all of a sudden we can't fight them as well but that our body because we make things like mucus that we have fevers that we have these immune cells that are really programmed to attack quickly they can chew up the viral proteins much better and much more easily to destroy a virus cuz a virus is really relatively speaking compared to a bacteria a simple organ simp it's very simple so it doesn't take a lot for the immune system to just say listen didn't take me a lot of energy to wipe that out because that virus is made out of simple things it's basically like made of really simple Lego blocks but then you have the bacteria that's made of an enormous amount of Lego blocks and it is much harder to destroy that same thing with fungi they are much more complex organisms they're made of many different materials so that it's harder for our immune system to kill every piece of the part and get rid of it so there are certain viruses though that we still get infected with but that they don't cause fatality so they've learn to kind of use us and then move on because they want to just keep proliferating but they don't necessarily stick around for our immune system to kill it they just keep being contagious so viruses are much easier at hopping from one person to the other whereas bacteria they're not that's not so easy because they're heavier they're it's harder to take a bacteria and give it to another human with bacteria I also think that we have this bimodal relationship and I want to make sure all your viewers know that there are some bacteria that are actually really good um we don't know any virus in particular that are actually good and beneficial for us but our body lives with bacteria so I think our immune system has a little tougher time to know what is this is this a good bacteria or this a bad bacteria so that's maybe also why it's easier to kill viruses than bacteria we've learned to tolerant to be tolerant to certain bacteria um but not others and some of them Escape our immune system if they are bad bacteria because they know that we have this tolerance to other bacteria that are in the same same class um but it depends on where that bacteria is it's totally fine if this bacteria is in your gut but the minute it gets into your blood if it's the same bacteria it's actually really dangerous so that's where our immune system has to figure out is this a bacteria in the gut I'm okay with that or is this bacteria in the blood I'm not okay with that and bacteria tend to divide so fast just like viruses that for both V virus and bacteria it these These are difficult but when we talk about vaccines we luckily have used science for both bacterially mediated diseases as well as viral mediated diseases so it's really thanks to vaccines that we've enabled the immune system to get boosted for both types of infections but it's always hard to predict mutants to predict different infections that one would have but I think that your question is an excellent one I don't have all the answers yeah no it's funny I think there's an analogy there with cancer right which is what makes cancer so challenging for the immune system is that it's basically self and um it's very good at masking it's non-self entities so even though it's genetically distinct from a non-cancer cell it's very good at hiding uh the neoantigens that come you know and sometimes they're not even coding proteins in other words sometimes the mutation in the cancer cell doesn't lead to the generation of an antigen and therefore it can go completely undetected masquerading itself exactly and that's the sad part about cancer um that our memory te- cells that are supposed to be there to protect us and monitor and make sure that any cancerous cells could be killed right away sometimes it's faked out in a way and that's where I think the car T

[00:22:24] Cell Therapy a lot of the t- cell mediated immune mediated therapies now can enable and better instruct our immune system but if that's not perfect either so you're absolutely right Peter this ying and yang of having the immune system do all that it can but we can't expect so much and one of those areas in order to help our immune system we found in covid for example people that slept better people that ate a healthy diet people that exercised in general their immune system was healthy here so I think when we talk about these public health issues and Co kind of was the

[00:23:03] X-ray into our soul of Public Health and public health uh processes but in that we learned a lot about what it takes to be healthy and what it takes to have a healthy immune system to better fight viruses and and microbes I'd like to actually come back to that because it's such an interesting topic is one of those things where it seems obvious and self-evident that all of those things are true I think I would also add stress to that I think it's hard to it's hard to understate the harm that hypercortisolemia and a ramped up uh sympathetic system have in the immune system but I'd actually if we have time like to come back to that and probe a little bit about what the mechanisms are for that but what I really want to get to is now pivoting to this idea of what a food allergy is um and I and I think it would maybe be a good idea to differentiate between a food sensitivity and an allergy is that the right terminology that you would use yeah that's actually so for a lot of my patients this comes up all the time and you know I am inspired by how much knowledge my patients have they come to the table or they don't come to the table with um with knowledge already that they received from the Internet or podcasts such as yours and others as well as just reading in general and finally asking questions is so important if you don't know something feel free to ask your doctor these questions this is CR IAL and um or a healthcare provider or anyone but I've always been really interested in this difference between food sensitivity and food allergy so food sensitivity means that you can bite a food and you're typically going to react to a chemical in that food perhaps a protein but it's mostly a small molecule maybe a sugar maybe a fat maybe a spice uh and with that people can get headaches people can get bloating uh typical food sensitivity is like lactose intolerance when you drink milk for example one of the sugars in the milk is called lactose and if you don't have an enzyme in your gut and in your body called lactase you can't break down that sugar so that's why people take lactate milk for example um and there are some ethnicities that don't have that enzyme so there is a bunch of people that in a certain population really can't drink cow's milk because of that lactose sugar so that's a food sensitivity people get bloating people get headaches but they're not going to have a fatal reaction highly unlikely and and just to be clear Carrie the immune system is not reacting at all in that state of a food sensitivity ah great question it can react if you have enough lactose and you keep drinking lactose and your body says

[00:25:57] I don't like this sugar why are you keep giving me the sugar when not when I can't break it down what happens is it sends its immune cells to try to break it down and that causes inflammation so some people when they take uh certain and preservatives as well certain emulsifiers these chemicals they can get into the body and our immune system doesn't like it cuz it's foreign a lot of our uh our preservatives and fortunately UL virus it hasn't been seen by the body before it's not something that's natural so for some people their immune system does react but it reacts with a different pathway than an allergic pathway it reacts with sometimes immunoglobulins Iggs it reacts with something called a cyto kind that isn't great because it causes chronic inflammation so we do have some chemicals that are associated with food sensitivities that can activate the immune system in a way that's not great for the human body and so that's why if someone does have bloating or headaches or they can still have rashes for food sensitivity you can still have rashes in your skin with certain chemicals that you eat in foods and if that's happening to you then get yourself tested because we want to make sure it's not a food allergy but importantly is we don't have cures or therapy for food sensitivities we often will tell people please avoid that food like I have someone that has terrible bloating with mushrooms because it's a certain chemical in the mushroom that bothers her immune system why I don't know but the minute she even smells the mushroom she gets this immediate reaction to her gut that causes her to vomit but it's not a food allergy it's an intense reaction of the nervous system to that food chemical you know sometimes we see people who have kind of a low great elevation of their C reactive protein and again we really like to see the the the very sensitive version of that below one and so you you'll see these people that you know otherwise seem reasonable but their C-reactive protein is somewhere between two and three so it's two to three times higher than it should be and it lingers in this state for a very long period of time there's no clearly no infection that's been brewing for that long and you you query them a little bit more and you sort of realized that it might be attributed to food and and and I would say in my experience the two foods that far and way account for the majority of this as determined by simple elimination and watching this go away are first uh wheat related products and secondly

[00:28:45] Dairy so uh again when I say wheat I don't mean celiac disease which I'd like you to explain as a contrast but but rather some sort of lowgrade sensitivity and so what you're saying is there's nothing going on in the IG pathway but there is something going on in the IGG pathway and again C reactive protein is made by the liver as basically a calling sign to the immune system so you're you're sort of seeing for lack of a better word you're seeing the sirens going constantly which is

[00:29:16] CRP yeah it's a great great analogy and and Peter it's a excellent question because we can measure what we can measure and CRP has been around in our sort of doctor's handbag for a while and it's actually a really good Beacon like you analog analogized because it does tell us something's going on there and it is kind of um a a window into what's going on chronically in the immune system so yes when I test the CRP levels in my patients with food sensitivities and they're not able to eliminate that specific chemical then I see the CRP kind of in in that kind of range where it's a I call it simmering immune inflammation it's not a fire but it's simmering and the problem with food sensitivities is I don't have a great way to diagnose them I don't have a skin test I don't have an IG test I have to do elimination and then I follow that

[00:30:13] CRP level until it can try to get to zero but that's not easy because some of these chemicals are so systematically in our food supply that it's hard to get rid of so that's food sensitivity and agree with you milk and wheat are some of the most associated culprits in food sensitivities especially in us and that might be for a lot of different reasons in terms of how we process and how we have detergents in our milk and the same thing with our wheat products it isn't necessarily the same wheat that we ate when we were when our ancestors ate it originally so maybe there's a lot of reasons for that but let me bring it to wheat because this triangulation of food sensitivity Celiac versus food allergy and we'll get to food allergy but let me just transpose this interesting comment you made about food sensitivity versus

[00:31:03] Celiac so Celiac is a very specific type of food sensitivity and it has a very marched out pathway of immune reaction to that wheat and that wheat protein and specifically is the gadin which is a part of the wheat and celiac disease also has genetics associated with it and other autoimmune disease with it as you know but that reaction is to a very specific part of the protein of the wheat and not everyone with a food sensitivity to wheat has Celiac and certainly not everyone with Celiac will have the same type of reactions to wheat as the food sensitivity people do now

[00:31:45] Celiac we take extremely seriously because it can result in longterm problems with your gut and so it has its own special category but you shouldn't call yourself someone that has Celiac just because you have a food sensitivity to wheat there's a specific diagnosis that needs to occur with a professional that specializes in gastroenterology or in Celiac to be able to know if I truly have celiac disease and if you do then it's important to test family members and to really get under the care of a good doctor and I hope that that's helpful to differentiate food sensitivity to Celiac are any other questions you have on that no I mean I I was going to ask you you know are we seeing any increase in the prevalence of celiac disease or are we seeing any increase in the prevalence of food sensitivities it certainly seems like it as a non- epidemiologist who pays attention only to the world around him but it seems like more and more people are saying uh boy I'm really struggling to eat fill in the blank yeah on one side I think that people are becoming more knowledgeable about this and they also feel they have agency as they should when they come to the doctor to be able to say I think I have a s stimul this food and and people take them seriously and that's good and we need that because these symptoms are serious they're affecting someone's quality of life we need to help and in the past maybe they were kind of poo pooed and said oh I can't help you so I can't do anything about that but now people like you and I can say well let's test that CRP let's see if we can do be better detectives and really try to help you because in the end we want to help quality of life so yes people I think are feeling more and more like they can talk about it as well as celiac disease but importantly is we have better

[00:33:44] Diagnostics so I think that we as a community have gotten better at really uh diagnosing Celiac so I think that's another good reason why there might be more people with it I think people also are seeing an increase in food sensitivities in Celiac because of the different ways that weed is processed uh because of the different detergents now and unfortunate chemicals that are put into our Foods so I think we have to be careful about that and hopefully the food industry and agriculture will think carefully about those chemicals before they put them in because I've seen an increase and when I tell people to not eat foods with those chemicals in them they tend to not have food sens sensitivity so I I think that perhaps and i' be interested in your comment too

[00:34:32] Peter that might be one of the reasons why there's more food sensitivity although I don't I can't put my finger on it yeah it's it I feel like there's something going on and and I know we're going to talk about this also on the food allergy side where I think we can probably speak with more clarity so so let's now let's now talk about that because I think this is the area where you know let's just start with some statistics uh do you have a sense of how many people in the United States die in a year as a result of a food allergy like the tragic story you told yeah thankfully it is extremely rare um the reason why I hedge is because nowadays with codes in the emergency rooms and understanding if someone died from a food allergy some emergency rooms some intensive care units they're able to ascribe or attribute a certain reaction exactly to a food sometimes it's a little blurry so it is very rare there are people around the country in

[00:35:32] Michigan as well as in Chicago that are epidemiologists I am not an epidemiologist although I love to work with epidemiologists so it is very rare um people have claimed that um it's one of the reasons why people can have a fatal attack is because they don't have access to an EP uh device or they don't have anticipatory guidance for what to do during reaction so any in my mind any fatal reaction could have been avoided and that's what I learned from that case is even though the Fatal reactions are rare and that's good um they could be avoided and when we learn about them and

[00:36:11] I learn about one per month right in in the US and it's very sad every one of those stories comes with um a tragedy that's heart-wrenching but it compels me to keep trading my my patients on making sure they have two injectable epinephrine devices at all times making sure they know how to use it within a minute making sure that if it doesn't help their symptoms within a minute that they use another right away that it's okay to use an injectable epinephrine device because that's the only thing that can actually prevent the unfortunate death and so I think the numbers right now in terms of death rates are getting lower which is good because people are understanding more about this disease and the communities understand that why we don't want to expose people unnecessarily to foods that could kill them but in addition there are increasing incidence and prevalence of food allergies in general in the US so for example my colleague Ruchi Gupta out of Chicago she published data that one in every 12 children in the classroom in the US has a doctor's diagnosis at food allergy and we used to think that children would lose their food allergy especially especially those with milk and egg so it used to be thought even when I was training that children with milk and egg allergies if they were under the age of five there was like an 80% chance that they would lose these allergies by the time they were teenagers but if it was peanut or or any kind of tree nut or shrimp or fish they had an 80% chance of keeping it but now unfortunately if you have a milk or an egg allergy and you're under the age of five you have a 50% chance of losing it so now we see more and more adults having food allergy and the other unfortunate thing

[00:38:01] Peter is that more adults when they get to adulthood are getting food allergies and so that's presumably about one in 30 adults will have some type of food allergy when they're an adult whether or not that's because they had it when they were children or because they gain it newly when they're an adult so the numbers are rising luckily the death numbers are not but someone needs to do more research on that but this compels me as a food allergist to really make sure that both children and adults understand this disease and how to manage it so let's talk about how this occurs and let's um unless it's it varies by food can we just pick a very specific example like a peanut sure um that's great and we talk about peanuts in the the US Peter uh I also want to get back to your original question about the incidence and prevalence of food allergy it's occurring throughout the world it's not just a US problem so peanut is also not just a US problem it's uh that those allergies are in uh the UK and Australia but not in Italy for example in Italy hazelnut is number one in terms of the the the sheets in Japan it's fish in uh

[00:39:22] China it's milk so we can talk about peanut today because it's an example of how our immune system reacts to something but it's a very similar immune reaction to a child in Japan who has fish allergy or a child in uh China who has milk allergy or an adult in Italy who has hazelnut allergy and I've seen a spectrum of allergies I've seen people that have allergies to Cinnamon I've seen people that have allergies to

[00:39:47] Orange pit seeds because all of these have proteins in them so people can actually become allergic to these proteins people have allergies to the tannin proteins from GP in wine so I'll tell about the story of the peanut but I want people to know that it's not just about peanuts and many people that have allergies to one food have allergies to other Foods so people also need to know that if they have a child with a food allergy expect that it's highly likely that that child will develop another food allergy as well so be super careful but also super Vigilant about taking um your child or yourself to the doctor to keep on getting being managed and diagnosed so you have a peanut and we think that one of the reasons why people start to have food allergies it's not genetic 70% to 80% of the time it's environmentally related it's not related to genes in the family so when a baby is born perhaps their skin is a little rough and a little dry and there might be microscopic holes in that skin and that happens a lot now a lot of children have dry skin and we can talk about that another time but with that little dry skin that means the cells then my two hands here are cells called epithelial cells they're skin cells that typically are connected and with a nice beautiful barrier but unfortunately the dry skin they kind of separate and our body doesn't know how to deal with this separation too well it thinks it's like a mosquito bite it's like wait what the heck's happening I have a little hole in there and so it reacts to these types of holes as if it was a mosquito bite so all of a sudden in the air you have dust that might contain hazelnut protein or in this case peanut protein and that comes settling in and it goes through this hole and our body has a very prehistoric way of dealing with this right back to those parasites so they it comes in by just passive um irration it drops down on the skin the body tries to pick it up and say and it tries to sense this just like

[00:42:06] I explained in terms of the immune system those macras are like what the heck is this is this good or bad and then it says wait this is bad this is not I'm not supposed to have food through my skin I'm supposed to have food through my gut so the cell takes it up and activates the allergic pathway because it thinks it's a parasite it thinks it's a mosquito bite so what happens is it takes it up and makes this molecule called IG from that B cell so the food gets taken up gets processed it teaches a t- cell to interact with that food antigen and then the B cell starts to make IG against that very same food antigen so the next time that baby eats that peanut even if it eats it through the gut that little IG molecule will have been made by the B Cel and it's sitting around in the blood and then it will bind to the peanut protein that the baby eats and when it does even though like I said before that IG is a very small percentage of the concentration of proteins in the blood it is such a potent molecule and what I call it it's the match that lights the fire behind allergies so you have this peanut that otherwise for you and me Peter we would be able to eat and we view it as nutritious but in a person with a already given allergic reaction to peanut that IG binds to the peanut and then this part of the IG molecule my arm that sets into another part of a cell as a receptor so it docks into the receptor after it binds to the peanut and then that receptor on the cell surface activates histamine release of the cell and that occurs within minutes so the histamine goes through the body and within six minutes causes swelling can cause mucus and that mucus can be in your lungs can be in your eyes can be in your nose and it also releases histamine that cell releases histamine and that histamine can cause itching on your skin it's very similar so what would happen if you got a mosquito bite you want to itch you want to get rid of that mosquito in the same way the body's trying to get rid of that food but unfortunately you've already eaten it it's already in your body and so you see these reactions via IG and they release histamines and in my mind it's a very skewed reaction the body's trying to do something that it was meant to do prehistorically but it doesn't help the person at all in fact the histamine becomes so high that it can cause sometimes death and within minutes if you already have asthma if you already have lung issues that mucus can become so strong that it clogs up your lungs and that's what often times can lead to those very rare fatal reactions or there's another chemical called brainin that is released by these cells once that receptor docks when the IG docks into the receptor once that receptor tells the cell to release it releases histamine and it releases something called brainin that's another bad actor chemical the brainen can affect our blood pressure system that can lead to dizziness and can lead to heart issues that's the second reason why people have fatal reactions so you can imagine when you take epinephrine through an injectable epinephrine device that helps both the lung clear the mucus and it helps the heart and the blood pressure stay strong so that you don't have one of these near fatal or fatal reactions but it all is linked to the immune system and how it reacts and it's a very fast reaction is my memory correct that the cell that's releasing the histamine is a massed cell am I remembering that good I was hoping you'd ask that so again you're seeing both sides of the story for the immune system the humoral response which is IG and now the cellular response so once that receptor gets docked into by the

[00:46:30] IG the cells that have that specific receptor on them are called mass cells they're also called eosinophils and for those of you sort of listening there's another type of disorder called eosinophilic disorders which you know that's a different type of food allergy but also related and then those mass cells exist in tissues but they're not in the blood eosinophils are in the blood the other third type of cell is called the basophil that's in the blood so this is such a potent system because it's got these cells ready to go in the tissues the mass cells mass cells are in the skin they're in the gut they're in the lung in the eyes in the nose and then you also have these other cells floating around the blood that are also secreting histamine and braine and they're like

[00:47:20] The Messengers across the whole system and then you have the mass cells embedded and the mass cells can live a very long sign time in tissues so these basophils and eosinophils are in the blood these mass cells can live a long time in the tissues and that's why someone's reactions can build up over time sometimes because every time they eat that food or have that allergen exposure their mass cells are going to remember because of the immunoglobulins that bind to them is the implication

[00:47:49] Carrie that each sucessive exposure gets worse um and and as a as a sort of followup to that question how often is a person's first brush with a food allergy a fatal one right excellent question so we're only as good as our data we're only as good as epidemiological studies as well so um typically and this is again typical there's always exceptions if you're if you learn about your allergies before the age of two those food allergic reactions are typically vomiting and hives they're not not typically related to lung and heart so babies for example although there are rare exceptions

[00:48:36] Toddlers and babies typically do not have fatal reactions to their first ingestion of food but there's a lot behind this so if you actually dissect out who dies and who doesn't die from a food allergy it's typically people that already have a heart problem already have a lung problem or didn't get to the EpiPen uh fast enough so it would seem logical like you're um inferring that with every dose that you take your reaction could get worse and worse with the same dose but it depends it depends for example if you're at elevation it depends if you already have a cold it depends if you have Arrow allergies and you're allergic to a dog and a dog came by you that week and you also ate a peanut so there there's a lot that changed that but yes in general if all things being equal each time you ate it your immune system would remember more and more and will boost up that response now luckily with therapy there's a way to retrain your immune system but that takes regular interaction with the food every day not every week if you take it every week it actually boosts your immune system to become more allergic take it every day so there's something to the Circadian rhythm and the dial C which we haven't talked about this yet but what I love about the immune system is it can be trained and you just need to know how to train it and you can train it away from becoming allergic and and train it into becoming more protective well I I absolutely want to focus on that because it's you know I think the most hopeful aspect of all of this but I want to kind of go back and understand more these environmental factors that are predisposing uh children and adults to these factors so you mentioned one which was dry skin again I I can only imagine after listening to this everyone is going to be lathering up themselves and their children and we're going to have the you know we're going to we're going to make L'Oreal or whoever makes nice skin lotion very very happy yeah um C can you say are there any other factors that that we've identified that seem to be predisposing people yeah um and there's some factors if they're lacking they also predispose people so people have talked about having good microbiome good dirt and that helps sort of decrease the likelihood of food allergies children who grow up on farms for example have uh a really good exposure to animals they tend not to have as many food allergies interestingly enough so I call that the dirt hypothesis um also growing up with a lot of animals like dogs also helps uh reduce the likelihood and that's probably due to the microbiome but importantly is vitamin D seems to also play a role so having enough vitamin D in your blood also decreases the risk of food allergies um being around too much detergent that's what I call the dry skin hypothesis unfortunately a lot of our clothing being washed in detergents our dishwashers having really potent concentrated deterence these days it's not getting rinsed away enough so that the skin and babies it heals so well but it is somewhat more sensitive than let's say adult skin and so because of that they tend to have dry skin due to all these other issues and let alone detergents but also anytime in life whether or not you're a child or a baby or or an adult if you have pollution or tobacco smoke that also causes dry skin and itchiness and not just the skin on the surface but also in your body so it's not the anything that touches the air has skin cells so that means our lungs that means our gut so all of the these features that I talked about can affect the skin and through we think that through the skin allergies can begin um it's not the only hypothesis we also think that it's really important to make sure that when you look at your overall diet that you diversify that diet really early and often so that if you can take certain proteins and feed that to your children when they're young and have that diversity in the diet that that can actually prevent the Advent of food allergies later on in life so we talked about dirt we talked about dogs we talked about detergents we talked about vitamin D and we talked about diversity in diet so I call that kind of the D's um but importantly that dry skin does seem to be a conduit by which food allergies start but what I didn't say was

[00:53:18] DNA and that's important because a lot of parents a lot of people will say oh my parents gave this to me or I'm I this is in my Gene so there's no way I can do anything about that and that's not true so there are certain allergies that can be passed on from one generation to the next but even those diseases if you change your behaviors that can also improve and decrease the likelihood of having food allergies so I hope that was helpful when people do listen I hope when they do try to improve their Skin Barrier if there is an emolient you can by try to stay away from the emons that are based with petroleum products or paraffin products or vasoline because what science has now shown us is that because those are not natural to the skin our skin doesn't really like wax or petroleum products or vas Vaseline is a petroleum product that tends to increase the bacteria on our skin and that can make overall the skin inflammation worse so try to choose products that have natural lipids that give the skin back what they're missing and and how how does one look for that on the label what what would be the signs of that great great question the natural lipids are like camide so I don't work for any companies I don't really know which companies have camide but I know one company Sera has s has camide in it so try to look for those um emons that actually replete the skin with what it is depleted from which are its natural lipids and then also try to rinse things now we are in a water shortage and we have to be careful too uh with not using too much water but if you can choose ecologically friendly detergents because eco-friendly detergents eco-friendly

[00:55:15] Foods tend to be better for our own bodies and I'd love to know your own opinion about that Peter but that's what I typically tell my patients try to avoid detergents that are not not eco-friendly because they're probably not so friendly to your body I wanted to ask one other question about this any relationship with breastfeeding you mentioned it earlier with respect to

[00:55:35] IGA uh does does a child who's breastfed or not breastfed do we see any difference in the incidence of food allergies yes it's a great question so there have been a lot of my colleagues in Europe that have tested this now because breastfeeding is now so much the standard that it's hard to do these studies now because the world Health

[00:55:56] Organization has recommended you know breastfeeding which is wonderful and that's really important to start feeding intense other types of foods between four to 6 months of age but in general breastfed infants do do better in terms of their overall gut health in terms of their overall health in general but it has not been shown definitively that by breastfeeding you can prevent food allergies but it is very helpful towards creating an overall healthy immune system so I in general tell all my families if you can breastfeed please do but the alterior unfortunately is that some children have it's very rare but they can have an allergy to a protein in the mom's breast milk so if your child does start to have issues with your breastfeeding go see a doctor and then see and make sure that they don't have an allergy to your own milk but that's very very rare and nowhere in that discussion of the DED did I hear um well

[00:56:58] I guess yeah you talked about diversity of diet but I want to talk specifically about the the the antigen right so what is the case for and against early exposure to nuts as a vehicle to prevent the um the onset of one of these allergies again I I think about the last 15 years I feel like I've heard pediatricians go in various directions on this at first it was and I think about this through the lens my kids right so it's like sometimes we were told absolutely don't let them see a nut don't don't have nuts in the house for the first two years to hey make sure they're eating nuts and peanut butter and and so so where are we today on that

[00:57:40] I agree Peter it's been confusing there's been a lot of flip-flopping and unfortunately there were well-meaning people 20 years ago that made guidelines based on not a lot of data I think that people were seeing there was an increase in food allergy throughout the world and that's probably due to many different things but that they reacted in a way to say oh we don't have enough science but we're really worried so let's just tell people to avoid those foods and hopefully that can prevent this epidemic from increasing and unfortunately the minute those guidelines came forward and it was also during the time that I was raising my kids um the minute those guidelines came forward you started seeing a hockey stick in the epid in the epidemic it actually started to increase in those countries that did not follow those guidelines it stayed flat so that's a that's a very telling case even though it's not a randomized intervention that says when you avoid

[00:58:40] Foods at a young age you paradoxically predisposed to the allergy exactly so let's talk about that right because we talked about the importance of guidelines I agree they're very important and often times guidelines are made by people that really think hard and they use the data that's at hand but we're only as good as our data so fast forward 20 years afterwards the world had different data the world said wait a minute we now think that through the skin allergies begin through the diet allergies can stay quiet we now know that the gut is really important for tolerizing to those antigens the the immune system in the gut is meant to tolerize the immune system in the skin in our lungs and in our skin skin is actually meant to be activated and react so when you think about that dry skin hypothesis of course it's going to be promotional of allergic

[00:59:37] Pathways but when you think about taking things through the gut it's going to be promotional of toleragenic Pathways so we learned a lot in the last 20 years so when the same people came together and wrote the guidelines 20 years afterwards they said wait a minute it's very clear now and many guidelines have changed

[00:59:53] Peter now to say we need to diversify y the diet we need to tell our country's population to start having children eat Foods in small amounts like tree nuts like fish like milk like egg like peanut and to be able to have that early and often and regularly so that we can try to prevent food allergies so that's the general Mantra the guidelines have now switched same thing for people who are pregnant it used to be thought women who are pregnant based on a very small study only 20 individuals but that was the only study that was available 20 years ago that those pregnant women should avoid peanuts and tree nuts but actually fast forward 20 years after there was a much bigger study done and that showed that definitively it's okay to have peanuts and tree nuts when you're pregnant it's actually healthier with

[01:00:48] Omega-3s of course people who already have food allergies shouldn't be eating these Foods when you're pregnant or if you're a child but in general enal it's a way to prevent food allergies now among many other things like we talked about but it does seem to be important and it goes back to those instrumental recipes of the immune system if you if the immune system can probe the antigen know that it's safe know that it's not going to harm the immune system or the body it then becomes tolerant but in order to give it that instruction sheet in order to give it that recipe you need to feed and you need to get exposed regularly and we think regularly means every day to every other day and you'd say well wait a minute why my my grandmother didn't have to feed me these Foods or my mother didn't have to feed me these Foods regularly what all of a sudden changed and we think that the environment is changing we know you know the environment is changing all around us unfortunately with different detergents with different emulsifiers with different chemicals in our food with different pollutants with different viruses it's changing so now we take the science and we have a better instruction sheet for patients and I'm grateful for that but it is all based on evidence do you think the genie ever gets back in the bottle do we ever get back to the levels we had 30 years ago or do you think that even if we can get dietary practices to where we were which is to say we're at a place where parents are encouraged to liberally uh and diversely

[01:02:20] You Know sample food for their kids these environmental issues uh that detergents the dryness of skin all those things the low vitamin D presumably because kids are playing outside less these days and they're you know indoors more and all of the things that we understand uh that it never quite gets back to the level it was when I was a kid like I got to tell you when I was a kid um Carrie I didn't know I did not know another child that had a food allergy okay so I'm all through all through grade school middle school high school there was not another child in my

[01:02:52] ZIP code that had a food allergy today my kids can't take nuts to school it's it's you can't have nuts on an airplane today so it's I can't tell how much of this is overreaction just sort of you know anyway so there's clearly a log fold change but I can't tell how much of it is is also just a disease of the brain you know if that makes sense no but you're right to ask that but and lots of epidemiologists have now tested it it's real I mean this is not just people thinking they have allerg and when you and I were growing up they didn't like this is real there were people very rarely that had a milk allergy P allergy but the allergists never really focused on them now the typical allergists and we have allergists that have worked in the community for 80 years right their offices have shifted from being offices where Aero allergens were what they took care of all the time to now it's food and that's not because someone thinks that they're alert to food this is a real diagnosed food out and I think your your question is a good one but I don't think we're ever going to get back to 30 years prior because we have different practices where we have different ways of processing food different environmental exposures we because this is mostly environment if I have identical twins born to the same mom and dad I can have one twin develop a food alergy and the other one doesn't and typically that's in adulthood and the one twin that develops a food allergy they're the ones that have been out in pollution more they've eaten not such a healthy diet they've lot of preservatives or they smoke uh and so or they eat a lot of fast food like it's so or they are under a lot of stress and they don't get a lot of sleep so genetics being equal exposures in early life being equal there are certain behaviors that now we're seeing are more associated with food allergy like air pollution and I don't think we'll ever go back but luckily science has helped us so that we know what to do now and how to change our Behavior so that we can try to prevent food allergies from worsening so let's now talk about the work that you've been kind of well I'd like you to put the context around your role I mean of course I think of you as pioneering this work I'm sure you'll uh elucidate us all with how many people are pioneering this work but but you you and I met like I said about a decade ago through a mutual patient of mine who at the time was being treated by you and uh you know quite frankly I was just sort of Blown Away at the fact that a person who once had an anaphylactic reaction to nuts was going through an immunotherapy based sensitization program with you at

[01:05:37] Stanford and then all of a sudden didn't have an anaphylactic reaction to nuts this was mindboggling to me and I'm forever in your debt for graciously hum you know letting me wander around your lab and sitting around chatting with me over coffee so um C can you give us a bit of a sense of you know what this revolution is about and and because it really is it's it's it's sort of hard to wrap our head around when you consider

[01:06:04] The lethality of these conditions right and um and we take this so seriously and and that particular family has been so engaged like so many other families that this is a disabling disease um my colleague Kim Yates you know has done so much work in this area as well as other families to be able to educate and organizations like fair and others have really moved the needle forward so when you think about food allergies it becomes in a child's mind or an adult's mind something they have to live with and it's not fun and um it can affect their social lives or quality of life so they come to the table often wanting to know what's the best therapy now and compared to when we started with your patient we have a lot more therapeutic options and that's always good in any field to have options especially for a patients so any of these decisions that

[01:06:57] I'll talk about today they're really personal they're really something that the doctor the healthc care provider should talk to the patient about and see what's the best for me but in general again getting back to that immune system getting back to the regular eating of foods so that you can start retraining it to tolerize to those foods to see them as natural and not unnatural this has been going on for about a hundred years and even though to us and to many others this is something new and we did work at Stanford but actually other work at other institutions in the country and other work in Europe had already been done so what I was doing is building upon other evidence and clinical trials that had been done and I worked very closely with the Food and Drug Administration the FDA because you don't want to do anything that's not safe and that you wouldn't want to do for your own children if they had the disease so with that in mind mind I learned a lot about the immune system what you do in immunotherapy at the very basic level is give the person back the very same thing that they're allergic to and this was done 100 years ago with dog allergies with cat allergies with grass allergies with mold allergies people would actually start to take these things but inject them so like a lot of your patients might have done allergy shots when they were little but those are ways that we've learned as immunologists that oh you can retrain the immune system you can train a body so that they are no longer allergic to cats for example but you need to keep taking those allergy shots in general so the same thing for food you don't want to give a food allergy shot because the food in and of itself is very potent and because it's a very specific IG mediated disease Foods if injected into you can be extremely dangerous so we don't give it via injection but just to be clear the the the allergy example um let's say it's cat you know dander or whatever is the shot giving you a little bit of that dander is it sensitizing to you a little bit and how frequently does the patient need that to to achieve a a symptom free existence exactly initially you need to take it like almost daily daily to a week and then once your body starts to build up that immune muscle you only need to take it about once a month but you will do that for life well some people do it for life some people do it for 5 years if you stop it after 5 years you have a 25% chance of regaining your allergy you have another 25% chance of having it just be less but there and then you have a 50% chance of having it be resolved for the rest of your life but you need to be on 5 years of immunotherapy depending upon the Aro allergy and we're talking environmental allergies yeah and is the reason that you can get away with doing that because it does not induce anaphylaxis in the way that the food does so it's just the severity of the IG

[01:10:02] Mass cell reaction exactly exactly and we still are trying to understand why that is why is grass allergy not as bad as peanut allergy um so people are still trying to figure that out like why is dog allergy not as bad as peanut allergy but given that it is for immunotherapy like we said you give small amounts of that specific allergen back to the patient whether or not it be a shot for environmental allergies or whether not it be orally for a food allergy you give it back in small amounts you start with a small spec that you can hardly see and then you increase that dose by 25% every two weeks but you're giving it every day and then you increase it step by step every two weeks you increase the dose but you're giving it daily and you want to do that in a doctor's office you want to be really careful about that so we did it in our clinical trials and over time you readjust the immune system now it takes a while right this person has had their allergy and it's been quite um severe for them so to retrain the embedded memory aspect of the immune system takes time and what happens over time in the immune system is those little te- cells start to be taught that oh wait a minute this antigen it seems okay I'm getting it every day boy I need to readjust myself I need to reframe frame my mindset and instead t- cells start to reframe their mindset you start creating another whole layer of memory T cells that become tolerant to that antigen and then they tell the they teach the B cell to forget making IG in fact we want you to make more IGA we want the B cell to make more IGG because that's protective and so that's what happens over time during the first year of immunotherapy you're slowly going up you're slowly readjusting and in our patient case that's exactly what happened that person was readjusting their immune system readjusting their immune muscle to then switch from an IG mediated bad reaction to instead creating protective molecules that could protect the patient against the allergy the IG can still be there but you have this huge amount of protective what I'm going to call blanket so that that IG doesn't have anywhere to go when it wants to bind to the receptor that blanket of imunoglobulin don't allow it to bind to the receptor we all have IG all of us do but some of it works and some of it doesn't in the case of the person with the anaphylactic reaction to peanuts do they ever go above the 05% IG concentration or is yeah and how high does it go just for comparison yeah good question so IG is typically specific you have to have an IG to a specific food to be able to have that reaction and yes typically some people with peanut allergies will be over that 0.5% or anyone with allergies their IG is higher and just so you know a virus can also increase IG not non specifically your body just starts making IG probably against the virus so it's a very prehistoric type of reaction but importantly Peter for every IG molecule we can make a 100 IGG molecules that protect against that IG molecule circulating and becoming potent and that's what's happening during the time of immunotherapy you're making a huge amount of IGG molecule to bind against that IG becoming what I call pathological so it's a ratio thing and just give me a sense of scale so on the very first cycle that first two week cycle what fraction of a peanut is being given in the capsule how how small is it

[01:14:15] I'm sure it's less than a single peanut obviously yeah it's about 1 1200th of a peanut2 200th you start very low and you go very slow because in the end you want to retrain that immune system but you don't want to activate it too much now during that retraining sometimes your muscles get sore right sometimes you will see some hives sometimes you will get a little itchy throat your body will have these little reactions but I call them simmering reactions but you do need to take it every day and then you start to see this switch from IG e to IGG and again the T cells are responsible for that many other cells are too but in general if you stop the therapy this beautiful pathway of

[01:15:07] Tolerance then starts to go back to the original pathway so it's it's really protection that it's very rare that a person completely flips and becomes nonallergic does that make sense it's really what you're doing in the immunotherapy is changing your threshold and creating more protection molecules around you and creating more protective cells around you and when does that switch flip typically yeah typically if you're on the typical immunotherapy regimen it flips at around 9 months to a year and again just to give people a context of the doses we're talking about someone comes in with an allergic reaction to peanuts for two weeks they're going to take a capsule that contains one twoth of a peanut if that goes according to plan they will increase that by 25% for another couple of weeks so a month into this thing they're still basically taking one/ two 200th of a peanut but you will continue to do that they will not hit the threshold of a full peanut by the end of the year they're really really micro doing this in the true sense of the word well you're super smart because you do the math but I in general we've worked it out thanks goodness to the science where we know the steps there are going to be certain steps of this where you don't have to increase by 25% so once you get up to about 40 to 60 milligram and that's only after a couple of weeks we start to go up those steps you start to skip and then you can go even higher double we can quadruple so that by the end of the year you are at about a peanut to two peanuts worth and that was done with science right there were dose finding studies there were maintenance finding studies and we do this for milk and egg and um and treut and peanuts all at the same time like that's the other thing because I told you a lot of people have more than one allergy we had to work this out scientifically to go low and slow but within reason so that we could eventually within a year make sure that that flip was happening in the immune system and make sure that by the end of the year if they didn't want to continue anymore we at least needed to get them up to an accidental ingestion of that food so we were very careful to design this and that's in essence why this needs to be a drug because all that science you can't do this at home all that science enables you to know when do

[01:17:30] I push the immune system to go quadruple when do I not and and what are you using are you looking at the IG IGG level are you simply doing this based on the absence of symptoms in the presence of the administration great question so thanks to a lot of pioneers who were in those trials including our patient we were taking blood every two months every 3 months we were using blood biomarkers to let let us know oh look at that the the cell immune system has started to switch oh look at that isn't that interesting the humoral immune system has switched so that's how we knew to change our protocol that's how we knew it shouldn't take 10 years to do this because there was this natural switching that was happening underneath in the blood so we use those markers to then readjust and recreate our regimen so that you could go low and slow in the beginning but then by about 3 months we knew that the muscles were starting to change so we could hike up the dose a little bit more by 6 months even more by year we knew we had it because by that time the immune system had switched but that took a lot of time and effort and blood draws from those original Pioneer patients to give us the science by which we could perfect this regimen it's not perfect yet but it's it's much better than where we were 10 years ago if at the end of a year you alluded to this a patient says look I can't handle coming in here every day to do this anymore I'm sort of done with this um is it on average safe to assume that they may never be able to just go out Willy Illy willy-nilly and eat nuts but if they accidentally ingest a nut here and there or there's you know you know dust from a nut in a food and you referred to as an accidental ingestion that they're going to be fine is that directionally try no you're absolutely right so at on one side we want to make sure that we reach the goals of the patient typically a patient wants to get up to Accidental level ingestion and with that uh and because of that we say okay we'll try to get up you up to 600 milligrams by the end of the time we also know that 600 milligrams is what the FDA also thinks is the appropriate threshold and so we're grateful for that knowledge across many other um communities and institutions so we try to get it up to 6 00 but you're right often times people say uh well you know I'm I'm done I I really don't want to have to do this every day can you please tell me if I could take my dose weekly or if I can take it every other day and what dose is safe enough for maintenance for example we try to get them up to two peanuts a day but sometimes they go off to college they don't want to have to take a nut every day but we tell them that you kind of have to because we don't know know what will happen if you stop and that's what we told them 5 years ago now we have some long-term followup now across many countries people are sharing data and saying what makes sense for patients can you predict who can stop therapy and who might not be able to stop therapy who can go down on their dose during long-term follow up and who might not be able to go down their dose so we're learning but in general it's much better to take about one nut or two nuts a day every day after you finish your therapy with a doctor and and just to be clear do they ever transition to the point where they can do this as outpatients on their own or do they always have to do this in a doctor's office yeah absolutely so after about a year even after 6 months if people get up to that one to two peanuts a day or you know hazelnuts or or glasses of milk you can say all right you're done now and you can go home and do this at home and then let me know how you're doing so yes after you've get to that threshold we definitely let you go home and that depends on the clinical trial though but nowadays in the clinic that's what we do are people undergoing this therapy outside of clinical trials yet so they are they are Peter and that's been going on for a while we were very careful to say that if you do decide to do it in an outside Clinic you know try to get your health insurance to approve we want to democratize this we don't want it to be only available to certain populations because everyone gets food allergy and it sees No Boundaries in terms of ethnicities or socioeconomic status and people that have especially people of color have a much higher rate of anaphylaxis unfortunately because of access to health care so that that that's a whole another topic for social determinance of Health but um yes there are clinics that are offering this and there are clinics for example latitude um in New York City and San Francisco now that offer specific Reg measurements that are based on science and evidence to be able to offer therapy so there are unique clinics out there that are specializing in food allergy Care to be able to help patients based on scientific methods what fraction of patients who continue this protocol get to the point where they completely shed the allergy alog together and at some point will go on to eat as many peanuts as they want awesome question I always like to start any conversation with the patient that you know this is possible some patients just want to be able to eat one to two peanuts for the rest of their life and just know that they're not going to have an ox ingestion they're willing to do that and they believe that is the word cure but for me as a doctor I kind of push the push my own standard a little bit higher like cure should be eating ad lib and not having to worry at all so in that definition of cure if you take the dose for at least 2 years you have a 20% chance of being in the Cure category 20% after stopping after 2 years after 5 years you have a 60% chance of being in the Cure category so time on dose matters as well and again it's all recalibrating re-educating the immune system and many people ask me well are there some people that are refractory and and you'll know that term because of people that are refractory to cancer therapy but in allergy there's no refractoriness per se if sometimes people have too much abdominal pain or they have too many hives or their asthma gets worse every time they have the dose that's where I'll say hey it might not be worth it you know this is this is just there's too many side effects here

[01:24:14] I this bothers you too much we try to decrease the dose so that we personalize it for them but some people just say this is too much now I really don't want to go through it so those people will stop doing it but in general if you stay with it you'll get the benefit from it what percentage of any of uh people going through the clinical trials required epinephrine during the administration of the immunotherapy right nowadays because we go so low and and slow it's a very rare percent so about 1 in 10,000 or in some clinical trials one in 100,000 it's rare so that's good and is there any um allergen that is not amenable to this type of therapy uh be it you know as you said you mentioned a few others right shrimp other fish non-sh shellfish um is there anything that we've uncovered that does not for which this therapy does not work right it's again back to that very uh Elemental nature of the immune system proteins any protein you can do this with with which is great very carefully if you're allergic to a protein which is what we're talking about today you can do this if you're uh there are very rare allergies where you're allergic to a sugar it's called alphal and we don't think you can do this type of regiment with alphal allergies because that's a sugar so with proteins the immune system has this very

[01:25:47] Elemental way of readjusting and recalibrating and become tolerant but with sugars it's a little different but luckily sugar mediated food allergy it's one of a kind it's called alphal and it's very rare um but it is occurring more in the Southeastern part of the United States because it's associated with a tick bite so that's another whole area uh maybe in the future Peter for you to look at but right now there is nothing that we have not been able to

[01:26:17] Des desensitize a patient to with food allergies that we've tried to um going back to sort of the environmental um allergy so you know here in Austin we have this thing called Cedar fever right so the cedar trees give off a ton of pollen and uh you know knock on wood unfortunately it hasn't Afflicted me but

[01:26:35] I know so many people here who for a period of gosh I think it's sort of December January or November December January where I mean they can't function without benad dril and zertek um I've asked around on behalf of friends to see if there are immunologists and allergists here that have an immunotherapy regimen and to my surprise nobody does would this be would this be an easy thing to address so cedar allergies are interesting because the cedar protein itself is something called a like it's a proteas sometimes so it can start to grade proteins it's a little weird but cedar allergies are very serious and yes there are people that have developed immunotherapy for Cedar so it's interesting that no one around there it's interesting that I can't find them in Austin but I have to I have to connect with you offline for this because I there are a lot of people here who I know would be interested in that yeah it's the same rubric you can desensitize to it although it takes a little bit you know a lot of care maybe that's why but importantly cedar allergies are something just like other tree allergies they're really to be cared for and they can um give you lots of mucus and Asthma so I hope that those individuals you take care of can get some benefit but immunotherapy so I called it proactive therapy and reactive therapy reactive therapy are all those antihistamines people need to take proactive therapy is the immunotherapy to readjust your immune system but you need both I want to now talk a little bit about uh air pollution just for a moment um tell folks what what's a pm2.5 and why should why should somebody care yeah you know 10 years ago I didn't really understand all of the PM 2.5 jargon either so I want to just make sure in all humility this is something that we all need to learn now every single one of us even if we're in a research station in

[01:28:29] Antarctica because air pollution unfortunately is rising um we need to know that there are no boundaries when Wildfire smoke happens in Australia it can circumnavigate the world within 4 days and pm2.5 is a way that we as a society have given a measure to air pollution but it's not everything in air pollution it's particulate matter it's the particles in air pollution that are 2.5 microns in size now you think well what in Heaven's name is that like 2.5 microns what does that mean to me well if you think of like a little red blood cell that's a micron so you think about particles that are basically about twice the size of a red blood cell and those are floating around in the air and why do they do that well that's because partially combusted fuel combusted fuel from our cars if you don't have an electric car combusted fuel from industry when it breaks up petroleum when it breaks up any kind of product wood fire as well little particles

[01:29:36] Escape into the air and those particles are not what you see as soot on your car they are not what you see as brown dust on your uh on on your house these are particles that are so small they continue to be air rated and they can float in the air around the whole world and they're so small that they can penetrate into our lungs and why do we care about that size the 2.5 microns that's because it can get through our lungs and into our blood and it's dangerous also because pm2.5 as a def as a defined measure of air pollution has about 200 different chemicals in it 200 and of those 200s some of those are what we call viol oranic compounds these are compounds that you smell when you smell like markers like xylene or in the old days moth balls napthalene so these are chemicals that are not good for the body they are from combusting fuel if anyone of your listeners is a chemist these are what we typically called six membered rings they're organic chemist sort of nightmares cuz they smell horrible and I didn't like them when I was doing organic chemistry when I was a student I don't like them now because now I know what they can really do to your body they can cause cancer they can increase asthma they can increase cardiovascular disease stroke and Wildfire smoke is even more potent as an air pollutant than pm2.5 we also measure pm2.5 from Wildfire smoke because Wildfire smoke basically is biomass burning but unfortunately wildfires aren't burning just trees anymore they're also burning commercial buildings so what goes up in Wildfire smoke compared to let's say just Diesel from the car which is bad enough but in addition with wildfires you're burning up your upholstery you're burning up your paint thinners you're burning up your detergents underneath your sink your shampoos that's all going up in the air and that's also measured as PM 2.5 because all those particles are so small they're also going into your lungs so with Wildfire smoke we also have to be super careful so for any person that's getting exposed to any PM 2.5 you can look on websites you can go look at air now you can go look at the Noah website and know in your region what air quality index you have that day if it's in the green zone great if it's in the yellow zone please start wearing a p a mask a 2. a basically a mask that you used to wear in Co because those masks are very important to reduce the risks of those exposures to your lungs especially for children and elderly patients so that's what pm2.5 means and I want people to really understand that it's measurable it means something biologically that's important it means something medically but it also can be measured by well-meaning agencies like the

[01:32:50] EPA like we use in California some something called Purple air and you can actually look on the web the purple air monitors can actually tell you what pm2.5 measurements are in the air not all countries have that we're lucky in the US that our US Agencies measure pm2.5 and a regular basis so that we can map that to our ZIP codes but I think all people need do you recommend that people yeah because there's a lot of uh

[01:33:18] PM 2.5 monitors that you can buy for your own home is it necessary or do you feel that if you are just looking at these databases you get a good enough sense because I can't tell which problem they're solving for are they basically trying to say you need to make sure you don't have particulate matter in your home because if you do by the way it might be that you have you know a leaking stove or I mean that would probably turn up as carbon monoxide or something else versus no you just need to know what the level is outdoors because that might be the day you choose not to do your 10 mile run if it's you know a a red day all all those things so first of all if you you know that you have to be outdoors and you're an immigrant Farm worker and you have to be out there for 8 hours no matter what and the air quality index is 100 like it was yesterday here in California and we had people out in the fields they should know that they should wear an n95 mask period an n95 will sufficiently prevent uh PM 2.5S from getting in not perfectly but at least it reduces the risk no mask completely reduces those small organic molecules those six member drinks from getting through the mask but at least it's better than nothing so typically that's what I'll say Al and

[01:34:32] I'll definitely say to my to my patients please don't exercise during any air quality index that's greater than let's say 50 cuz that can even though they might not feel it during the hour that they exercise outside it definitely affects their immune system there were studies done in uh in London for example where people would exercise out in streets that had a certain air quality index and in London you can actually do this because there's micro uh PM 2.5 measurements in hid Park versus in Broad

[01:35:01] Street so they did this research and they knew that even if people exercise out for 1 hour in Clean Air versus polluted air their immune system changed for a whole day based on that one hour of exercise so I would say be careful and yes indoor air is very important we our lives are spent indoors for more than 90% of them that means 90% of the time that we're on this planet we're spending it indoors that's typical for the average US citizen so having a purple air meditor indoors is actually helpful especially if you live in a place with lots of wildfire smoke or air pollution because you can't assume that your air pollution is being filtered appropriately and you can't assume that you're being protected cuz just because often times you can't smell this and you can't see it it it is so small that you need a special detection monitor to know if it's there now if you do have bad indoor air you can buy a MV filter you can buy a filter in your air conditioning your central air or you buy a standup filter to reduce the exposure so all these things are available to people and in certain

[01:36:17] States they are available freely for families that can't afford them so just to be clear let's say you you do this exercise you buy the purple filters you figure out that hey actually either hey I live in a in an area where there's enough pollution out doors and of course it's e easily able to get indoors through windows and doors um or just for whatever reason there's something in the house that's producing these compounds um option one is you just get stand up heer filters for the house but you're saying option two is there are certain filters you can put in your HVAC that will do the same thing and what are those called again they're called mve and they're mve they're MV 13 or higher don't buy a MV 7 or eight MV 13 reduces all of the major pm2.5 as well as pollins as well as other chemicals but you need to change them often because they're getting clogged up so if you can buy and it's not I don't work for purle air but you know you can buy any of these monitors that can monitor external outside air and indoor air and you can buy them and get to know the difference and how well you're you know it's good to ventilate your home so you don't want your home to also like you said be collecting its own toxins and that can happen if you have a gas stove for example so or a wood stove so yes in general knowing and measuring your pm2.5 is going to be helpful to your health because you can manage accordingly do do you have a sense cuz

[01:37:47] I've never been able to get a great answer to this question Carrie it's actually one of the reasons I did not include this in my book so wanted to include a section on air pollution in the book um and in the end I didn't for a couple of reasons but the the biggest reason was I couldn't get a really clear sense of the mortality impact um I couldn't I couldn't quantify it the way

[01:38:10] I could quantify it for you know smoking obesity and some of these other things so coupled with the fact that the book was already about 50% longer than anybody wanted it to be um but do do you have a sense of the magnitude of this and you know for example like what's the difference between again even quantifying the exposure is a little difficult it's not like a pack years of cigarettes where we can say 40 pack year history versus zero pack year history translates to this much difference in in outcome yeah actually now Peter you can so uh there was a recent the who just put a report out the aqli just put a report out from University goo I'll send it to you um I want to make make sure you have this because you have such a wide amazing opportunity to influence people through your bandwidth and Peter I I feel like you are in this incredible position to make this impact with others you are a trusted voice and because of that comes the privilege of being a trusted voice but also that accountability and responsibility of knowing all the science and so what I'll do is send you this report because it has now been put in to exactly those terms and it's more dangerous than tobacco smoke because it is so prolific and and I'll give you this report because in the first page um it it shares with you the context of how pollution has killed about 8 to 10 million people a year now and so and that's attributed directly to air pollution and what is the final common pathway is it majority through cardiovascular disease cancer where where do we think the the actual uh mortality comes from exactly uh especially in low to middle- income countries it's uh it's cardiovascular disease and lung disease in uh in quote unquote more westernized countries it's more associated with stroke long-term cardiovascular disease and cancer so I'll send you this I I'll get it for you Peter because it I I think it's important for you to know air pollution has now thanks to a lot of science that you can disaggregate what deaths are due to air pollution versus what deaths are due to tobacco smoke right because it's there's a multiplicity of effect here but now the epidemiologists really have the data right and you can sink your teeth into this data and know that it's accurate

[01:40:41] Well Carrie this is this is very interesting I know we were a little bit short on time today so I'll kind of just ask you one final question when you go back to that that child who died in the ICU the the child who was kind of your patient zero um you alluded to it but we never really got to it tell me why did the epip pen not work when that father asked you about that what what was uh what happened there they hadn't renewed the epip pen it had expired they hadn't gone to the doctor for at least 5 years and they assumed that their child had grown out of a milk allergy because that's what people told them would happen but they never got their IG retested they never went back to their allergist and so they still had the EpiPen that had been given to them 5 years prior and it had expired in addition it was for a different weight it was for epie Jr and he had gained and of course grown so if he were to even get an Epi that was not expired he should have gotten a different dose so it interlay all these aspects about the fact that you cannot know just what typically happens to a patient if that happens to you you need to actually go to a doctor and get your own set of data to figure out how to best manage your disease it also taught the lesson of you've got to keep updating your EpiPen and making sure that it's renewed and not using an expired chemical or of any expired drug and then lastly that as you grow you need a different dose wasn't there a big controversy a couple of years ago when a company that was selling epipens decided egregiously for no apparent reason other than just ious greed to Jack the prices up has that resolved and are epip pens now relatively inexpensive again that's right that company was my land and they were making epipens and that's why I called it injectable epidrin device because now there's a lot of them thank goodness or the FDA other agencies got involved and said okay this is not right you cannot keep charging that enormous amount of money and so then what we call generic epinephrine devices started to be made other companies started to hit the road there's other uh devices now that can be used called the avue so I think luckily now thanks to many Industries involved in this there's also potentially a nasal Epi that can be used so yes that company um was seen as providing methods that were not ideal at all and that was stopped thank goodness because no one should be charged that amount of money for a life-saving drug what were they charging for epipens oh was like 400 up to 600 for some of my patients so that luckily now is being covered by insurance but again third party payers also need to make sure that they can reimburse for these life-saving medications Well

[01:43:36] Carrie this is this is really interesting stuff I I think look I've learned a lot today certainly getting the differences in some of the Immunology here um also I think the the PM 2.5 story is something that I look forward to digging into a little bit more um especially as someone who does spend a lot of time outside maybe no more than 10% of the time like anybody else but it seems like I spend more time outside so I'd like I'd certainly like to be aware of that um anyway thank you very much for most of all your work um

[01:44:05] I've seen firsthand the impact it has had on people's lives and I know that there are probably a lot of people who are hearing about this for the very first time today there are people who are listening to us or watching us who know somebody who suffers from a devastating anaphylactic reaction who probably at this point in time are completely unaware that such a therapy exists I guess my final point is what would you suggest for those people someone listening or hearing this who is being blown away by what you're telling them where can they either find a clinical trial or find um a non-clinical trial provider who's able to to walk them down this pathway absolutely well first of all thank you Peter and thank you for your excellent questions as always I'm really excited to be on the show and and thank you for your curiosity and your and your care on this podcast for people that are learning about this newly um what's wonderful is you can get on your computer do a search on clinical trials.gov look under the category of food allergy and you can find out what clinical trial nearby you is actually ongoing for food allergy therapy and there's a lot more than there were just 5 years ago so that's good there's like 17 companies in the space now I'm really excited about the future there is a lot of Hope and promise within that hope and promise there are more clinics around the country as well that are specializing in food allergy I gave you one example of latitude but there are others as well and so with that in mind

[01:45:28] I would go to your healthc care provider ask them questions if you feel like they don't have time or they haven't really answered the questions in the way that you learned about today go online and find out those clinics that specialize in food allergy therapy and again not everyone fits with everyone so give it a test see if you like that structure and then you can try and I hope the best because that possibility is there that reality is there and I hope everyone tries to underg therapy Carrie thank you so much this was absolutely fascinating thank you thanks for your great questions
