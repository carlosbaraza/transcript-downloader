Nir Barzilai, Director of the Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, is back for his third appearance on The Drive. In this episode, Nir divulges insights into lifespan and healthspan through the lens of his extensive research on centenarians as well as the latest from the TAME trial (Targeting/Taming Aging with Metformin), a multi-center study investigating the concept that the multi-morbidities of aging can be delayed in humans. He discusses common gene variants found in centenarians, important pathways for longevity, and ultimately what we can learn from centenarians about extending lifespan while also trying to improve healthspan. Additionally, Nir goes into depth on metformin as a longevity tool for humans, including studies with positive and negative results. He discusses the impact metformin can have on exercise for both strength training and cardiovascular training, as well as future research facilitated by data from the TAME Trial. He also touches on epigenetic clocks and concludes with his take on the usefulness of NAD precursors as a potential gero-protective agent.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dr. Nir Barzilai:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on centenarian research, longevity genes, and potential geroprotective interventions. Dr. Barzilai discussed his extensive research on centenarians and their offspring, particularly focusing on genetic factors that contribute to exceptional longevity. The conversation also covered detailed discussion of metformin as a potential anti-aging drug and the TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) trial.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Centenarians have 5-6 "bad" genetic variants out of 15,000 possible variants, yet remain disease-free [15:00]
- 60% of centenarians have genes that impair growth hormone/IGF signaling pathway [45:00]
- High TSH levels (5-8 range) are common in long-lived individuals while maintaining normal thyroid hormones [1:05:00]
- Metformin's effects on longevity show 20-30% improvement across various studies [1:25:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Exercise and nutrition remain important for non-centenarians [2:10:00]
- Prevention of chronic disease should be ultra-primary, before any symptoms appear [1:55:00]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications discussed:
- Metformin: Detailed discussion of benefits and potential limitations [1:20:00]
- Rapamycin: Mentioned as one of the "three best drugs" along with metformin and statins [1:15:00]
- NAD precursors: Limited evidence for efficacy, concerns about bioavailability [2:15:00]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"The genetics of longevity in humans is exactly what we learned from animals - it's the insulin signaling pathway, it's the mTOR signaling pathway, it's the MAP kinase pathway." [1:45:00]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the optimal biomarkers for measuring biological age?
2. How does the sex difference in proteome stability affect longevity interventions?
3. What is the relationship between TSH levels and longevity in younger populations?

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia hey near it's great to have you back i was thinking about this when i was sort of preparing for the podcast today there's so much i want to cover today that i don't think it's actually going to be possible i'm pretty sure that we're going to talk as much as we talk today and i'm going to be saying to the team all right let's talk about when we're going to have nearback because there's really just too many things i want to go through so anyway thank you for making time and uh let's just uh get right into it so thanks peter it's uh i'm happy to come back but it's you who's coming to me every week and i'm so grateful for what you're doing for this field and for helping all of us catching this field of longevity that's going to come true very rapidly i hope i was thinking about the first place i wanted to start and there's really no good one place to start because we're there's just so much i want to talk about but let's start with centenarians you know you along with the dr pearls are probably two of the people who have spent the most time studying this very very unique subset of the population so i think everybody knows what a centenarian is someone who lives to be a hundred or more but there's so much nuance about what it is about these special people and then you know there's sort of the pop culture view of this which is people love to talk about all of the bad behaviors that centenarians engage in how much more they smoke how much less they exercise all how much whiskey they drink and all those things which which are really cute but when you study them scientifically and when you study their offspring scientifically as you've both done we learn a lot of things and if my interpretation of the literature is is at least partially correct it appears that genes play a significant role so genes don't seem to play a big role in people living to 70 versus 80 but boy when you start to talk about living to 90 versus 100 you know relative to 70 or 80. genes play a pretty big role so tell me a little bit about what we understand about the role that the parents play in determining the lifespan of offsprings right how how fortunate were these people to pick their parents let me just tackle one of the things you said that there's no much genetic impact in people between 70 and 80 and and it it's true if you compare the lifespan of fathers and sons okay or or or mothers and daughters or sons and and and let me tell you why it's problematic my grandfather got a heart attack when he was 68 and he died that's my grandfather my father got a heart attack at 68 and he had triple bypass and he died at 84. so the correlation between age of death in different cohorts is not much revealing but let me say it now differently let's say it's 20 okay let's say it's 20 if we understand this 20 percent understand it really we can use that in order to prevent the 80 of the environment well maybe another way to think about it near because that example is a great example which makes it very difficult over discrete generations to make comparison do we have twin data because it seems to me that if you had monozygotic twin data that would be the gold standard for looking at the discordance and concordance between the role of genes in separate environments right so let me tell you the problems with twins twins are usually born small for their gestational age in fact it's more true that one of the twins is small for their gestational age now i've been i've been doing studies with rats from before when you uh ligate the uterine artery and make them small they get diabetes which they never get at three months we know that twins or the people that the babies that are born small for age develop age-related disease very rapidly it's called the barker hypothesis right it's observation from holland in world war ii so and and we actually determined some of the epigenetic manifestation of what happens epigenetically when you do that so i don't think twins are the right model unless you understand that and account for that near this is super interesting can you tell me a little bit more about that i actually was not aware of the relationship between low birth weight and the epigenetic imprint of that on reduced lifespan and i assume health span or is it just lifespan it's mainly healthspan in humans that we know you know we know uh you know first thing that's obvious when when and when you have a a a small gestational age twin okay there's the ketchup growth of the small baby and those twins born in the the same day in few years one of them is an obese child and one is a normal child and as you know obesity drives aging very rapidly so that's one mechanism the imprinting the changes in imprinting of epigenetic i would say for now that it's more of a description than a mechanism there are many genes that are involved and i'm not aware of a recent paper that says you know this is what happens so let's get back to the broader question which is when an individual or when a cohort of individuals lives to 100 and we compare them with a cohort of individuals that lives to 80. what are the types of genes that seem to be offering protection to that group that lives to a hundred what is it that the centenarians have in a sort of polygenic sense that the rest of us schmucks don't have when we went to the centenarians we had three hypotheses that we had to take care of one is that it's all the environment okay it happens that they did exactly the right thing what the doctors tell us to do now the second and it's not true as you mentioned it's not true sixty percent of the men are smoking and thirty percent of the women fifty percent of them are overweight and obese and all that and not exercising and not vegetarians the second hypothesis is that they have perfect genome you know we we know that we have a lot of genotypes that are putting us at risk for variety of age-related disease so maybe one out of ten thousand you know doesn't have that and that's why they're flying in so gracefully so to be clear near part of that hypothesis is the absence of bad genes exactly necessarily the presence of good genes exactly that only the absence of of bad genes will allow them just to get without diseases yes i'll describe a very simple study that we've done it was sorry what i took you off your track but what was the third hypothesis the third hypothesis is that there are genes that slows their aging all right so so good genes so longevity basically yeah yeah yeah so it's right okay fair enough so as for the second hypothesis that they have what we call the perfect genome we took our first 44 centenarians and did the whole genome sequencing at the time huge expense but we only had those centenarians okay we don't have had a control but we had a great instrument we thought um it's called clinvar it's an accumulation of all the genes that have shown to be causing diseases the cl if you had a clean var var variant you're very likely to have a disease so we simply asked do our centenarians have any of those those variants and how many of those variants are there at the time there were fifteen thousand now there are many more so just to put that in perspective for the listener that i mean we have between 20 and 30 000 coding genes correct right but these are variants of how many genes well i don't remember how many genes are are in the variants but those are variants that were found to be compelling and by the way a lot of them are not that's another story but so let's keep it simple we had 15 000 variants and we asked doers 44 sentinels have variants and the answer was each centenarian had between five and six bed variants five and six out of fifteen 000 possible right and we didn't have a control so we don't know how many the average person had right but but think of it those centenarians each one have had five variants that will probably cause a disease and none of them had it and if you're asking are those variants important well we have two centenarians who have the apple e4 homozygosity that puts them [Music] at major risk one of the best genetic risks for alzheimer's that the textbook says they would be demented at 70 and dead at 80 and they are at hundred and not demented genes for parkinson's for cancers for other diseases so basically the centenarians don't have the perfect genome which left us with finding genes that not protective right that slows their aging are protectives even against genes that are thought at least as i'm saying it's probably not totally true thought to most probably cause a disease and tell me near approximately what year did you arrive at that conclusion this paper is more than 10 years old i think we had several papers since then confirming this and look like always they are there are some there is a decrease also in bad genotypes in centenarians some decrease but but really the majority of the study shows that it's not that it's not the perfect genome it's something else we've very easily eliminated hypothesis one which is centenarians live to 100 because of what they do their behaviors their environment you now make a very compelling case that it's not number two either it's not that they lack any disease driving genes so it is in fact this third hypothesis when did you actually demonstrate that that's that's obviously a much harder one to demonstrate because you probably have a far smaller library of disease disease-sparing variants as opposed to disease-causing variants so when did you start to arrive on what some of those variants were the story was interesting because remember we started the study in 1998 and there were other parts of the studies that i i didn't talk with you about but one of the things we had is we start to establish the phenotype and one of the phenotype that came up is high level of hdl cholesterol actually very high level of hdl cholesterol that was more obvious in the offspring of our centenarians even than our centenarians so we have offsprings that have hdl cholesterol 130 140 you know falls higher than it should be and and what we could do when we were when the methods were poor and we were poor we were going about genes that are involved in those phenotype and we actually got a very compelling data on two genotypes that seems to be functional important that are controlling lipid metabolism one of them was a ctp genotype and one it was an apoc3 genotypes and those genotypes increased from about eight to nine percent of the homozygosity in control to almost 20 in centenarians and it's not not only that look when you have people of all ages unrelated you can look at the trend of the genotypes if the genotype is killing you then as as you go closer to 80 90 and above those genotypes will decrease and if there are if there are a going up and by the way the slope that's going up is a very important statistical tool then there are very likely to be longevity genotypes and this is what what we found and it's so interesting it's it was our initial discovery and drug companies were at our doorsteps immediately because not because they're interested in aging but they said just a minute if we have if we make a good drug okay if the drug is really good it targets exactly that without side effects then we have already safety we have safety because those guys for 100 years had er in in though in both cases by the way the suppression of the expression of those genes it must be safe so let's develop the drug and isn't it amazing how big the graveyard is of ctep inhibitors yes and and and i don't totally understand it and i i listened to one of your podcasts yeah tom tom dayspring and i have discussed this in great detail uh i think a lot of it comes down to not understanding the biology of hdl i mean the biology of ldl is relatively straightforward the biology of hdl i think it's safe to say we don't understand at all i mean that would be putting it mildly and i think the challenge with the ctep inhibitors is they raised hdl cholesterol so in one in one sense they reproduced the phenotype in its most crude sense but you can think of it very simplistically i think which is how do you raise hdl cholesterol do you raise it by putting more cholesterol into hdl do you raise it by impairing hdl from conducting reverse cholesterol transport and getting rid of cholesterol right those are two very different approaches to raising hdl and when you look at the centenarians and examine their phenotype you don't really know what it is you would speculate that they have better hdl function but the reality of it is we have other phenotypes that exist in nature i'm not sure if you're aware of this but i've seen a number of papers that examine people with hdl cholesterol that's very elevated who have very advanced atherosclerosis and in fact the elevated level of hdl cholesterol they have suggests impaired hdl function and impaired reverse cholesterol transport and so i think that's that's probably the issue around why a lot of these drugs have failed and it obviously speaks to the humility with which all of us need to be able to examine these phenotypes and it's a clever way to go about doing it right the very clever thing is look for phenotypes that are different and work backwards to find genotypes right so let let me add uh two points to this this absolutely the trade-offs of this pathway are amazing on one hand you don't clear cholesterol on the other hand you have high hdl but it for me it's not about the hdl because all the particle size are significantly bigger so you could say it's all about high dense ldl right that's the phenotype that we're depicting uh so so i i think that i think this part is important the other thing that was really striking i told you about those two centenarians with apple e4 genotypes they both had very high hdl cholesterol and they were homozygous for ctp and so it is possible in fact the major phenotype for us of the hdl wasn't cardiovascular it was cognitive function and so when i'm saying cognitive function maybe we're talking about physiology you know we're thinking of this physiology from a heart perspective and maybe there's a physiology of that from a brain perspective that we don't totally understand and by the way i i did ask merck i said to merck do cognitive function okay and and they did but but the people they got to the study were between 50 and 70 years old so there's no results for that near did you have you might not know this off the top of your head but even offline i'd love to hear what you learned about the variants of clotho that those people had especially the ones who were homozygous for apoe4 you're probably aware but there are variants of clotho that seem to completely abrogate the effect of e4 meaning you take people with apoe4 either hetero or hetero or homozygous and if they have this particular variant of cloth o they they behave as though they are e3 this is so interesting so we we published on kloto and and clotto was the example of what we call a v-shape or a u-shaped genotype clotto basically killed seemed to kill 50 of our subjects by age 85 okay the genotype has disappeared by age 85. and all of a sudden after that at 1800 it was the same okay it was the same and our interpretation was that you know those centenarians were born with clutter but they were also born with longevity genes which made the the clutter not significant okay but another hypothesis is that the actual clutter that they had is a clutter that was protective in another mechanism so what about some of these other genes that have now come to light so foxo for example tell us a little bit about foxo how did you arrive at that what was the phenotype that tipped you in that direction or did you arrive at uh foxo through a pure genetic analysis well i didn't come up with fox so foxo came out from japan in okinawa and i'm using you in the very liberal sense near i'm i'm giving you and the field correct and me me is not only me right it's a big team and in fact you know the research now has changed very much the teams are really teams because you need to computational and the ai people and the doctors and the and the physiology so it's we um but but but let me let me start it uh differently because you know why did i start centenarians i started centenarians because because all of a sudden in the mid 90s it became apparent that you change just one gene in a nematode and they can leave ten times longer right by the way the gene was bugging me because it's the insulin receptor or the igf insulin receptor gene and the nematodes were insulin resistant and they also had abdominal obesity they accumulated fat in their intestinal cell it wasn't the right example but the concept was right and and and so i started the centenarians i told you about the first genes that uh that i saw and then i wrote a grant and you know most of the grants that i wrote ended up the hypothesis ended up being wrong though we found the right explanations mostly there was one grant that i wrote and i said i'm writing this hypothesis knowing it's wrong and that is that growth hormone igf singling pathway have anything to do with human longevity i said it's great you know we have the nematodes we have this and that but but this is wrong and i was totally wrong about it and i'm telling you the bottom line 60 of our centenarians have genes that impairs growth hormone igf singling pathway in including the foxo3a 60 it's the most common genotype it's not only genotypes by the way it's it's micro rna it's genotypes on the igf receptor it's deletions of the growth hormone receptor there's lots of ways to to get to this but this is very common and sorry just to double click on that a little bit near i think it's worth maybe giving people a little bit of a primer on the relationship between growth hormone and igf one and if you want we can talk about igf-bp3 right well we okay so the growth among igf-r i was trying to slide over there no no no i think this is important to the story so please expand so i i i said uh i said growth from on igf and and i'll stand by picking those two but for growth there are actually hundreds of genes okay there are hundreds of genes if you only if you only look at what determines height there's hundreds of genes that are determining heights but the growth hormone is the growth hormone pathway or the growth hormone signaling pathway that really comes from the pituitary controlled by the hypothalamus but comes from the pituitary and makes you grow when you need to grow and it has its own actions but also it has a specific action of binding to its receptor in liver and releasing the second important growth hormone which is called igf-1 it stands for insulin growth factor one and and so those are the hormones that we're talking about the advantage of igf-1 is that it's measurable growth hormone is measurable in provocation and in young people and not much in old people so igf is kind of the biomarker for this action igf itself is really complicated because there are five actually i hear that there are seven binding proteins and there's a lot of regulation in between but it's true to say that high i that levels of igf are really very good biomarkers even if you don't agree that they're causative for variety of of health outcomes i so so and and and i want to say another thing you know that in nature uh the the the dwarfs are doing better as far as longevity the the little dogs are doing better the ponies are looting are living longer and in animals everyone everyone that no matter how you interfere you're getting better longevity even the laronne dwarfs that have deletion of the growth hormone receptor we we don't know if they live longer but at least they have less age-related diseases like cancer or diabetes but they have more alcoholism and suicide and as you said it's not clear that they live any longer they just seem to be spared of some of the chronic diseases in exchange for others correct i'm always describing it that they're still unhappy to be short they drink they they cross the road and nobody sees them when they're drunk and they're being run over right it's not it's not natural but let me tell you a much more optimistic story about it we discovered and when i say we it's gillette zmon who was a fellow and then a faculty with us he's still involved he's now uh in israel but he we we looked at all the pathway and we discovered that our centenarians have deletion of exon 3 in the growth hormone receptor and gil came to me and showed also the trend okay and as i said the trend is important so the homozygosity was three percent in our population and twelve percent in centenarians okay and i said gil what's their what's their igf-1 level and he showed me it's significantly lower i said terrific what was their maximal height and he said that's the problem and he shows me they're significantly taller than the rest of the people two three inches taller wait the sentinel the people that had 10 the people that were heteroz homozygous were taller than the controls significantly taller and two to three inches is not subtle what was the relative z-score difference between them in igf i don't remember i'll get you the reference uh it was like a 20 decrease and what about their igf-binding proteins there is nothing special there no there's no major difference no okay but but you you're you're on the right track so so i said to gil what do you do with genetics first of all you need to do validation you know you're not ex the paper is not accepted without validation i said do validation so gil got three other studies uh from all over the world actually and all of them were showing the same thing the oldest old head [Music] false difference in their growth hormone in this deletion which was very compelling on its own but still why do they have lower igf-1 so we went to sorry just to be clear they had lower growth hormone they should have lower igf-1 you're saying but they were taller why they were taller sorry yes why they were taller yes yeah so hasey cohen who's who's the dean of the gerontology school at usc and one of my collaborator is a growth hormone expert and he took the cells and and by the way that's another thing that we have we have the lymphoblast of our centenarians so if you have a phenotype if you have a genotype you can actually look look at its action with lymphoblasts and it took this lymphoblast and he incubated them with and without growth hormone and something really interesting happened when they were not incubated with growth hormone the phosphorylation of this receptor the activity of this receptor was lower as as we thought it would be because they have deletion of an axon mm-hmm but when he incubated with growth hormone it was almost like an amplifying switch they were phosphorylated three times as much the same was with proliferation proliferation was lower and with growth hormone was increased so what we understood what we understood that happened although we don't understand this switch mechanism but when they go through puberty okay they're activating growth very sensitive they're sensitive they grow taller and once their growth hormone decreased after puberty they are tall but their igf stays low for the rest of their lives what fraction of centenarians share this genotype 12 20 12 12 okay i want to talk more about the genotypes and i want to come back to a question around this so hopefully i'll remember um so this is now another big major axis is the the the genotype cluster around gh we've already addressed the genotype cluster around ctep um let's talk about foxo let's talk about tshr let's talk about some of the others oh okay can i can i make a point because i don't want to forget it so you can edit wherever um we recently published a paper because because we didn't understand so well uh why the literature is called so confusing us with the growth from an igf we went to the uk biobank which has really changed our ability to validate and to learn and to get hypotheses and and they have 440 000 people who have actually igf-1 measurements and we looked at the young people that had that had high igf-1 level and we saw that for young people high igf-1 was protective from variety of age age-related diseases and and from mortality although not from cancer yeah i was just about to say it's a very complex relationship igf seems to protect from everything but cancer right right except that by the way i'll get to that i'll get to cancer in a second on the other hand people over the age of 60 it's exactly the opposite okay they had more of every age-related disease except cancer and they also had increase in mortality what i'm telling you now in other words sorry was that was that a linear relationship or was was totally linear totally linear relationship totally linear relationship what i'm describing to you is what we call the antagonistic pleotrophy hypothesis of aging okay the things that are good for you when you're young can turn against you when you're old or in this case yeah in order to do reproduction and to do evolution you need a lot of growth hormone to get there but after that you have to switch the energy because now you're going to have breakdown it doesn't make sense for you to expand growth in any any way and i think it was beautifully demonstrated and it also explained the confusion in the literature it depends if you looked at young people or old people or took care of that at all yeah although it's one thing that's confusing about the that pleotropic relationship is that the cutoff is quite old right so like if you really think about this just through kind of a dawkins lens you would think that that cutoff would be done by 25 or 30. you know at that point evolution is done with you like you've served your purpose now anything that you get after that is gravy and really not under the purview of evolution evolution sort of stopped caring about you unless you buy the argument and i think this is an argument that there's there's an evolutionary benefit to you being a caregiver beyond your reproductive capacity so so maybe there's something to be said for that but but are you surprised by how long we how late in life we see that switch flip you made this argument but by the way i would i would say i believe in the grandparent theory but still if you had your kid and died the next year the next day or survived for 100 more years i i think it's too late for evolution number one number two we show the most one of the most interesting thing that we show and it's true around the world people with longevity with exceptional longevity have less offspring from an evolutionary point of view you should be losing longevity genes in fact uh i wrote a paper one year by the way anybody with kids will immediately find that completely intuitive right that's just especially in cold times suck all the life out of you they're incredible i love them more than anything but i believe that they are indeed shortening my life on some level i i think there's or misses they'll come back and and you'll be more resilient it's okay but i actually wrote a paper saying you know when people in the old testament are quoting methuselah to be 969 and moses to be 120. maybe they were right maybe we had this capacity because we're losing longevity genes because of reproduction that's really interesting has there ever been a serious study about the biblical stories and if there's any way to assess any validity to some of the age-related claims that were made merely 2 000 years ago you know why it's problem because the people the orthodox people believe that every word in the bible is true exactly you ask them you ask them and i asked many believe me i asked many you think really that's happened no they didn't know how to count they're very skeptical that's why i wrote the paper that i'm not skeptical i think that's true i want to ask you another question about growth hormone it's a it's a hormone that that i've prescribed to patients when they're healing from injuries so i've seen pretty good literature um that says you know you're having you know you tear a bicep you have surgery to repair it growth hormone for eight weeks fosters rehabilitation uh better than if you did nothing so so that's the very narrow window in which i've prescribed growth hormone is typically around the healing from orthopedic injuries a couple things i'll say every patient i've prescribed it to and there hasn't been many maybe half a dozen over the last 10 years they all say i've never felt better which then helps me understand why this cottage industry of doctors out there exists who run longevity clinics prescribing growth hormone i've drawn a hard line in the sand with my patients that i don't believe in the literature that would suggest that prescribing growth hormone is a pro-longevity tool but if i'm being brutally honest and i tell them this as well i can't tell you that it's killing you either right like i i can come up with theoretical arguments why prescribing growth hormone is going to make you feel better but is going to shorten your life but i don't really see any data one way or the other and even when you look at extreme cases which are basically athletes who use you know growth hormone is the most abused drug in all of sports because we don't have a test for it um you'd think that the the more the morgue of athletes would be much bigger so what is your view on exogenous growth hormone uh as as a as a not necessarily a pro longevity tool but as an agent that clearly helps health span but might be not as destructive to lifespan as i believe it could be i think you're absolutely right look we're talking about chronic you know chronic environment okay and that has nothing to do with the fact that there could be indication for growth hormone you mentioned one there is a paper about growth hormone after strokes okay we were actually interested in growth hormone in the brain there are more examples like that so i don't think those are mutually exclusive right and i've all thought i've often wondered by the way i haven't seen the literature if you know of it i'd love to see it would growth hormone be protective in stages of early cognitive decline um but anyway putting that aside for a moment what about this idea of the 50 year old who goes to the longevity clinic and they're being given low doses of growth hormone every single day typically it's somewhere between point four and one milligram daily i'm not going to answer you about the dose but i'm i'm going to make the the thing that i think is very important and it's getting us back to this antagonistic biotrophy and it's relevant to tame and metformin it is possible that things that you're doing are good for you when you're young and against you when you're old right so when people are asking me on any of those gyro protectors gero therapeutics vitamins um what what when do we start them okay the answer is i really i really don't know i think i think you shouldn't get synolytics before you're 70 or 80 years old i think probably in forming although we start this study at 65 most of the study so far that showed really large effect of metformin are people were recruited above the age of 50 so i think it's 50. so i i don't know to tell you for a singular patient who chronologically chronological age is 50 and biological age i don't know what it is you can determine it better well what do i tell them i don't i don't really know based on literature based on clinical trials so last question on this near based on the number of people that are taking growth hormone out there and i don't know how you would quantify this but presumably it's not rocket science to figure it out but let's just say that there are hundreds of thousands of people in the united states alone who are taking growth hormone daily as part of a geroprotective regimen um why aren't they all dying prematurely we don't know that assuming that they're older well but we don't know that well it's true we don't know it but wouldn't we see a signal of it i think not because the people who are taking growth hormone are probably taking also metformin and exercising and doing other things yeah so fair fair point there's too many confounders yeah yeah it i mean again i my view is still and probably will remain for the foreseeable future that it is not a great geroprotective agent um because i do have these concerns but i re this is an example of something where i really wish we had data i want to tell you another thing that also is is a gray zone for me most of the negative effect of growth hormone igf in humans we see in females not in males actually in animals too in animals too so i'll describe two things um when we look at our centenarians that's done by sophia millman who's running the longevity studies now and she measured igf-1 in in all our our patients and she looked at our centenarian and our centenary so they're already hundred years old okay um is igf-1 level predicts their longevity and remember centenarians are likely to die 30 of them are going to die each year so so those with the lowest half of igf-1 lived twice as long as those with the highest level of igf-1 and that's females only or both sexes that's females only okay males we don't have you know the ratio of female male centenarians around the world is there 85 females for every 15 men we have better results because most a lot of the female centenarians have never got married you know nuns and other things going back to your problem with your kids right but we need people with offspring our studies based on on an offspring because the phenotype the phenotype you capture in offspring and not in centenarians in centenarians the phenotype is going down already okay those women also have better cognitive function and as far as muscle function it's not different in other words they are not paying i think a lot of our problem when we come from sports right we're trying to preserve muscle and i'm not sure that low igf is the best way to preserve muscle i think maybe it's making the muscle uh biology better but it's not making the muscle any better sorry just to be clear you're saying that the women in the bottom uh quartile say of igf are no more likely to be sarcopenic than the women with higher igf but they do tend to live longer and smarter and cognitively they have better cognitive function right yeah with male it's not there is a trend but it's not significant so i think that if you have male you know and that's my way out of that if you it's a lot of it is males that are taking it i haven't convinced myself in my study that it's not a major sex differences the sensitivity to growth hormone yeah i i i'm just reflecting on the few patients in my practice who do take growth hormone it is prescribed by other doctors i've made it clear that i'm not thrilled about it but they feel strongly about it and it's their choice i think it's an equal it's a very small number it's an equal mix of male and female and which again gets to a question that we are going to talk about today which is health span lifespan trade-offs so uh let's continue down this path of double-clicking on the centenarians and their bucket three genes that is to say they're good genes rather than their absence of bad genes are centenarians more likely to have apoe2 than non-centenarians which is the protective variant of that gene that's the most common general longevity genotypes that we have and apoe2 either an allele frequency or the homozygosity of apoe2 is the most validated longevity genotype that we have okay first of all it's the truth if you measure if you measure genotype it was hard for me to accept it and it's only recently that i convinced myself and the reason is that apple e2 genotype is also associated with diseases too it's not so simple and and i thought for a long time that uh what what we have actually we have a problem it is it's a saturn ascertainment bias that to our study we don't get people with apple e4 because they are demented and they are not getting to our study or to any study so that we increase the proportion of other genotypes but what convinced me is that it should have been equally distributed between apple e2 and apple e3 and it's not it's really an apple e2 a phenomenon and so i'm although i don't understand totally the mechanism i i'm convinced myself that there's something true in in this and that apple e2 by mechanism that i don't totally get is the longevity genotype presumably this is backtracking a little bit on something you said i'm guessing centenarians have less lpa genotype lpa genotype is really interesting it remember we talked about how we are losing clotto with age until we regain it yeah right we are losing lp a little lp lpa and regaining that now what what we've done is uh with compare computational biology the system biologists we interacted every one of those bad genotypes with a longevity genotype and actually the people with high the centenarians with high lp little a all have ctp they're homozygous for the ctp genotype so they have some protection to counter it and by the way they might be getting some benefit from lp little a there may be something that lpa because you have to think lpa is common right it's about 10 of the population so 10 of the population over expresses this thing 10 of the population has an elevated phenotype for lp little a and it's true that evolution wasn't selecting against atherosclerosis but there are arguments to be made that lp little a could have played a role in managing infections for example that this could have been a manner in which we fought oxidative stress so it it begs to you know at least question the idea do the centenarians who have it get some benefit from it while having genes that offset some of its negatives yeah but but you have to explain on a population base how all of a sudden at age 85 you switch and this genotype becomes protective you know yes you're selecting a lot yeah is it does that is that really necessary or is it just a denominator problem where at 85 you've really eliminated so much of the population that you're now concentrating the people who were never harmed from it so in those people they've never been harmed by the gene and now they are disproportionately rising to the surface because the population around them has has withered away so quickly right so those are the two explanations either what you just said or that they are protected by other longevity gene and it makes it irrelevant what is lp like although i don't think those are mutually exclusive i think the former is an explanation apparently i think that the latter is an explanation for the former it's the amplifier of it right it's what lets them get there in the first place is that using ctep as an example they happen to have a ctep uh you know mutation or a ctep variant that offers remarkable protection against atherosclerosis of which an interesting but kind of irrelevant phenotype is high hdl cholesterol and that's offsetting the damage of their lp little a and then eventually at some point when everybody else has died because of their lp little a they're still standing and they might even be getting some benefit from lp little a that everybody gets but it's in other people's cases it's so dwarfed by the damage of lp little a again total hypothesis or speculation but that it's a it's a it's plausible right it is okay tell me about tshr i've never found i've never understood that one fully so the thyroid story is interesting because we found a correlation between high tsh and longevity and when when i say as an endocrinologist near maybe give people the the two-minute story on what tsh is and how it functions you know i i promise to some of my you know my my sisters are listening to you and i promised i'm going to be so simple you won't need to call me again and ask me what did you mean and now i'm falling into it i know i i do i'm doing a bad job of this i'm sorry you're absolutely right so uh tsh is really the your control of thyroid function in the sense that if you become hypothyroid then this tsh this hormone from the pituitary will increase in order to get those thyroid hormones to be normal again and they might fail and then you'll be hypothyroid but there's an effort to get those thyroid out of your glands okay so that's tsa so when we see a high tsh in a normal person we ask the first question is their thyroid gland not making enough t4 and or converting enough of that t4 to the active hormone t3 which is the feedback loop that tells the pituitary how much tsh to make so so what you're saying is we see a higher amount of tsh in long-lived people suggesting and their children and their children so so maybe suggesting a subclinical or potentially a clinical degree of low thyroid function or hypothyroidism is that a safe summary correct and and i'll tell you our discovery has led to several papers and to change in the thyroid association recommendation of what to do with old people you know the endocrinologist or the thyroidologist who are looking for business so once tsh was above 10 and then they said you know it might be subclinical at seven and we went to five and now if you're three and and symptomatic which all we are always because we're tired uh you know so that's where the science came and we pointed out to the fact we did it in our study then we did it in a national study and we said you know you have to leave those older people because maybe this is a physiological way for them uh to be well and we don't need to increase them tell me how high you're seeing the tsh what is the difference when you age match them between secondary and five to eight okay so normally it's like until five yeah okay or even four point two on something yeah oh yeah and and changing baselines so yeah yeah there and and look their their thyroid hormones themselves are normal okay it's really only the tsh so normal free t4 normal free t3 but they walk around with a tsh of five to eight right now here's the kicker and this is where i'm hoping the offspring can help us do you know what their tsh would have been in their 30s and 40s would they have also had a tsh of five six or seven well i think that's why we have the offspring and i i don't have the answer for this yet but that's why we have the offspring because we want to see the effects of those longevity gene as they get old right and to see really what phenotype and what measurements are change throughout and i i don't have the answer but a lot of them do have high tsh when they're 60. so they're eu thyroid high tsh patients right right what's the hypothesis for that is this simply a biomarker of something else that is unrelated to thyroid function or does it suggest that these people live right on the edge of hypothyroidism without actually becoming clinically symptomatic and that there's something protective within running a lower rpm you know running running the engine a little bit lower a little bit slower right so so by the way the models the growth hormone deficiency models are also hypothyroid okay so uh it might be part of of the physiology of of what we're seeing anyhow have you looked at prolactin in these people and other pituitary hormones that tend to cluster tend to move with tsh we have prolactin i'm not sure i'm not sure that we looked at this age you know this tsh paper came years ago i i don't remember that we're doing anything it's a good it's a good question i i have two endocrinologists that are looking at our data and analyzing it and i'll be happy to come again or have them talk more about the endocrinology of those of those people but um so we we're we're we're just looking and and so i don't have association with others but the hypothesis was that uh that their metabolism is maybe slow and although they're compensating by higher tsh still their metabolism you know it's like insulin resistant you don't totally normalize the glucose although you have enough insulin for that that there's a metabolic over of metabolic advantages i'm i'm saying it like that because i don't know that it's true i don't really think that our data supports low metabolism necessarily um but but i i but but i do think as an endocrinologist that if an elderly person comes and by incidental finding has tsh between five and eight you don't have to go and treat it straight away has anyone done mendelian randomization on any of these clusters of genes and looked for because we haven't really established a causal relationship here have we in in these genes no uh we so we're doing we're trying to develop you know by the way peter you you just said another word that nobody knows right mendelian randomization okay sorry do you want to do you want to explain a mendelian randomization well i i would just i don't want to go long into that but because we have so much genetic data and by the way genetic data is disappointing because because they're not so predictive most of them you can find lots of genes for for obesity and you'll be lean for lipids and you'll have normal lipids right but we have lots of genotype and we try to integrate those genotypes in order to assess how much they are increasing the risk of us of getting a disease and usually it's not by much what we're trying to do we're trying to have an instrument that will do mendelian randomization to longevity okay so we can see what's your genotype that fits longevity more than anything else that's in evolution now but otherwise look i i have to tell you the reason the reason this is not good is very simple we're doing something so stupid in genetics we do lots of genotypes and we take each one of this genotype and we ask is this associated with obesity or diabetes or not and we found many things and in order to by the way to make them statistic significance without increasing their power much we just need to get hundred thousand more people in the study okay but we're not built with one genotype at a time we're built with numerous genotypes and what we've started doing lately and that's our latest nature paper was to say just a minute we're looking at the difference between centenarians and and people without longevity and we're going to take all those rare genotypes less than one percent okay because because to be centenarians 1 out of 10 000 so we need to find rare genotypes and and by the way there are 80 000 rare genotypes just in our population and then we take those genotype and put them in pathways and look at the enrichment of the pathways rather with a specific genotype and then we get really important information and by the way the important information that we got in the study in in the summary statement is that the genetics of longevity in humans is exactly what we learned from animals it's the insulin signaling pathway it's the mtor signaling pathway it's the map kinase pathway it's exactly the same genotype the distinct centenarians and other people and i think this is really very important for us because people have blamed us that our animal models are not you know animals models are not good yeah they're not good for diabetes they're not good for alzheimer's they're not good for other things but for aging actually our models are really good because it's so conserving evolution all our animals their skin their hair their skeletal their their get cancers they get diseases so this is the same but it's really the same pathways and the the first that comes out is the igf insulin signaling pathway yeah which as you said goes all the way back to c elegans right one of the simplest organisms we can study um all of this really points towards the importance of polygenic risk scores and you know when i talk to someone like richard isaacson who is so focused on understanding alzheimer's disease and richard and i work so closely on this because it's obviously one of the most important things we think about in our practice i think of the evolution that we have had in our thinking over the past five years in fact we're working on a paper now that's looking at this polygenic assessment of of risk in dementia you brought up earlier apo e4 obviously any listener to this podcast is no stranger to it we've spent so much time talking about it one of the things that i would say is ten years ago we thought that being homozygous for e4 so being in that roughly one percent of the population that has two copies of the e4 gene that was a death sentence as you noted earlier that's that's a person who's going to have alzheimer's disease by 60 and they're going to be dead by 70. it's there's no way out of that their their risk is deemed at about 20 fold that of the general population and then five years ago we looked at the data again and said you know it's still awful but it's not 20 times the risk of the e3 e3 it's 12 times the risk and then we look at the data again two years ago and you know it's still bad but it's it's maybe it's five times the risk and now we are looking at patients who have e4 e4 and they don't have not only do they not have alzheimer's disease more importantly they don't have any of the early signs of it based on really really advanced cognitive testing that that shows very subtle signs decades before and we're starting to look at other genes that are abrogating some of the effects of this and so now the focus has been less at looking at apoe4 and making a determination and it's looking at e4 plus tom 40 plus mitochondrial haplotype plus cloth though plus a whole bunch of genes and taking a polygenic approach to risk it seems to me that this would be the most logical way to do [Music] the same thing with respect to longevity right i mean i think this is true with cardiovascular disease lpa is part of the story but you know it's not the whole story right absolutely absolutely you're right i really i really don't have you described the problem and the the solution absolutely right i i would just tell you that in uh in in looking for those longevity genes that we just published 12 of them are associated we're funded for that but they're associated with resiliency uh to alzheimer's and i think that um not enough of the genetics is explaining not only the genetics but the resiliency or looking at the genetics of resiliency which is what we're calling longevity in this case but the resiliency to diseases which happens to diseases that you get in young age too not every genotype causes this disease so i i think you're right would you put foxo in that category as kind of a general resilience gene that is less disease specific and more broadly protective yeah i i actually count the fox o3a as a in the insulin signaling pathway and the insulin igf singling pathway we we can argue about it but that's that's my bucket what are the genes that you would put in the general resilience pathway not necessarily a disease specific or uh or system specific as in the endocrine system we have 750 centenarians in our study now they are all ashkenazi jews and there are ashkenazi jews why is that not because religious is important but because ashkenazi jews are a genetically homogeneous they went through a bottleneck an expansion and then a bottleneck and and very few survived and they lived in isolation and intermarriage and their genetic pool is much more homogeneous in fact we can measure it it's gene it's it's um it's genotype specific but we need between 20 and 50 less times between 20 and 50 times less people in order to get the same data so think about about it that not 750 but few thousands but it's still not enough to find all longevity genes and one of the things that we realize is that there are 50 ways to live your lover there are 50 ways probably to get to longevity uh it's possible there's only one person who's 150 years old somewhere and if we knew his genotype he will solve the problem for anyone and the genotypes we are discovering are things like that we we have 20 genotypes in centenarians and one in control okay but those for geneticists who are dealing with 400 000 people in study they say well in 750 centenarians this can change any minute okay so what can we do well what we can do is look at the function of those genotypes and you know our friend yushin su that's that's what she's doing with our studies she takes those discoveries and either takes the lymphoblast of our patient or she does construct and express those genes in cells and see how resilient they are to to injury so there are a lot of genes and the i think the biggest news for me now is that a american federation of aging research has has gotten contribution from a a single guy 2.8 million dollars to recruit 10 000 centenarians across the united states and their offspring and control and i think that this will give us such an acceleration of understanding longevity and such an acceleration of getting drugs that have a probably are likely to work and also things that we don't know yet like who knows some of the things that we discovered are in pathways that we're not they're they're not uh in our longevity lexicons near that's interesting only 2.8 million dollars is required to recruit 10 000 centenarians plus their offsprings plus appropriate controls well well let's see let's see where we get that seems like a very high roi for that donor we hired two companies who have approaches and actually there's a preliminary data a preliminary study to see what's the best way to approach these people because it's all going to be basically web based so we need their children and grandchildren and we're going to send them a swab so that they can do it with help and we'll get the swab at least as the first on the first pass and be able to rapidly do the the genetics and post it by the way just immediately post it so people can start looking at it and making sense of the data and you're going to do whole genome sequence or exome both we're going to do mainly exome sequencing and maybe switch as the whole genome sequencing price comes down which is what's the current price of whole exome uh i don't i don't totally remember that the the reason i don't remember is that our we were our genotypes was done by a regenerone and they paid for that so i don't remember how much it is now so let's talk about a thought experiment you mentioned something earlier which is what made me think of this right so you said there's somebody out there maybe who's going to be 150 years old one person that will concentrate all of these genes in perfection and they'll get to be 150 and if we could look at that person's genes we might have an answer i would push back and say or not right it might be that we're discounting the stochastic nature of this and even if you found that 150 year old person and even if you identified which genes played a role the likelihood that you'll identify which environmental factors turned on those genes or amplified some and attenuated others seems very low so it begs this thought experiment right if you took 10 000 identical people with whatever program you have of the perfect genotype so this is 10 000 people that have as many of the good genes as possible and as none of the bad genes we put them in a time capsule and we let them live their lives but now we randomize them to i'm making this up but three groups right one group is the base case go and live a normal life one group is the do everything bad that you possibly can so i want you to start smoking when you're 15 i want you drinking three drinks a day never exercise uh you're only allowed to eat at mcdonald's oh wait you go and then the the third group becomes the do everything right you know we're gonna exercise we're gonna we you know we do the opposite give me your prediction of how long each of those three groups lives so peter i was trying to do things simple and you complicate me again and i'm taking back first of all when i said 150 human i i think the maximal of our of human lifespan as a specie for us is about 115 years even if we argue even if there's 122 somewhere okay and so so uh and and so i'm i'm not sure so this and and we die before the age of 80. so we're we're talking about 35 years that we can realize it's a lot of years we should realize that but i think aging will improve by other methods and mechanism that can break eventually this 115 years and maybe get us to 150. the experiment they experimented you know when people are asking me when will we leave 150 i said oh in 150 years because even if we start the experiment now it'll take 150 years to get there right we wouldn't know uh so so of course this experiment i i don't know what i'll tell you what i'm getting at in the experiment i want to understand how in the perfect genetic uh makeup how much can environment hurt or better what is already a genetic lottery i i totally understand and i i would take you back to the uh and i meant to ask you that when you described that apple e4 was a 20-fold risk and became smaller and smaller well became smaller at whom and how their lives were different than those that we knew 20 and 40 years ago that have the apoe4 genotype right yes it gets back to the point you raised about your grandfather versus your father versus you right the environment both in what we do both in medical treatment in surgery and all all those things absolutely and and so you're right uh we we think that there are muster switch to longevity and some of them we're doing with exercise and and and food right so you don't really have a sense of how much longer the group three could live than the group one when you basically put amazing genes in everybody yeah i i you know it's not it's it's not the things that i'm doing predictions on no it's just it's it's interesting to me because where i'm really going at a macro level is most people don't have these genes so the only interesting question is the contrapositive of that which is once you have a sense of what that could be now for the rest of us the 900 990 of us who don't have centenarian genes how much does environment make a difference and i know the answer is significant but i'm curious as to how much you think it is for me it's more you know some centenarians are coming to me and said okay what can you do for me and i'm like you're it i don't do anything for you so so so for me the question if those centenarians are willing and i'm starting to exercise them and to change their diet am i going to kill them or or or or help them and i i really i that's how i'm thinking about it and i don't know the answer fair enough so thomas pearls has written quite a bit about this idea of dividing centenarians into buckets uh i think we have the escapers the delayers and the survivors are you familiar with that terminology yeah yeah of of course but you know uh i'll tell you two things about it first of all tom pearls and paolo sebastiani are did terrific job and we're collaborating a lot and and and they've been great and i i don't hear uh tom talking about it because this is the point uh some people average life expectancy is 80 right some people are going to be 81 80 to 83 it's not that 100 years old is any special you're picking at one time people who actually aged before or will age later and what we've done together to kind of overcome that is and and that's very important thing we looked at our data in both studies and harmonized them and asked what is the health span of of centenarians versus by the way cohort that lives now it's not their cohort their cohort died before that's right and the answer is that it's not only that they live long they get variety of age-related disease 20 30 years later the people the people there our control group by age between 60 and 80 accumulate lots of diseases at 80 only 10 of them don't have a disease in our centenarians at after the age of 100 30 don't have a disease and are not treated with anything but but there's a 20 30 years of health spend this is not really the important part the important part that it's the end of their life they get sick and die some of them don't wake up in the morning okay but they have such a compression of morbidity they are sick for months at the end of their life unlike us that are sick for years at the end of our lives and i think this is uh this is really the boundaries and so first of all there is an example there's the example of humans that can live healthy and long and have contraction of morbidity and for me it really says it's not that they didn't get older of course they got older but at some point they had great life they have great health and at some point they're checking out much quicker without diseases at the end of their lives and this is what we're trying to imitate i completely agree although i'll throw a wrinkle into it near which is could it be that um you know the average person has their first heart attack at 70 languishes with congestive heart failure for five years and dies at 75. the centenarian has their first heart attack at 101 and you know they die six months later could it be that the reason that the first guy languished for five years is he really technically had more resilience given that he was 25 years younger and if so you can now do a very grim thought experiment which is we could easily replicate the health span we could easily replicate the contraction of morbidity and non-centenarians with a rule that says the moment you get a disease you get a pillow over the head right the moment you get your first heart attack we're not gonna cath you we're gonna kill you right i mean i get a thought experiment please let's be clear but you would you would immediately square everybody's longevity curve for the most part you would contract that period of morbidity to replicate that of the centenarians but you would dramatically truncate lifespan as well now and now you would even widen the gap between the non-centenarian and the centenarian so in my mind it's been it's very difficult to disentangle the the the objective for someone like me which is i do want to lengthen lifespan i do want to delay the onset of chronic disease and i want to compress the period of morbidity not by having you die quicker but by having you live better longer if that makes sense absolutely uh it makes sense peter and um of course your your point is very important but it's like it's like the a podcast last week on the on the covid you had a scientist and the advocates right that's how you call them the scientists and advocates which by the way our mutual friend david allison that's i he was really the one who i think made me first realize we need to talk about these two things totally separately right absolutely true and and and what you did you really stopped me from being advocate because you're absolutely right i think that the reason that centenarians are dying so fast is because they're already frail they are aging and so they are less resilient but on the other hand without diseases i mean some of them are working as hedge fund managers until 107. some of them are painting as long as they have no pain and mobility their life is good not like when they were 20 but their life is good so i i totally agree but as an advocate i wanted to hide that peter i didn't want to but but but you're right why why they are dying but you know what i think it's still important for people and i think this concept is probably true if you prevent aging and age-related disease you're going to compress morbidity too one of the biggest challenges i have with health span is i don't think that that we have great ways of describing this in medicine i think there's several issues with it the first is um our definitions i think are not wonderful right we talk about freedom from disability and disease but that doesn't really capture it i can tell you a lot of people who don't qualify for having disability or disease but their health span is still poor and by the way this gets this completely excludes a very important element of health span which i think is emotional health so let's put that aside because it's not particularly age dependent and it's it's outside of the purview what we're talking about today but if you just limit it to physical and cognitive in fact if you just limit it to physical right you can you can have people who can still carry on activities of daily living but one of them has a vo2 max of 50 mils per minute per gig and the other is 30 mils per minute per gig by the way neither of those people would ever qualify as disabled because whether you're at 30 or 50 in vo2 max you can still do any activity of daily living but one of those people can clearly get more out of life right you can take someone who can you know has the grip strength to hang on to a bar for 30 seconds versus hang on to a bar for two minutes both of those people will see no immediate difference in their day-to-day activities but one person can do far more should they choose to you know one person can sit on the floor for half an hour and play with kids and feel nothing another person their back will ache for the rest of the day neither of those people are debilitated or disabled and therefore health by health span you know by traditional health span metrics they're both equal but they're nowhere near equal and so that's problem one that i have with the way we as a community talk about health span the second thing is nothing that you or i learned in our medical training even remotely prepares us for how to help people be truly stronger late in life it just it just wasn't part of our training right like there's nothing about that so um it i guess my point here is it's hard for me to really interpret the data and get at something i'm very interested in which is do centenarians truly have better health span or are they just dying later and you know for the most part they have this period of compressed morbidity so it looks like they have better health span but do we really know that i mean i think they do based on the literature like i think a 90 year old who will become a centenarian is functioning more like a 70 year old who will not um but it's still very difficult to quantify i don't think we have great metrics here do you disagree with me no i i don't think that healthspin is well defined um definitely but there so there so there are two comments that i will make um for the nih right back to tame uh for them what is aging is if we can prevent diseases that's their measurements right which which uh which which which is not satisfying not to geriatrician and not to physician okay but that's how you get drug approved for the economist there are two issues one is uh what we're counting as the the cost of medical cost the medical cost of the last two years of life by the way in centenarians the cdcs data in centenarians the the last two years life are third the cost in 100 years old than in when you die in 70. okay well that is fascinating i mean to me that is something that speaks to what we're really aspiring to and actually that statistic capture captures much more about the quality of a person's life right but but the david sorry andrew scott had a paper in nature i think i'm sorry yes he sent it to me and he describes an economical term that's called the value and by the way it's very hard if you want to know more about this paper we should talk it's it i had to sit with him in order to understand what he was saying but basically saying hey if you increase the health spin of someone it's not only medical costs because this guy is going to travel and spend money traveling and buy gadgets and buy houses for his kids you know it's going to be their value of the person life is going to be increased and all of a sudden and some of those people by the way are going to still work exactly right they're not just playing golf right so the economical value is is is is huge so you can do it economically and the third thing i wanted to tell you is this story about the real story about this 102 year old guy that i met and i'm sitting and talking with him and he's the nicest guy i've ever met okay he's so considerate he's so he's thinking about life in such a nice way um nothing bad about his daughter-in-law right and and so i'm spending time with him i'm going out of the room and i'm bumping into his son who's 80 years old right yeah and i'm telling this 80 years old what i'm telling you you know your father is just the nicest guy i've ever met so he looks in my eyes and says you should have been seen the son of a when he was my age he was a terrible terrible person okay so then i realized and you'll see why it's connected to what you just told me then i realized that because we wrote paper about the personality of centenarians and you have to be positive and stuff like that but apparently he became positive only when he was already years old not when he was 80 years old and and then then you see papers like in university of pennsylvania they took two groups of people young and old people and show them bed slides you know cockroaches in pizza and good slides like islands in the caribbean and they ask them to repeat what they've seen and the young people knew remembered a lot from both bad and good the old people remember less but mainly the good things okay so i'm waiting for this part in my physiology that i remember only the good thing but what i'm what i'm telling you is that think of the complexity now right because your brain age you also retired you lost your spouse you moved from independence or you moved to somewhere else you moved several times you get to 100 years old so so apparently there's changes not only in your environment but in your physiology where life can still look good to you is this wrong actually that's such an interesting point near i know you mentioned already that a number of the centenarians in your cohort were not married um what fraction were married no my centenarians have to have offspring oh okay so all of them were at least had at least at a party at least married for a while okay and then what fraction of them have lost their spouse a lot of them a lot of most of them most of them we do have and sorry one other question here what fraction of them have also lost children also a lot of them you know this gets to something very interesting um someone asked me once at a dinner party uh if you could wave a magic wand how long would you want to live and i said not that long truthfully because unless i could wave that magic wand for the people around me i think it would be an awful life i think could you imagine if i waved a wand and said near you have immortality and not just immortality i'm gonna let you preserve your quality of life today so as smart and healthy and able as you are now i'm gonna let you do this for the next 500 years i would view that as an awful curse think of you know you'd have to watch your wife die you'd have to watch your children die your grandchildren die sure you could remarry and do it all over again but then they're going to die so so you know that's a that's a silly thought experiment but i also think it gets to something i've never really considered with respect to actual centenarians which is the price of being a centenarian is giving up and losing most of your friends right how many funerals do you go to the most common thing that centenarian tells me the the thing that underline their age is when their the children of their friends were long gone the children of their friends started to die that's for them kind of what's going on we're losing now the second generation you know what's coming next yeah you're you're absolutely right i'm i'm thinking about it for immortalist right so immortalists they have 12 billion years we don't know but one of the estimates 12 billion years for this planet i'm a little tired from some of the now really 12 million years january 6th i don't know you know wars and stuff it's true but what i try to tell you in a different words is that those centenarians have been adopting not only because what got them to be centenarians but because of physiology of aging that allowed them to harbor and and maybe to put in compartments uh lots of their stuff yeah lots of grief and it's not that you come to centenarians and they want to tell you first of all about the spouse that they lost that's not how they are talking to you they're talking to you about where they went and what they do and they're going to a concert and their their grandchild is coming to visit them you at least the centenary you know it's the centenarians in my study right so it's not always looking at net net i think living to 100 with preserved health span would be a wonderful thing and even if it meant you lost a spouse a child it it means you probably have three generations of people you know one of the questions i i love asking my patients is um how many of your great grandparents can you name so we all have eight great grandparents and i say tell me the names of them i've only had one patient who could tell me two of them most people can't tell me a thing about one i can't i i didn't even meet two of my grandparents they died you know so young um so if you think about that for a moment and the reason i ask my patients this by the way has nothing to do with living longer it's more about living better it's basically it's a way to remind everyone myself included that we're not that important like no matter i mean like my point being is my great-grandchildren will never know who i am uh maybe in the age where they have video they'll see a video of me or something but like i'm not gonna be an important part of their life meaning the only people who i matter to are very narrow and close to me now so let's not lose sight of that um but these centenarians have a gift right which is their great grandchildren will know them and when you use this example when you can go to concerts with your great grandchildren that's amazing when you could take a vacation with your great grandchild and and and you're not only able to give them money for college but you go to their graduation think about the implication of how much of their life you've been a part of so the flip side of everything i just said is i've never really met somebody who's dying at the age of 75 and that's a phenotype i've seen an awful lot in my training who didn't wish to have another year of life it could if it could be had at a higher quality which now brings this whole discussion full circle nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine out of ten thousand of us will not live to a hundred directionally speaking but if we want to live an extra year or five years what is the most important lesson we can take away from the centenarian that we can actually do something about i want to start with what you mentioned before one of my darkest day in research when jay leno in the tonight show said you know there's those people at einstein and they said the secret for longevity is don't exercise don't uh you know be obese don't do and you know what he said if you die you don't care anyhow right and and that was the wrong lesson from the centenarian study if you if you're going to be centenarian maybe it's not important by the way it could be important for centenarians right i mean this woman that i have that smoked for 90 years and died at 110 i just wonder wouldn't she be the next madame clement without smoking um so the the lesson for most of us is still right exercise and nutrition whatever it means to everyone and everything else that you give right that's that's the lesson and it's not the lesson from centenarians the lesson from centenarians is that there are a longevity genes that could be translated into drugs and i believe that they could afford a years of health spin however we want to define that um and and and and and that's really what i'm trying to to say that is a not an emotional part but but a clinical part would you agree with my takeaway from this cohort which is this because the single most important lesson i gleaned from everything we've said and in addition to lots that we haven't said that you and i have talked about elsewhere or that my own work has you know pointed me to based on my study of this problem their superpower is simply delaying the onset of bad things like bad things just happen to them 20 to 25 years later so it's not that they don't get heart attacks they just don't get them when they're 65. it's not that they don't get cancer they just don't get it when they're 60. it's not that they don't even get dementia they just don't get it when they're 75. and when the last time i looked at the distribution of death for centenarians it was shockingly similar to that of non-centenarians with a couple of differences they tended to have a little more atherosclerosis a little more heart attacks a little less alzheimer's disease and i think a little bit more pneumonia but directionally they had the same actuarial table of death as people dying in their 80s it was just a time shift in fact i i i reviewed the paper from germany where they looked at pathology okay it's a pathological they looked at a thousand centenarians that over the years died in their homes and they're right because in the hospitals we kill them in other ways died in their homes versus thousand i'm not sure about the numbers of of other people that died at their homes and basically the paper was funny because the the title was like there's nothing special about the centenarians they're dying for the same thing but 30 years later okay they missed the point it was like a negative study but you're right you're right they're kind of dying from the same thing much later much later on so it's you you can look at it about what you said the resiliency that got them there the resiliency for anything that detect them to get them there or the fact that their aging was slow and so what's the takeaway for us to me the takeaway for us as physicians or people who want to have an extra five years of life or 10 years of life even if we can't have an extra 20 is nothing matters more than prevention of chronic disease and by the way you don't get to prevent it once you have your heart attack secondary prevention is not prevention we're talking ultra ultra ultra primary prevention and if health span is something that the medical system hasn't been poised to teach ultra primary prevention is also something that we haven't really been prepared to teach so um okay let's pivot to another topic that we visited last time but i think so much has happened in the interim which is metformin i probably get an equal number of questions near about the following three things so uh the frequency of this would be several times a week a patient or a friend is asking me about metformin rapamycin or some combination of nr nad or nmn somehow those three things seem to rise to the level of everybody's curiosity when it comes to giro protection let's talk a little bit about all of them but let's focus on metformin so for folks coming to this who have heard of metformin because i think at this point many people have but don't know much more than that can you give a brief background of what metformin is how long it's been around what it's historically been used for and and then of course we'll talk a little bit more about why we're going to talk about it oh so boring i i also get those questions what's the distribution by the way what what do you mostly get asked about while we're on that subject the most common question is i hear you're doing a metformin study can i volunteer can i be can you assure me i'm not on placebo yeah he's just about to say are you sure you want to volunteer okay so by the way i'll tell you something really interesting um i i'm not because i'm leading this study i i'm not pushing metformin okay again the difference between advocate and scientist okay i'm i'm doing this study okay i believe in that but i'm doing this study so i cannot tell you that it's good so i'm not going to prescribe to anyone even to my friends i'm not going to prescribe but i have a method that works 100 of the time there are two papers that i wrote one i think in 2016 about metformin and tame and the clinical data and one in 2020 about actually the mechanisms of action that was in cell both of them were in cell metabolism but the mechanism of action the fact that metformin actually hits all the hallmarks of aging miraculously i'll i'll explain it later and i'm saying to those people send it to your doctors and say i asked the doctor what do you think about me taking metformin and they're one of two things that always happen one could be that the doctors reads the paper and said oh i should be on metformin myself of course i'll give metformin or the other is the doctor said you know i'm busy but you know metformin is a safe drug and stuff let me just give them it for me and that's the end of that and that's 100 success everybody can get me for me now i know that i'll get emails asking for those papers i'll put it in it we'll we will we will absolutely link to those papers in the show notes yeah but i i think what people don't realize is that metformin is an extract of the french lilac so some people say it's nutraceutical it it is modified and it is a drug the three best drugs in the world are nutraceuticals rapamycin statins metformin there you go right but you need prescriptions but also look one of the modification was fin forming it's an early form of metformin that kind of was a little too potent too potent on the mitochondria and cost trouble but we're over that for 80 years but metformin was used initially to treat the flu and malaria and inflammatory diseases and it's at that time that people noticed that people with type 2 diabetes have lower glucose when they take metform when they took metformin so the whole metformin moved to diabetes and that was about the 1950s or 60s right right 1950s and 60s interestingly in the united states it was approved only in 1993 or or so i came as a fellow to ralph de fronzo at yale and my my mission was to describe them for the mechanisms of action of metformin in in humans you know i did insulin clamps and i'm the first to describe that metformin decreased hepatic's loose production rather than increase insulin sensitivity in the periphery serendipitous i didn't think about it as aging i came to ralph de france and i did aging in another way to insulin resistant and aging but not not metformin um but the point is there are billions billions years of use remember every patient takes it for years and there are people on metformin who are 90 years old i actually know them so so people people they're billions use of here and i cannot think of a drug with better safety record if there are any side effects to metformin they happen usually in the first week of use and and that's even if you didn't take them the way you should which is small doses with food and when i say with food after the first bite when your stomach is full and and then usually there is no side effects but three to five percent of people and maybe more with elderly have diarrhea that doesn't stop and we basically stop metformin in those people uh whether whether there's well yeah to stop diarrhea we don't know if it if there is something but by the way in tame study we're going to follow those those patients that were sensitive to metformin and see if there's something unique about them that's one of the things we hope to do well we'll we're definitely going to talk about tame so so let's pick up the story 10 years ago all of a sudden people start to notice things people start to notice that diabetics who take metformin when compared to diabetics who don't take metformin do better and when i say do better i mean they have lower mortality from all causes and lower mortality from very specific causes and if you look at it um in some extremes if you compare the patients taking metformin to the patients taking insulin the difference could be 50 80 percent difference in mortality is that a fair assessment of where curiosity began to peak that this wasn't just a good diabetes drug but it might have some protection against aging yes absolutely when when one drug we we should just know that's that's the base of uh of uh of of of gero therapeutic it has to be a drug that has effect beyond its disease whether it's on other diseases whether it's on overall mortality not a disease-specific mortality that's when you have to think this this drug is a general therapeutics and that's exactly where metformin fell and i i would just add one thing look some some of those studies are association studies but some of the studies were clinical studies the diabetes prevention program the dpp is an nih-funded study where metformin was one arm there was also a an arm of lifestyle changes and both of them were preventing diabetes in about 30 percent and by the way the study was stopped early because it was significant after four years okay although the study was funded for five years the uk pds in many cities now i do want to talk about that study near and some of this of course you and i have already talked about but i think it's just good for people to be able to hear our our discussions on this one of the challenges of these studies and i think this is frankly true of every single study i've looked at for metformin is when you squint your eye at the study there's always a problem and in the case of the dpp the problem is the patients in the metformin arm could easily fall out of that arm and therefore not be counted so if they're if they progressed to a need for medication beyond metformin or if they couldn't tolerate metformin or if they were not compliant with metformin they were no longer counted and so when you compare and this is true not just of the dpp but of course when you compare the metformin patients to the other patients who are taking other diabetes drugs you always have this potential confounder which is you are disproportionately selecting the healthiest people which are the people who a can be compliant with medications which might say much more about their behaviors outside of medications whose diabetes is maybe just mild enough that it's always kept at bay with metformin never requiring other medications including insulin so am i correct in saying we don't to date and tame we will talk about in a moment but we don't to date have any clean example of a study that demonstrate uh metformin's gero protection look you're right in humans you you can say it on many studies but it's certainly true with diabetes diabetes is a problem because it's a progressive disease no matter what and and you can go and go back to the data and show whether the people were metformin from the beginning versus other have done better and whether it stops and there's a lot of of of things but first of all you're right you're also right about we had this discussion about the mortality data and you pointed out that maybe the control were not controlled enough for getting them out for some reason you watch them all the time you're absolutely right even even the clinical studies are not perfect studies but there are still enough of clinical studies or small studies that gives you the confidence so for example there are two studies on people with mild cognitive impairment that were treated with metformin one for half a year and one for one year and some of the outcomes have changed and there is no different in how they were treated um you know in other words they didn't have diabetes so it's not that they switched to other medication so there there are lots of examples a lot like that but you were right uh if if this was compelling if this was compelling on its own um you could argue we wouldn't have to have tame even right and really tame is not about it's not that we they were not studies for each one of the diseases but there is no studies to be agnostic of the diseases okay we we don't care look we're targeting aging we don't care what disease you have and we don't care which disease you're going to take to get if you're obese and your mother's diabetes you're going to get diabetic necks we have to think in general science that aging is going to drive your next disease yeah and therefore it's the cluster that is going to to count and we're counting the clusters by the way we had this discussion about mortality uh mortality you get a point for mortality just like you get a point for a disease and the important thing of the cluster is that we cannot do time study imagine we do a tame study and in two years cardiovascular disease comes up as as significant and this is an insignificant reduction of cardiovascular mortality and the fda will say hey we have to stop the study because we cannot go with the study when with placebo right and it will ruin it for us so the whole the whole problem of the statistics obtain is to make sure that we're not getting to any significant in any disease just to trends and that the only way to stop by the way the one one way to stop the study is if mortality is significant that will trigger a stoppage of this study otherwise what will stop the study is the integral approach of right so statistically you just can't your biggest mistake here is overpowering the study for mortality and therefore appropriately powering the study for subs subsets of mortality yes is that a safe assessment substance of mortality you mean diseases disease specific mortality is what i mean yes well let's talk a little bit about tame this is something you and i spoke about god two years ago um so this is a study that is going to look at people who do not have type 2 diabetes right it's an exclusion criteria and they are over the age of 65 65 to 79. okay so 65 to 79 no diabetes no type 2 diabetes any other exclusion criteria yes but it's not important for our discussion so if you have cancer in the last year okay things like that yeah yeah very specific if you had the heart attack in the last three months but again these people are going to be taking statins they're going to be taking medication for blood pressure some of them will be overweight some of them will be normal weight presumably right the point the point here though is that look we don't want to recruit a bunch of centenarians you don't want to be you don't recruit future centenarians here you're not going to get an answer so they have to have something okay they have to have for example walking speed less than six uh meter you know per second is is a an inclusion criteria you have to have something i see so you don't want you don't want exceptionally fit people in this group right you know it's almost like you want to take the patient population that predimed started with because this was a primary prevention study for cardiovascular disease that found a statistical significant difference in under five years i think it was four and a half years they expected to go for seven um so so it's you're really looking for that type of population you you you really do want people who are gonna i mean it's morbid to say this but you're looking for people whose risk of death in the next five years is is high enough that you're going to move the needle now the the risk of that is you get a negative study which means there is no difference in all-cause mortality or even disease-specific mortality and the counter-argument might be you started too late you know that's like applying the brakes on a car that's driving towards a cliff when it's only 20 feet from the cliff should this be a lot longer study where you start this at people when they're 50 and your ex your five-year mortality expectation is very low again i'm not saying this can be done because that's a very expensive study but it is a risk here correct there are two arguments here er you know first of all we needed to do look to st to start a study at 50 where you have to show mortality is a 20-year study we we we cannot afford it right so we needed to start it when people are starting to accumulate disease in order for us to have lots of events our hypothesis is that the the aging part of your biology doesn't stop working when you had your first disease it's still going to get your next disease okay and if we think biologically like that we should be able to intervene as we do with animals quite late also uh that that's that's one thing the second thing is there are metformin studies which included elderly people for example the dpp the dpp by the way got a 20 funding from the nia in order to include 20 of the subjects over the age of 65 which they didn't they had 20 over the age of 60 but there's still people over the age of 65 and and their results were similar in prevention diabetes to er to younger people so it's an example but we have several other studies that tells us that metformin will still target aging even if you started it it's not it's not that the first disease canceled yeah it just means that you have a lower period to apply the brakes on and it suggests that if if tame shows a reduction in all-cause mortality in a subset of people so old in quotes um because when i say so old meaning in five years is really what i'm saying um it would suggest biologically that there would be a benefit to starting sooner but of course then the question goes back to our original discussion how soon so peter you you you said an end endpoint of mortality in time uh there could be only trend of mortality so i'm sorry i misunderstood what is what is the primary outcome of tame it's the cluster of bunch of cardiovascular cancer cognitive and mortality it's the cluster okay you get one point for each one i see so let's define them again so you get one point if you die right for everyone you get one point if you have a major adverse cardiac event right one point if you have a cancer occurrence or skin cancer right and mci or dementia got it do you have any points for health span outcomes such as frailty falling breaking hips this is in the 70 million program okay so so let me explain we would like to start longitudinal study where we capture a lot of the other health spin issues you know hospitalization and function and depression and all that we are still powered to do it at the end of the study or or as the study goes on we probably wouldn't have money to do it longitudinally through the whole study but we have power at the end of the study to see if there are difference in frailty etc just a statistical question why is mortality given equal weighting to disease occurrence is there a reason that mortality wouldn't be three points to one point for mci mace and cancer well it was questioned for each one of them and we decided just that uh that we we cannot rationalize that everyone is an outcome you know we we basically said those are the outcomes we don't know which one you're going you're going to get an outcome you're going to get the point for that all right it's by the way it's the time until of course right yes the time you're moving you're moving health healthspan now earlier you spoke about how animal models are not really great for alzheimer's disease cancer and cardiovascular disease which i think any listener of this podcast is well aware of those limitations but you note that look animal models are pretty darn good for aging given how conserved it is and yet one of the challenges metformin has had is in animal models now rich miller was on this podcast a while ago we spoke about the itp where metformin was successful in the itp when combined with rapamycin but alone was not again i think the itp is a very rigorous uh type of experiment i know you've probably thought a lot about this what explanation do you think exists for why metformin did not succeed in isolation in the itp study which i'll just take for a moment to explain to people the itp if you haven't listened to that podcast with rich miller you should go and do so we'll link to the appropriate section here but these are studies that are conducted using a particularly good model of mouse that is kind of less troubled by the usual difficulties mice studies have it's also done independently at three separate laboratories concurrently so i think those would be some of the and then the final thing is they look at all cause mortality so um tell us why you think that that that we could be misled by the itp let me make a big picture statement now it is possible that some of the drugs that had mild effect in itp will have much bigger effect in humans and the other you know maybe rapamycin is going to be not as effective in humans as it is in animals okay we just have to accept that we we're all rich miller can rich miller if it's not in in true in mice it's not true but which i don't think rich says by the way no i've never heard rich say that i i think you know rich is just says this is what it is in this model i'm kidding he start he started saying that initially and he took it back of course i i think one of the problems with animals is the dosage that they are using okay the dosage in animal where you were used uh if you look back as 0.1 in a solution to 1 1 is deadly okay because listen metformin after all is a weak cyanide okay it binds to er to a complex in the mitochondria it probably affects complex one and also complex three it's not totally clear but if you give too much there is a trade-off so you have to give right and i think that the studies in animals accept by the way mice it's not true for you know nematodes and there are several other fish there are several other animals that live longer and healthier with metformin but i don't think that 0.1 is really the appropriate dose and also i don't what do you think is there so you think i don't know i don't know there's nobody one percent is clearly problematic yeah i think 0.2 percent maybe will be will be better if we want to optimize that because this is the other there's a paper that gets a lot of attention i think it's 2013 the raphael de cabo paper right which gets touted as oh look at metformin i i gotta be honest with you if you look at that paper i don't know how the editors let the title of that paper slide with the actual data i mean let's let's call a spade a spade you had two groups of mice one of them getting point one percent one of them getting one percent the group getting one percent were assassinated to your point i mean these animals were killed by the toxicity of metformin the group getting one pers point one percent lived a staggering point four or four four percent longer right right i mean it was basically a null trial that was touted as the definitive animal study for why metformin works it was kind of like it's like an onion article when you dissociate the title from the actual data right look the average when i took and make a table with all the longevity data that then the effect of metformin across studies were between seven and ten percent not a huge effect well that's that's pretty good seven to ten percent in animal studies if it's consistent would be pretty good but the effects the nice thing with metformin the effects on health span is much but what are the health span effects besides the metabolic effects cancer say more prevention of cancers but isn't that effectively already captured in lifespan rich miller will give you a better thing i mean animals look the problem for us with animals is by the way it's the problem with centenarians also they die with cancers we don't know if they die right it's like the prostate cancer issue right cancer is several as much as we say in humans it's you know cardiovascular disease cancer is the probably the leading disease of that for animals and and that's true for sure so the other point is which which i think i'm trying to get to the bottom of that but when you gave metformin to animals in the itp in two centers they had 10 you know one was 11 and one was nine percent increase in longevity but rich miller's er er er point was minus two percent and and i i i just wonder if they're all actually delivering the same dose and and what's going on i mean and so it wasn't significant but it actually was in two centers there was a ten percent of you yeah there's always an issue that that could be methodologic do you think that the animal studies in metformin are largely irrelevant once we have tame underway i mean one of the reasons that we rely so heavily on all of the animal data for rapamycin and why the itp which has studied rapamycin five ways to sunday starting it late in life starting it early in life high dose low dose pulsing it not pulsing it continuous i mean every way you study it rapamycin works and we have to look at that and really pay attention to it because i don't think we're going to get the human trial of rapamycin i don't know that we're going to get the tame equivalent of rapamycin and if we are it's not going to be for some time um but now that we're moving to a human clinical trial of metformin should we even care about this question in mice does it matter if it's 0.1 percent or 0.2 percent no i i don't think what i'm saying is that the preliminary data from humans overall right you as you said there are problems everywhere but but you know it's the same story it's a 20 30 effect on each study no matter how you look at it it's a really very impressive style studies and there's no better studies that came with different results so so i think once tame is there tame is there i don't know that we need to go into animal studies and discover more about metformin at this time will tame allow you on its current budget which i think is 50 million is the bare bones budget sounds crazy right on the 50 million dollar budget how much will you be able to look at mitochondrial function and omics that are associated with other you know deeper markers that go beyond the hard outcomes that feed into your primary outcome well the ni the nia has given us a grant that is now delayed to do basically the biomarker part of tame so even with this 50 million and with the nih money and with afr we're going to store lots of plasma dna um and and other resources like cells and other things that will then be open for omic studies and we wrote a beautiful grant about that in part it was a preliminary data from our centenarian studies on proteomics by the way i just realized i used the word omics do you want to tell people what the full suite of omics means uh so that people listening to this know what we're talking about yeah and it's really it's really back to something that i said before when i talk about if i said my study i mean our study and when i talk about teams i'm talking about teams that have computational capacity i i talked about zheng dong dang that being that did a lot of my study about yushin su that is doing functional genetics i'm talking about sophia millman who are doing other studies we're really bad big team and the reason to have a big team is very simple we have you know i was all i knew when i started my training was insulin i knew insulin i know insulin is signaling now i'm losing it at billions of data set that are under my tip if you think of genetics only whole exome sequencing for 3 000 people or my proteomics which is a 5 000 protein for a thousand people it's all big data and in order to do something that with the big data you have to ask the right questions because yeah otherwise you can find anything you are the the first paper that came out of the uk biobank for aging said that longevity is all about assortative mating okay now now yes if if you if you're a smoker you may marry a smoker if you're obese you will marry obese if you're poor you will marry poor it also all has consequence of health but we knew that without the uk bio bank we knew that obesity is a risk for diabetes without the biobank too so you have to ask the right question and it's really only asking the right question that you get the answers so the question that is very important for us there are two questions what are the biomarkers for aging you know how can we do a test at 50 years old and know if we're 40 or we're 60. if we're 40 we skip colonoscopy okay if if we're 60 we have to do something about it already and the second part and it's more important for me is biomarkers that change with treatment we want to make sure that we when we try all those treatments that we have in two three months and answer are they likely to work and then maybe we can get to phase two and phase three trial but we need something more immediate and that's what tame will try to provide now in my study we did this proteomic and it was really incredible for for many reasons and i'll give you a titbit but we have those uh thousand people and five thousand proteins and we asked what changed between 65 the age of 65 and 95 this didn't include our centenarians and the answer is a lot of proteins are changing but this is i think the most important part a lot of the proteins that we're capturing by the way number one is igf related proteins okay number one that comes up even in the proteomic not only in the genomics but then a lot of what you see is breakdown you see breakdown of collagen you see the granulation of the thrombocytes you see breakdown of extracellular metrics lots of things like that and at first i said okay that doesn't tell me anything until i thought you know whatever it is no matter what we do we have to stop the breakdown you know this is probably going to be the best marker for any treatment you just stop the breakdown it's funny that seems so obvious doesn't it i mean like it's when you're talking about collagen breakdown and you think about this gets back to what we talked about earlier you want to really know what health span is it's not some nonsense definition that the nia gives us about freedom from disability and disease who cares who cares if you have cancer but you're living in remission with it and you can climb three flights of stairs with a bag of groceries in your hands that's living right it's yeah when your collagen is breaking down your knees aren't working i mean this is the essence of what we're talking about right right it i i think the i think the proteomic story is very interesting and i hope it gets its appropriate funding and by the way the other part of proteomic there are few other aspects that are important the the proteomics that are the proteins that are 10 to the minus 80 significance the two top ones when you express them in animal they live long in other words their protective protein when you get those proteins you don't know which are protective and which are causing problems and and that's a challenge because we are saying let's bring it to normal no you don't want to lower the protective mechanism the third thing that is really cool is the proteome of females is much more stable in other words it's only half of the proteins are significantly changing in women than in men between those ages so you'd need to look at actually different biomarkers for women and men and by the way this is this is something this is eureka this was eureka moment for all of us mice from itp and on female and males have different biology as far as aging some of the gero therapeutics both work for both like metformin and rapamycin maybe not equally but work for both and some are not yeah look at look at the 17 alpha or 17 alpha estrogen beta 17 beta estradiol i mean that's a remarkable story and then the last thing that is interesting those thousand people that i had uh 500 are what we called opus they are of offspring of parents with usual survival no longevity in the family and one are opel offspring of parents with exceptional longevity the offspring of parents with exceptional longevity have half of the biomarkers uh of of of the control group because they're younger they'll get those biomarkers later so i i think look i don't know that methylation is going to be the best biomarker for treatment i think methylations are are complicated they're kind of stable they are going up they're going down but they're kind of stable i think proteomic is going to be a better biomarker i think metabolomic is very complicated because it so depends on how you establish the sample you know if somebody was fasting less or more if their insulin level was less or more you're done that's sort of my problem with these biomarkers is and you know i mean i don't know you've probably heard me rail on these um these uh biological clocks i've never seen a worse biomarker than a biological clock these are so easy to manipulate and game in fact i need to do this just to demonstrate it but i'm too lazy is get five copies of a biologic clock and do five different self experiments and i promise you i can change my biologic age by 20 years right when fasting glucose and vitamin d level factor into a biologic clock i'm sorry that's useless it might be valuable at the population level it is as useful as a warm bucket of hamster vomit at the individual level so we have to have things that can't just change on a day-to-day basis you're fasting glucose the difference between 95 and 105 has everything to do with the meal you had last night how much cortisol was coursing through your veins if your water heater broke that night if you got startled in the morning when you before you got your blood draw i mean i'm just amazed near at the attention i'm sorry i'm going off on this tangent night but i'm amazed at the attention that is being given to these clocks and the entire cottage industry of businesses that are spinning out this type of i think i think this is complete buffoonery peter i i have more positive outlook of life maybe because i'm so much older than you so much older yeah but you know at least it's good for the economy yeah exactly hey theranos was good for the economy until it wasn't right no um the other thing is even with methylation and and i thought methylation was very interesting until the twin astronaut brother experiment then i stopped thinking it was very interesting right whenever you had the twins right the one astronaut went to the iss for a year his twin brothers stayed down here you then looked at methylation clocks of them after a year and they were vastly different and then three days later after the twin brother was back on earth for three days they repeated the test and it was right back to his twin brother right i mean come on how biologically relevant can this be when it changes like that right and i i think uh have you had morgan levine no and no i i do of course and and and i haven't had steve horvath on as well i've communicated with him a little bit via email and i would certainly uh love the opportunity to speak with him about this but um there's probably something interesting there i'm just having a hard time seeing that because again what's the purpose of doing this we have to never lose sight of the purpose of biomarkers of aging it's not so that you have bragging rights that oh i just took this test and it says i'm 37 when i'm 50. no the only reason you do this test is if it can guide therapeutics the only reason you do this test is if it helps you determine if i'm doing this thing is it making me better or worse and my fear is i haven't seen a single test that is validated at a level that would give me even a modicum of confidence in that right right have you i mean again i'm looking i'm saying this in a very deliberately provocative way because i'm waiting for you to say oh no no peter you need to look at this test no so i'm i'm telling you i i don't want to be a spokesperson all i'm saying is i don't think uh methylation because it's not mechanistic i don't think it's going to help us er when we come to gero therapeutics even if they're examples okay i i don't know what the examples mean just like the example you gave i i don't know what it means morgan levine and steve horvath by the way they're they're really good and they're responsible and they understand exactly what they did and what they didn't do and morgan levine has a mechanistic way of looking at epigenetics remind me what the inputs are to the levine clock the way they're moving is so one one one thing that morgan levine is doing is she's saying well if the if methylation has a function then i want to cause mutilation and see that there's change in the expression right of those genes and and that those genes are something that we know are relevant to aging etc etc and then build a clock that is mechanistic because the only way this clock was built was to be uh to measure chronological age will you guys be using any of the biologic clocks through tame as well so what's going to happen with tame is there are two things we are going to we're going to have a committee that we time and we didn't decide we're going to to do the right epigenetic test and by the way we're going to do epigenetic not the clock epigenetics but enough epigenetic data on a genome you know on the genome-wide in order to then discover which are the ones that have changed with treatment okay that way but it would also be good near to have a clock running in parallel wouldn't it because if you can do this longitudinally with multiple data points you sample people every three to six months with multiple different versions of these clocks and then you can look at how well those clocks predicted the actual outcomes you will see over five to seven years that strikes me as a very valuable way to get at something that no one is doing today because right in other words take advantage of the fact that you have two things going for you that nobody has today which is a very large longitudinal data set with hard outcomes and an intervention that is relevant and interesting to study if we're doing the methylation scan we can obtain any clock from them that's the idea yes that's my point i mean you'll have the bio i'm just saying just make sure you're collecting all of the data that goes into multiple clocks exactly in in a in a concurrent manner with it not just at a time a and time b right and the second point is the nia is going to have rfa okay for people who want to have sub projects in relation to what we collected those rfas can be in centers for example there's a center that wants to look at skin aging okay if if 250 people are enough then for a project then you have a center if you need 500 you'll take two centers in other words there'll be a process by which application will be reviewed and people can come in and look at variety of things that they're interested in if it's not too late make some crazy suggestions and i don't know if this changes your irb but are you going to be doing any bone marrow sampling even at time beginning and end because i'll tell you one of the other things i'd really really love to see with a study of this magnitude is are you impacting immune function specifically memory t and b cell function obviously this is a topic that's very interesting in germane to covet at the moment but i think it goes well beyond covet and it would be very interesting to know if metformin is having any impact on immune function specifically memory function because it doesn't just play an important role in infections it plays a very important role in cancer so look the answer is a mundane okay we're not we're taking elderly people into a study we're not going to torture them we're not going to have any excuse for them to leave us okay it's the same with our centenarians by the way we are in the centenary what we're offering the offspring we're offering mri of their brain we're offering them coronary ct you know we're offering things but we're not doing biopsies that's in another study are you doing brain mri and tame no just because of cost yeah look you could do again we are powered enough to do things eventually okay because because it's not going to happen before and after we're not going to have everything from before and after this is only the things that we have to measure for the outcomes but we'll have enough power for anybody to do mris uh in metformin what about what about exercise function because one of the things i want to talk about before we leave metformin is the the impact metformin may have as a negative impact on cardiorespiratory fitness so no the answer the answer is no we're not going to have anything like that because of cost no because of how much time can you get an elderly to spend time with you every three year three months when really want to make what you want to make sure is that they're taking their drugs that's why how many centers you said 30 3 500 subjects yeah we well we have if currently before before we get okay to expand the beat we have 14 centers and about 250 people in each centers all in the u.s all in the us i don't know i mean i think that would be potentially a lost opportunity not that you have to do c pet testing every three months but would doing it every two years be you the issue at a minimum i would look at fasting lactate levels or resting lactate levels you know everybody everybody has i know everybody has their pet idea for you right everybody has possession and but by no way i'm saying it's not important i'm not just saying i understand what are we practically ready because at the end we want the out we want the fda look let me state it again i'm doing tame not because i don't believe in metformin because i need to have we need to have a tar a target that that's similar to aging okay that's the reason so let's talk a little bit about this other issue which is um you know i've talked with you about my experience right so i took metformin for i don't know eight years or something like that um but three years ago when i really began checking and constantly monitoring my lactate levels both in and out of exercise it became clear to me that my lactate levels were too high so my fasting lactate level was typically above one millimole it was between one and two millimole and as a result of that my perceived mitochondrial efficiency was lower and there's ample data to suggest that fasting lactate level now of course this is not necessarily in people taking metformin but if you take lactate levels in people at rest there's a high association between what that tells you about their general health so the less healthy an individual is the higher their lactate level is [Music] so for me i just said well boy they're sure it sure looks like a lot of compelling reasons why metformin could be beneficial but if i really stop to look at it none of the cohorts of people in whom we would infer that look anything like me right these are not people who are exercising constantly doing all of these other things so that was the decision for me three years ago i'm not going to take metformin anymore until i have better data so now we have a couple of studies that have looked at the impact of metformin on cardiorespiratory fitness and we see that it is indeed impaired and then we have studies that look at the impact on metformin of strength training and we see a mixed response we see that it does not appear to impact strength gains it only appears to impact hypertrophy the good news is we know that strength matters more than hypertrophy in longevity i had a whole ama on that which you probably heard so i think it was pretty clear that we can say strength matters more so what do you make about these potential limitations with respect to metformin on cardiorespiratory fitness and what do you think it says about people who exercise a lot first of all i think one point that is very important is when we go from a drug that has certain capabilities to personalize medicine and all of a sudden it becomes about the person okay and i think what there's nothing i can say about what you're observing except that a lactate is one of the biomarkers of giving metformin in every patient in 1987 when i did the metformin study metformin went from below one to above one in everyone who took metformin lactate you mean yes hey lactate sorry what did they say you said metformin but i know yeah lactate went up in every in every patient it's almost a way that in i hope in tame you were measuring lactate if for no other reason than determine compliance absolutely by the way there's a better taste test it's called gdf15 it's one of those peptides that goes up with aging it's a protective peptide it goes by three and a half fold in people who take metformin so there are other other other ways other ways to look at it so okay but this is the point with exercise and let me make the most important point okay uh we can talk about muscle but remember just like with exercise itself exercise is not only about muscle it improves brain function okay it decreases cancer okay but farming has many other effects okay so let's remember that metformin has other effects than its effects on the muscle as far as the muscle is concerned what we've done with charlotte peterson which you reviewed two papers of her during during the time we took the biopsies and looked at the transcript of the people who were on exercise and metformin versus exercise only right that's the only thing we had and and the reason we did that was because in supplement four of her first paper she showed that the strength of the muscle didn't change right which means that per gram muscle you did better okay and we try to understand what is the biology and it became very clear look in order for muscle to grow it needs to activate mtor okay so emptor is good for muscle and for muscle growth it's not good for aging but it's good for muscle growth a huge transcripts of of emptor has been decreased by metformin which was not news for us on the other hand there were other transcripts that had to do with inflammation and autophagy and oxidative markers that were where in people with metformin and not with exercise so there was there were trade-offs okay there were trade-offs you get less muscle but the muscle is healthier okay so it's up to you if you want if it's healthier can we really say that or can we just say it is as strong it's by it's biologically younger or as strong yeah whatever they're trade-offs but how do we say it's biologically younger because the trans the changing transcript that we saw is from an old transcript to young transcript okay so in our studies we have people with biopsies from people who are old and young and with every treatment and we've done it for resveratrol and we've done it for metformin and we've done it for akerbos and for exercise and now we're doing it for fasting we have young and old and we see if in old with intervention the transcript goes back to young and he does so the exercising people without metformin versus exercising with metformin the with metformin group had a maintenance of the transcriptome or it actually declined relative to the other group no no it's it's it's transcript specific okay it's which transcript which groups of transcript changed and did they change either with decrease or increase did they change to resemble more young than old and this was done on the patients in the masters trial yes and what was the duration of that trial 16 weeks i believe what do we think we can learn in four months with respect to the transcript well like how much does it apply from what you've learned over a much longer period of time in a non-intervention setting i don't know i think well first of all the answer is what we what we learn in four months we learn what it is in four months but i think it's a long it's a long period of time it's also a dynamic period of time in this experiment because they were building muscle throughout time right so it is what it is in this experiment but in this experiment the transcripts were younger by metformin and the emptor was increased by exercise and this was the trade-offs and what about in in terms of the cardiorespiratory fitness differences i'm listening to them i don't have i you know i don't have biology i mean i guess what i'm getting at is the the most plausible explanation here for a blunting of of cardio respiratory fitness would be what you said earlier redshirt which is you know metformin is a mitochondrial inhibitor uh it's a weak one at the doses we take it but it nevertheless is so it seems to me that that's the most obvious explanation that's the place i'd be looking for the fire given where the smoke is so do we think that the net benefits of that are probably positive in some people but in others for example those who exercise a lot it might not be beneficial because they're getting so many of those other benefits of exercise as you point out yeah look i'm i'm taking that for me an exercise but i have a different way i'm thinking about it for me right now we're very personalized and and and this is back to the issue of when do we we start metformin and or what is the biological age of those people who exercise and take metformin and i would say that if you're young or biologically young i don't think you should take metformin when you exercise at this level okay and maybe peter peter you're you know you've been doing it for years you're probably biologically much younger than most people i don't know if metformin is for your age and for what you're doing for your health i can tell you that i'm with metformin and fasting my exercise capacity is increased significantly i'm not measuring lactate i'm not exercising the way you are so i i think those are good discussion we'll find out eventually who can who cannot but we have to make sure that we don't generalize where we're being so specific yeah no indeed um i i i you know again i said at the outset i get asked about metformin constantly and you know in the end the only the only people who are asking me for whom it really matters are the patients i don't you know particularly care what someone asks me on social media but um it has been a change in my practice over the past few years where i'm really reserving metformin only for people in whom i see an otherwise obvious indication such as even a trace of insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia that is not otherwise you know treated with the right amount of exercise nutritional changes sleep and things like that so it'll be interesting to see what tame does and how it can change that practice but i also worry that it won't fully answer the question for our patient population because the tame patient population is not a very healthy population by definition if they can't walk a certain speed they're 65 to 80 years old you're basically selecting people who we expect to have a bad outcome in five years um so it's a very important question for the for the world at large uh but it you know i think it's important that people listening to this understand we may not get the answer we want for them for the healthy 40 year old person absolutely remember all i want with tail is an fda indication for aging okay that's all i want what do you think that opens the floodgates for how does that change things now assuming that we get there and that that we now have an fda indication for aging what follows first of all pharmaceuticals will jump in right and they wouldn't make many mistakes because i think the biomarkers will be there from tame and others there will be more biomarkers better biomarkers and so that they could do testing two and three months and find out if their drug is working and then do a phase free trial now phase three trial think of it for any diabetes treatment you need 12 000 people for tame you need 3 000 people the study is going to be much much cheaper we think i think we this is still a hypothesis that being tested right is 3000 the right number yeah yeah if if it were look the 3000 is a question of when and not if for me how many years will it take us and and i hope that we'll actually do the 3 500 uh and and not not lose a lot not lose a lot also the question is who's stopping the study that's another thing so and in other words that's administrative questions but the the the reason the reason we do that is to get an indication uh that for the fda is not making aging a disease which is another big topic but but for us it's okay you can call it whatever we want but if there's a drug that targets variety of age-related disease and mortality that's for us at geotherapeutics and this is what we want to get all the the other question when to use whom to use you're absolutely right and and the one thing i didn't with the one thing we don't want is not to kill anyone on the way to success right we're almost out of time but one thing i want to just touch on before we go we've talked a little bit about rapamycin a lot about metformin we didn't talk about the other one you and i probably get asked about a lot which is the nad precursors where are you in your thinking on the efficacy of these as gero-protective agents they're in a different class because they're not pharmaceutical they're nutraceutical how how is your appraisal of the of the data in that space you know as a biologist i have a problem understanding it okay on one hand uh you give it to animals and the animals are doing better okay not not in the itp but yeah right not in the single most important animal study they did better yeah when you ask people okay follow you know follow the drug tell me where it goes where can you measure it you cannot measure it anywhere and you cannot measure the derivative of that and so i don't know where is the biology so joe bauer do you know joe barrow from european he's a really good nad biologist and he basically thought you know what the nad goes we swallow that it goes to our microbiome sorry when he when he says nad you mean the nr or nf you're right right yep they go to the microbiome and the microbiome either transfer the nad or does something the microbiome itself does something you know there there's indirect health benefit from a dufferin system and he actually did a really good study where he discovered that the nad for the microbiome comes not from the food but from the gut the gut walls okay everywhere everywhere you try to understand what's the biology i don't get it and when i don't get the biology i'm a little bit more worried of of what kind of a placebo is it uh i i actually one of the studies i wanted to do those short studies when i i get elderly do placebo control crossover and do biopsies and look at the biology i wanted to do nad and then i said i just have so little belief here that i i'm now doing intermittent fasting one but uh but i'm i'm uncomfortable with it now saying that i started taking nmn at one point and what i noticed is my rem sleep has improved a lot and i stopped it and my rem sleep wasn't so good i restarted it and my rem didn't get better again so so and then i tried another there's a japanese company i don't remember the name of the top of my head that has really the best preparation david sinclair tells me about that has the best preparation er of nmn of nmn 900 a month supply for the low dose 1800 for the high dose i i got i got some of the supplement as a present more expensive than a pcsk9 inhibitor and rapamycin combined okay right right and and and my rem sleep didn't return so so i'm currently not taking anyone so what am i telling you i'm telling you i i'm just i'm just not convinced i i don't i don't know it's not the whole truth you never know the whole truth but i don't know enough of the truth to make anything about it again if people want to know it's good for the economy i'm not sure that the preparations out there look they're very sensitive preparations if they have a high time shelf i think you lose a lot of it and i don't know which to recommend yeah i think it's always problematic when your rationale for taking a supplement is that it's a mini stimulus program to the economy through this supplement company i generally i think as a general rule if we're going to talk about principles for trying to optimize your health i would put that very low on the list peter i i did many jokes do i have to go over and tell you which was a joke and which is not i know it's a joke this is my joke right back at you yeah yeah exactly no no this is my sarcasm coming right back to you yeah supplement company stimulus program not a not a high on my list reason for it anyway near this has been great um thank you again for for the the generosity of your time and behind the scenes people don't know how much i bug you and how much you know we interact on on all matters that pertain to
