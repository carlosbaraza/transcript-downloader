[00:00:00] if we want to jump into clinical trials and I think this is the time to really U move clotho toward human clinical trials wouldn't it be amazing if we had a cocktail for Alzheimer's disease in addition to um lanam or danab that's removing the amalo beta from the brain what about adding something like clotho that can really help Shore up the functions of the cells no matter because we know that Alzheimer's disease is a multi-protein opathy it's not just one

[00:00:35] Protein that's um that's causing the disease we need factors in our treatment we need cocktails that can really resist multiple protein toxicities so I I just have this dream that um that that people might be able someday to benefit from clotho this this Factor that naturally circulates in our body that helps with with longevity that helps with other organ systems and enhances the brain hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:17] AA Tina thanks so much for joining me today um this is a topic I've been very interested in for um the better part of about a year and a half to two years uh and obviously there there's no better person to discuss this with than you um I also suspect that this is a topic um not enough people know about given its potential implications and significance uh Visa Alzheimer's disease which we'll we'll get to but maybe before we get into this let's let's give people a bit of a sense of your background um tell tell me tell me a little bit about your clinical work your your research work um you know what you did during your PhD and how that carried forward um uh during your tenure sure well thanks again for the invitation I'm delighted to join you today and um I by way of introduction I'm a neurologist and I'm a neuroscientist and I direct a group um that is deeply involved in the discovery around clotho and um I was thinking back to when when my interest in aging actually began what was this journey and I thought back to um my undergraduate days at UC Berkeley when I was um a 19-year-old that was oddly interested in aging kind of obsessed with aging I worked with a medical Anthropologist um at Berkeley Lawrence Cohen on what it meant to experience Dementia in different cultures um what was it like in India versus the United States and then simultaneously I took a class on the physiology of Aging um I remember it so clearly in Dell Hall and I was at the edge of my seat learning about cellular inessence um and I remember thinking this is amazing this is happening to us day by day aging um yet we don't know so much about it um and we don't know much about brain aging per se and I I was committed as an undergraduate to really learn more about brain aging and possibly to do something about it um that led me to an mdphd at the University of Kentucky um I trained with villis wiise a neuroendocrinologist who studied brain aging who was an amazing PhD learned so much fell in love with the discovery process of Science and fast forward um I then trained as a neurologist at UCSF where I am now and that was um over 20 years ago 2003 and I'm on the wards it's a regular day of patient rounding and the former chair of

[00:04:10] UCSF um neurology Stephen Hower turned to me and he said Dena when you go back to the lab do things that are big and important and not incremental or mediocre because they'll take you the same amount of time and that really um clicked with me it became my Mt and after an Alzheimer's Fellowship both clinical and basic science I had the chance to build a group and to really start my own scientific discovery and we focused on clotho um the subject of what we'll talk about today the Greek fate who spins the thread of life and the idea of studying clotho was to understand whether factors that help us to live longer could help us to live better whether this longevity Factor could actually help the brain could help it Stave off

[00:05:04] Alzheimer's disease and that's where we began so let's kind of go back to the first time clotho crossed your radar yes well I was um just beginning my junior faculty days and um was thinking what what were we going to focus on you know what was going to be our chance to do something big and important and um I was very intrigued by um by a few

[00:05:34] Decades of work that was emerging that aging itself was malleable and the and the first work with this was Cynthia Kenyan and worms where she demonstrated that that tweaking um tweaking genetics like Aging in worms could dramatically increase lifespan and I really wanted to know whether that could have effects in the brain um clotho had emerged as a longevity factor and um and it was a chance to understand could clotho do something in the brain no nothing was known about clotho very little was known about clotho when we started a colleague had um had observed that it would that the levels decreased in the white matter of monkey brains um that um a a variant of clotho that we can talk about in a bit was a associated with decreased stroke risk um and the person who discovered clotho had noted that um that mice without clotho moved slowly and they they were cognitively a little slow um but you know I was at the the right person at the right time um and and had the chance to really dig in it was um it was risky you know to start with something that not much was known about in the brain but it was a chance to do something maybe big and important let's talk a little bit about the discovery of clotho so was it discovered through the mice that were deficient was it deliberately knocked out what was the process of discovery I mean just contrasting it with Cynthia's work obviously she knocked out a gene that is

[00:07:19] I think sort of the analog of of one of the igf genes if I'm not mistaken correct yeah the daff 16 y um so so how was clotho discovered it was um in 1997 Makoto kuroo a Japanese scientist accidentally discovered it and it's such a story of serendipity he was studying hypertension and he engineered a mouse to insert a gene um which I believe was a sodium um proton um channel so he engineered mice he inserted this Gene and then he not noted that in a few lines of these mice um maybe it was just one line of the of these mice that there was this premature aging phenotype so the mice lived to um about three months instead of about 30 months and they developed normally but around two weeks of age they became um sort of progeroid they rapid they became they look like they were rapidly aging with osteoporosis atherosclerosis um empyema um they looked and they moved slow they looked really old and so he went back to that Mouse and he mapped out what had happened and he had accidentally um caused a mutation by by inserting his um sodium proton um pump so so he went back back he mapped what had been dis disrupted and um and that was clotho um that was the first time clotho was found and he named it after the

[00:09:08] Greek fate who spins the thread of Life daughter of Zeus and um clotho the Greek fate is c t h um but he named it k l t h um in homage um to his Discovery his name is kuroo k r o o and um and a and a longevity Factor isn't something that just causes premature aging if disrupted so it was very important for him to then excuse me to go back and see what would happen if he overexpressed it so he made then he engineered mice to overexpress clotho and those mice lived 30% longer so that was a longevity factor that disruption caused premature aging an overexpression extended lifespan yeah no that's I it's such a beautiful story um I I think you know it's a great story for people especially maybe who don't don't do or haven't done science because um it illustrates the role of curiosity and

[00:10:18] Serendipity and you know I think look there are some people who maybe wouldn't have even gone back and done the experiments that he did to understand what turned out to be the most relevant thing I I'm sure that whatever he was doing with a sodium uh proton pump exchanger uh you know seemed interesting at the time and that what he observed was you know actually kind of a disappointment in that it you know ruined one of his lines of mice but obviously it led to the far more relevant finding over the long Arc of time he opened the field you know he followed the science he opened the field he looked into the mistake um the oops of Science and and here we are you know maybe on the cusp of a new therapy yeah exactly so let's talk a little bit about what this Gene does how big is this Gene uh you know how preserved is this Gene over other species um and tell us a little bit about the protein that it codes for what regulates it sure so clotho itself is a pretty big protein um it's about a thousand amino acids and um by weight maybe 130 kilodaltons if you look at it on a western block and it codes for for the efficient AOS a type one um transmembrane protein which means that it's n Terminus um will sit in the extracellular space it has one pass through the membrane and it C

[00:11:45] Terminus is inside the cell now um it's ENT the part that sits outside the cell has two repeat domains K1 and K2 um and those domain Ms have high homology to um proteins that are found throughout Mamon um worm and fly biology so they're homologues of clotho um throughout species and um and pretty conserved in mammals so um so clotho is a big protein it's a transmembrane protein and then what happens is there are a few forms of clotho it it's made primarily in the kidney also in the chid plexus of the brain but it's made in the cells of the kidney and then it gets transported into the membrane and then enzymes come across um base atom 10 atom 17 and they clip that extracellular portion of clotho and release it into the blood or in the case of the brain release it into the

[00:12:54] CSF and that form of clotho is known as a soluble form of clotho or the secreted form of clotho I call it a hormonal form of clotho the clotho hormone because it's releas at one site and then can act at different sites at multiple organs um so that's how it's made those are the major forms so how big is that end terminous piece that gets clipped that now goes and acts like a hormone basically it's the it's the majority of the protein itself um the the part that's inside the cell and crosses the membrane is very small so it's really the majority of the protein is is the hormone itself if we were to you know take a blood test and measure a person's clotho levels um what could we observe about it across people of the same age uh people of different ages what factors do we think might influence the expression and does the expression and production of the protein become the sole determinant of the soluble factor in other words is there also variability at the cleavage uh efficacy or um are there other factors that lead to consumption of the protein or degradation of the protein in the periphery yeah great questions so starting with levels of clotho across the lifespan um well first um first clotho is um it circulates in US it circulat Ates in mice and um and when we started our studies in mice I really wanted to make sure that this was going to be relevant to The Human Condition and it is very relevant to The Human

[00:14:40] Condition and so we have circulating levels of clotho we're born with about six times the levels that we have now um in our cord blood and then throughout our lifespan clotho levels Decline and into in our um from let's say 40 onwards they can decrease by half during aging so um we're born with very high levels and they decrease across our lifespan they also have a circadian rhythm um or a dial rhythm in that when we wake up we have high levels of clotho and by 4 P.M 3 P.M when people are looking to grab a cup of coffee the clotho levels are really starting to decline and then they nater by around midnight and that can be it can be a 40% or so decrease so there's a circadium rhythm to clotho it changes across the lifespan sorry Dina just to make sure I understand that yeah what explains the daily variation is it some sort of quote unquote consumption or is it being turned over that quickly and the supply of clotho is decreasing by the time of day yeah I think that's a great question um I the answer to is not known um what regulates the daily levels is it how is it being degraded um you know is it is the expression being increased um the half-life is is short in mice um and in um in mice it's maybe seven to 10 minutes but in humans well I would say in monkeys it's much longer um it's at least a day or so so um it's unlikely that the production is really actually increasing and decreasing because when it's made its

[00:16:35] Half-Life is will be longer and non-human primates like us um so I would speculate though I don't know Peter um that um that it may be sequestered in organs or degraded or not sure um i' I've seen a couple of reports of this dial variation and um it's really not clear why it's increasing and decreasing but it is known in Aging for example this longer term Decline and slow decline that we see it has been um it's been observed and this was work by um Fabia ambrosio's lab that there is a hypermethylation around the clotho promoter that occurs with aging that stops its transcription and essentially transcription and translation um and so that's an interesting thing to think about if we wanted to um if we wanted to preserve our clotho levels how can we interfere with that methylation that happens with aging that's interesting so more methylation there leads to inhibition of the promoter um yeah and a lot of times you'll see the opposite right it's the loss of methylation that shuts off the promoter correct I don't know I I don't know about that in general um or clotho at least the methylation really really turns things off off okay um I could I could be wrong about that but I think that that's that's definitely the case um in with clotho I think that's definitely the case I and is that believed to be the main mechanism driving the reduced production of clotho is the increase in the methylation of the promoter that's what's known so far um there are other possibilities like um maybe organs make it less maybe the kidney is less efficient at making it with aging that's possible um but I think that this I think that um that ambrosio's lab is really on to something they showed it in condr sites and aging condra sites but was really the first a molecular demonstration about why clo may be decreasing now there are other things

[00:18:58] Peter decrease clotho and um one big one is um is chronic stress um we did a study with um Alyssa eel and Eric prayther here at UCSF and mothers um with neurodevelopmentally um typical or atypical children and um the mothers with high levels of stress with um children with autism spectrum disorder um had much lower levels of clotho as well as shorter tiir and um their level of stress with increasing stress there was a decrease in the clotho level did you demonstrate in those folks a higher degree of methylation of the promoter relative to their age and did it did it basically look like they were older at the level of the promoter I think that would be so neat to look at um we haven't done but it would be really neat to look at so in other words we don't yet know the mechanism by which chronic stress could be mediating the reduction that's right there might be um Ryan Brown here at

[00:20:11] UCSF and Eric Prather and also Lissa epel and myself looked at whether there might be a relationship between U between clotho levels and tiir length um in these same women and there is a very direct relationship with um a very tight correlation between shorter tiir and lower clotho levels so there may be some convergence around um these different Hallmarks of Aging maybe some relationship of them regulating each other um or maybe they're changing in parallel it's hard to say um but here's some really good news um that in talking and thinking about what changes clotho levels um we do know that stress

[00:20:56] Associates with with lower clotho level levels um but one of the most robust interventions that increases clotho levels is exercise um it's been shown in study after study um and in metaanalysis it's been done in about 12 studies but um the data are that in after 12 weeks of what's called what people call chronic exercise that clotho levels increase by about 30% um and maybe even increase in a study with preliminary data in mice they can even double acutely after a 45 minute um treadmill run so um and and how it's increased like unknown but it's beginning to be thought of as an exor kind something that is produced and released in the body following exercise how would this stack up in your mind compared to something else that we would think of along these bdnf where you know if you I've talked about this at length on the podcast of course if you really look objectively at all of the modifiable behaviors around dementia uh routinely exercise is at the absolute top of the list uh more potent even in its magnitude than lipid management glucose management and hypertension all of which themselves are enormously uh powerful but something about exercise seem seems even greater it could be that it indirectly mediates at least two of those three but of course people point to something else that's going on and bdnf is often discussed do you think that maybe part of that effect is clotho and do you think that the effect of clotho may be even more potent I was recently asked the same question at um at an

[00:22:50] Alzheimer's conference um at the sock Institute and I don't know the answer but I think it's a really important question um is there a relationship between clotho and bdnf does one mediate it does clotho increase bdnf levels in the brain I don't know um bdnf has a very striking effect in the brain maybe Dena just tell folk tell folks a bit about bdnf because

[00:23:16] I sometimes I forget that maybe not everybody listening to us today has also listened to all of the other content over the years uh so maybe just give folks a little bit of a primer on bdnf as well sure so dnf is brain derived neurotrophic factor and um and it has been shown in the brain to really be associated with even drive um like positive brain health so um intermittent fasting increases bdnf in the brain exercise increases bdnf bdnf if you give bdnf to the brain the neurons function better um it's a it's a really good Tropic factor for the brain brain and um and it does remind one of of clotho and effects of clotho and in fact intermittent fasting simultaneously increases clotho in the brains of mice along with u with bdnf how long do the mice need to fast to get that effect so this work was done um at the sock and um the mice fasted for 24 hours wow so so not really something we can translate to humans given that that's I mean 24 hours in a mouse is you know that's half the distance to death so that's uh you know no but this is a real problem this is a real problem with extrapolating from mice data right is e even a 12-hour fast in a mouse is a is an overwhelming feat of calorie deprivation uh 20 24 hours is staggering

[00:24:54] I mean that's I don't we don't have a way to translate that to hum but that that it could be that that's on the order of weeks um so I just want to make sure people aren't listening to this thinking hey all I got to do is Skip breakfast and I'm getting the same amount of bdnf or clotho that I would get from a 45 minute workout my guess is those two are not even in the same ZIP code right yeah well I I mean so I I would think I think differently about it so when I think about um Mouse time and mouse lifespan I think I believe that they are so they live to 2 to three years um but

[00:25:32] I believe that they're aging faster that they just have they have a shorter Lifan but but um but I think it's possible that their 24-hour lives are similar to our 24-hour lives but they'll usually but but you know 48 Hours of of fasting will usually kill a mouse right with 48 hour I don't know how long a mouse can go I I used to be more fasile with literature but I pay less and less attention to Mouse literature now than I used to but I and and maybe you know obviously someone listening to this could could could could write in and correct me but but I don't think it's a stretch to say that 48 Hours put put it this way what I do remember is um an

[00:26:16] IRB would would really scrutinize an investigator who's trying to get to 36 hours of of fasting in a mouse it's a really big deal you know we don't do fasting studies in mice but but I would agree that in general it you know we have to be careful when extrapolating from from mice to humans I do think that in the area of cognition and neurodegenerative diseases that um that's that studying mice and mouse brains and their neural circuits and their hippocampi and their prefrontal cores tell us fundamental things about

[00:26:55] The Human Condition um they particularly because they have to have very strong navigation strategies and memories for foraging for coming back to their nests and these memory circuits are very very fundamental and and and quite preserved um up up to non-human primates including us but having said that um and we do the majority of our work in mice and um we are always aware of are we doing something that is important to

[00:27:28] The Human Condition is it relatable to The Human Condition is it relevant um who cares does well any of this matter these are always on my mind these questions particularly as a physician scientist and there are certainly limitations that I also think that there are many strengths particularly in studying U memory and neural circuits in the brain but we don't stop there and um we have tested whether I haven't talked yet about um what we have found in mice but I'll I'll just spill the beans and say that we found early on that clotho enhances cognition in Mouse brains and um and in a very recent study we um collaborated with biotech and yel

[00:28:16] University and found that actually clotho enhances um learning in memory and cognition in Old monkeys um in a very um complex brain genetically diverse anatomically diverse functionally complex that in a brain like ours that clotho had very similar effects to what we see in mice well I I there's so much

[00:28:40] I want to come back to on that topic because I've seen all of these data of course and truthfully they seem overwhelmingly positive um but let's go back and and kind of use some of the mice data to you know allow us to speak speak about um maybe greater insights around the the the causal relationship between clotho and brain health so we've already established a few facts here so you're going back to the discovery of clotho in 97 which was based on effectively a knockout um we saw that that that is incompatible with a long life um and we saw that the reverse when uh clotho was enhanced I believe you said it enhanced lifespan by about 30% and uh again that's really remarkable in a mouse um there aren't many things that enhance Mouse lifespan by that much that's you know that again that's that's that's up there with the most Draconian caloric restriction uh Rapa

[00:29:46] Administration under certain settings so that's that's a very reproducible and robust finding um let's talk a little bit about um specific fix to brain health kind of what you're talking about with respect to um not a disease State per se but just enhancing cognition in an aging Mouse uh or even in a in a middle-aged

[00:30:11] Mouse this is where we started and we started with the hypothesis that that in these mice that overexpress clotho that live longer that maybe these mice would be resilient to alzheimer's toxins that was our starting point and so we backcrossed Alzheimer's models with clotho overexpressing models to create mice who have um mous Heimer and then have mous Heimer plus lots of clotho and then we had normal mice and normal mice with lots of clotho so there were four experimental groups and to our complete surprise the normal group groups that means the we're not talking about the mice that had um Alzheimer's model Alzheimer's but in the normal groups that had higher levels of clotho versus normal levels of that group showed a remarkable difference a remarkable statistically significant difference across multiple cognitive tasks um and across different ages and that was that the mice that overexpressed clotho that live longer were smarter so you put them in a maze they could map the room better

[00:31:33] Escape quicker not because they were swimming faster not because they could see better but because they were remembering and learning more efficiently um and better um and it was that was a complete surprise I remember the day unblinding the data analyzing it it was it was unimaginable can can I add a point here DEA I just want add a point

[00:31:59] Sor sorry to interrupt but it's so powerful you a moment ago said this was statistically significant which of course it was and too often I think people hear the term statistically significant and um I think they can be forgiven for confusing it with clinically significant but as you know those are not necessarily the same thing and I almost think that in this case

[00:32:22] Dena stating that it is statistically significant which it is almost under cells what I think the magnitude of the differences are I have a friend um who likes to point out that the really powerful stuff in biology is the stuff that you don't actually need to do the statistics on you know when the Delta is so big that you don't need to whip out the student T Test and calculate the P value to make sure you're not being fooled which by the way is very important and you should be doing it it every time but when it's actually just a formality because the answer is so clear looking at the data that's the really big aha moment and I I think I'd be safe in saying that that was the case here wasn't it you're right um you know we tend to be really conservative we don't want to make um an error and um and and um but having said that you're totally right I mean I can imagine the graphs now and and there were like nonoverlapping data points right I didn't need to run the um the repeated measures between subjects and Nova to to really know that it was statistically significant it was that type of a finding um so it's a point well made um but you know sometimes sometimes um experiments will show you those differences and then the next time you do it they don't um and um you know someone who runs the water maze is is um wearing a new cologne and the mice get stressed out and it's not that the data don't rep I mean they they don't always repeat and are not always replicable um this is a case that um I it was amazing but you know was it going to replicate was it going to be true in different cognitive tasks asked what would happen in aging Mouse like all of these questions opened up um and um and we iterated and we did experiment after experiment and the data held strong in mice that clotho ere expression really enhanced their cognition in young mice in aging mice in mice that modeled

[00:34:52] Alzheimer's disease and um also in my in a publication that's in peer review now but also in mice that model Parkinson's disease that overexpression of clotho enhanced cognition and it um it is really a remarkable finding I um I think it's one of um it it may be one of the most important findings in my professional career well I I would go one step further um I I feel like it's one of the most important findings in brain health period I mean it's um on some levels it's a bit of a mystery to me why this isn't known by everyone it's part of why I'm really really happy to be sitting down with you um and why I've wanted to sit down with you for you know the better part of six months and I know that between my schedule and yours it took a minute to get us on the on the schedule but this is such a big deal um

[00:35:50] I also want to reiterate something you said a moment ago and I I say this and we'll we'll be linking to all of these studies so people can see the data for for themselves but the reproducibility coupled with the magnitude of the effect so the consistent enormous magnitude of difference across studies across Labs across investigators that signals something is going on here again not to bring up rapy again which people hear me talk about a lot but people say why are you so confident in ramy's geroprotective effects the magnitude of benefit is enormous and it doesn't seem to matter who does the study right if it's done in this part of the country or this part of the world or with this animal or with that animal it always seems to work now that doesn't guarantee it's going to work in humans I be the first to admit that but boy I feel a lot better when it works in every model system virtually every time and when it passes the eyeball test and you don't need the error bars and the P values so let's talk a little bit about before we go to primates and ultimately to the epidemiology in humans let's talk about mechanism of action tell me what you think is happening with this soluble clotho protein um I assume it's crossing the bloodb brain barrier or it wouldn't be having this effect uh has that been easily demonstrated it's um it is a winding story

[00:37:28] Peter and um and one that's exciting and has led us to very um unanticipated findings I first wanted to mention as we think about how different interventions May converge um upon the same biology or relate to the same biology it is interesting that mice treated with rap ayin have increased clotho levels um so rap aice and either directly or indirectly will increase clotho levels just thinking about the convergence of biology now um how does clotho enhance cognition in a young aging and diseased brain and um that immediately became um a major question for my lab and many other labs and um the very first thing that we had turned to was um was a component of nmda receptors so nmda receptors um are really key in connections between neurons and when they're stimulated they let in calcium into a neuron and they um allow essentially a potentiation of a neuron for connections to form for functional connections to form and really for like the the neural substrate of memory to form so nmda receptors are really key and there's a component of nmda receptors called glu2 to be it's a subunit um I I'm really um I'm really going tiny and molecular here but it's it's very important because I had remembered that there was something called a Doogie Hower Mouse kind of affectionately called a Doogie Hower

[00:39:14] Mouse and that in that we're kind of dating ourselves here because there's going to be a lot of listeners who don't know who Doogie Hower is but so I it to say this was a prodigious Mouse yes so it was a mouse that was smart very there are very few model systems where you can actually you can um really pivit the system to make a engineer a mouse to be smarter there are very very few things clotho one so this glue n2b overx expressing mouse or the doogy Houser Mouse um showed a very similar phenotype to the clotho overexpressing mouse so when I looked at the behavioral data of the glue n2b overexpressing Mouse um in the very same test it was performing very well just like the clotho overexpressing mice so I just wondered whether clotho was acting through glue n2b to enhance cognition that was the hypothesis in this case um the hypothesis turn we we gathered data that supported the hypothesis there wasn't a big surprise and that overexpressing clotho caused a it caused an increase in glue n2b at the synapse at the area where brain cells connect and led to a more efficient um connection and memory formation synaptic plasticity um at the level of the neural cell so this Glu n2b was really important when we blocked Glu n2b with multiple pharmacologic Inhibitors we um abated Clos ability to enhance cognition so that was one clue but here was here was the um here is the major head scratcher so

[00:41:09] Peter clotho is expressed and the kidney is also expressed in the brain um secreted through the corid plexus which also makes the fluid for the brain that the the brain sits in but but clotho does not cross the bloodb brain barrier um we have looked others have looked um through Auto radiography through IP and Western blot we've looked through many imunohistochemistry we looked through many different methods and and um and can see very clearly that it doesn't cross into the brain however when we give a shot of clotho to mice to monkeys um and their arm or their belly doesn't matter if we give them a shot of clotho within 4 hours there is cognitive enhancement and that cognitive enhancement lasts for at least a couple of weeks so how is it that giving peripheral clotho is enhancing brain functions if it's not actually Crossing into the brain that's been a major question that we and others have been working on and um and we have some Clues um that led us in unexpected places um

[00:42:32] I'm happy to talk about one of them if this is I am I am all ears to me this is I mean I didn't want to get to this point yet but I think we're this is the natural time to talk about this and then I think we should you know step back and talk about some other things but yes to me this is the jugular question Dena why is it that when we inject a monkey per peripherally with clotho it spends the next 14 to 19 days in a state of cognitive superiority and that clotho isn't crossing the bloodb brain barrier this is to me the jugular question you're right and um and we have been working on this um I think I think I'll step back and say um it's it's actually amazing right that some that you give something peripherally it has a central action it's not Crossing into the brain um and it's something physiologic that our bodies are used to that we have seen high levels of upon birth and development um it's not a small it's it it does not have known side effects at physiologic levels that have been observed yet um it's very remarkable so what is it doing we hypothesize so I'll just say we don't know yet this is an area of of fervent investigation for us um and others um but we have one clue um in a study that we published recently um in nature aging and this is what we did we said we started with the premise that that maybe clotho was doing something in the blood that then would send a messenger into the brain so maybe there was this messenger of clotho that was actually going into the brain when you when you gave it peripherally and so we did a very simple experiment um we injected mice with clotho and four hours later at the time of cognitive enhancement we did an agnostic profiling of the proteins in their PL Plasma in their blood and um what we found was was um was sort of unimaginable it was unimaginable in that we found that all of these platelet factors were increased with clotho injection in the blood and Peter I have to be honest when

[00:45:18] I saw this um agnostic data set I um turned my postto and I said I'm really not interested in this I am not interested in looking at platelets you know they are involved in wound healing their coagulation factors I just like this is weird um I had a postto Kaa Park who is very persistent and said let me try like let me just study this for a little bit I said go for it I could see your passion sorry one one question Dena just to ask in parallel did you do the same multiomic observation of the CSF in the mice in parallel to see if there was something new that was showing up in the

[00:46:06] CSF to parallel the platelet factors in the plasma yes we did and it's a great question we haven't published this yet um but we did in the same mice we took their blood and we took their CSF okay um and um and what we found is that clotho increase these plates factors it was um totally bizarre um I didn't believe it I tend not to believe data like need to see things over and over again need to see functional studies I need to see it matters I tend not to believe data but there it was she repeated the findings um many different ways she took um she did she repeated the finding in many different ways but ultimately what she did was a series of studies um demonstrating that this biology is real that clotho is actually activating platelets very modestly and releas and then when a platelet is activated so let's say let's first just step back and and what is a platelet a platelet is an a-clear cell in our blood um and it contains little compartments of bioactive chemicals um chemokines and when a platelet is stimulated or activated it actually releases these factors and it does so in a context dependent way so when there is a cut um or a wound there is a huge activation of platelets and they release all sorts of factors that help with the clotting and help with the wound healing so that's what they're that's what they're traditionally known for but it turns out Peter that when we exercise our platelets are activated and they're releasing factors that travel into the brain I mean who would have who would have thought that platelets could be messengers of brain health and could take Center Stage as as a messenger of brain health so when we exercise this was found by an Australian group led by Tara Walker that when we exercise platelets are activated and certain platelet factors one of them being platelet Factor 4 is released and travels to the brain and actually um causes neurogenesis or the production of new neurons in the brain that was very new data and with that data in mind I felt too like maybe there's something to this clotho platelet connection maybe there's something to it so Kaa isolated platelets she put clotho on them they released pf4 this platelet Factor 4 the same one that the Australian group had shown and then she gave this platelet Factor 4 to mice young aging mice she gave it to them as a shot in the belly just like we used we have given clotho and she found that that platelet Factor 4 enhanced cognition in a young Mouse and in an aging Mouse and It reversed cognitive deficits and it was totally remarkable and this is where it gets weirder and

[00:49:29] Wilder so I go to my colleague and close friend salv here at UCSF he's the um young blood and old brain um scientist so he's he's really built a um really nice body of experiments in literature showing that if you give Young Blood to an old mouse it rejuvenates their brain so Saul is studying brain Rejuvenation

[00:49:53] Through Blood and I'm having coffee with him and I'm I saids Saul we've found something so interesting I have to tell you about it and I go on to tell him about pf4 clotho stimulates platelets platelets release P4 P4 enhances the brain and he said well he was silent for a second and he said Dena we found the same thing with young blood and that when we give Young Blood to Old mice that young blood is enriched for platelet Factor 4 which declines in aging and then we give platelet Factor 4 we rejuvenate the old brain and if you think that's a remarkable convergence of biology wait till I tell you that terara Walker and

[00:50:42] Australia had found the same thing with exercise and this is all at the same time that exercise was increasing pf4 and that when she gave pf4 to old mice it enhanced their cognition and so all of us who are close friends and colleagues now have an incredible convergence of biology where clotho young blood and exercise we're activating platelets releasing pf4 P4 is enhancing the brain and as an aside like the biology was just amazing um and each of us had our own um unique approaches and unique way of of digging into the biology but a practical question Peter was like what are we going to do like are we competitors now or are we going to hold hands and go through the publication process together like are you going to screw me am I G to screw you like how is this going to come out and what we did is um I think a really nice um example and model in biology where we held hands and we said let's just stick together we went to editors um we went through a couple of years of revisions and reviews but at the end of the day all three papers came out in the in the nature family of journals on the same day um and I it made for an impactful

[00:52:12] Splash um and it also just highlighted the convergence of the biology the reproducibility of the biology um again this will never happen again in my lifetime but this was amazing and complete surprise that platelet factors could play a role here so so let's talk a little bit more about this so um platelet Factor 4 is increased by all of these three things do we believe that it's platelet

[00:52:43] Factor 4 that is directly acting on glue n2b then is that the actual and and and if so what do you think is happening at the at the level of substrate and receptor yes that's where we went next with the biology and the experiments and when we so one question was does platelet Factor 4 actually cross into the brain and we demonstrated that it does we gave it peripherally we um immediately looked into the brain and saw that it was ending up near neural cells or even within neural cells um so it's Crossing into the brain and then does it act directly into in the brain was the next question and what um one of my lab members did is take hippocampal slices so the hippocampus is the area of the brain um that is really executing the learning in memory and is targeted by aging and diseases of Aging so he took hippocampus and then he put platelet factor for on it and saw immediately within seconds actually there was a well

[00:54:04] I don't know within seconds but but quite immediately maybe seconds maybe minutes um there was a change in the membrane potential and more calcium was being led in and we thought maybe this would be glue n2b um acting and so we put on Glu n2b Inhibitors and platelet Factor 4 no longer potentiated the synapse or enhanced the neural function um so we we do know that PL platelet Factor 4 like clotho is working through glue n2b and maybe clotho is working through platelet

[00:54:43] Factor 4 to change glue n2b and sorry has that same experiment been done Dena to look at the clotho that is derived from the chide plexus to say when you dump clotho directly onto glue n2b you see an influx of calcium when you block glue n2b you abgate the effect as well so you now have two things platelet

[00:55:08] Factor 4 and clotho that can independently do the same thing is that is that a correct statement well it's you know it's a we haven't done that experiment yet so all of our work on clotho has been through peripheral well that's not true um we've done transgenic overexpression in the brain um and we've done clotho peripherally we haven't dumped clo itself onto the hippocampus I see to see whether there can be a direct effect um other groups have overexpressed clotho specifically in the brain and seen cognitive enhancement but I haven't seen studies seeing whether clotho is actually directly influencing glue and we know that it indirectly influences glue and 2B we know that we can give it peripherally and it'll increase synaptic plasticity through glue and 2B but we don't know whether it can actually directly do that too it may based on other people's um based on other people's studies it may we don't know but here's here's something else that was actually quite disappointing um but the biology is the biology we then ask the question does cloth rely on pf4 to enhance cognition is it is pf4 required for clotho mediated cognitive enhancement and to do that we generated a colony of mice with pf4 knockout so they they just don't have pf4 and then we gave them clotho versus vehicle always blinded always randomized um through a series of cognitive tests water maze large y maze one maze after another because you like to see the same effect reproduce and what we found um was that clotho continued to enhance cognition even in the absence of platelet Factor 4 and um and to the same extent Dena to the same extent you know you might think there would have been a dimunition but to the same extent and it it just tells us that there's more than one factor this is this has to be such an important pathway and it is so conserved that there is no way biology is going to let one thing be the messenger I'm I'm making all this up of course but hypothesizing that you know you know if clotho is so important it can't be limited to One messenger right it sort of if it gets to the gate and it can't get through it has to have multiple

[00:57:50] Messengers that it can deliver the message to pf4 being one of them but clearly this experiment would suggest that there's at least one other Messenger right right that's that's the interpretation and conclusion because it um it is pf4 is sufficient to not necessary mediated cognitive enhancement but not necessary and so when you go back and look at the first experiment you did the unbiased was that just a proteomic assessment or did you look at all omix did you did how broadly did you sample the serum uh way back and and was there something else you missed because the pf4 was such a big signal was there a smaller signal that was there perhaps as well there there were many signals there are many other platelet factors there are many other proteins um we are systematically Marching through those um we're marching through not just proteins but metabolites um we are also asking in a cell type specific way is um through a system called turbo ID that labels the protein as it's secreted from the liver the kidney the heart from lymphocytes um it's a really unique and elegant um genetic manipulation that does a biotin label once it a protein is secreted let's say from the liver and we're asking when we inject clotho what gets secreted out of the liver and into the plasma so we're doing like higher resolution studies to understand how clotho um really changes the systemic circulation in a cell type specific way and then asking which one of those factors that comes from the kidney the liver the lymphocytes the heart which one of those factors is necessary and required for clotho mediated cognitive enhancement and the answer at the end of the day may may be what you alluded to that there may be many factors that have overlapping functions of cognitive enhancement maybe they work together maybe they work independently but you're right like if this is a if this is a very important biologic function it's not it it really shouldn't rely on just one factor I think that's a a really important point to underline so so Dina tell me a little bit more about this assay the um in vitro assay that you were able to basically sprinkle on pf4 sprinkle on clotho to the glue n2b um subparticle and witness the calcium the massive influx of calcium right um it seems to me that if that assay is is reasonable it could also become a great screening tool to identify rather than having to do the experiments to see if you can enhance cognition at least do your first screen there now you run the risk that if clotho is working through secondary mechanisms you'll miss it right but at least as a first screen hey you know in as much as clotho working through nmda via you know glue n2b let's screen a whole bunch of molecules on it look for the activation and then go back and search for those in a biased way in our serum sample and sort of you you know triangulate back and forth like that right I love it let's do it and we are doing it and um we're doing it with synaptic plasticity as a measure as a substrate of cognition and we're also doing it in vitro at the cellular level using live cell Imaging where we can um isolate neurons from the brain from a mouse brain and then they grow beautifully on a dish they connect with each other um and they survive for weeks on end actually and um you can do live cell Imaging to see whether if you put clotho on I have a graduate student doing this um right now um Barbara Shara who is putting clotho onto neurons and these other factors that we're seeing from the omx onto neurons and seeing whether there is an increase in um the neurite outgrowth and the connections but the physical connections between neurons um again this isn't cognition it's s but it's a substrate of cognition um it may be it may be a distant biomarker for it but it's a it's a really smart way to when you when you're asking a question of if this many proteins you know which ones are important it's a way to screen so with synaptic plasticity and with with um neurite connections with the outgrowth of the neurons connections so so all of this makes a lot of sense for a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease where the primary deficit is a cognitive deficit that seems disproportionately focused in memory um but you mentioned before I distracted us down this rabbit hole that you are also seeing positive signals in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease now are you seeing them in the mild cognitive impairment that can accompany Parkinson's disease or are you seeing it in the movement uh disorder are you seeing an improvement in the in the primary issue associated with

[01:03:29] Parkinson's disease it's a great question and again this part of this is published part of this is in the peer review process um but it's really really exciting to share so these are the experiments we took mice that overexpress alphason nucleon which is a pathogenic player in Parkinson's disease um it dis it's disrupts the synapse and and um has a causitive role in Parkinson's disease because we know that people with mutations and causing overexpression of alphason nucleon can will develop

[01:04:08] Parkinson's disease it's sort of like the equivalent of a in people with Alzheimer's disease where you yeah you have this you know it's not necessarily the dominant driver of the disease but it's it's clearly playing a causal role based on these mutation studies that's right and the mice that I've mentioned that we've used for our Alzheimer's or mous heimer's studies were

[01:04:32] AP mutant over expressors just to just to Pedal back to that so we took these Parkinson's model mice and they have both motor deficits u meaning that um you put them across they walk across a balance beam and they'll fall um if they're put on a root on a spinning rod they're discoordinated they have and they'll fall they have motor difficulty they also have cognitive difficulties um which are not as severe as the Alzheimer's model mice but they do have cognitive difficulties and their ability to um to map a spatial environment and to hold memory in their mind with working memory so they have these deficits we um we did two things we injected them with clotho and remarkably saw that clotho treatment improved their cognition it um it didn't normalize but it it improved by if I'm thinking about the data correctly by maybe 70% or so their cognitive abilities so nearly normalized their cognitive functions it didn't do anything to their motor functions so they continued to have motor dysfunction and clotho did not help that that was also true with the transgenic overexpression of clotho all over the body and brain for a lifetime that that that boarded the cognitive deficits induced by Parkinson's toxicity but it did nothing for the motor problems and

[01:06:19] I've spoken to my um Parkinson's colleagues about this um there's a lot of interest in potentially uh using clotho as a treatment for Parkinson's Disease because you know they tell me in our clinics Dina we you know we can treat the Tremor um and the rigidity but people complain over and over again consistently about the cognitive deficits that we now know are a part of of Parkinson's disease not just later in the disease but even as part of the disease and those deficits specifically are um problems with executive function um which is the ability to um to focus to shift attention um to make certain judgments to think quickly um and it is it is uh mediated by the prefrontal cortex um an area that became important when we looked at human studies so the bottom line was that clotho in in mice clotho really enhanced again cognition but didn't do anything for motor functions is there a mouse model that fits between the Alzheimer's model and the Parkinson's model that is more akin to a Louis body dementia model where it has some of that alphascan pathology uh but also has a much more significant cognitive component um there are so many

[01:07:54] Mouse models Peter I I think that that um a good Mouse model for Louis body would be um alphas nucleon and and maybe more in the brain stem um and the hippocampus and cortex I just I I I bet there is one but I'm not I'm not but a reasonable hypothesis would be again that it would probably provide some relief of the cognitive symptoms though not necessarily the movement symptoms that's right so that's what we're seeing consistently that that one of my friends and colleagues had an interesting analogy of thinking about clotho as a helmet for for neurons that um that whatever came crashing the cell's way whether it was alphason nucleon TOA amalo beta aging stresses that um the neuron was protected it was it remained resilient against multiple toxicities and the effect of clotho is is really in cognition itself um in hippocampal and frontal cortical circuits that um these neurons and glea and other cell types are really protected against multiple toxicities if we want to jump into clinical trials and

[01:09:20] I think this is the time to really U move clotho toward human clinical trials wouldn't it be amazing if we had a cocktail for Alzheimer's disease in addition to um lanam or danab that's removing the amalo beta from the brain what about adding something like clotho that can really help Shore up the functions of the cells no matter because we know that Alzheimer's disease is a multi-protein opathy it's not just one

[01:09:53] Protein that's um that's causing the disease we need factors in our treatment we need cocktails that can really resist multiple protein toxicities so I I just have this dream that um that that people might be able someday to benefit from clotho this this factor that naturally circulates in our body that helps with with longevity that helps with other organ systems and enhances the brain as we know from our monkey studies for weeks at a time um at least a couple of weeks if not more um there was funding for a certain amount of time but it has a long acting action we need to put helmets around the neurons to really um to really Stave off multiple toxicities and and this is clotho this is what clotho does this is what that this is the new job of the Greek fate

[01:10:55] SPS the threat of life it's to protect our brains yeah well you're you're preaching to the uh not just the choir but the fully converted and and obviously in in in in my in my other activities this is this is something that that a lot of my energy goes into um I want to come back to a couple other questions on the mouth study that are going to factor into I think when we talk start to talk about the humans more so uh has the following experiment been done where you you take a mouse that is genetically susceptible to Alzheimer's disease so the equivalent of your a mouse or something like that um and you take a control group uh so so maybe just for my own knowledge if if you took an AP Mouse um at what point in its life uh how many months old before it starts to develop uh a clinical disease uh so so maybe two questions at what point would it start to be a accumulating ameloid in the CSF at how many months of age and then how many

[01:11:59] AIDS when it age when it starts to show cognitive impairment what are those two numbers roughly it depends on the mouse model and there are so many Mouse models of Alzheimer's and including AP models the one that we've used um consistently is it's called the j20 model it's um it expresses human AP which produces amalo beta in mutant forms and it is um it's a more aggressive model Peter and it causes synaptic loss that connection between cells it um really disrupts that connection between cells really early like before 3 months and then it starts producing cognitive deficits um at around 3 to four months and that's the

[01:12:51] J10 the j20 model j20 and um okay so here's my question Dena has the experiment been done where you give those mice clotho starting at Birth at a high dose and does it delay the onset of the inevitability the delaying the onset um we know that through overexpression throughout the brain and body that those mice those those AP mice will have um almost normalized cognition um what I but we don't know whether it's delaying the onset um we we have some um there others that have done human population clinical studies sorry make sure I want to make sure I understand what you just said you're saying if you take the a you take the the j20 the AP mutant and you also cause a mutation that overexpresses cloth though are you are you saying that you've done that in the same Mouse yes tell me about that mouse's lifespan is it normal and is it cognitively normal or does it still get Alzheimer's disease that mouse that has the AP mutation and overexpresses clotho by about three to fourfold yes that Mouse will live much longer um number one so it extends its lifespan number one number two it in it will normalize its cognition across its lifespan remarkably across its lifespan um well let me um at at three months seven months eight months yes it it normalizes its cognition it's very remarkable and then when you look in the brain Peter when you look at levels of amalo beta and of to they're not different from the mice without high levels of clotho that is unbelievable in other words they're brains are still riddled with the

[01:15:13] Alzheimer's toxins but they've been able to really thwart the effects of those toxins because they show normal cognition and if you look at their apses this work was done um in collaboration with Leonard Muki and um Eliz or Masia looked at at he's who's at the NIH now um when when Masia looked at the synapses in these mice they saw he saw that that the synapses were all preserved so again like like this analogy where clao is really providing a helmet around each neuron it really allowed the synapses to be preserved but there was a whole bunch of amalo and TOA still there and that is resilience these toxins are present you know um they won't necessarily go away with clotho at least in mice the story may be different in humans but clotho provided resilience and thwarted the toxicities of Alzheimer disease okay so I'm going to plant the seed with you which we'll come back to but the reason I'm asking this question

[01:16:33] Dena is I do believe that at some point we will have clotho as a drug I do believe I think it's come we're absolutely going to be injecting people with clotho where I'm going to start you know where where we'll go is do we believe this is a drug we will only want to give to people once they have MCI mild for The Listener right so early early early stages or do we believe that we'll take anybody who's susceptible and just be giving them clotho even before there is a demonstrated uh disease risk so that's that's where I want to go with this is kind of thinking you know sort of three or four moves ahead on the chessboard now let's go back and talk about the primates because we've talked about this incredible body of literature in in mice and again I think it's it's reasonable to be uh um you know circumspect around mice literature but again when you start to talk about the volume of literature here and the breadth of mouse models and the number of investigators that consistently find the same results and the magnitude of the results again it passes the eyeball test you don't need to do Anova tables all day long to get the answer and squeak at it um this looks incredible but it would be nice if we had a more convincing model so let's let's talk about the single best thing we can ever do shy of before you know before we get to humans and that's to look at at primat so let's talk a little bit about primate brains and the body of literature around clotho in the in that brain this is this is an area that I wanted so much to get into um I don't work with monkeys and um I think it's a very very specialized field to test cognition in monkeys and so I'll just take us back um almost I a long time ago maybe eight years ago when um I really wanted to know Peter whether clotho can enhance a more complex brain than a mouse brain and like you said myice are um are really important in scientific discovery but there are so many examples of what worked in mice and cured malzer disease failed in humans and that's the Valley of Death Works in mice doesn't translate to humans it's not true for everything and mice have been very very important for fundamental scientific discovery and for medicines but I didn't want to spend my career on something that was not going to be relevant to hum and that might not be that you know big and important thing that that stepen Hower challenged me on when I was a resident so I um I actually was I was pitching this like want to test clotho and primates want to and I all across Silicon

[01:19:43] Valley um from biotech and Pharma to biotech and Pharma and people were um people were curious and enthusiastic about it but um but I tell you one individual really got this um and that was um Ned David um who had started a company Unity biotechnology um to attack aging and um we joined forces they um fundraised they found really great collaborators at Yale and and really made this happen to test clotho and um and cognitive enhancement in a brain like ours you know this and if this didn't when people would tell me

[01:20:31] Dena this like if it doesn't work it's going to kill your research program and I would say let it die then I just like I don't want to spend my career on something that's not important if it's done well we'll know and so this collaboration between biotech me and Yale was one in which a lot of thought a lot of money um went into the design and um the execution so why non-human primates so um rees's mcacs are um are incredible organisms um they sh they um have very complex brains they are more genetically diverse than humans um and that genetic diversity is something that often um that often trumps effects so um can often really influence whether an effect is able to survive genetic diversity or not so having a lot of genetic diversity is very important to really Challenge and test the biology so

[01:21:35] Rees and our mice are inbred they all have the same genetics just to say so the Reis mxs are incredibly genetically diverse more than humans they have a functional um complexity that's very similar to humans in terms of the even more the neural circuits the hippocampus the prefrontal cortex um and they have an anatomic complexity that's pretty similar to us so by testing clotho and non-human primates the idea was to jump over this

[01:22:09] Valley of Death if it worked in primates let's look toward humans if not let's do something else so so I just want I want to pause there for a second Dena I mean I think obviously The Listener can imagine where this story is going but um that's a huge burn your ships moment um and um I want I want to I want to just spend a minute probing that a little bit more and and um look you're you were a wildly successful investigator before this um I don't think it's um an obvious step that you would take to push that much further because let's be clear if clotho had failed miserably in primates you're like how many phds and postdocs and students do you have in your lab we're a group of around fluctuates between um 7 to 11 yeah and obviously you probably have a very well-oiled machine at generating r1s and all sorts of

[01:23:22] Grants um it's not easy to start all over again if all of that dries up right that's why it was so risky and some people me this is like you know just go to a human trial you know um you can do biomarkers and and but but this is risky and it is risky if it's not done well but it's super informative even if it's negative um really really informant I negative data if it's good negative data and not because the experiments were done in a sloppy way it's good negative data then it's it really tells you something and um you know we have other projects on longevity we study why women live longer than men what is a second X chromosome have to do with it um and there are other longevity factors um so it was really important to push forward and to push forward in a rigorous way and also with that with the knowledge that um that the results could really change the direction of of what we're doing but you know Peter um we have these I don't know we have times in our lives where we reflect on what we're doing how we're spending our time um is it with people that we appreciate is it with doing things that are meaningful um and it may be deeply philosophical but you know from day to day like I really want to be doing something that I have a lot of faith in and that potentially has meaning um for The Human

[01:25:05] Condition to improve human health and if and if we've done a really great experiment that's negative um and there's really reason to believe that this isn't going to go forward then that's fine you know we will mourn it and we will still move forward with something else but um but we just don't have just don't have lifetimes you know to to devote to all you know hundred different scientific projects so we have to be very choosy and I really really wanted to make sure that this is something really worth putting time energy resource passion constant thought training um fundraising I think the reason I'm pointing this out Dena is I want to uh publicly commend you for something that honestly I don't think most scientists would be willing to do and I I I I wouldn't even Hazard a guess at the fraction but I think there are a lot of scientists who have lost sight of what you just said and um they think the job is doing science but it's not the job is is knowledge creation the job is knowledge creation for the purpose of making lives better and those are very different things they over La APAP the fir the former is a process to the latter but it's very easy and I'm you know it's very easy to to lose sight of that in the in the weeds um so again I I just I only call it out to say I don't I think I I don't I don't think everybody would have made the come to the same conclusion you did so with that said let's talk about how you and your colleagues uh at Yale and um but you know basically thought of the right question to ask and then the right design of an experiment to ask the right question first I just want to say thank you um and that is very well said um and and to the to the monkeys so um monkeys undergo cognitive decline in a very similar parallel fashion to humans um they have synaptic loss the connection between neurons um with aging as do humans do and the circuits that are affected in aging are really similar to the human circuits so they are um the hippocampal frontal circuits the hippocampus and the frontal loes and aging will preferentially Target working memory um and and also spatial memory and other types of memory but this working memory holding something in your mind you go to the refrigerator you open the door and you think why why did

[01:28:07] I come here what was holding that that immediate memory in your mind is something that that aging really targets and monkeys undergo this a very similar cognitive decline to humans and there are ways to test monkeys that interrogate those circuits u in this case um a spatial delayed task was used Graham Williams and Stacy Kastner conducted the studies and um and the fact and clotho actually preferentially targets those circuits that aging erodes so here so here is a model system it's genetically anatomically functionally complex it undergos cognitive aging parallel to humans and there are really well-developed tests um by these exceptional scientists um who who are who are very um experienc and Adept at conducting these tests and so it was a really uh it was an excellent setup to ask can clotho enhance cognition in these aging monkeys and so what they did what was done is um something called a spatial delayed um response and the monkey is presented with a a bin of multiple

[01:29:43] Wells and one and sometimes there's a few Wells and sometimes there's a lot of wells and it's harder when there's a lot of Wells to find a treat so a treat is placed in in a well and they can see you place the treat and then a screen drops and then at some point and then all the bins are covered so you can't now you cannot see where all the wells are covered you cannot see where the treat is and then um and then the blind is opened and they are tested where to choose because they're

[01:30:19] Bas basing this on spatial memory and on working memory where that treat was um again it's a little easier if there's only three Wells it's easier to choose one out of three and get it correct it's harder when there's nine Wells to to to remember spatial and working memory where that treat was so what was found so it was done very rigorously I must say so um the study was largely blinded um and it was done in a way in which um injections would the in of clotho wouldn't interfere with causing stress in memory so that everyone got a baseline they then got a vehicle and then they got vehicle or clotho so like a just a really well-designed study in 18 monkeys and just for folks listening vehicle is Placebo so that they understand what we mean by that thank you um so the monkeys that that that got a clotho treatment again again largely blinded performed better than the ones that got vehicle treatment sry Dena how did you guys decide how to raise the dose so first of all when you obviously did all the mice experiments you're dosing like you probably do based on a certain number of milligrams per kilogram or milligrams per gram of of animal um what what did you use to dose escalate that did you just assume the same dose per unit body weight or did you make other adjustments we went with um well we went with with two things in mind one is we really wanted to stay at least with one dose in a physiologic Range so with something that the body has been been you been exposed to and has seen over its lifetime and so we so in one dose we wanted to go somewhere up to like maybe four to five y yeah exactly so sort of you're still just below what they would have been born at right y so very useful level of cloth O A rejuvenating dose and then the other doses were higher and Were Meant to test you know could you really push the system um to improve cognition even more than um than what is observed um with with with that physiologic dose by the way that physiologic dose that sort of natural dose is what we have always used in mice um and I should say we've also given mice huge huge doses that were Way

[01:33:09] Beyond what they would ever see or were used to and it still enhanced cognition in mice and that's going to be different than the monkey Story by the way when you gave the super physiologic doses to mice so presumably 10 fold and Beyond um did you run into any problems for example did the mice ever develop antibodies to the protein did they did did did anything else arise that that would suggest that more is not always better we didn't see signals in mice um we we did not see signals in mice no but having said that we didn't systematically study whether whether doses of 100 you know micrograms per kilogram was doing something different we we didn't observe differences in their like normal behaviors um or like in their basic kind of blood work but it worked it didn't work better so I should say like the super low doses work just as well as the super high doses in mice um which was very interesting and super low doses mean well below 3x normal uh sorry three like like so so if we just call 6X the peak physiologic dose what what was the minimum effective dose in mice relative to that the minimum effective dose so let me think about this so would have been like more than five times less wow so like a very very small dose that still worked um I'm thinking if we gave gave mice 10 microgr per kilogram I'm remembering something like um like 0.5 or 1 enhanced cognition wow okay2 micrograms enhanced cognition so very very low um just a touch more just a boost enhanced cognition um but we stayed our our strategy was to stay with within a physiologic dose and make sure that that was represented in the monkey studies and um consulted I mean really thought about this consulted with people that have that have taken drugs to

[01:35:29] Market um Tom Boon is one of them and was very instructive and um and um taught me a lot in terms of thinking about thinking about relevantly dosing in monkeys and then there were higher doses that created um that created much higher doses than the body has seene which is uh like maybe 10 times higher and Beyond 10 maybe 20 times higher and Beyond and what we found is that that the the low physiologic that natural dose of clotho enhanced cognition in the monkeys and it did So within four hours and then that cognition stayed better their ability to think remember um stayed better for at least 3 weeks 14 to 21 days and some were even tested out to I saw 28 days yeah so um and then at some point you know the study had to be stopped it's a million dollars and more and so but it was remarkable that that one subq dose like like a shot of AIC would be given you know a subq do that was low physiologic had an immediate effect on cognitive enhancement that lasted for um lasted for a very long time now um there were there were a few different types of tests done one was for normal memory load and one was for high memory load and the high memory load is was a test with a lot of different bins where they had to remember which one among seven or eight Wells was the treat hidden in um it's just more taxing um with more choices to remember and they did even better in that study of high memory load with a low dose with the low dose um so the effect was particularly pronounced um they were particularly smarter when the task became harder and again you know why this task why monkeys why clotho it all came together because clotho works on these circuits that are tested in the monkeys that decline with aging and with neurodegenerative diseases like

[01:38:04] Alzheimer's and Parkinson's so what about the high dose right so the high dose did not work um the high doses that gave us that gave the monkeys clotho Way Beyond what they've seen in their lifetime they didn't harm they did not impair cognition but they didn't help cognition and it's not too much of a stretch to think that too much of something that does multiple things in the body and maybe multiple Pathways that could just create an imbalance that doesn't support cognitive function again it wasn't harmful um with the measures that we tested but it didn't help to take so much more um than the body has seen and is used to and that again was different from the mice with the mice and this this may be a different but a big difference between mice and and um and a more complex brain um with the non-human primate in mice we we saw continued cognitive enhancement and in monkeys we really got a window into um you know before going into clinical trials that that if we're giving clotho probably should be thinking about a specific therapeutic window one that the body knows one the body is used to so Dena why do you think the effect lasts for so long this is also a little counterintuitive when you consider the hourly variation of clock naturally when you consider the transient effects potentially of things like exercise where you see these large boosts over you know a short period of time following about of exercise but it seems hard to imagine that the benefits of an hour of exercise persist 3 weeks later the way a subcutaneous injection of clotho did so what what do you think accounts for that I don't know the answer but I'll spe speculate first I'll just say it's remarkable isn't it um it's particularly remarkable as we imagine

[01:40:32] Therapeutics in that maybe this is the type of treatment um of Rejuvenation that could be administered maybe once a month once every three months as um as a shot in the arm for example so I think it has really important therapeutic implications mechanistically this means that clotho has not just an acute effect of immediately enhancing enhancing nmda receptor functions synaptic plasticity cognitive function at 4 hours but it has an organizational effect it's doing something to in the longer term really help to for example remodel a synapse to help so I would imagine that um that ver example with glue n2b being trafficked to the synapse and to um to promote better functions that those sort of synaptic organizational effects um are happening for and staying put for a longer period of time I think the biology of this organizational effect of cloth though has yet to be um discovered um but it's something that's happening at the synapse I I'm

[01:41:55] I I have a very strong um sense of of it's something that's happening organizationally structurally at the synapse you know as as much as I want to go deeper into that and talk about the the confirmational changes that could be occurring we'll we'll have to save that for another discussion because where we have to really go next is you know what do we think about in humans and what evidence do we have have because we do have some really interesting evidence even absent a single experiment that everything we've talked about so far might indeed also uh be relevant to the species of interest and no disrespect to the mice and the Mako but there aren't too many people listening to this whose mind isn't already wondering okay enough about the animals already tell me is this going to make a difference for my mom or for my dad who were in The early stages of dementia is this going to make a difference for me because of my risk factors even though it's 20 years from now and so tell me a little bit about a particular snip associated with the clotho gene called KVs and what its significance is to this story sure well you um really described well why and like none of this matters Peter if it doesn't have potential to help The Human

[01:43:26] Condition it just doesn't matter you know it's interesting and but um but the big and important um is if it's relevant and may work in humans I don't I don't know whether we've done anything big until we test PL in humans um so with that said in the early back in the early days in um I I think it was 2012 or so when these or 2011 2012 when these first clotho studies were we were doing them in mice and and discovering these cognitive enhancing effects I went to and again I'm a physician scientist I always have humans in mind I have my patients in mind um

[01:44:12] Alzheimer's disease 50 million people around the world this is going to Triple by 2050 cognitive decline is our biggest biomedical challenge um always have humans in mind and I went to my um my friend and colleague Jennifer yokoyama at the meman Aging Center here at UCSF and I told her that there there was this genetic variant of clotho that had been found and we'll we can talk more about what that is but was there a way because she's a geneticist and she and others at the memory and aging Center

[01:44:48] Joel Kramer Bruce Miller have built this incredible population of individuals and patients um with Alzheimer's disease with normal aging with front of temporal dementia and they really carefully characterize them their genetics um their blood biomarkers Etc so I went to Jennifer and I said is there any way we can know whether this genetic variant of cloth o

[01:45:16] KVs has any association with cognition because that would mean that there that this clotho is is important to brain like it would mean that there was some link with humans and brain health so what is klvs that you mentioned um and what does it associate with so um as we've discussed we all have clotho circulating in our blood um and around our brain but some of us about one to four one to five of us will have will carry a Gene for clotho a genetic code for clotho that leads to higher levels of production and that is and KVs refers to two um single nucleotide um polymorphisms that cause a difference in the coding of the protein itself um again so about 1 to four one to five of us will have KVs other people are non carriers and those people with KVs will genetically have higher levels of clotho circulating in their blood now interestingly it's only the people with one copy of KVs the heterozygotes and very rarely there are homozygotes of KVs and those people um end up having multiple disadvantages in lifespan and um vulner ability to different diseases so when we talk about

[01:46:55] KVs we're talking specifically about heterozygosity carrying one Al of it sorry what what are some of the health consequences of being homozygous and what is the prevalence of homozygosity it's really rare So if the prevalence of heterozygosity is um around 25% in populations homozygosity is so it's probably about 1 to 2% because actually it would kind of mirror APO E4 where the heterozygosity is about the same right it's about one in four and the homozygosity is about one in one in 50 to one in a 100 yeah that's about right um it it is it's pretty rare but it exists and and um those people have shorter lifespans they have much lower levels of clotho um and they are at risk for anything that the heterozygosity helps with the homozyg homozygosity hurts so um so but the heterozygosity has been a really interesting window into clotho and and natural experiments of and how how much higher is their clotho level well we did this study we um

[01:48:20] Jennifer and I um took this serum from individuals here at the memory and aging Center um a few hundred and tested the ones that were non-carriers that just have the typical cloog gen versus the KVs heterozy carriers and um the heterozy carrier status increased clotho Levels by about 15% 15 maybe 20% and just to give you context if you're wondering am my carrier and you know some people are and some people aren't I don't want people to forget that exercise is the is thus far one of the more powerful modulators of clotho expression and exercise increases clotho on average by 30% so much more than what the genetic influence is but nonetheless um KVs increases clotho

[01:49:17] Levels by about 15% so for example if an average number uh let's say a non-carrier had 800 picograms per Mill of cloos circulating in their serum um a klvs carrier might have like 950 or so um picograms per Mill that's what I'm remembering from our graphs um so it does increase clotho and um there's reason to believe that it increases clotho because because those two um amino acid changes that Translate um into a different amino acid in the protein itself um influences secretion of clotho from cells so there is a biologic reason um that this variant um is probably changing cloth levels the other piece to this story Dina that's just so fascinating is now when you take those data the prevalence of heterozygosity of klvs and you cross it with apoe4 so now we have you know listeners of this podcast are absolutely not strangers to the populationbased risk of apoe4 of course we always want to remind people that at the individual level very difficult to make that statement but at the populationbased level we know that having uh an apoe3 and an apoe4 is at least a doubling of of risk maybe even slightly more um and and homos osity for apoe4 could be an 8 to 12 fold increase so call it a log order increase in Risk so tell me what did you find in people who are homozygous and heterozygous for apoe4 who also happen to be heterozygous

[01:51:11] I.E have the favorable variant of klvs single copy yeah this is really remarkable data I first want to um to go back to that original experiment um that we published in 2014 I believe with with um Jennifer and that those people with that that carried the klvs alil did better across cognitive testing just and this is a normal aging this was not an Alzheimer's disease but carrying that variant carrying klvs associated with better cognition across the board and if you look at

[01:51:54] I'm often asked well how much smarter does it you know were those individuals and I would be careful about you know smarter and happier and we don't know but the cognitive test showed us that they did better and they did um they did better to the same extent that apoe4 carriers would do worse so it was a sort of a a similar um it was a a similar amount of change in cognition in which KVs was improving and apo4 was decreasing so with that in the background since then um many groups um and many people have examed have looked at KVs in their populations and that Association has held largely in most studies not in all but in most studies there is an association of KVs and better cognition with um heterozygosity so then the question comes that you asked about APO E4

[01:53:00] Alzheimer's risk and clotho and KVs and um we did uh we initially did a study and collaboration actually led by um o cono and his group at Wisconsin that showed that um that in individuals with um with apoe4 that were carriers of klvs that they just had um less of the effects of AO E4 in terms of less a beta deposition less cognitive problems it was a smaller study of a few hundred people at risk for Alzheimer's disease but it was a good study but I'll tell you the study that I'm most excited about that we um were not a part of and that is that came from Stanford um led by Mikel belloy he's one to watch he just established a lab at wasu and um his um senior Pi Michael gracius um and they're Wizards at doing genetic population studies so Peter they did this remarkable study um of 22 different cohorts that were normal cognition MCI mild cognitive impairment that you mentioned earlier in

[01:54:22] Alzheimer's disease over 20,000 individuals um a very large metaanalysis and they looked at um and they looked at if there was a relationship between KVs um carriers and apoe4 and the bottom line of what they found was that if an individual carried KVs the apoe4 or didn't matter so let me break down what that actually meant in their experiment that meant um that in those people that carry apoe4 if they were also heterozy for

[01:55:15] KVs they had um a decreased risk for developing El Alzheimer's disease that was pretty close to the normal population they had a decreased conversion from MCI to ad and they had decreased um Alzheimer's biomarkers both in their CSF and in their brain they just had less amalo beta um it was uh it's a really striking study again because it has the power of statistical analysis it holds across many many cohorts and it's many many people and you know it's um klvs essentially blocks and abreg the apoe4 toxicity by this

[01:56:12] Association um by this genetic Association it's really remarkable did the double e4s did the homozygotes reduce to a completely normal 33 risk my my recollection but it's been a while since I looked at the the there's a graph that you know demonstrates all of this that's that's a a great summary my recollection which could be wrong that's why I'm asking was that the three fours were completely abated to a 33 risk and that the four fours ended up coming way down but they still looked like more of a three4 am I misremembering that well and this is this is why it's um it's they didn't actually publish that um they excluded the homozygotes from the analysis um but and it might be in a supplement somewhere um but I actually reached out to Mikel and I asked him about the 44 I had the same question um and so this is um this is just by verbal communication he indicated that the 44 also a associated with with the protection from the KBS heterozygosity so that that the effect of having one apoe4 wasn't different than H um having two Apo e4s in terms of

[01:57:36] KVs protection it protected in both heterozygosity and homozygosity of the APO E4 again it's it's um again just through verbal communication it might have been in a supplement somewhere so did they find anything negative so going way back to the mechanism of this which at least in part is communicated through a platelet

[01:57:58] Factor was there anything that might have been um unwarranted such as you know an increase in stroke risk I mean I know that it's actually the opposite but but I'm just trying to say like is there anything that with an increase in a platelet factor that that could have led to an increase in dvts or something I mean when you have a sample size as large as they did presumably you would find something that was negatively associated with the

[01:58:26] KVs I'm not aware of of increase as you were saying it's actually the opposite the KVs heterozygosity actually protect is Associates with the protection against stroke risks um cardiovascular risks even metabolic risk and metabolic yeah metabolic diseases um it's very remarkable I did I I I searched I searched for something that could be negative and I did find some I did find that um that in the cancer literature that KVs heterozygosity has a poor prognostic um value as um indicates a poorer prognosis in brca1 carriers with breast cancer so um it's there are examples where it's um not helpful and one is In N brca1 positive breast cancer Dina going back to the human homozygotes for klvs do we know how much of an increase in clotho they produce so if the heterozygotes are producing 15 to maybe 20% more how much more clotho is being produced by the homozygotes and does that give us an insight into toxic I it in humans that was not observed in mice and not even observed in the primates because in the primates when you gave too much you just didn't get a benefit but you didn't get a harm in the mice you actually got more and more benefit so as the as the organisms get more and more complicated it seems that the therapeutic window is getting narrower and narrower do the homozygotes give us any insight into that it's a great question um with um Jen here at the memory and aging Center we also we we have access to homozyg serum and we actually looked at um several homozygotes compared to non-carriers and heterozygotes and what we found is that their clotho levels are actually lower than normal and we think that has something to do with um and I'm going to get a little deeper into this because I think it's really important when we think about Therapeutics actually that there's something about so many genetic variants won't cause a change in the protein sequence itself if it happen if the variant if the nucleotide change is in an intron it's just not going to change the um this structure or function or anything of the protein but in KVs the nucleotide changes they're two nucleotide changes and they translate into different amino acids in two places of the clotho protein and so what we think is happening this is speculation but what we think is happening um based on inv vitro studies that arcing did in 2002 that that in the clotho heterozy in which one Al is making a mutant protein we think that there's an overcompensation for that mutant protein by increasing wild type levels because what that polymorph what that variant does is it mucks up clotho secretion from the cell so just to be clear carrying one variant is chain is likely changing the fun structure and function of clotho but there's probably a a an overcompensation from the wild type alil causing higher levels of the wild type cloth though and in the in the first of all that is an unbelievable story like I I would not have guessed that and I'm I I can't believe I didn't think to ask such an obvious question which is do the klvs uh individuals produce the same protein I took it for granted that they produced the same prote protein and just made more of it but to be clear if you assay those individuals are you finding two proteins in them A A A protein that mirrors the wild type that's the one that's elevated 15 to 20% and an actual mutated protein or A protein that has two different amino acids which again to many people sounds like big deal you've got a thousand amino acids in the full protein you've changed two of them how much can it matter well unfortunately in biology it can always matter ask a patient with CLE cell anemia so is is that what you're seeing you're seeing two different proteins and it's the wild type one that is overexpressed at this point it's the it's a hypothesis that the wild type one is really compensating overcompensating by increasing levels for the what may be a mutant protein but in reality our and we've done Eliza on um the enzym linked imuno assays on thousands and thousands of individuals but the Eliza itself doesn't distinguish between a klvs protein and a normal wild type clotho protein it doesn't distinguish between the two and so the answer to that question is not known yeah Eliza is just Eliza is just too too blunt an instrument to figure that out and if we take that a step further and and say what's happening in a clotho homozyg well they have they're expressing a mutant protein from one Al that mucks up secretion and they're expressing a mutant protein from another alil that mucks up secretion and so they don't have wild type clotho um all of their clotho is the KVs form and it's very low yeah um there's a big and how much how much lower is it Dena um in our studies it was I'm trying to visualize the graph if there was a 15% increase with heterozygosity compared to non-carriers there was probably a 30% decrease with homozygosity compared to non-carriers so to give you a sense of numbers if um if a non-carrier was at 800 um a KVs homozyg carrier um was below 600 something like that and this is why this matters it matters for many reasons but there have been some really large scale studies recently Peter um one is called the enhan study published in in 2022 I believe and what this study showed us is that clotho levels as measured by the this imuno assay by the Eliza that the clotho levels really correlated with mortality so that um if there was um I want to make sure I get this right so it was over 10,000 people in the United

[02:06:03] States um clotho serum was measured on everyone the mean age was about 56 years and if the mean clotho level was around 800 than something less than what they defin as 666 by their study peagram per Mill associated with a 30% mortality over 5 years and that was replicated in another study called in Kean that lower levels of clotho and again this isn't like half the levels this is um it's it's maybe maybe it's like 30% of a decrease of levels um drove a 30 well associated with a 30% mortality over 5 years and that mortality was primarily in um cancer and cardiovascular disease so the level you know I I think levels are going to matter as we think about our human aging as we think about our our organismal health heart health brain health cancer Health the levels um at least by association right now matter um and lower levels are really associated with with um with more diseases of

[02:07:23] Aging it's just like can we even scratch the surface of this I mean we've just sat here and talked for Two Plus hours about you know the limits of our understanding of clotho and brain health and yet this enhan study is actually looking at something totally different which is all cause mortality and saying basically if you're in your 50s and your clotho levels are 30% below what would be Ed for somebody to your age It's associated with a 30% increase in all cause mortality over the next 5 years if that turns out to be causal and you're saying that the manner in which that death was mitigated was or rather the the manner in which that death was was um was distributed was cardiovascular and cancer so it doesn't even have to do with more dementia which of course wouldn't be kicking in in your 50s um um I I mean it suggests that clotho is doing even more than just protecting brain health which if it did nothing else would still be arguably the most important thing that you know we should be trying to get into humans for clinical trial so uh I know that your area of expertise is not oncology or cardiovascular medicine but I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are as to how that can be happening I couldn't agree with you more you know my and my expertise is as a neurologist and neuroscientist it's really on the brain um but having said that I you know the side effects of clotho in in um increasing it may be much more than and helping brain health it's it clearly has um a very strong association with um with protection against cancer cardiovascular disease and kidney disease and um there is Peter a very very very large literature um on clotho and organ

[02:09:29] Health um a very strong one um in the cancer field there are many preclinical models again in um rats and mice that show that giving clotho um the soluble hormonal form um actually stopped um and and reversed um cancers in mice like pancreatic cancer for example um and then there are Association studies in humans too but there's um there is so much more to the biology of clo than um than only what it's doing in the brain um so and kidney disease so there's there's like CLA is going to come to Market and and maybe the kidney people will beat the brain people um if clotho comes to Market I I think people are going to benefit no matter what but in chronic kidney disease there is a decrease in clotho um secretion and decrease in clotho in the blood and the kidney folks the kidney Specialists are really developing clotho as a diagnostic biomarker um to understand um when the kidney starts failing and the idea there is that right now the measures are um glome filtration rate um

[02:10:58] Ura um and and these are not as sensitive as as they would want biomarkers to be in detecting kidney dysfunction the CL as soon as the kidney starts having trouble clotho declines as soon as it starts having trouble so there is a lot of um there's a fervent interest in developing clotho is a biomarker for kidney function and I would say again if we think in the broader sense about clotho maybe someday and maybe someday soon we would have our clotho levels checked you know just as we do our blood pressure um and our cholesterol um and we get breast exams um and we have colonoscopies that you know why not have a clotho level checked everyone's will be different now how do we get around the issue that it has this dial effect um that's the only thing that jumps to my mind when you're talking about a marker of of egfr because I know in our practice I mean we're fanatical about monitoring egfr I mean we we you know we look at cattiny we look at creatinin we're triangulating them um but at least to our ability they these don't Mar these don't depend terribly on time of day so do you think that the answer clotho is you have to have it done 60 minutes after you wake up in the morning it's non-negotiable don't ever let somebody check your clotho level at two in the afternoon otherwise we can't interpret it is that how you think it's going to factor in I think that is going to give us the best and more accurate level of clotho and in fact I mentioned that we do CL we've done thousands and thousands of clotho um measurements and human serum and human CSF Ros spinal fluid and I always make sure that um whoever we're collaborating with and who has collected the specimen did it in a morning fasting manner so that the um the individual or patient hasn't eaten and its first thing in the morning why do you think um or why do you know that eating impacts clotho levels I don't know that and I don't know that it's really been tested per se but um in the spirit of what one does right just being just being incredibly consistent and rigorous and early yeah with with um just less confounding factors in the background but having said that um the decline over the course of a day isn't dramatic so the decline by age is more relevant than the decline by time of day I would say that um the decline by by age is is a consistent decline um and then the but the time of day does matter because it can decrease by almost 40% by midnight but the statistic and this is done with I have to say I've looked through the literature the dial rhythm of clotho has been shown in a small number of people but the data look good um that it's not really statistically different until like afternoon but it's starting to decline so I would you know I had to design um the time and day and I would say that we need a AO tests that people take in the morning fasting like they do with their cholesterol just get it along with the cholesterol draw and um and most importantly we need a standardized assay yeah I was about to say is there a cleab based assay for this no NOP but but I think I I think it's coming given how many people and how many samples have been it just hasn't been you know levels haven't been coordinated between institutions and labs and um so everything we do in our lab is consistent to our um is is consistent to to our methods and standards and we standardize everything to um and I include my own um samples in there but it's all standardized but then my lab um may have slightly different values than yeah what is going on in another lab and then of course you know so if I woke up in the morning and I checked my level and I was at 800 is it Pags per milliliter is that the unit yeah so if we if I did my test at 6:00 in the morning and I'm 800 pams per milliliter and then from 7:00 to 9:00 in the morning I'm in the gym I could easily be 1,200 Pags per milliliter after um so so how does that impact our understanding of what's going on I think that's a really good important Point um and I just I do want to emphasize that that that was really M that the human studies show chronic exercise increases clotho by after a few months after three months and that and there's been a mouse study that shows an acute B of exercise can really like nearly double clotho but I think we would be interested again we're imagining a not so distant world and um it would be important to get like a baseline level where are you living oh so so just to be clear you're saying you do not have human data that demonstrate that acute bouts of exercise dramatically changes I have not seen that ien haven't I have not seen that in the l i I know a person who might be willing to do that experiment for you so just we we could discuss that offline sure yeah um okay so final question on this Dina because I know it's come up for us a lot in our practice um so I'm hoping you have a better solution for us we do like to test our patients especially those who are higher risk for

[02:16:57] Alzheimer's disease um we do like to test to see if they have the klvs uh um uh polymorphisms it is very difficult to get that information um are you guys doing that work yourselves are you Outsourcing that um how are you guys getting that information on your own I mean I realize that much of the research you're doing is on a database where that's been done but are you aware of any uh commercially easy ways for individuals to determine their klvs status you know should they choose to know I don't know the exact answer to this I know that the information is represented somewhere on 23 and me we can't seem to get it out of 23 and me even even when we use

[02:17:46] Prometheus yeah we can't seem to do it maybe hopefully somebody can say no you're wrong Peter you just got to do this but we haven't figured it out yeah I have to say that that um in in our case when we collaborate with the um with the clinical researchers uh they have their populations completely genotyped for clotho ape4 and and most other genes out there with the polymorphisms so there there's been like a there's been um a really deep deep sequencing and um and and a genetic screen of all those individuals but I'll have to Circle back to you about that well Dena this has um this has been in I mean I think at the risk of being hyperbolic just an insanely fascinating discussion uh and

[02:18:42] I'm so happy to be able to have discussed your work with you know with you and and then by extension to be able to kind of put this in front of so many people um because I do think that for a disease like Alzheimer's disease that if we're being brutally honest of all the what I call the Four Horsemen of death if there's one that we have very very little to offer patients once they're in the throws of the disease um this is this is the sad poster child for it um it it is Unfortunately today um it's it's you know I don't need to tell you what you see every day but I think I think people watching this understand that even even with the

[02:19:27] Advent of anti- ameloid therapies they have they have barely barely been able to put a dent in this uh enormous problem and it's for that reason that I'm very excited about this and uh uh just applaud you on your on your career um and I I think this is only the beginning right like that that we have to get this into human clinical trials that's what's next um thank you so much for this invitation um it's been really really fun talking to you um and um I you know Alzheimer's disease is one of our biggest biomedical challenges um our entire world is aging it used to be the

[02:20:10] US Japan Sweden but it's the entire world Japan China India AF Africa all continents aging and we're aging rapidly and um again this is one of our biggest biomedical problems we really do not have effective therapies um and I'm I'm hopeful that um that with multiple shots on goal right now that something will come to Market that that provides that resilience you know in addition to anti-id therapies that is a cocktail that provides resilience um for the suffering that really erodes our our memory it um destroys families economies it's it's it's just a devastating problem um we're we're glad to be working on it and we hope that we can do something big and important but that remains to be seen I also just wanted to say I'm um I'm so lucky to be doing what

[02:21:13] I love to do like really really love to do and um and I am Al lucky enough to have a very diverse portfolio being funded by the NIH by foundations um and in the past by biotech and also by philanthropy and um I can't emphasize enough how much um friends and supporters of our lab have enabled really risky science have enabled us to just take a leap ask big questions take a big risk and um and see what happens and um you know win or lose to really see what happens when we go down that route and I think that's so important to progress in science is to do something risky to um to take a risk so um I'm just I'm very grateful um to be doing what I'm doing well I I'm glad you mentioned that I I do think that philanthropy um can have an enormous impact in science um when philan anthropist come in with the right attitude which is I want to fund something that is asymmetric in the following way it is too risky for say the NIH to fund or too risky for industry to come in and fund um but yet it has enough biologic plausibility and enough potential upside that if it works it's a GameChanger and look the reality of it is I think clotho is a poer child for that type of work um and at least as of this moment it looks like it's actually paying off so um I I think I'm I'm you know I and countless others are grateful for uh for what's been done Dena thank you so much for your time today really really appreciate it thank you this was wonderful thanks [Music] no
