Erin Michos is an internationally-known leader in preventive cardiology and women’s cardiovascular health. In this episode, Erin discusses current trends in cardiovascular disease (CVD) through the lens of female biology and the observation that major adverse cardiac events in both sexes are on the rise. She walks through risk factors including LDL-cholesterol, apoB, and Lp(a) and makes the case for the importance of early preventative measures. She explains various interventions for reducing risk including a discussion of statins, GLP-1 agonists, PCSK9-inhibitors, and drugs that lower Lp(a). She goes in-depth on female-specific factors that contribute to CVD risk such as pregnancy, grand multiparity (having five or more children), oral contraceptives, menopause, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Additionally, she explains her approach with patients as it relates to the use of hormone replacement therapy and provides advice for people wanting to lower risk both through lifestyle changes & medications.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dr. Aaron Mikos:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focused on cardiovascular disease in women, with particular emphasis on prevention, risk factors, and lipid management across different life stages. Dr. Mikos, an expert in preventive cardiology and women's cardiovascular health, discussed how cardiovascular disease manifests differently in women compared to men, and how traditional risk assessment tools may underestimate women's risk. The conversation covered various life stages including premenopausal years, pregnancy, and menopause, as well as specific conditions like PCOS and the impact of hormone replacement therapy.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Cardiovascular disease mortality is rising in middle-aged women (45-64) [06:37]
- 90% of cardiovascular disease is due to preventable risk factors [04:26]
- Women with FH have 20-fold increased risk of CVD [12:34]
- Lipoprotein(a) is 5-10% higher in women than men [43:41]
- PCOS affects 5-13% of women of reproductive age [47:49]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Start prevention early in life [18:36]
- Focus on lifestyle modifications before pharmacological interventions [30:30]
- Regular physical activity and stress management [37:03]

Context-specific Recommendations:
- Consider calcium scoring for risk assessment in women over 50 [26:04]
- Hormone replacement therapy within 10 years of menopause for symptomatic women [1:57:53]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:

Medications mentioned:
- Statins (various types) [1:29:28]
