[00:00:01] [Music] everyone welcome to the dr podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode

[00:00:38] I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode my guest this week is ned david ned is the president of unity biotechnology a company that he co-founded in 2011 in this episode we're gonna talk a little bit about unity but more importantly we talk about the science upon which unity is developed and that is the science of senescence or cellular senescence we begin this episode by putting that into context I think if you're interested in the space of longevity you're listening to this podcast you've undoubtedly heard the term senescence but it might not mean much to you and I think what Ned does a great job of here is explaining not just senescence but where it fits in the overall lattice if you will of all of the different cellular processes that occur during aging so where does it fit in with the role of mTOR inhibition caloric restriction mitochondrial dysfunction stem cell exhaustion methylation of DNA and epigenetic change all of these sorts of things we also talked quite a bit about Ned's background as a serial entrepreneur in biotechnology Ned is at least partly responsible for the development of a number of fda-approved compounds and he talks openly about what he learned good bad and indifferent along the way and how that helped him at the beginning of this process of creating this company unity define sort of the jugular questions that needed to be addressed as sort of a proof of principle in fact I found that part of the disk most interesting and I think you'll you'll know what I'm talking about when we get to that part in the episode because I found that exercise that he and his co-founders went through between about 2011 2015 to be some of the most interesting thinking around this idea of company creation that is a prolific innovator I think when he was about 30 he was named to the top 100 innovators in the world by MIT Technology reviews he holds a PhD from Cal Berkeley and he got his undergrad degree in molecular biology at Harvard so without getting into too much more of the details of this please enjoy my discussion with Ned

[00:02:49] David ed awesome to see you today thank you for coming by oh thank you for having me I feel like I haven't seen you in person in way too long this is true we tried to get you to come to dinner oh god I feel horrible about that yes sorry yeah you were distracted it's all good no you know what I was doing you were doing a podcast I was doing a podcast yeah that I thought would take two and a half hours it ended up taking six hours that must have been an intense experience it was a very intense experience and I felt horrible after I'm sorry so I owe you an apology for that it's okay we love you there's so much I want to talk with about you in fact I've been bugging you for about a year that come on the podcast because what I was hoping we could do and we can never do it when there's a microphone in front of us but was sort of reproduce at dinner conversation that we would have ordinarily which would be pick some topic and we go way off on a tangent about it and it could be energy it could be biotech it could be whatever but some of the most interesting discussions we've had over the past five years have been around longevity something that we both share an interest in and god it's been probably nine years since you talked to me about what became that which you're doing today is that about right yeah that's about right it was 2011 towards the end yeah actually we're in December now so it's actually been somewhat more than eight years so I want to talk a lot about your work you're always a guy who's got a lot of hats on right now you're mostly wearing one hat and that's hat that puts you squarely at the center of a pretty big circle with a bunch of folks working at a company called unity biotech which we'll certainly get to but

[00:04:36] I think for listeners to really understand what you do today what your company does they need to sort of understand the journey you've gone through over the past several years and how that's sort of shaped your thinking about an interesting problem you're a serial entrepreneur and we will likely discuss some of that in your background but let's just start with how you think about this problem that I think about which is how do we help people live longer how do we help people live better how do you define that by the way I don't impose my definitions on you what is longevity to you well longevity for me would be being able to live without the indignities that I've witnessed we all witness in our lives all of these features of aging that seemed to be inescapable so my father for example he has profound degenerative disc disease which makes him functionally a mobile it defines his life my stepfather died of Alzheimer's at 87 that defined the final chapter of his life so I've been up close to these things in other people in addition we all and you and I are now I'm older than you I'm in my 50s now we are witnessing and these changes in ourselves and for me longevity would be the ability to use what I know how to do just science and biology and be able to change how we get to live our lives to be free of these indignities and I think it's something that we can do and we are doing it and so for me it sort of began as a dream but now we're generating human data that says this we can actually do this so I remember when this started Ned circa 2011 how you really steeped yourself in this field which at the time was kind of new you had already done a number of interesting things in biology that had led to the development of drugs but none quite in this space I mean I literally remember many nights I'd be driving home and we'd be talking on the phone and you would be telling me about things that you had just read about and I saw this paper and it's ten years old but it was it was almost like you were going through a second postdoc or something getting up to speed in this I've always liked the way you sort of explained your evolution of thought there do you want to maybe for the listeners give them a sense of how you developed a framework around this about sort of ageing biology and why do we age and what can you do about it ultimately so maybe it's helpful for me to just create some context and so the way I think about this and the way I explain it to people that are new to this or people that aren't scientists is I I always talk about they're these sort of three principles that if you remember nothing else from listening if you're awakened two weeks from now in the middle of a night it's these three principles that I think are a good way to think about this and the first principle is that aging is not a rigid thing so it's this flexible malleable thing and Nature has throughout evolutionary history sort of bent and twisted aging for its own purposes to create creatures that have very different lifespans and this kind of takes us to the second principle which is that nature is done this with these control knobs these are sort of biochemical systems that nature twists and these systems are now something we're learning and this takes a third principle to turn as people that do drug hunting like us and so it's these three principles that nature is flexible or the aging is a flexible thing and nature has then bent and twisted control knobs to make it flexible and that these are turnable stuff so if you take those three principles as the context you may ask well why do we as scientists why do

[00:08:35] I believe these things are true so if you just look outside nature and creatures across phylogenetic history you see very similar creatures with very different lifespans so if you take the hard clam so this is this thing you can eat at a clambake if you don't eat it it won't live about 40 years and it hasn't deep ocean dwelling relative called a quail hog that lives at least 500 years and these are very similar creatures they look very much the same and no one really knows how long this Quahog lives it is 500 year thing was just because that was what the age of the wreck off of which it was pulled was so these are very similar creatures on the order of 12 fall different lifespan similar story if you flip over to let's say the order of rodents actually let's not even go to rodents you let's just talk about mammals because that's us of course rodents are mammals too but we are mammals as humans so if you look at the shortest living mammal which is this thing called the tiny shrew lives less than a year then you look at the longest living mammal so it's called the bowhead whale and again no one knows how long about I'd well actually lives so the estimate is at least 200 years so again you've got this 200 fold difference at least in creatures that kind of have the same biochemistry were both mammals now if you flip over to rodents it's the same phenomenon okay you can take a field mouse which can live somewhere between two and three years and then you find this naked mole rat which is this very unusual-looking subterranean creature that's blind and hairless this creature lives 10 times longer lives on the order of even more than ten times longer it was on the order of 30 years if it doesn't die of some trauma and again these are these are in this same order and so these are closely related creatures very very different life spans so Nature has clearly gone to town on this and created these marvelous examples of disparate lifespan but sort of the same creature the same biochemistry so this kind of takes us to this idea of the Nature has done this how is it done this and it's done it with these control knobs and a walk through why we thought they were control knobs and how we turn them so the first control knob that got the discovered molecular li was the work of

[00:11:04] Cynthia Kenyon and this was a paper that blew me away I was a first-year in graduate school maybe second year and Cynthia published a paper that was pretty heretical at the time and the paper showed that you could knock down the function of a single gene in a worm C elegans so it's about a millimeter sized little worm and when you knock down the function of this thing it doubled the animal's lifespan and this was a wild result because at the time aging was thought of as this kind of decay process but the notion that you could essentially break a function of something or at least make it function a lot less well and double the lifespan of a creature was just a total mind warp for me and other people just like oh my gosh you can dent something and it gets better now what's happened in the intervening decades this has been repeated and flies it's even been repeated in mice you can knock down the function of a single gene and calorie restrict an animal then you can double its lifespan that's like you were me living to a hundred and sixty okay because this is a creature with really similar biochemistry to ourselves so this just said that you could take single genes turn them and do radical things to lifespan now in fairness with

[00:12:17] Cynthia's work and C elegans I always felt that it wasn't the best model to extrapolate from because of the division stopping at the germ cell and therefore if you take daf-2 and daf-16 and project them forward to mammals I don't think we've seen the same magnitude of reduction with attenuation of those have we know and maybe it's worth rather you explaining it than Mead you want to tell folks what daf-2 and f-16 you just to bring them along for the ride so these were genes that were discovered in Cynthia screen as receptors and transcription factors associated with what we now talk about as the igf-1 receptor signaling pathway and if you go in so this is something that now has been explored in great detail and in mice for example and the analogous knockdowns and mice of the receptors don't produce the same degree of longevity that you can produce in a war now interestingly a paper published somewhat recently this was a near

[00:13:19] Barzilai and actually Pedro Beltran whom I work with now with an antibody that antagonizes the idea yeah it extends life but there's a sex difference so it only benefits a female's and it's not something that translates perfectly but I think that's not the interesting piece in terms of the whole kind of story of what we're learning about aging was to us and to me it was oh my gosh you can damage the function of a single gene the fact that it still works in mammals is remarkable the fact that it works less it's not as cool it's a little bit of a bummer but to me it was really the it was the daf-2 daf-16 observation that opened up the field and said that there were these knobs that you could turn and you could get these radical impacts on longevity and the additive value of daf-16 plus caloric restriction was also very interesting in cynthia's worms and i actually thought that that was perhaps the most extrapolate elincia to mammals but to your point it was a proof of concept right it was this thing is malleable yeah and to me at the time it was just like it was though the masked tipped a little bit and you could see the face underneath like oh my gosh there's something almost programmatic going along here as opposed to just this idea that you're just decay and that was exciting and that paper stuck with me for several decades it was not something that I chose to work on although I became friends with Cynthia at some point in the early 2000s and we continued to be friends and talk all the time but that particular biology is not it's more of a marker people use now as opposed to something that people are actively trying to preserve so going back to this question about of ABS this goes to our this third principle which is that we can turn some of these knobs the first knob actually that got turned in a super aggressive way goes way back to be 1930s and it was this guide

[00:15:24] Cornell named Clive Mackay and he had a colony of rodents and this is shortly after the Great Depression and his lab didn't have a ton of money and in an efforts to keep portions of his colony alive he fed some of the animals all the time and then other animals he fed infrequently and what happened was not what he expected the animals that were restricted with food lived longer and it was the first time it's ever got experimentally demonstrated albeit by accident and for me that was the first time that scientists had sort of set out I'll fillet it for a very funny reason and turned a knob that extended life and it brought forward this idea that as we live aging or your biology is making a decision about the rate at which you are aging now flash forward several decades a molecules discovered on Easter Island made by soil bacterium it's one of your favorite molecules rapamycin now the aging affects a rapamycin were not figured out until about 2003 and then the awesome work of David Sabatini eventually linked this calorie restriction observation from decades and decades earlier to rapamycin and turns out that rapamycin and calorie restriction are both turning the same control knob and this is pretty wild because biology typically only invents a few ways to do things and what was really neat was the way in which these two totally different approaches for both touching the same biology so it's my belief that this biology so there's this complex called mTOR which is this mega dalton complex since this master decision-maker of whether or not we are choosing to divide and make more biomass because there's enough resources or are we choosing to fight another day and this biology that rapamycin and chi restriction and restriction of various other things like methionine is the single best validated biology across labs across species and one of my co-workers who's a sort of incredibly brilliant but the cynical guy always says if you want to know what the real biology is it's the stuff that works in every lab no matter who's doing it okay rabbie myosin and calorie restriction definitely have that feature it works in all these labs do you know that I tried to get a personalized license plate for rapamycin and they got rejected by the DMV in

[00:17:54] California because rapamycin is a drug and you can't have a license plate that's a drug so then I tried again in vain to get wrap a log as a license plate and I got Thorton again because apparently someone at the DMV was smart enough to Google rap a log and figure out that it's an analogue of rapamycin which is also a drug and I got the same rejection letter from the DMV I would just assume knowing you you would have done rap a man which sounds vaguely like a supervillain okay but now we didn't go you stop I'll tell you over dinner what

[00:18:27] I eventually went with okay I gotcha it so anyway there's this mTOR thing which is the best value to control knob the next knob that got turned is this thing with Youngblood so this is something that's sort of popularized if you watch things like Silicon Valley but this goes back aways but the first time that the lifespan effects of this were demonstrated was in the 1970s and so what you do is you take two animals ones young and ones old and you literally suture them together and they're circulatory systems joint and it's not a giant mental leap to imagine that crap and old people is bad for you so the old blood to be bad for the young the awesome result was it's tough and the young was good for the old and it could extend life by as much as 15% these are with animals that are sutured together which is not exactly an optimal way to live so that tells you that's another knob there's stuff in young blood that is able to exert biology and do good things and I think that's going to be an area that will be fruitful the next sort of control knobs we've learned about so in mitochondria age so mitochondria are the descendants of ancient bacteria so they have their own DNA they have their own genomes and mitochondria live really hard life and so their mutation rate of their own DNA is somewhere between a hundred and a thousandfold faster than our nuclear mutation rates so their DNA just gets all chewed up and as a consequence by the time you are in your 70s you can go into a human being and look in their colonic crypts and on the order of half of the cells and their colonic crypts don't have functional mitochondria they can't utilize oxygen to make energy or do all the other things that mitochondria do that are important and so that's something that we've learned that is clearly a part of this aging story another thing that could be a knob and this is an area of some intense debate these days is this thing called the methylation clock so this is this ever ticking clock in which these methyl groups this is a little carbon atom with three hydrogen's around it are attached or detached over time to the various C's in your GATC code and when you're young they sucessfully these five methyl sees these methyl groups on your DNA it's like a crisp pegboard where everything's lined up perfectly and you've got areas where they are and crisp areas where they are not and gene expression is not noisy and as we get old it's like someone drops the pegboard and suddenly you've got methylations where you're not supposed to have them and you're missing them in other places and looks as though that might and I stress the word might give rise to sort of noisy gene expression and the metaphor I often think of for this is imagine you have a vinyl LP if you're old enough to know what that is or hip enough to know what that is kind of a hipster thing now and you play an LP a lot the actual act of playing that LP takes the little knobs and grooves and wears them down so that LP doesn't sound is good and it's possible that the act of being alive and that aging actually is modifying these little methyl groups in such a fashion as to cause aging no one knows if these changes in this epigenetic clock are the cause of features of aging or the result the features of aging or even a little bit of both and that's gonna be super interesting area of biology yeah I've spoken with David Sinclair quite a bit about this he uses an analogy that's similar but has a couple differences which is the methylation could be thought of as the scratches one gets in a CD surface and the question of course being can you restore the CD back to its original form if you have that master template and then that's not exactly the same as the analogy you've used but it certainly speaks to the music and the discs yeah it's interesting so I always think of

[00:22:26] CDs getting scratched because you're negligent okay right as opposed to just putting them in the CD player and using them yeah and so so there's a nuance I mean it's funny those two metaphors may even as you notes may speak to different intuitions between me and David about what's going on here but I don't really have an intuition I'm sort of reporting out what sort of known and what it's gonna be just very exciting to see when we can actually do experiments that can tease this apart and ask questions like if you take these methylation groups away do you in fact start making cells that are younger functionally and that's going to be an awesome experiment David did an experiment recently and I think you have to be a little cautious with the interpretation so twice in our lives we press a factory reset your methyl um so you do it once at conception and so a bunch of gene products get made which erase and reset your methyl um back to day zero because you're now an embryo and the program is beginning again now a few weeks into your life it happens a second time but only in a little bit of yourself yeah so let's explain that so when you start at conception you have one cell mm-hmm it goes through about 50 divisions so I don't know exactly it so are you talking about when we do the second reset first of all it's different in humans and mice and I apologize I don't know but it's some relatively small no it's a small number it happens within I believe it's weeks in the human

[00:23:57] I think it's a little over a week in a mouse but anyone out there that works on this and I have friends I could call but not right the second what happens is there's a second wave of these gene products that are me and for a second time in your life and the only second time in your life you will reset because now you are making germ cells for your children and they are kept in a special spot in your sex organs until you make babies so those are the only two times that this factory reset gets pressed and then going back to where I was saying you feel a cautious with interpretation we now know how to do this artificially so we can express four factors called the Yamanaka factors and these four factors by themselves if you express them in cells it's super inefficient but one in every few thousand cells you can cause to become a reset cell with a prime you know when did ya Menaka do this this is in our lifetime I mean this is quite recent yeah he got the Nobel Prize I last I don't have the date I know a lot about actually how he isolated them I just don't know the precise dates but basically he did this it was a beautiful experiment Magellan akka did he initially identified genes that as candidate list of genes that were turned on in this sort of embryo logical state and then he started using he was delivering the genes in various combinations he ultimately wound up paired down to about two dozen and then he then would take various pairwise combinations and figured out how few he could do and still manage to turn on one of these embryonic genes and he managed to weed it down to four and he got the

[00:25:41] Nobel Prize for that and and so what's happened in the intervening years is there's been some efforts to see could you actually impose features of youth because it's sort of a simple-minded leap to say oh if you look embryonic that's young in fact and I think that's the little dangerous leap right just because you don't have the methyl groups on your DNA doesn't mean they translate into the phenotype that is youth that's correct what I think you do when you do Yaman octave for factor reprogramming is it's a self fate decision you've entered a very unique cellular state now it just so happens to have things that are in common with you and so I think that when you do a reprogramming event and you were able to exert something that looks like youthful biology you may have actually just created new you stem cells that are able to somehow pick up the music developmentally and participate that's sort of different than youth it's a bit of a sort of cell transplant II sort of thing although done by the delivery of genes so anyway this whole question about this methyl o'clock is something that it's an intense area of interest in the biological community it's evolving a lot there's a bunch of labs that are working on this and it's going to be very interesting next five years to see where this drops out um we sort of covered a bunch of things we've talked about yeah you got mTOR reduction slash caloric restriction loss of the circulating youth factors mitochondrial dysfunction methylation clock which sort of ties into sort of stem-cell exhaustion and then we've got another big what I wanted to do is I've spent the last now just a little over eight years working on one of these last knobs that we now know how to turn which is cellular senescence but

[00:27:33] I wanted to place that particular knob in the context of the others because I don't want to sort of overhype this idea but I would do want to explain why I've dedicated a large chunk of my life on planet Earth to this because if you look at all of these aging mechanisms and these knots that I've described they all play a role in this we don't yet know what the sort of underlying primordial clock the ticks that makes us age what we do know is it you have a series of these component mechanisms that work collectively and they create this phenomenon that we call aging and I want to talk about cellular senescence now because I work on it because of all of the mechanisms it strikes me and struck me as the simplest mechanism to perturb and make medicines that you can use to treat human beings and I'll get into why that is in a sec but I'll just tell you about the knob so we all begin life as a single cell at conception and then over the arc of our lives we the single cell will divide as many as 50 times and on the road to 50 divisions the cells that make us up will encounter some form of stress they cannot resolve they will pull an emergency break and they will stop dividing forever and we call this state when you do this we call cells I do this a senescent is cell and this is something that we've we find these cells in all of the tissues we've examined and these cells they're a very small number most of the time typically it's on the order of hovering around 1% or less now in some disease states we have looked at that number is dramatically higher and

[00:29:23] I'll talk about that a little bit later children don't have these cells know they can make them but they don't accumulate and we don't know why but as we age these cells accumulate now before the work of my collaborators and my cofounders of the company I work at no one knew if these accumulating senescence cells were good for you bad for you or neither and so my two co-founders and now almost a decade of collaborators it's Judy Campisi at the buck Institute and the unders and at the

[00:29:56] Mayo Clinic both of their laboratories genetically engineered mice where we could eliminate senescence cells from these animals whenever we want it and for the first time we got to ask what happens and what happens is pretty eye-popping so normally I carry this picture around on my iPhone so I always show people this is what I work on but essentially by a podcast you have to use a little bit of imagination so imagine two animals siblings born within seconds of each other from the same mom these are animals that are 24 months old so it's kind of equivalent to a 70 year old person and one of these litter mates is blind it's osteo product it's frail it has kidney dysfunction it has cardiac dysfunction it looks visibly old it's littermate from whom we eliminated senescence cells from midlife until it dies this animal lives on average about 30% longer which is cool but what's more awesome than that is that when this animal dies and when it's similarly treated animals die they die with many of the features of aging either absent or reduced and that is awesome and so we're trying to do it unity the company I work out now before you say there's something interesting you said which is they have this knockout of senescence that only occurs in midlife no what we do is we insert into every cell of that animal's body we genetically engineer the animals so that we can administer a drug weekly which kills senescence cells within that animal but do you begin that administration at midlife and what happens if you begin that administration at Birth we have not done that experiment in large part because we don't see senescence cells at birth I see is there a chance that those animals would prematurely get cancer if we eradicated their ability to create stem cells at the beginning of life didn't

[00:31:53] Judith have some data that suggested the importance of senescence early on as a sort of break against cancer as well so you bring up a really important point that I should clarify so whenever I tell people about this result people often ask this is an important system why are you messing with it so it turns out the ability to make senescence cells is vitally important to our survival so if you genetically engineer a mouse that cannot make senescence cells this animal is born normally it's got ten fingers and ten toes but it is statistically winds up full of tumors before it's in reproductive age so it tells you that this emergency brake is cellular senescence system is an anti-cancer system and you do not want to mess with the emergency brake you have to leave it alone and so in the experiment I described where we eliminate these cells we don't touch the brake we allow the brake to pull completely and for the cell cycle to stop we only show up after now I think it's still a reasonable question you say dude it's like this is an antique answer you're kind of screwing around with it are you sure this is okay let's take a step way back so in medical school we spent all this time learning about different cellular insults and perhaps the most obvious one and the one we could use as an example is DNA damage so when cells DNA is damaged presumably its first choices can I fix this but if a cell's fate is such that it can't repair its DNA that's sort of when it has this bifurcated pathway of going down the pathway of apoptosis which means for the listener that it has a programmed form of cell death so it basically kills itself in a programmatic structured way or it goes down this pathway that you've described which is senescence effectively saying I will no longer do anything I'm still alive but I don't grow anymore I don't replicate I don't reproduce anymore my DNA is dysfunctional as we'll talk about I suspect it still does things it still secretes factors that wreak havoc but is that a fair assessment that

[00:34:05] I've just made of sort of using an example of a cell with DNA damage has that sort of choice it does and we don't understand how cells make a choice between the two yeah I was gonna ask you that do we have any sense of what's ways that decision well I'll tell you some anecdotes so what we do is we in the lab will a radiate cells or treat them with a DNA damaging agent these are both things that sound known things to destroy damn it so we have a setting on our radiator which does both so it both causes cells to die and then 99% of the cells that remain will enter senescence so you know that all those cells in the dish got the same radiation they're all the same clone of the cell yet some of them chose death and some of them chose senescence

[00:34:54] I think it's a really interesting question for us to try to understand about why did some die and why did some live presumably it's driven by some Oxbow cell state at the time is there a way post hoc to examine the DNA damage of the cells that died in compared to the DNA damage of the cells that underwent senescence because presumably the actual DNA damage is going to be stochastically distributed across those cells and even though they are the same cells receiving the same radiation they probably undergo different degrees of DNA damage and could it be something as simple as if you damage this portion of the DNA you lose the ability to undergo apoptosis but you still retain the ability to undergo senescence or vice versa yeah I mean you have to be a little tricky because if you're so the challenge with asking cells that died what happened is that it requires a bit of a cellular seance okay I have a cellular Ouija board we can no I'm just kidding yeah since we've been talking about this as

[00:35:50] I've been thinking kind of creatively there are these there's moments on the order of minutes two hours after the insult happens in which the cell is kind of going through it's sort of pre death throes and you still don't know which direction it's gonna go this is so not something I've ever seen studied so this could be something that just outside of my personal experience but I just think about what we do every day in which we insult cells in an effort to make cells become senescent but a portion of them choose death there's got to be a dozen postdocs thinking about this problem right yeah you'd have to be in a kind of hardcore apoptosis the thing is it's yeah you want to be a sort of apoptosis lab I don't know who is actually working on this problem it's pretty interesting problem no I think the way you'd want to get at it would be you might want to be looking quantitatively for example if you had some sort of mark of die that could tell you how much DNA damage a cell got you had some sort of high content imaging and you could look down at a plate and say oh these guys that accumulated in the minutes of radiation three times more of the they incorporated three times more of the dye these are the guys that chose death you could do something like that and so then you don't in this seance you just need somebody it's kind of a I guess it's more of like a cellular death watch there's ways you could start to get at that it's kind of cool sorry to take us off that track but now let's focus on the guys that didn't undergo apoptosis so you've got all these cells that have undergone some insult and they've now committed to sort of a celibate life they're not going to reproduce anymore and if they just left it at that it wouldn't be such a problem it's this other thing they do that's problem which is they sort of poison the well for cells around them that are otherwise not damaged is that a fair assessment of senescence that is so in fact early on in the history of this field which we can get into in a little bit it was a real theoretical problem how could something that's 1% of your cells damage the function of 99% of yourself well as it turns out these cells have a very active secreto that my co-founder Judy

[00:37:56] Campisi discovered in 2008 and it's this is the means by which these cells exert bad biology and they secrete into the micro environment around them all this crap that distorts tissue function and that is how these cells contribute both to features of natural aging as well as very particular diseases of aging is via this secreto me called this ASP which stands for senescence associated secretory phenotype and I know it's a mouthful well SAS was pretty cool yeah and so it's really a paracrine feature so in medicine we learn about endocrine versus paracrine versus exocrine features but paracrine is when a gland can actually secrete its hormone and it goes directly to the tissue that its operating on without having to even pass through the circulation and go around like the way for example insulin when it's secreted by the pancreas becomes systemic but this Peregrine effect is to secrete it and poison your neighbor right next to you I guess your point now explains why if you don't have the ability to undergo senescence that would be bad because you take all those cells that are damaged that for whatever reason don't choose the a pop tonic pathway are now they should be celibate but they're not and they keep reproducing and that's why you might be born looking normal but as you accumulate injury and insult boom you're gonna develop into tumors but that's very different from saying we're gonna let you undergo senescence but we might potentially block your ability to cause toxicity after the fact or other means of targeting those cells I mean there's many ways to do this but yeah well let me just go back to this whole thing which is the cancer thing so we know that if you can't make cells become senescent you dramatically increase tumors in mice and that's a powerful lesson about what not to do which is it don't mess with the underlying biology here showing up after however is a pretty cool idea and the fact that this paper and I'll come back to how I got involved in all this but the fact that eliminating these cells can produce a series of youth effects while not increasing cancer risk was very awesome and was actually kind of a theoretical validation of the picture in our minds about how this was all working so it might be useful to actually sort of at this moment sort of talk a little bit about the history of where this actually all came from and then we'll come back to what we're doing with this now and how we're making medicines based on it but I think it's always helpful to place what you're doing in historical context so this whole idea of cellular senescence traces itself back to the early 1960s there was a very clever guy named Leonard hayflick who I've actually had the pleasure of meeting very randomly on an airplane but at the time in the early 1960s it was widely believed that cells from us from mammals could had infinite capacity to divide and this was made famous by Alexis

[00:41:10] Carrel who goes back decades before that the leaders in the field all believed this and it turns out this was the result of the fact that the food that was being fed to these cells which was derived from chickens was contaminated with chicken cells so every time cells were fed food they were also fed other cells and it gave this impression that these cells were dividing forever and at this Leonard hayflick showed up and and for someone listening who's listening this thinking how can years decades of dogma come from such sloppiness it is important to understand that they're basically relying on light microscopes today you wouldn't make that mistake because you'd be able to look at the DNA of the different cells and realized that hey these are chicken cells those are

[00:41:57] Mouse cells etc but it's a beautiful example of both how far biology has come but also how the simplest mistakes can lead to catastrophic misinterpretation I write about this in my book this story and I'm I remember the first time I came across it like you I was sort of like my first thought was how the hell is that possible but then upon further reflection you're like you're imposing too much of your current worldview on the problem yeah I think it's important to share a little bit of compassion as you have by pointing out the limitations of their technology at the time and the context that they were living in what's funny is I will report an interesting mistake turns out we ordered from a TCC what we thought were Mouse cells and they were rat and as a consequence they weren't behaving properly this is this was about a year ago okay so these types of things are still happening so hayflick turns over this 60 year belief basically and so he published this paper in 1961 and it's pretty heretic --all and he coins this term he said he calls them senescent cells meaning cells that lose the ability to divide in culture and he says something very prophetic he says this may contribute to features of aging isn't that sort of like Watson and Crick's DNA yeah the thing about it does suggest a means for replication yeah yeah the most understand is eka which I love these things here's the great stories that when I ran into Leonard hayflick at the Portland

[00:43:26] Airport having gotten off the plane I pull out my phone and I show him he was very old down all right and I show him a picture of the mice within without senescence cells the term he functionally coined and I said this is what happened when we delete these cells that you said may cause aging and it was just a mind warp frame he hadn't heard of the paper you know at the time the paper had been out for six years you know he's very old then his his daughter walks up who lives in Portland and she thinks you're costing him or something no it was immediately clear that we were your fans exactly yeah we were fanboys and I show her the picture and I said this is where your dad's work went she was like oh my god and then she's like turns to her dad and said dad you realize what this is right and so there was this moment it was at one of these great moments where you get to see this person who really architected this major insight and biology confronted with the historical result right to his face and watching him trying to process it all it was pretty neat anyway so that's the kind of back story of where this all came from now flash forward decades now Judy

[00:44:39] Campisi was the first individual to find a marker that we could look at in vivo this is about 1995 so you could actually figure out because the senescence was a something that you did in plates like you know plastic plates out in an incubator but it was Judy you figured out the first biomarker where you go into a living creature into a tissue and say AHA there are senescence cells it was the first time we got to know how many there are right it's not a lot and her work really asked it raised this larger question which I mentioned earlier which is how can so few cells do so much bad for so many cells and it wasn't until 2008 when

[00:45:22] Judy described for the first time this thing that I mentioned earlier called the SAS the so called senescence associated secretory phenotype that are how these cells exert bad stuff and it's over a hundred factors that have been characterized that these cells make now that drive their negative biology now it turns out that a lot of what we know about the SAS p-- was all figured out in cell culture and plastic and what we've been working on the last eight years is doing a lot of this more in vivo and it turns out the SAS but very different in different tissues it turns out to be very different from different cells within those tissues in different disease states give folks some of the I mean I know there are so many of the SAS but what's a handful of things that they have in their playbook how do they sort of wreak this havoc on their peers so if you look at the sort of the totality this ASP everything that's been labeled a SAS factor what you will see are kind of usual suspects of badness okay so things like tnf-alpha which is the target of the most successful drug in the world today you know you Myra then it's an anti-tnf drug you see a factors like veg F alpha the target of things like Lucentis and

[00:46:36] Ilia multi multi-billion dollar drugs for the treatment of diseases of the eye and also using cancer but that's a sort of a separate thing so those are both SAS factors that are the targets of existing massive drugs there's also some SAS factors that have been clinically validated so there's one called CT gf which if you make an antibody against that you have efficacy in a rare lung disease that's profile that we now know is driven by senescence that's not a marketed drug yet but it makes the same point which is antibody they were taking a step back from this I mean let's put some broader strokes on this inflammation would result from SAS right so there's lots of things that go out there that basically tell immune cells hey let's recruit you to this area you mentioned fibrosis what other types of broad destructive categories of things go on out there and I'm fascinated by this work because it's it's just a little counterintuitive I totally get the and again this is just my need to teleological is everything if that's even a word but it totally makes sense why senescence exists it's a little harder for me to accept the breath of its destructive capacity to its peers my general thinking about teleological discussion I know you and I could debate this all night long which is get over it yeah because these things are not testable any teleological explanation should be evaluated solely on its entertainment value okay great but that's not why we're here I will say that there is an idea that is also T illogical but which I use and is a framework that I think is helpful so many things that we see in aging biology in particular they're kind of head-scratcher it's like why is the system doing this this seemed bad for the individual didn't evolution get a vote isn't that the whole point of evolution well it turns out that features of aging are manifest post reproductively oh yeah no no I don't think there's going to an evolutionary explanation for this for exactly that reason so is your argument that this occurred call it stochastically an evolution was never there to fix it or catch it so it just ran amok oh it's actually something it's a cooler idea so it turns out these decisions if you want to call them that these seemingly irrational decisions made by evolution of course evolution doesn't make decisions it's a votes with the survival of a species to reproduce or an organism to reproduce many of these so-called decisions are things which benefit the young yeah so it's basically let's get the post reproductive folks out of the way to conserve resources maybe you know I don't think anything so active or sort of sinister I think mostly it's let's take cellular senescence for example it's a awesome mechanism to block tumor formation in young reproductively competent organisms so if you can make more of those organisms to make more babies yeah I guess I'm not arguing the senescence it's the SAS p-- that I'm struggling with right well so it turns out this is interesting so turns out the

[00:49:43] SAS does some other things that are useful so a paper published by Judy Kim PC again and Mark Odom Aria who is a professor in the Netherlands now they got interested in wound healing and what they demonstrated was that if you make a wound in an animal a week or two after you make a laceration wound at the wound site you will see an accumulation of senescence cells and they're dumping SAS factors into the wound and the question

[00:50:12] Judy and Marko asked was is this important and so in this experiment they went in and they eliminated senescence cells in the course of wound healing and what they saw was that the wound closed less well and more slowly and it suggested that the SAS p-- had another role wasn't just well assassin this is a role for this a spear its role was to facilitate wound closure which if you think about it for most organisms in a naturally evolving ecosystem is super frigging important and so essentially senescence got co-opted into suppressing tumors and case in a very different case was co-opted into helping heal wound and so

[00:50:54] I think that what you see in these diseases of aging is often the sort of unintended consequences of a system that was absolutely awesome for the young at the expense of the old one metaphor for this that I sort of like is that let's say you innocently write a computer program to fill your bathtub it also unintentionally becomes a computer program designed to overflow your apartment it wasn't why you wrote it but it is the net effect yeah now that's an interesting point certainly things that favor wound healing could be quite beneficial some have even argued that LP little a lipoprotein maple glycoprotein little a which is attached to an LDL so it makes this thing called

[00:51:35] LP little a has very potent prothrombotic properties and even though it's wildly atherosclerosis you could argue well frankly that's a very favorable phenotype to carry for most of our evolution it's only recently that we need to concern ourselves with atherosclerosis but there was certainly an era where having a prothrombotic factor to help you in periods of trauma would far outweigh the tale effective knocking off a few elders who managed to survive and died of aortic stenosis or atherosclerosis so that's an interesting tidbit with respect to the wound stuff I wasn't aware that by the way that other example you've this LP little a is a perfect comparator to you whether or not either of these geological explanations matters not the point is is that those are the same logic so let's go back to something you said at the outset which you've now given us enough to put in context you said look you you sort of you went on this journey of thinking through final common pathways of aging you sort of arrived at this mTOR CR thing probably matters a whole heck of a lot and if I could seems to be the only one that works across organisms across labs no ifs ands or buts you've got this loss of circulating youth factors clearly something is happening to mitochondria as we age that is very problematic we clearly see this observation of methylation whether it's causal or not as is unclear we get a sense of what's happening to themselves exhausting and senescence cells your view which you very briefly touched on is the first four things I mentioned are probably harder to drug then the last one is that fair summation of how you kind of arrived at this yeah that's how I wound up focusing last eight years of what myself and my colleagues were working on was that was how do we make medicines that target a fundamental mechanism aging I was not clever enough or knowledgeable enough or both okay to figure out how to do mTOR and CR I mean there are a lot of people who are trying that by trying to get more and more selective molecules but it was not an area where I had anything creative to add but the backstory how I kind of got involved in this was I was sitting around actually in the Calgary

[00:53:53] Airport a lot of these important things are happening in airports okay for some reason and I was eating french fries and in this 20 minute interval of french fry consumption five different people sent me the same PDF and they were subject lines like holy you have to read this this has to be your next company and I opened up the paper and right on the front page was a figure showing these two animals siblings one of which had senescence cells the other one these are the mice you talked about earlier yes now this was yawn or this was Judy were they collaborating at the time they were collaborating though judy was not on this particular paper and this paper was not exactly the same mice I described so it had a very similar or the same means of senescence saw elimination but there was a difference this is 2011 these animals also contained a mutation where they made less far less of a protein called bub r1 which is an Anna phase checkpoint protein so this is a protein that makes sure that your chromosomes line up on the spindle and it sort of is like a bit of a schoolmaster and it sort of says you're not dividing until everything's lined up and so if you don't have Bob r1 you just blow right through the checkpoint and you become polyploid and yon Vander's in my other co-founder long-term collaborator he created this animal thinking this animal was going to get tons of cancer because he was a cancer researcher so let's just make sure we understand why that's the case if Bob r1 is there to make sure your spindles line up it means that you should not be able to divide until all your chromatin is perfectly aligned everything is in perfect tip-top order and you're ready to undergo mitosis that's right so if you take away your master a lot of faulty division should follow that's correct so yawns hypothesis is we either attenuate or knock out Bob r1 we should get a lot of cancer that's right okay what happened that wasn't what happened the animals were super polyploid meaning that they wound up with super weird numbers of chromosomes too many too few all that good stuff the animals aged quickly so the animals wound up full of senescence cells okay so there is something about become having very wrong numbers of chromosomes and all of the effects of that that caused the animals to be full of senescence cells and to age very rapidly have features of aging that were onset very rapidly and die so it accelerated the speed with which it's a record played but it didn't change the music in other words they didn't die sooner because they got cancer they just died sooner because they sped up their aging we don't know the answer to that so these animals are extremely sick animals so trying to make a larger statement I think it's too much to say with an animal like that of the whole record metaphor what I can say with I think conviction is that clearly a whole bunch of things that go along with being old happened very quickly in these animals and these animals die very quickly they look visibly old for me it was an experiment that suggested that it was consistent with the notion that the senescence cells were actually driving these features of aging and what's so cool about this paper and why it caught so many people's attention even though there was a somewhat earlier paper that yawn also did that for many allowed one to draw the same inference but it just didn't smell like a drug I won't get into that paper today but what was so compelling was that you added senescence cells through this mutation that gave rise to the production of less Babar one protein and then you eliminated those cells or a subset of those cells with this insert into the DNA of every cell of that animal and you could ameliorate a subset of the effects of senescence cells so you didn't get rid of all the senescence cells for it by the way interestingly the animals don't live longer that particular mutant because it's so sick when you eliminate the cells but a whole bunch of the features of aging for example they're bent spines they're organ atrophy they're cataracts in their eyes these were all severely blunted when the senescence cells were eliminated and when I saw this paper I thought this feels like a drunk you just eliminate cells that are driving bad things and so I contacted yawn and Mayo

[00:58:27] Clinic and 72 hours later we had agreed to meet and a little time after that I set up the company but this was a observation in a mutant animal and I remember the sort of early blogosphere talking about how this paper didn't mean anything and this was exaggerating the role of senescence and humans and it's a mouse and all this stuff and but to me it it really felt important now it was a long way between that paper and when you could never credibly claim there could be a drug discovery program based on it and we spent the next four years in stealth mode asking for biological questions and I had some very patient investors who gave us sort of a spoon fed or dropper fed money into the company we did not have lots of excess resources but I will confess that some of the best times in my life have been under resource constraint because your decision-making is very high quality every single resource decision matters so we had four questions we were trying to ask an answer and the first question and none of this stuff got answered in the first 2011 paper was do senescent cells contribute to natural aging as opposed to some genetically contrived

[00:59:50] Mouse second question could we find a disease any human disease that we could model in an animal where we could eliminate senescence cells and take that disease and either stop it or even better send it backwards third question could we find a molecule that could trigger the elimination of senescence cells from a living creature safely and last question which is what's getting rid of these cells safe we know that kids don't have them but that doesn't mean that getting rid of them from an adult like what if adults need them for some reason when kids don't so that was a formal question that really was on our minds now today I look at question four and realized that it's not an equivalence between children and adults because of the following reason we know that if you prevent kids from being able to make of them horrible things happen we don't know that if kids make them and you nuke them horrible things happen which is what you're trying to do with adults correct we don't know that those could be two different things yeah so kids naturally nuke them so we know what kids can make them because you can do experiments in young animals and they make some nothing cells and those are gone so in effect that is your living breathing experiment right that's right the superpower of kids is the ability to make them which prevents the replication of a cell that shouldn't replicate and then it has the good sense to get rid of it before it harms anyone the adult retains the ability to make it but keeps it around I want to go back to your second question it seems obvious now your second question just for the listener if I recall was could we find the right disease in which to study this can we find any disease because if you think about it that first Mouse or the first and second Mouse experiments that you undid both 2008 and then 2011 occasions in nature those weren't diseases the way right they were sort of

[01:01:50] Polly death conditions well they were sort of like this animal has these features of being old they weren't things that the FDA would label a disease like I bent a spine like who's gonna develop a drug for that but your intuition was of course you can't study lifespan here it has to be health span related because if you have an interest in taking this to humans mortality is a very difficult endpoint yeah it's not the way we develop drugs I mean unless you're tackling conditions that kill people quickly mortalities a reasonable endpoint for cancer and heart disease drugs sure so in fact I would even make us even ruthlessly more practical we wanted to find very diseases of being old diseases things that the FDA has regulatory paths for and endpoints that you can get drugs approved on and so we wanted to do that and that's what we did so tell me about number one number one again we take that for granted today but it was a very reasonable question eight years ago right yeah so again young vendors into the rescue here so net at this point it's just you and yon and Judy so is myself young vendors and Judy

[01:03:01] Campisi and a guy named Al hangzhou who helped us discover one of the early synthetic molecules also Darren Baker who's a professor at Mayo Clinic was also instrumental he was first author on the 2011 paper and he also was the first author on the paper I'm about to describe as it relates to question 1 which is how did we figure out that senescence was driving features of natural aging and so that was what

[01:03:31] Darren Baker and yum vendors and spent the next few years after 2011 doing and that paper took 5 years before it published in 2016 and what they did in this paper was they took natural mice mostly natural okay they contained one difference was we made it into natural mice that same construct that piece of DNA that was signed up in every cell of their body so we could eliminate senescence cells whenever we want it and so now we got to do that in a very slow multi-year experiment but these were naturally aging creatures and that paper took a half decade to happen and when we got that result which was in 2016 we been and should also ask the other three questions by then but that was really the trigger for us Dease telling the effort and speaking openly about what we were doing because if it didn't in contribute to natural aging and it didn't cause a particular disease of aging and we couldn't find molecules there was no company so you basically were processing question one and two three four in parallel that's correct we had a small team it was a relatively virtual for a few years we were just living at arch the venture fund and then we move when we got too big we moved up to the buck Institute so we were camped out right over Judy's lab or a floor up in a few doors over no pun intended yeah and we essentially went to town was a small group it was just a few people supported very intimately by Yuans group with Darren's support and with Judy's group and so we had this sort of virtual research group where every week we'd get together and review all the data for each of the four questions and we had work streams for each of questions one through four and it was a great time so

[01:05:17] I want to kind of pause on this journey and take a parallel or orthogonal journey for a moment because I suspected at least one person listening and likely more also have some sort of entrepreneurial bent in them and as it pertains to biology or biotechnology I think I'd love to figure out a way to extract from you some of the lessons that you've learned along the way you've done this over and over and over again in many companies and I'm just sort of wondering what well let's start with a broad question you've already alluded to the fact that you enjoyed that period of time right it was a it was really less of a company and more of a lab at that point it was sort of a virtual postdoc that you guys were doing yeah it was a Coalition of the Willing doing an incredibly hard project and it was far more likely that we were gonna fail than see well that's actually the question I wanted to pose to you so we don't talk enough about sort of what the Graveyard looks like of these ideas gone wrong it's quite possible that 2011 to 2016 you spend all of that time working on something and it didn't work in fact that would be the expected outcome of this type of endeavor but that said no one goes into something with a belief that it's going to fail without getting too much into the rose-colored glasses that inevitably bias our ability to look back what proof points did you look to to say there's a biological plausibility here that if it wasn't there would have had you less likely to consider it and if you can Ned try to answer it in a broad enough way that it would be applicable to other endeavors that maybe don't deal with senescence cells in other words I'm asking this through the lens of somebody who's considering finishing their lab or finishing their time in their lab or even graduating from undergrad and wanting to join a company how can they think through handicapping the odds of success which you've done a number of times so the approach I take to a bold idea like this idea of making drugs that eliminate senescence cells is I try to picture it's a simple beautiful idea and I try to picture the end state like what does this look like at the end and then I say okay I can see this in my mind and then

[01:07:28] I say well what are the existential risks to that beautiful simple dream and I try to write them down in the most primitive way I can and so those four questions they were the four risks which is that senescence cells don't contribute to naturally Jake I'll use this particular example back out a sec that was a risk they don't contribute to natural aging they don't cause a particular disease of aging you can never find a molecule to eliminate or eliminating them as unsafe and those were the four risks we came up with and you can apply this risk to a beautiful simple idea in any technological endeavor that I've been involved in what's nice about that is one of those is a very clear market risk three of those our biologic or technology risks your second question is actually a market risk question in other words if number one worked so if number one is this absolutely explains natural aging if number three was true you could come up with a molecule that could block it and number four was true you could do so safely but there was no way there's a regulatory pathway that was going to allow you to go from A to B because hook spine disease was never gonna show up on the FDA's list of druggable things to think about it's not to say that it couldn't work but now you've taken on an enormous regulatory risk that would be almost crushing to any one company so what I'm hearing you say is embedded in your questions was actually a very thoughtful risk analysis that reverse engineered success I think so it turned out to be a good way for us to focus ourselves how long did it take you guys to come up with those four questions because it was just five of you if I did my math right there was a few orbitting so my long-term business partner Keith

[01:09:19] Leonard he was at the time we had founded a previous company together and he was still being the CEO at that company where I had previously been the chief science officer but he was involved in this and a few other just very smart people that I will pull into these things I need very simple thinkers for this sort of thing because you must in a very discipline way distill out to these primitive risks that can animate behavior over many years they have to be durable if you can summon the discipline and the simplicity to distill the next say four to five years your life down to call it two to four risks because any more than that and your life gets too complicated and then you can build work plans that systematically remove each of those risks or do not remove them but at least identify them yeah identify them and then build plans everything we did at the company for four years everything was those four risks that was it and the money we raised was pretty paltry at the time it was all budgeted around those four risks and whenever I go after a new thing I always try to just go back to that simple beautiful idea and then say can I write down the risks to this beautiful idea then you build plans from them and then you build budgets and then you politely ask people for money which by the way almost no one would provide because this idea seems relatively preposterous at the time the people that stepped forward were people like Bob

[01:10:56] Nelson from arche who has been a visionary across decades of biotech and it was he who when I explained this to him very rapidly said yeah let's do this there's some other people that artists like Kristina burro who was very supportive early on so that really was the prime anchor early on in the life of the company and animated all of our behavior and that was four years of my life how long did it take you guys to define those questions now because the way you rattled them off they're so logical they're so obvious but my guess is those were not immediately apparent to you in 2011 that those were the four things that had to be wrestled to the ground no we kind of didn't know them really yeah so it's funny I recently went through the early I was looking through some old files and I found an old PowerPoint where there was six risks and it was clear that we'd done some kind of pruning down to the most primitive because I'm I'm kind of a tyrant when it comes down to like we must have them simplest plans sort of thing so there had been some pruning but

[01:12:00] I know that we initially generated the list of a half dozen or so and then over a period of weeks I think we managed to just in a disciplined way shear them down to this relatively streamlined plan now did you learn this the hard way was there a time when you went down the path of trying to do something lacked this discipline and found yourself sort of looking back some time later thinking we wasted time we wasted money we didn't pursue this as linearly as we could have absolutely no wouldn't really taught me this this is something I sort of learned a bit on the fly kind of in the eras in which I was building companies like okay and Kai Thera said those were all early 2000s so occasion was 2003 cath arrows around 2005 my first company which I founded my last year of graduate school we were strategy free this was a high throughput structural biology company called CX and we never had any of these intellectual tools and so these were tools that were really developed through feeling as though we wasted time which is your most valuable resource and you wasted people's money which was a also valuable resource and the net effect of this has been now this discipline streamlining of idea and risk yeah so it's something that just picked up over time and now it's reflexive and I everybody in my group everyone thinks this way and we're true and so whenever a new thing comes up immediately everyone goes to the board and starts writing out risks and then starts writing out well this is the de-risking plan for this this and this and okay that means it's 18 months and this is kind of the budget do you think that that type of thinking is productive or counterproductive in academia it's clearly productive in industry if you tomorrow decided I want to go back and start a lab and go back to Berkeley and apply for a grant would you encourage your graduate students and postdocs to think that way or would you modify the thinking slightly I would be modified but I think there is kind of value to this I think in any setting where you have a problem or a technological thing you're trying to solve which is being explicit about the failure modes even if you're an academic in an academic setting and I'm speaking specifically of biology or something akin to it like I can't talk to you about math or something because I think it drives a certain degree of honesty when things are failing so you know what to see and so if you're looking out for this isn't working and this isn't working and only this is working and all three have to work for this project to go you can make a go/no-go decision in an academic setting and pivot to another project cuz there's there's no end of creative ideas that you could be working on they're limitless and so the important thing is to conserve your most valuable resource which is your time and so I encourage my academic friends some of whom listen and some of whom do not okay to think similarly and to take a sort of portfolio approach to academic projects which is it's okay to prosecute this question for 18 months but there are certain things we won't have in 18 months and if you do not have them we make a formal go/no-go decision meanwhile you had two other projects going and so what you need is only one to raise its hand and say I'm working yeah that was super helpful let's go back to kind of you now have the answer these four questions is it safe to say there are still a number of ways to do this in other words if you know that senescence is a natural part of Aging if you know that there are specific diseases for which it plays a role if you know that there are molecules that can be developed that can target it and you know that it can be done safely that third question really has many heads you can have molecules that kill senescent cells you could have molecules that target the factors they secrete presumably there are other ways you could mash Nate around this had you fixated early on you alluded to it that killing cells is something we really know how to do pretty well in biology was that the path you guys were on from the beginning or was that a pivot early on we honored the possibility that we could either eliminate the cells because that's what was achieved genetically and was our proof of concept but we could also come up with ways to reduce the pathological

[01:16:26] SAS that these cells were creating it wasn't so much as a pivot but a decision to go one way rather than the other because in the beginning we thought you could do either and the decision was driven by a simple idea which is that were you to make molecules that would simply suppress the secretions of the cells but not remove the source of all of these factors you'd have a drug yet to take all the time and the cool thing about eliminating it also assumes you know all the factors your approach strikes me as the more logical approach but there are companies doing the other approach correct yeah well you could take the position that any antibody therapeutic against one of these pro-inflammatory in this ASP is just such an approach actually I was saying something a little bit more I understand your point the primordial I was suggesting if you understood for example the regulatory mechanism that makes the cell decide to secrete all of these factors and you targeted that then hey what you've done is you've shut down the secretion the cells sitting there not dividing how bad can it be but what motivated us was this would be a drug you would have to take all the time and what we thought was so neat about the idea of making a molecule that could eliminate senescence cells which we then named we called them Senna lytic molecules if you could make a Sen oolitic molecule you could dose it once and once you eliminate senescence cells the cells are not there anymore so these are not drugs you take every day every week or every month these might be dosed once a year and till your body makes more senescence cells and in fact which member we can talk about later in our human clinical data what we show is that when we eliminate senescence cells from the painful knee joint of a human being with osteoarthritis a single administration of a sin oolitic medicine eliminates pain dramatically in these humans for as long as we've looked and so the cells we don't know if the cells have come back but we don't think they have come back by that time this sort of validates the notion that you can now have a drug it's far safer because what kills most drugs actually is the fact that they're unsafe that generally as a result of treatment again and again and again you don't have to do that if you can go in once surgically eliminate the cells mean surgically metaphorically here it's not surgical you can make a safer drug least theoretically and that's why we went that direction so there's another big challenge here which is how do you identify which cells are the senescence cells in vivo when you don't have the luxury you've had in the animal lab which is you get to label those cells you get to put big targets on them what was the proof of concept that you could go into an organism and without the luxury of having the senescence cells raise their hand and here we are metaphorically actually send out snipers to get them deep profiling of human tissues for senescence exists but it's few and far between and so we undertook a study and this is after we demonstrated animals that osteoarthritis which is the second most prevalent disease of Aging and the primary reason it hurts to be old what's the first by the way type 2 diabetes interesting so what we did is we knew from animals that if we could induce surgical trauma to an animals knee a mouse and we eliminated senescence cells that we could eliminate pain and actually repair cartilage in a mouse wait a second that's counterintuitive I know that's what's so cool well it's counterintuitive because of the experiment you shared with me earlier that Judith's group did I think it was she was group that did this looking at wound healing you would think if senescence cells were necessary for wound healing they would be necessary for the non pathologic healing of cartilage following surgical trauma and they may be so our theory about what's going on in osteoarthritis and this is just one of the ideas we entertain here and I can explain what data we have that supports this notion is that senescence cells accumulate at sites of osteoarthritis in fact they may be trying to heal got it but unlike in the skin they literally fall off in the context of healing this cells remain and essentially continue to sound the alarm over and over and over again and we think it could be giving a sort of flawed attempt at wound healing that could be driving the pathophysiology of disease and the margin for error sorry to interrupt is much smaller in a joint in other words you don't have to heal a wound perfectly to achieve a functional outcome that is perfect you might not have a cosmetically perfect outcome but functionally you could have a hypertrophic scar you could have a keloid you could have this you could have that but you've closed the barrier to the outside world but inside of a joint it's a very delicate balance of one cell layer to many and all of a sudden you have a different outcome than you had prior to the insult yeah coupled with everything you said I mean that's all of these things factored

[01:21:36] I suppose so what we were able to show in animals was that when we induced trauma by cutting the ACL which is known to be risk factor for human osteoarthritis of the knee we got something that looked like osteoarthritis and we eliminated senescence cells either genetically or with our drug in which we've now taken into human beings we could in this trauma-induced setting and sorry that genetic Mouse just to be sure that's a mouse that has a genetic tag for senescence cells that's easy to turn off that's correct okay one aside question is there a mouse model of osteoarthritis that comes from overweight or obesity no is that the most common cause of osteoarthritis in humans it's a comorbidity I'm not aware that anyone's established a causality but it would make some sense that it could be causal because of weight bearing this interesting so the animal model for osteoarthritis is an ACL injury which is still true in humans but there are a few different models for us - arthritis and so really one of the things we've learned is that when you attempt to model disease there are lots of off-the-shelf models that people have built for things like osteoarthritis because they're making a painkiller so they do things like hurt the animals knee and then give it a painkiller how relevant is that to osteoarthritis in a human it's not you inject a odo a sedate into the joint it hurts like hell and then you give them painkillers so we had to search around for models that happened fast because that's the way we do experiments in which senescence played a role and and the ACL T model so this was work we did collaboratively with Jennifer Alice Eve who's a professor at Johns Hopkins of bioengineering and she was someone old friend and she'd been thinking about osteoarthritis and had the model in her lab and I called her up one day and I said we have this crazy idea we think that senescence cells could be driving this disease do you want to try to figure this out with us and she was an awesome collaborator some of the first synthetic molecules we found we shared with her and she had her model in operation and very quickly in her laboratory we were able to demonstrate the Senna lytic molecule so we dedenne the buck Institute in Judy's group one of them was active in Jennifer's model of osteoarthritis and so for the first time we actually had a disease a human disease the second most prevalent disease of Aging the primary reason it hurts to be old I can't overstate that enough it's like being in pain sucks and this is the reason old people are in pain mostly and we could drive that disease backwards in a mouse so we were just overjoyed by this because we can achieve it genetically which says it's really senescence cells and the second thing is we could also achieve the same result with a drug like molecule it was the confluence of those two results that convinced us this is really cool it seems that we got the idea right how does the drug actually target the senescence cell when you don't have the luxury of a genetic tag we spent the first remember that was question three of the big four questions we spent the first two and a half years of this whole effort searching fruitlessly and not finding us analytic molecule and the first molecule we identified followed swiftly by the second and then a series of others that were very related to the second one the first molecule identified was a mdm2 p53 interaction inhibitor and so normally mdm2 is this ubiquitin ligase so it walks around and it's like a meter maid who goes around marking cars with chalk for getting a parking ticket but what mdm2 does is it walks around and it marks proteins with a little molecule called ubiquitin and it marks them for destruction and p53 is one of its client proteins and so if you break up the interaction between mdm2 and p53 p53 doesn't get marked for destruction so it's concentration and the cell goes up and discovered in Judy's lab by a few people including remi martan L'Auberge who was a postdoc in Judy's lab at the time he discovered that when you did this to senescence cells senescence cells died preferentially by the way is there anything on the outside of SMS and cell that identifies it there are some things on the inside and we've been searching but it's not like you have an antibody or anything that would render it externally identified we are searching now and we don't have any universal external marker of senescence cells we do have some that we just haven't talked about openly yet in various disease states where the senescence cells in a diseased state have a marker that's on the outside we've not found in people like Ned

[01:26:20] Sharples have been searching for over a decade for such a marker Wow so just to add to the complexity of the biology if you were on a little mini nano spaceship and you were inside the joint of a person with osteoarthritis you wouldn't be able to look out and see which of the cells are actually senescent and which ones are normal which ones are simply injured you wouldn't be able to make that distinction so even if you had a special gun to shoot senescent cells you wouldn't know which cells to shoot based on just the observation of the cell optically no now if you had a little bit of a sniffer eyes would not be useful if you were very small a nose however would be useful so if you could just sort of swim up the gradient of pro-inflammatory and pro fibrotic markers you would find yourself you find your source yeah right so I do think that the little mini spaceship thing is often very illuminating to think about biology I use that a lot your drug then targets p53 that's right yes so so p53 goes up in these cells so it doesn't target 53 it actually binds on the mdm2 side thereby kicking me relieving yeah yes okay and then so p53 goes up in concentration the senescence cells die selectively and then and this turned out to work very well in our trauma osteoarthritis models and another very cold result this is what's something else that Jennifer did wind up in our nature paper or nature medicine paper in 2017 was Jennifer got nice from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty so these are people who don't need their knees anymore because they're getting a metal one and she would take the cartilage at the site of the osteoarthritic lesion and she would digest out the extracellular matrix and she'd take the cells the cells actually make your cartilage and she would grow them in 3d culture and she would either expose those little blobs of baby cartilage to either vehicle or our drug that's now in Phase two clinical trials in humans and she observed something awesome which is that exposure to the drug eliminated senescence cells that were very prevalent from this site of damage you talked earlier about how you might see one to two percent senescence cells in an organism but when you talk about a very local spot of damage like that how highly concentrated were they so it's a little hard because I'll tell you a slightly different number because the cartilage stuff is so basically it's very there are a lot of them at the site where you have the osteoarthritic injury and you go millimeters away and then it drops way down so it's a more puncta of it in that setting if you look it to the synovial membrane which is I'll talk to you about another study we did in humans where we actually counted senescence cells in patients with osteoarthritis the number hovers around one to two percent even in patients with osteoarthritis but it scales with you have more senescence cells when you have more disease and when you say do you mean synovial fluid like if you did a joint aspiration on somebody with osteoarthritis you're saying one to two percent of the cells in the synovial fluid now senescence so we actually did tell you I'll come back to this a little bit later they just finish up and then we'll immediately flip to that sorry okay is that we did this experiment where we soaked the cartilage from the patients that had osteoarthritis in our drug and eliminated senescence cells but a really really cool thing is they started growing cartilage in the plastic dish so these are cells that came from the sick person's knee they had the capacity to make cartilage but they just didn't but once you eliminated the cells all of a sudden they were producing cartilage again and so that was super cool we have yet to prove in a human being that this drug can grow cartilage when it's still in your knee but that experiment is cleaned it cool because it suggests that you have this innate capacity if you were unburdened by these cells and they're bad stuff they're making so this next question about how many cells you the disease I'll tell you why I'm asking the question which is not just general curiosity it's really to get a question of how difficult is it to target these things in vivo are they ubiquitous enough that you can whack these things with an injection because obviously when you're doing this in a person you're not going to have the luxury of taking their knee out to do it that's sort of the etiology of my question so I'll tell you a little bit what we've done in the clinic so in human beings we have eliminated senescent cells from patients knees with a single injection of this drug and we can not only eliminate or dramatically reduce pain but we can also eliminate factors that senescent cells are making so the quick answer to your question is that this molecule is safe enough selective enough and potent enough that we can do it so it doesn't just work in a plastic dish but it works actually within the knee of a patient suffering from osteoarthritis so this was your phase one trial with your first agent this is the 101 yeah that's right mm-hmm

[01:31:29] I've seen the phase one data maybe explain a little bit of what was done phase one for people who aren't familiar with drug studies is mostly to ensure safety but sometimes you'll see efficacy sometimes you'll see that the drug actually does something beneficial and that's a bonus if you can see both efficacy and safety but you're typically escalating the dose and again you want to see if more drug leads to more toxicity but if there's efficacy and the efficacy improves with dose that makes you a bit more confident that it's not the placebo effect or not the effect of the vehicle that you use to deliver the drug that's correct so the experiment we did and this was all the result of what we saw in animals the result of what we saw in a phase zero study in which we went into patients with osteoarthritis no drugs but we biopsied little bits of their synovial membrane and counted senescence cells and we saw that the more senescence cells they had the worse osteoarthritis they had the more bone deformation they had in the knee the more pain they had so emboldened by these results we then took the drug to humans and as you noted phase one studies are typically for safety we realized though that we couldn't really do the right safety study in patients that didn't have a senescence up burden because if you're asking the question is it safe to eliminate senescence cells from a nasty orthotic knee you need to have the cells to eliminate and so that was our kind of logic in the design and so the way we did the study was 48 patients where we did a three to one randomization meaning three people would get drug versus one person giving placebo and as you noted we stepped up in dose and it was a single dose of the drug at day zero injected into the knees of patients with painful osteoarthritis and we then followed these patients for three months and we checked in with them every week and they checked in with themselves every day on a little iPhone device and we monitored their pain and the investigators were blinded as well oh yes every it's called a double-blind study which means nobody knows who's got drug who's got placebo or what dose of drug you were on so there's 12 placebos 36 treatments treated patients and those 36 treated patients were about 6 per dose they were 6 per dose yeah so we had 6 dose levels and so they were marched up from essentially a group of a series of doses three of them which we based on some modeling we did and in cell culture we thought would be sub pharmacologically active doses so we thought they'd be semi and active or inactive entirely and then we moved into the dose range where we thought we'd be doing biology in the knee and we saw what happened and we asked the patients they had once a week meetings with their physician where they answered questionnaires about their pain about their functional state then every day they would go and they'd enter on a little iPhone device they'd answer one question which is how much pain am I in on a scale of 1 to 10 and what we saw when we unblinded the data was that there was a dose dependent meaning as you go up in dose you get more and more pain reduction and durable impact in pain and for as long as we looked when you got to 3 months the pain is not returning its completely flat do you remember what the placebo group experienced how much of a reduction in pain did they achieve relative to their baseline it depends on which of the endpoints were using but

[01:35:02] I'll just summarize by saying that injections into the knee placebo effect is a big deal in fact if you did not see a placebo effect that looked like other clinical trials you would scratch your head and wonder what's wrong we saw a very similar placebo effect to what is seen with the injection of steroids into the knee and that was actually good meaning if you do a trial with steroids and with saline for example you saw the same placebo effect you didn't see the same effect as you saw with steroid correct you see the placebo groups in a steroid trial had comparable yeah it looked like the placebo effect in our trial and that is something that one must the placebo effects in pain studies is absolutely important but what we saw was that we vastly exceeded anything looking like the placebo effect so in fact it our highest dose of drug again because it's a phase one study the n number of patients was small at the highest dose we saw patients who were entering so this is this scale of one to ten thing okay it's actually zero to ten patients were entering on average about a six point two and at the highest dose they were dropping to just over one is that comparable to what patients experience with steroids I know it's not apples to apples and by the way it's a reason it's not apples to apples that I actually learned on this clinical study the reason you don't compare across studies is that different studies in world different patients different inclusion exclusion criteria even if you use the very same clinical instrument it's really not an apples to apples comparison that said okay the effect looks very large in terms of what we are doing in terms of approaching our highest dose getting some patients close to pain-free now I know that the phase one trial was a three-month study what's the average duration that patients have now been since their injections I don't have the answer to that question we are not monitoring the patients in that study going forward because we didn't consent them for that what we are doing now is we're actively dosing patients and phase two study so presumably the duration will be extended in Phase two that's right so because we only went three months in the phase one study and we didn't consent patients to keep watching them we really wanted to answer this question which is if you eliminate senescence cells from somebody's knee how long does the pain stay away and so the phase two study goes out to six months so it's 24 weeks and we're trying to replicate the phase one study as much as we can so we're using the same clinical instruments to measure pain and function we're similar dose levels so we're doing placebo half MIG two MiG's four MiG's okay which was the highest dose that we explored in the phase one study and it's 45 patients per dose level as opposed to six so we should have sufficient statistical power to really see this really clearly and in terms of the criteria of the patients that are coming in they have to have painful osteoarthritis of the knee and so there is a score this thing called the NRS which is this numerical rating scale this is this zero to ten so it's an 11-point scale and you have to be between a four and a nine and are these patients that typically have already tried corticosteroids and only achieved limited or short-term response like I'm trying to understand clinically somebody listening to this who should and shouldn't be excited about this type of work on the horizon so I think all of us should be excited about this work because not only is this a solution so if our phase two replicates the phase one and which we all hope and believe it not to not only is this a means to treat the primary reason it hurts to be old but it's he read through to this whole idea of medicine which is could you treat diseases of Aging by eliminating these cells at sites of disease this is just the beginning of something well let me go back and make sure I understand a few things because I'm already doing what you're doing I think which is sort of extrapolating to the what it means is radiographic evidence a weight because you can certainly look at a person's knee on an x-ray and examine the loss cartilage and appreciate an osteoarthritic need you could do the same thing on an MRI do you know if the reverse is true do you know if the level of cartilage that's making its way back into the knee as a result of the loss of senescent cells is radiographically evident as well or is it possible that some of the amelioration of pain is due to the reduction of the circulating factors there but not so much an increase in the structural integrity of the knee so what we saw in terms of the speed of pain resolution in the phase one was it within two weeks of the injection you achieved most of your pain reduction so it seems pretty implausible to me that that is the result of a structural change to your joint it seems far more likely this is the result of getting rid of factors that are driving pain acutely and it's possible like my questions are probably so ignorant and

[01:40:15] I'm sure there's some orthopedic surgeon listening to this cringing we would assume that some of the pain that people experience in osteoarthritis is due to this structural part of this but your evidence would suggest that at least part of the pain is not it's consistent with that idea but who's to say so we're going to know because we're also doing

[01:40:33] MRI and x-ray in the phase 2 study and so we're gonna be able to not only follow pain but we will follow structure as well but we have no idea if you will see improvements in the structure of the joint over what time scale you would see changes and improvements to the structure of the joint this is the cool thing about doing cutting-edge biology and clinical science I mean I would love to take a group of patients if resources were no object and we could continue to be absolutely sure the safety of this you know you man should take a bunch of people our age and you do a bunch of t2-weighted images MRIs of their spine and you look at these signal loss l4 l5 l5 s1 disks many people our age myself certainly have these blown out blackened disks that just aren't taking up water and I have them yeah it would be very interesting to note if you did directed injections of cinah lytic agents like this if you could restore this signal could you by eradicating enough senescence cell create an environment where the existing cell could proliferate into a healthy enough place where it takes up water something as simple as that that again it's a slippery slope in the spine to go after indications because it's not as clean as the knee I don't think but again just a great proof of concept yeah I will say that I suffer from degenerative disc disease it's well everyone does at some point but it's particularly prevalent in my family there was a result I did not mention earlier from mice that when we eliminate senescence cells from mice from mid life until death and we do x-ray on their spines we see a 41% improvement in the maintenance of the intervertebral disk volume now do you see a restoration or a reduction in decline we only measured reduction in decline so we do not know if you could see restoration so that's still an unknown question in the senescence pace absolutely so it's possible you me and all the other folks that are in the senior category here won't necessarily reap the benefits nearly as much as the people like your kid my kid right now where you figure this out and when you're 20 you start to prophylactically take these things to reduce the glide rate of decline that might be true structurally but I would say that what we saw in our phase one study was you can take people with Frank painful osteoarthritis of the knee dosed them in two weeks later they have profound pain reduction at the highest dose so that tells you that you are taking a big feature of that disease the one that you get to feel on a minute-to-minute basis and you are sending it backwards now whether or not that becomes a structural change is something we hope to understand in the phase 2 study and the other thing we I guess don't understand and it might take even more than a phase 2 study to understand is with corticosteroids we have problems which is excessive use of corticosteroids is not a viable option no they themselves become destructive and/or potentially lose efficacy over time and so there are great once-in-a-while tool but not a great maintenance tool it will be interesting to know if this if you become tachyphylactic to this or if the efficacy increases with use as you start to increase the amount of cartilage Lang tissue that exists and the you tip the battle in favor of the chondrocyte over the senescence cell yeah that would be the kind of prediction one would make from the simple sort of zero order prediction would be that I think is there an example in bio pharmacology where the good guy ends up winning with progressive dosing oh I would say oncology if you think about cancer is a gain of function only in the cancers that don't spread though but that's sort of that almost seems binary doesn't yeah

[01:44:20] I guess you're right I guess you could say so because if you think of cancer as I sort of pitted battle between you the organism and cancer which is sort of a gain-of-function separate organism based on you living in you but not you when you successfully treat cancer through the elimination of those cells the good guy one yeah I guess I guess that's true some of the time but most of the time that's not true it's sort of a tautology right it's true when it's true but when it's not it's not but most the time it's not true is the problem but I could certainly be the case here there's certainly a case but even if the worst-case scenario is you need a drug injected every six months or every 12 months it's certainly interesting let's go one step further because this is obviously a critical piece of healthspan in fact you could argue that along with cognition there's no more important piece of health span than the structural integrity of your body as you age have you in your leisure time had the ability to think about how this might impact lifespan visa vie atherosclerosis cancer or other diseases that actually shortened life well we know that atherosclerosis is another disease in which senescence plays a role now we're not currently working on that one of the things you may have noticed is that osteoarthritis the way we approach the disease even though it affects many of the 360 joints in your body we treat the local version of the disease with local therapy athletic or

[01:45:47] OSIS is about a systemic as it gets and yon vendors and at Mayo Clinic published a paper actually was young vendors and the guy named very excellent young scientist named Ben childs and this is a paper in science in which he showed in rodents that senescence cells accumulate in the atherosclerosis that form in high-fat diet mouse which is a model that can predict say statin efficacy to some extent although exaggerated sit somewhat compared to the human case and what

[01:46:22] Bennett showed these plaques are full of senescence cells and if you eliminate those cells what are the cells that have become senescent what's their origin so they appear to be macrophage in origin I see so it's not the end of fuel cells well no there's three cell types it's basically there's senescent endothelium there is a myofibril blastic type of cell that's in there and then there are macrophages so it's all three it's basically the barrier the immune cell that came to the rescue and the fibroblasts that attempted to repair the damage yeah all of them and when you eliminate these senescence cells either genetically or with a drug first of all you can reduce plaque volume which is cool but what might even be cooler is that and again it's in a mouse and so you just gotta wonder what is that really saying about a pathophysiology of the human disease but there is this fibrotic cap that forms on the surface of an anthro sporadic plaque and one of the ideas in the literature is if the thinning of that plaque gives rise to a unstable plaque that is clinically dangerous and that interventions that can thicken that plaque might be a therapy because you could take a plaque that you have and now convert it into something clinically more innocuous in what Yann showed was that genetically and with drug that he can thicken the plaques of athos guard plaques in a minute that would seem to counter the idea that you could lessen plaque volume do you have to pick between one of those two strategies because typically if you thickened the plaque wouldn't you likely increase the volume no so that if you look at the sort of relative partitioning of how much of the plaque volume is kind of the and then how much is this sort of bulk sort of lipid deposit with macrophages in it eyeballing it it's you know ninety percent is this kind of lipid II sort of macrophage blob and then there's this thin little kind of veneer on top that is the cap and so the thickening of that cap doesn't dramatically contribute to the overall volume of the ah throw slack at least in a mouse but both are happening you're thickening the cap and reducing the sub endothelial portion of the mm-hmm reducing the foam song yeah so a throw is it's a very tough place to do drug development I mean we've seen the pcsk9 story has been a multi billion dollar battle that has given rise to relatively moderate uptake of those drugs could argue that's just due to the cost of the drug it's also the fact that yeah it's a relative cost issue going up against statins so switching people and all this sort of thing but it's not been it's caused a sort of downward pressure on people's enthusiasm for doing cardiovascular or drug discovery just the because now we have to you're not using circuit markers anymore you're using outcome studies you're actually following people until they die or have a serious cardiac event do you see an application here in oncology I mean it seems like there should be well it's an area of interest of ours so one of the things we saw in yan vendors and 2016 paper was that these mice from whom we eliminated senescent cells from mid life until death they had the same cancer prevalence so 85% of them died of lymphoma with and without senescence cells the difference is that when you eliminate the cells the animals from whom these cells were eliminated get cancer 30 percent later in their lives so you have to kind of this head scratch from them like what is that if I recall you said they got a 30% lifespan extension yeah so you basically created centenarians you just phase-shifted chronic disease by 1/3 and some of the diseases were just dramatically reduced so the effects on kidney function the aged effects of kidney function were reduced dramatically cataracs would produce dramatically so there's a whole bunch of behavior stuff that we don't know what that means but these animals seem to preserve features of youthful behavior their spine Oh Lord

[01:50:30] Lord doses looks youthful so there's a whole set of things but one of the things that people often ask about the experiment is do they die of different things when you live 30% longer and the answer is no they die of the same thing mostly now that could have to do with the fact that it's mice and these lab strains of mice yeah they just get cancer like crazy it's less interesting to me that it's how much lymphoma they get it's more interesting to me that you could phase-shifted so we don't know why that is but an explanation that makes some sense to me is that there is something perverse that senescent cells do to the tissue microenvironment so this system which is an anti-cancer system in the young could become a pro cancer system in the old by doing something to the tumor microenvironment that makes it more amenable to tumor

[01:51:24] Genesis and that would be consistent what you see where the rate of tumor formation across the animals life is unchanged but its ability to take root is delayed so you could imagine applications in oncology but you would require something in which you had some sort of highly sort of tumor prone in situation or you could intervene in it there's also an idea where if you could make cells senescent which is what chemotherapy does in many cases and then do a sort of a two-hit strategy where you drive the cells into senescence and then you exploit a senescence associated you know achilles heel so it could be a strategy in which you're deliberately you're trying to drive tumor cells into senescence and then killing them and then there are a series of cancers that we think that are aged associated that may be essentially the product of a highly senescent environment so cancers of the skin what if you could or cancers of the say the bladder or something like this these things that older people get could you go in and eliminate senescence cells and change trajectory of disease that's an idea that's very cool you could think about but I would say that the most powerful read through from our results so far in humans are these other diseases of aging for which we have no treatments so let us take something like the dry version of macular degeneration this is a disease for which there is no treatment in its 8 fold more prevalent than the wet disease that you can treat with anti veg s this is a disease that appears to have senescence associated with what's the distribution of those two so people that have age associated macular degeneration one in eight has the wet disease and only that one out of eight people is treatable with the anti veg F antibodies seven out of eight of those people are untreatable now that disease the dry disease moves more slowly but it makes you just as blind and so that is an area in which senescence enseña lytic medicines may play a role but we'll have to find out in the clinic and next year we are going with our first molecules into the I do you have an animal model for that No so you have animal models of the wet disease and our molecules work in that model and so you could say that that's pretty neat this is a giant opportunity but I am personally attracted first of all I want to say that when we talked about the four risks to find your work so yeah for four years we live in a different risk set now so if you think about it the chapter one of this entire effort really was demonstrating a human being that eliminating senescence cells could take a feature of Aging that otherwise was untreatable and sent it backwards our phase one study certainly if the Phase two replicates that was the end of chapter one and we're sort of living in this chapter two moment where we're seeing how broad can we make this work and if you think about what risks live in Chapter two for me and I think anybody it would be that the risk is you have your biological disease hypothesis wrong and animal models they only ask and answer the questions they're built to ask an answer and the only way you get to really ask me answer the question you want to ask is in the clinical setting in human beings so the way I think about diseases of the eye is you have a series of these untreatable diseases that make you blind where we think senescence could play a role and we're going to explore each of these in the clinic so essentially being able to ask in the relevant setting that can we intervene in these disease of aging using the very same approach that we took to osteoarthritis albeit with different drugs now you won't be doing a real phase one here you're gonna go in directly into a Phase two right so this is something that we haven't really talked about yet but notionally we're going to be going into patients because obviously your eye is something that's super super important and you can't mess with it we're going to be going into a very select population first demonstrating safety and then branching outwards into multiple diseases of the eye how do you deliver the vehicle is it an injection yeah so it's very similar to clinical practice for anti Vejjajiva

[01:55:42] Jeff yeah delivery so it goes right into the vitreous fluid of the eye and our drug then takes up we naturally know exactly where the drug goes into the various sub compartments within the eye and we know where senescent cells are in these different diseases and our drug gets there and the clinical hypothesis is that one or more of these in essentially progressive diseases of the aging eye when we eliminate the cells will stop and can you speak about the drug what is it targeting it's not targeting p53 no so we have two molecules that we're advancing toward the clinic both of them are inhibitors of the bcl-2 protein family so these are molecules that inhibit inhibitors of apoptosis so they cause cells to enter program to solve death but interestingly we've shown in animals that they don't cause that to happen in normal healthy eyes they only target cells that have been damaged by the disease process and the stress associated with disease process and so why is that there's something about so senescence cells when they enter this state do a variety of things they turn up proteins that are

[01:56:54] Pro apoptosis and they also turn up proteins in terms of our expression that are anti apoptosis so we do is we go in with a drug and just give a little shove in one direction I see but you're saying if you give that same shove to someone who has not upregulated or downregulated either those factors it doesn't seem to matter too much yeah and so we have a beautiful experiment in mouse where we have a disease condition okay and we have a normal condition mice are identical but for this and we put the drug in and we can see the drug molecular lis going in and engaging its target so because it actually breaks up two proteins that are stuck together and you can see in these animals both of them are equally engaging target but the apoptosis program only turns on in the disease

[01:57:45] State and it was a pretty awesome result because you can see the selectivity of molecules in a living creatures eye does that same molecule work in the osteoarthritic scenario no so we couldn't get it to work either in the trauma models in mice we couldn't get it to work when we took the cartilage out of human needs it didn't work there either and so it never raised its hand and what do you think that says about the biology there's something about cells and their fate that determines which apoptosis vulnerability you have they have different Achilles heels and we don't understand mechanistically why that is we've sort of figured this out empirically and picked molecules based on their behavior against the cells that we find to be senescent in these human diseases so 15 years from now or 20 years from now we will likely look back and companies like unity and presumably there will be many like unity you will have an entire suite of targets you will say well here's the PlayBook in this type of cell or this scenario going after the anti anti a pop tonic pathway is the way to go in this case we're gonna go after p53 and you might have a dozen of these different targets well we're not sure yet I think it's too early to say how this is gonna play out oh so you don't think it's a fait accompli I mean you think it might be that there's a very small number of ways to go about doing this I doubt that I doubt it will be dozens though I think it's going to be a small number I think it'll be context specific I think there'll be super creative ways that we and others come up with to exploit these different vulnerabilities I don't think biology is gonna have made 24 different keys to this lock I think it's gonna make a half dozen and we actively search for these it's just interesting to me that you can turn one key and get a benefit I mean think about how often that doesn't work think of the futility of that in chemotherapy where you target this one piece of cell cycle replication and very quickly the cell mutates away around that drug so cancer is incredibly hard okay because cancer exploits the single best tool biology has which is variation cancer cells can divide and mutate and become anything to avoid death they live under selective pressure particularly in the context of drug senescence cells can't divide by definition so their ability to access variation is dramatically reduced and that's not to say that there couldn't still be selection without division but boy it's way harder when you can't make a million progeny with tiny variants and test them all in parallel which is what cancer does yeah it's sort of funny isn't it cancer is the ultimate a be tester yeah we like to think of senescence cells as cancer cells that can't divide is one I've heard that said semi humorously but that's actually really bright which is sort of funny because it's like take the top 100 most valuable traits of cancer and take away ninety nine of them all right by the way

[02:01:09] I was saying that in somewhat joke no I understand yeah yeah in the sense that citizen cells become senescent well first of all in vivo we don't often know why they became senescent but one of the mechanisms by which cells can become senescent is activation of a cancer-causing gene but that could be very rare event compared to mitochondrial failure or high concentration in glucose or telomere shortening I mean I was gonna actually ask you exactly about that example which is do we have any reason to believe that the increase in age associated type-2 diabetes could be resulting from some sort of pancreatic senescence where beta cells become less and less robust due to senescent beta cells in the proximity there is some data in support of senescence in that cellular niche but it's very complicated biology and there is even some talk about compensatory mechanism where senescence cells actually may improve the function of some of those cells within the niche it's an area of intense literature debate the other challenge we have there is we don't have good models

[02:02:16] I mean animals of studying this and so it's been hard for us to get our heads around what I will say about type 2 diabetes in humans is that there was a large meta-analysis of a genome-wide Association studies looking for the genetic correlation between grievous illness of aging and low sigh where did these mutations happen and what you saw is that one of the very big Peaks for diseases of aging maps into the control system for the establishment of cellular senescence is this p14 RF locus and you look at this is where this very important gene that people use for senescence all the time called p16 which is this part of the emergency break its gene lives in this locus and what you see is diseases like type 2 diabetes mutations that give rise to that live their mutations that give rise to late onset Alzheimer's live their frailty lives their atherosclerosis lives there so a whole bunch of these diseases where we saw phenotypes in mice you see a natural genetic variation of humans also shows it kind of tie in to senescence and so type 2 diabetes caught my eye there because you see that in the gy studies and lastly what about Alzheimer's disease we have to believe that astrocytes are losing some functionality to protect neurons right so this is what my group works on and it's something that animates a lot of us at the company we know that astrocytes or glia just call them glial cells so if you guys don't know what glia is that's it's actually derived from the word glue so this is the the cells that are not your neurons in your brain that seem to hold the rest of it together which outnumber neurons term invest lino I think the number is on the order of ten to one eight to ten donors guys got to look that number up but it's on that order of magnitude and what was known before we got involved was that as human beings aged there's a dramatic increase in senescent glial cells specifically astrocytes and microglia which are the sort of macrophages of the brain and stuff we've been working on if we've been looking at that trend in rodents and we see a very similar trend now we have not talked about doing on this yet because it's still early days but it's hard to imagine that the pro-inflammatory environment created by this vast number of senescent clea cells is good for you one needs to ask the question what would happen if you could eliminate senescent glial cells would that enhance cognition wouldn't harm cognition and this is something that we are actively looking into but all of the work we've done over the last eight years everything going from the mutant animals to the wild-type animals to human data in osteoarthritis and now moving into human data soon with in the eye it would just be very hard to imagine that senescence is not playing a role in aspects of cognition loss as we age and this is something when I think about why we do what we do that is something that there could be very few greater contributions that myself and my colleagues could make than making a contribution there because it has been an unsolved problem and scourge to humanity I mean do you get the sense that doing what you've done now it would be very difficult for you to go back in time and do something like

[02:05:54] Kythera over again and I'm not saying that to be critical or in any way shape or form I'm just saying like I mean maybe tell people what Kyra did that was a very successful company for you but there's no comparing the nature of the two problems you're trying to solve yeah actually thank you for actually pulling me out of would otherwise be a kind of like overlay sort of sappy discussion about contribution okay so Kyra is actually a total kind of opposite sort of thing and I ther was a company that myself and two co-founders founded now almost 15 years ago it's about as opposite as you can get from doing unity and so it was basically this idea that all this biology that's been explored for oncology and inflammatory disease taking molecules from that and applying it to the biology of aesthetics and we did this and I had these great business partners that continued to be partners with me today one of them is Keith Leonard who's CEO at unity and very close friend and he's been my big brother for 15 years and continues as of this morning calling me and giving me feedback on things and

[02:07:02] I've just grown and the reason I did Kythera was it was sort of a cute idea but it was mostly because of people was these guys said hey let's do something together and it was a great decision because I learned so much in a sense because so the drug we ultimately got approved we took four things into the clinic and one out of the four things worked and it was a molecule that causes fat cells to explode so we went from an in vitro observation all the way to a launched commercial product called kybella you can go get at your dermatologist and Allergan acquired the company and it was a great learning experience of just how to develop pharmaceuticals in something that didn't have historical resonance at all and so it was a great sort of it was a great moment where the stakes weren't as high for whether you succeeded or failed it has a consequence that allowed you to hone your skills of kind of getting really high quality decisions on risk and making drug development decisions in a way that's actually frankly a little more dispassionate and it was a great growth experience for me

[02:08:11] I mean is it safe to say that if you had not had the experience at Chi Farah because then you would have been coming from occasion right basically yeah would you have had a more difficult time doing what you and the early co-founders did at Unity it would have been impossible I would have none of the intellectual or emotional toolkit to do what we did I mean that whole risk thing that was stuff we built I mean it was a little bit when we put together a Cajon but it had become a kind of ritualized practice by the time we were doing chi

[02:08:43] Thera projects this dimensionalization of risk and creating work plans based on it and so yeah I would say that there would be no unity without there being Chi Farah last question Ned what I should have two questions Ram sorry but I think about it first question is what advice do you give for a person who's studying science and trying to decide between the entrepreneurial pathway that you've been on versus a more academic pathway what would you offer them as an insight or a set of questions that they could pose to themselves to further delineate that well I would say two things first don't create a false choice all right so I have friends that are academics that have founded as many companies as I have and I do from time to time have career jealousy over over some of the freedoms and some of the responsibilities frankly that they have as people who have academic appointments there are wonderful things that you can do from the seat of academia in company creation if you are so lucky and so positioned to do so so first don't fall into this idea of a false choice and I see people do that I think out of some emotional discomfort this desire to just move and confuse action with progress and I'd say just slow down take a deep breath don't rush you have your life that be the first thing the second thing is animate what you do with a single beautiful idea so something that moves you that makes your gives you literally gives you goosebumps that weird tingling sensation when you think about it when you think how cool it is and oh my god if we could actually make this work I mean few things in life rival that feeling when a hard-fought battle for data that it was 18 to 24 months in the the experiment finally works and you're looking at the data and you feel like the future taking root in the present the only thing I can compare it to is love from their kids that is the only thing that has the same emotional gravitas finally third thing learn from people that are better than you that are more experienced than you that will have patience with you I mean the KY Thera experience was that I mean good heavens I was may still be sort of unemployable in normal corporate settings yet the people there saw that I knew how to do certain things and I learned from them and I learned how to do the things that allowed us to build unity because people were patient and took time to teach I learned from real experts and I don't claim to be an expert at much of anything but I do claim to have a deep appreciation for learning from people who are better and more skilled than myself so three things well I'm gonna leave it at that I was gonna ask you another question but I think this was the more interesting question and so we'll leave it that and grateful in that for the time that you've set aside today to talk about this stuff this is I think this is super interesting topic when I think of all the pillars of longevity going back to your initial framework right which is things that inhibit tore things that target mitochondrial function things that may set back the methylation clock slow down time in that regard in this problem it's not a zero-sum game and it's very likely we need to be pursuing all of these strategies in parallel but the data so far with respect to a very tangible problem like osteoarthritis is pretty exciting so I suspect who's gonna be a lot of people listening to this who are going to be very eager to all the results of the technology that you guys are trying to bring to market along with presumably some others down the line thank you Peter it's been really a treat and an honor to share this with you and
