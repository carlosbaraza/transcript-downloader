Adam Cohen is an orthopedic surgeon with expertise in sports medicine. In this episode, Adam breaks down the anatomy of the lower extremities: the hip, knee, ankle, and foot. He explains in detail the common injuries, sources of pain, and what leads to the development of arthritis. He lays out the non-surgical and surgical treatment options as well as the factors that determine whether surgery is appropriate. The discussion includes various procedures like hip replacement, knee replacement, ACL reconstruction, repair of meniscus tears, and more. Additionally, Adam sheds light on the utility of biological therapies like stem cells and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and how they compare to more traditional approaches.

## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of the episode:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Adam discussing lower extremity orthopedic injuries, focusing on the hip, knee, ankle, and foot. The conversation covers anatomy, common injuries, surgical and non-surgical interventions, and prevention strategies. Key themes include the importance of biomechanics, the role of early intervention, and the complex relationship between mechanical and biological factors in joint health.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Hip dysplasia develops as early as 4th week in utero, with acetabulum formation critical by 30th week [00:01:09]
- Cartilage has the lowest coefficient of friction of any known substance, smoother than Teflon [00:08:30]
- Knee forces during squatting can be 7x body weight behind kneecap [01:04:09]
- 50% of ACL tear patients develop arthritis within 15-20 years [01:10:03]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Maintain gluteus medius strength for lower extremity stability [00:30:21]
- Practice proper landing mechanics to prevent ACL injuries [01:16:48]
- Regular neuromuscular training for joint stability [01:57:51]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Use Pavlik harness for infant hip dysplasia [00:04:56]
- Consider mechanical alignment in exercise selection [01:06:34]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:
- Dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS) exercises recommended [01:37:38]
- Blood flow restriction training useful for quad strengthening [01:37:38]
- Jumping rope and basic plyometrics for tendon health [01:57:51]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Nothing's worse for you than inactivity" [01:04:51]
"The satisfaction rate after knee replacement is different than hip replacement... people feel like it's a normal hip but they don't feel like it's a normal knee" [01:41:57]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What role does genetics play in joint degeneration?
2. How might emerging biologics change treatment approaches?
3. What are the best preventive strategies for maintaining joint health throughout life?
4. How do different activity levels affect joint longevity?

[00:00:00] there's no way that that's not helpful for all of lower extremity injuries is to be able to know where you are in space and to have good training in those Dynamic situations because that's when people are injured nobody wanted to trip on the sidewalk but what happens when you trip are you able to recover quickly or do you end up with an injury hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter AA hey Adam thank you so much for coming uh from New York to

[00:00:34] Austin um very excited to do this and of course this needs to be done in person um we're going to do today what I did with your colleague Dr Baron a little while ago on the upper extremity which is everything you need to know about the lower extremity and its Orthopedic injuries so um for each of the major issues the hip the knee the foot we're going to talk about the anatomy talk about what goes wrong we'll talk about the surgical and non-surgical management for those things um so thanks very much for joining sure great thanks for having me appreciate it start with the yeah let's Jump Right

[00:01:09] In um so let's talk about the anatomy of the hip uh the hip joint is a ball and socket joint um have a model here the unlike the shoulder it's it's a very contained concentric joint and and much more stable under normal circumstances than the shoulder it's a it's a deep deep socket the socket is called the acetabulum this is the femoral head and the femoral head is covered with cartilage we place this down for a moment if we just focus on the proximal femur we have the head as I mentioned the neck and this is the subtrochanteric region and this is the trochanteric region um the acetabulum is formed in utero it starts about fourth fourth week in utero and then by the uh 30th week it starts to develop um and I think that's a good starting spot because a lot of the problems that we see or a number of the problems we see in the hip really start that early there is a condition called a developmental dysplasia of the hip used to be referred to as congenital dysplasia of the hip but we felt that uh it's it's there there are more factors involved than than any congenital ones particular basically what happens is if the if the hip is not concentrically reduced um as either late in stages of pregnancy or in early childhood the first several months of life in fact um the acetabulum will not form properly so for example if the ball is shifted out of the socket let's say due to positioning in utero where it's not completely uh in the acetabulum will not form correctly what that means is is that after birth if the if it's sitting outward this deep socket will not form and it'll be quite shallow that has major implications later in life because if it's not deep in the socket it's sitting on the edge of the socket which means there's greater pressure here and that pressure can lead to Mechanical overload in arthritis so even um conditions that have much happened much later in life uh can start quite early so a child that'ss breached for example during pregnancy which our one of our kids was breached um as soon as he was born they immediately said he has hip dysplasia he was in a brace for nine months he was in a sped open brace for nine months and I remember sort of freaking out thinking oh my God he's never going to be able to do anything and they're like no he'll be fine like as long you keep him in this brace and he was in that brace 23 hours and 45 minutes a day he basically only came out of it for a bath it was actually hell on my wife but nine months later his hips were fine that's kind of remarkable right so it's called the pavic harness and um you know there's it actually is quite comfortable for the child there's they don't you can put it on and take it off without much of a fuss or no more fuss than normally um but we we know that if the ball is not sitting in there in that socket um it will not form properly so the the harness keeps keeps that positioning until the acetab acetabulum forms properly you know the exams that pediatricians do we always check the hip and we want to make sure that it's it's in it's in the socket um I think going forward a lot of lot more Physicians and

[00:04:56] Orthopedic Pediatric Specialists are using ultrasound to better quantify that the hip is in the socket because we really don't want to miss any dysplastic hips if you have a dysplastic hip um you are going to get arthritis now it doesn't mean it's going to be symptomatic necessarily it doesn't mean you're going to need a hip replacement but people who have dysplastic hips that is an acetabulum that did not form properly are going to get arthritis it's a mechanical problem where the force are unevenly distributed across that ball and there's Edge loading and that will break down over time no matter what you do do we have a sense of what the uh incidence is of uh congenital dysplasia or whatever the new name is developmental display of the hip um I don't as far as how many children born for every you know kids that are born I think it's about one in a thousand I think I might be wrong I would need to check on those numbers um but the important part is is that we shouldn't miss any and if we're basing it solely on an exam um I think we're going to miss more than if we base it on ultrasound and the ultrasound is really not that hard to do and certainly teachable um but that confirms that the ball is in the socket and the socket is healing properly um it's you know there was a study once done many many years ago where it was an animal study and they put a cub shaped object in the acetabulum and the acetabulum formed in the shape of a cube it is going to develop based on what is sitting in that area and if you wait too long what happens is the soft tissue deep in the socket will become hypertrophied and it's harder to get in so I have patients that I've seen who they come in to see me because they're hip hurts they're 28 29 years old never had a problem before did not suspect anything wrong and we have get an x-ray of the hip and they have arthritis and it's quite a shocking development because you don't know you don't necessarily know and for folks just listening the plain x-ray is a good enough tool for that diagnosis because you'll see the absence or thinning of cartilage where you should see it as in that diagram there correct so for yes for for arthritis that becomes symptomatic we can usually see that uh there obviously is a spectrum where the process starts to happen before it's we're even clinically aware of it and you know I think that's that's the future that's the trick is to find out before someone has clinical arthritis do we know about it and what can we do to avoid it and I also think it's important to really discuss what arthritis is because because I know just from my own patients um I say you have arthritis and there's a lot of conversation of what actually what actually does that mean um the surfaces the ends of all long bones have cartilage at the end it's it's a layer it's a very smooth layer and the only reason joints move painfree without friction is because of that cartilage the coefficient of friction of cartilage is so smooth it's smooth Smo than I on

[00:08:30] Ice there's no man-made substance I mean it's smoother than Teflon wow and it's a biologic substance it's it is constantly remodeling albe it's slow but it it is a it is a a biologic tissue that um can adjust to the pressures so arthritis is is part of arthritis is the loss of that cartilage the cartilage starts to thin um the condra ites which are the main cellular is the cell of cartilage its job is to create proteins to make the extracellular Matrix so that it remains healthy but condra sites that the the cartilage itself is avascular it gets its nutrition through diffusion from joints and they're not very efficient at making The extracellular Matrix which is imperative so if there is any un if there's overload of the cartilage the condra sites will respond and sometimes they die sometimes they go into sence and cartilage if you take the knee for example 2% of the cartilage is is condra sites and they they don't they don't have a lot of leeway when the load is substantial so when a person comes to your office and they're complaining of hip pain what is you know the most I don't know call it the three most likely sources of that pain and obviously we'll we'll go through some of the examination so people can sort of see how you will go about Gathering that information sure but what would be the top three most common diagnoses you'll encounter for person with hip pain and let's maybe bracket this by saying a person under 50 okay sure um so you know someone comes in with hip pain right away I'm sort of thinking about the different layers of the hip so in my mind I'm thinking is this is this a bone problem is it a bone cartilage problem is it a uh connective tissue problem that is a ligament problem is it something is the capsule too loose because the the ball is held in the socket by capsular layer um or is it a is it a muscle and tendon problem so we sort of we from Deep to superficial we have bone cartilage and then we have connective tissue ligaments capsule and then we have muscle tendon and then we also have to recognize that sometimes hip pain is referred pain that is it could be coming from your back so we're thinking about those separate layers and then we're also thinking about locations so someone who has pain in the front of the knee sorry the front of the hip is is different than someone side of the hip back of the hip so we need to tease all those factors out um so someone under the age of 50 you not would not necessarily be thinking about arthritis but it obviously is always is on on your mind um and it finding out a clue to what the diagnosis often depends on when it hurts where it hurts and what their activity is so for example um you know I think about patients they come in they say you know we have the endurance athlete we have the power athlete we have um the the non-athlete presum the non-athlete the the individual who is uh flexible gymnasts ballet dancers they sort of have different patterns of hip problems um if we start with the endurance athlete let's start there endurance endurance athletes is we start deep down in the joint the first thing we have to rule out is that this is not a stress fracture stress fractures can happen in a lot of different areas in the lower extremity and we separate them out is to high-risk stress fractures and lowrisk stress fractures risk of bad consequence if not treated correct so if someone if someone comes in and they have a marathon coming up and they say my hip hurts we have to make sure that this is not a stress fracture femoral neck stress fractures so just differentiate a stress fracture from a fracture sure so a stress fracture is something that occurs slowly so a stress fracture at

[00:12:51] Baseline potentially normal bone with a substantial load to that bone that is in excess of what the normal healing capacity is of that bone that is bone constantly remodels every time we put stress on it the microarchitecture is changing there's small tiny micr fractures that occur from normal weight bearing the body is very capable of adjusting to that load and making new bone when you start exercising or working out or running the bone will get stronger based on the stresses that that bone sees so for runners for for example um if you are training properly there's no reason to expect that that bone can can't adjust to the increased load that it's seeing but often times due to overtraining where you're not giving that bone enough of a chance to heal you develop these tiny little micr fractures that aren't given enough time to then heal and then it gets compounded when you go run the next day and the next day and you're increasing not only the number of times that you run but you're increasing the distance and the speed all at the same time you get a groin pain because that's where that's where stress fractures of the femoral neck hurt right away we know we need to rule it out and they tend to occur in the femoral neck and we have two locations either this is called the compression side and this is called the tension side of the neck and tension sided fractures where you get a little crack in the bone here are much more severe than compress

[00:14:29] FR side but the bottom line is that we need to know that this exists and the patient will feel groin pain which is otherwise difficult for them to differentiate I mean they're not going to come in and say my femoral neck hurts correct it's what is the actual feeling does it feel akin to what you would feel if you pulled a muscle in your groin it does except it's very weightbearing dependent so um most people come and say

[00:14:58] I I think I tore muscle I think I have a muscle strain I I don't see a lot of muscle strains in Runners without an injury right you run you're training you're not necessarily going to get a a a an acute injury like that so sort of the presentation slightly different um but it hurts in the groin and right away you don't let them run until you find out if it's if it's a stress fracture and here's why and sorry the MRI is the gold standard it is so x-rays we always need to get x-rays to make sure you're making sure that the joint looks healthy there are other conditions that can cause groin pain uh but it's usually negative it's usually hard to detect a stress fracture right when the pain starts the MRI is the gold standard to see that it used to be bone scan but that is Impractical um and an MRI really is excellent at looking because you can see the architecture of the bone and you can see um basically what we call edema in the bone or a bone marrow lesion and sometimes a crack in the bone and it's graded there's stress reactions and then there's stress fracture stress reaction is like a pre-stress fracture and the reason why it's a highrisk stress fracture as opposed to a low risk is if it becomes a complete fracture which was the other part of your question what's a complete fracture it's where this completely separates from the ball um and that's very important in this area because the blood suppli to the Head comes from this direction so all of the nutrients that the ball sees comes from this direction if this breaks and the blood supply is disrupted and that's not corrected quickly then the bone in that area no longer has blood supply it will die and can't support the cartilage anymore the cartilage will collapse and you a AVN of the head and that is a hip replacement which is obviously difficult for anybody but for someone who's in their 20s 30s 40s it's so the treatment for this when you make the diagnosis is rest is rest typically so if it's on the compression side this is the compression side you can go on CR on crutches uh until you start to have no pain with weight bearing once you have no pain with weight bearing you can continue along that path takes 6 to8 weeks to heal and then you can slowly start up your exercises to regain some of your endurance Physical Therapy Etc and often times I'll get a follow-up MRI to make sure um that it's that it is healing and not increasing if the stress fracture is on the tension side the other because you could imagine if it starts to crack on this side and and the whole weight of your body is coming down this way it can more likely displace mechanically um that often will need to get surgery which is to put pins in and we we will often just put three pins from here to here into the femoral head and it will heal and they heal quickly and often times you can let that individual be weight sooner so paradoxically the riskier stress fracture usually has the quicker recovery because they go to surgery as opposed to the tension sided stress fracture uh it just means you you can often end up getting uh walking around doing what what you need to do in your normal life too I've had patients with compression sided stress fractures who were having so much difficulty with just their getting onto the subway getting to work with the crutches that they they wanted to have the surgery so that they can do that are there any differences in Hip injuries between men and women I mean one thing that stands out to me just having taken care of a number of patients is I always I for again in the at least in the under 50 population it seems that more far more female patients of mine have had hip issues than male patients um I've had a number of females who have had hip resurfacing laboral repairs again these are all young women so they're typically in their 40s is there is that just a small Number issue and that's actually not a disproportionate uh finding or do women based on the anatomy of their pelvis are they more susceptible to laboral tears or other types of injuries in the hip there different patterns there are certain there are certain conditions uh of ligamentous laxity that are more prevalent in women uh developmental displasia more preent more prevalent in women and so sometimes that sometimes is the inciting issue uh there are other types of hip problems that are more prevalent in men um there's one there's a condition that we often have to treat that has implication to a lot of the structures around the hip it's called femoral acetabular impingement um femoral acetabular impingement is we think at least the the prevailing theory is let me tell you what it is first basically on on the neck right around here it's actually sort of in the front a bump develops so if I if I look at the model a model here of the uh femal neck and there's sort of one here and this is typically the location of it and I'll just color it you get a prominent bunk of bone so this area it's called a a cam leion and what happens is it changes the shape of the at the head and neck

[00:20:52] Junction so it's not really spherical it's sort of this oblong shape so that that when it goes into the acetabulum it can pinch on the acetabular rim and on the acetabular rim is not only the cartilage but the labrum let me show a picture so if we open up the hip and we look inside again here's the cartilage this blue hue and this lining is called the labrum so if the ball is no longer spherical but oblong it will the cam

[00:21:40] Legion will pinch on the on the laum and the labrum will tear and will injure the cartilage that is connected to that area so how does this happen it we think it happens because the growth plate which closes in Mal's late teens slightly earlier in females because of repetitive stress from certain sporting activities hockey football basketball if there's impingement because of those high stress sports that growth plate will have a delayed closure and it it will close later and a new new bone will form in that area and that's important because one of the risks of of fi that continues use is you can get arthritis because if the cartilage is being injured then the um then the increases the risk of needing a procedure later in life so that's so it's more common that's more common in men fi it's certainly prevalent in women too not as uh sometimes it's different sports but I think it's because the growth plate closes a little earlier in women that it may not be as much of an issue it also may be the type of sport the power type sport where there's a lot of ground reaction force when you land tends to make this situation worse now in the shoulder the laum creates effectively the socket so if you have a person who's never had a subluxation of their shoulder um you know that that laum is creating kind of a a vacuum around the glenoid uh head this seems to be a much more stable ball in socket than the older what is the role of the laam in stabilizing that joint I can understand how asymmetries can cause arthritis but just in terms of pure stability right um You don't really hear about dislocations of the hip very often obviously the most famous example

[00:23:45] I can think of is Bo Jackson right um which maybe we can talk about that case a bit but um what is it that the laam is doing from a stability standpoint or is it simply just providing a clean and neutral articulating surface for the cartilage it it it also helps to create a seal around the ball so it is a sort of a suction effect too and it's very similar to the shoulder we have Dynamic stabilizers in the hip um it becomes more of a concern when the hip isn't formed normally because then that acetabulum becomes flatter which actually mimics the shoulder a little bit in terms of lack of stability corre correct and some of those patients who have instability of the hip because maybe they have some dysplasia so the ball never really is in the hip they have greater motion ballet dancers would be a perfect example it comes at the cost of less stability that's right and some of those individuals actually have a hypertrophic labor it actually gets bigger because it's being asked to do more there's also I mean you can see in the picture here there's a ligamentum teres I don't know if you remember that from Medical School only slightly it's uh it's basically called the round leg and we didn't think it did that much it provides some blood supply early on in life and then later on doesn't really provide much blood but for people who are unstable this provides a secondary restraint because the ligament connects the ball to the socket so one thing we need to be aware of whenever you're operating on the hip is to leave that alone in individuals who are unstable because it's providing a bit of stability to that area got it is this um a good diagram to show how you do a total hip replacement or a hip resurfacing or explain what some of those procedures look like sure um so in a hip replacement basically you're remove you're taking off the neck you're cutting this off you're inserting a metal stem down the shaft of the of the proximal femur and then in this area you're putting a metal Cup in that in that region and then the cup there's different ways to do this but the the metal cup then has a plastic liner on the inside and is that still made out of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene yes yes it's amazing that's what they were doing 25 years ago um why has that operation become so tolerable compared to the version of that operation I saw in medical school uh today it's an outpatient surgery the people go home they seem to recover so well people used to be ilit by that operation 30 years ago right so a lot of the approaches are are different now and honestly in every aspect of the surgery technology has helped us so back when I was training as a resident almost all of the hip replacements were done through a posterior approach an approach through the back muscles so which muscles were actually getting cut through the gluteus

[00:26:52] Muses which are huge right and now you go anteriorly now I don't perform it's not one of the surgeries that that are perform hip replacements but it's much easier to spare the muscle and the ligaments when you do an anterior approach that is an approach from the front um you're saying less of the morbidity is due to less muscular damage on the approach it is it is it is and and also just the way we medically manage patients around the surgery there's we give medicine to decreased blood loss and and so the whole process is has become uh much more efficient and uh safer to be honest and a resurfacing leaves the femoral head intact and only addresses the acetabulum no it's the opposite yes yes the and I don't do this so I can't really I don't

[00:27:46] I'm not going to speak to the different intricacies of that um but it's there are there are ways to preserve the amount of bone that you're taking if the per individual is Young I think that's done less now actually lately of late so we talked a little bit about what are kind of the problems that people will show up with when they're young when people are seeing an orthopedic surgeon north of 665 I'm guessing it's arthritis and

[00:28:18] Fracture that would be the dominant right injuries is there anything else that's showing up as as significant yes so uh in addition to those problems we also see muscle and tendon problems in particular we see issues with uh the tendons on the side of the hip and and this is actually not just in in older individuals but all individuals the main abductor of the hip is the glutitis medius which you could sort of makes uh you could see coming out it sits on the the back of the pelvis and attaches at the edge on the lateral or the outsid of the femur and these mus help to is that glute me and Min yes correct yeah and glute Max is not shown here correct the glute Max comes across here and attaches a little bit lower down on the femur and that's not depicted here so this muscle is incredibly important in fact we we consider this to be the rotator cuff of the hip just those two just those two correct the glutitis medius and the gluteus Minimus and it has a very similar profile and just as in the rotator cuff it starts to degenerate after after a certain age same thing happens in the hip um this will weakness of the glutitis medius is very difficult because it's incredibly painful uh it doesn't have great healing potential we also see this in endurance athletes as well from the repetitive stress and we also see this in unstable patients because those muscles are trying to dynamically keep the ball in the socket so they are working harder ballet dancers in particular have incredibly large glutitis medius Minimus powerful part of the reason is because they're asked to do a lot to stabilize the hip so we see tears there all the time and we often approach that just like a rotator so are most of the injuries you see here underuse or overuse it sounds like they're mostly underuse um I don't I don't think so I I

[00:30:21] I I think it's it depends so the older we get it doesn't necessarily matter whether it's overused or underuse these things will happen because that is just a normal trajectory of tendon problems tendon pathology the tendon cells over time start to degenerate just like all of our cells and they go through process of sence like all tissue and those ccent cells produce those factors that lead to degeneration of the tendon causes inflammation incredible amount of pain and it's hard to treat it's hard to reverse the process now if you knew it was happening before it started would you be able to do anything we don't have that ability yet but that's what we're that's what we're trying to figure out how to intervene before these injuries take place there's two things that jump into my mind here the first is the obvious need for I I hate to use the word physical therapy because that really gets misconstrued a lot but basically deliberate exercise that strengthens those muscles I mean uh when I used to be a cyclist um one of the challenges of that versus any sport truly is you're you're sort of in one plane one dimension right so you get very very strong quads glutes and hams your glute me uh and uh men do very little you're not really doing any abduction of the hip and as such you get a very tight tensor fascial Lada a lot of cyclists get really bad IT band pain um because they just lack that strength there and so an obvious way to fix this which I was very lucky that I was able to fix this non-surgically because I was having debilitating IT band pain was simply doing a lot of strengthening for the uh the the abductors so that at least suggested to me that you could be preventive in some way if I had any muscle that needed to be worked on and I had to pick one muscle group it would be that muscle group starting from early teens it is implicated in so many lower extremity injuries um at the hip and the knee a a weak gluteus medius weak abductors um are can cause a lot of injury and I do believe that the stronger they are it's almost like Bones the higher the bone density you get early on y then the higher your glider the longer it that's right because it's going to degenerate it is just going to happen and so the stronger and healthier the tendon is at a starting point um this is this is sort of how I think about this um first of all not only are you likely to have less injury and I'm talking about ACL injuries too I'm talking about theee injury it holds back to vgas everything that we're going to talk about in exactly hip fractures which we started to talk about a little in the elderly that too these muscles are incredibly strong and the and the hip flexors too there was a study done out of South Korea that looked it was it was an imperfect study but it was pretty decent they took a group of I think it was it was retrospectively evaluated but they took CAT scans of people who were in for a hip fracture a femoral neck fracture elderly population and they meure measured the volume of their seos muscle so this is the Seas muscle and this is the ilis together they make the ilos soos muscle attaches here and this is what picks your leg up that's what lifts your leg up so if you're you stumble you pick your leg up to save yourself they the volume of that muscle was significantly smaller than that of an aged matched control group who were getting CAT scans for other reason now we don't know why they were getting CAT scans so that's you know it's a little bit confounding but um it showed that there was a significant decrease in volume in those patients who have HP fractures so we know that hip muscle strength so the important to get the the abductor strong the hip flexor strong the adductors see the problem with the hip flexors is that we're always sitting so even if they're strong they're often tight because we're we're always in this position so it's important to see how how your hip flexors are make sure that they're flexible cuz a an imbalance in the in the flexibility of that muscle group will also impact the antagonistic muscles in the back the the gluteus maximus which extend the hip and the hamstrings which also extend the hip so these are you know it's fine balance but if I could work on anything to help prevent these things later I think this is a good place to start the other thing that I've really migrated to over the past decade as I've become very obsessed with with all of these muscles in particular those uh hip abductors is the importance of training them not just in concentric phase but also eccentrically so there are these exercises we do in in a training uh I don't know for lack of better word philosophy Dynamic neurom muscular stabilization DNS uh there's a position called DNS star I was just doing it this morning so I I do doing this stuff most days and you're laying on your side uh so if I'm on my right side you know my right elbow is down it's sort of like a plank but you're on the knee and your hips are up and you're extending yourself forward as you're putting the hip back so you are eccentrically loading the adductor as you go back and then you're concentrically loading it as you bring yourself back up now for anybody who's done this and we've demonstrated these things in other exercise videos I mean five reps of this slowly you feel like someone is jamming an ice pick into those muscles it is remarkable how difficult it is but you don't need to do a lot I mean just doing a little bit of that stuff every day right does so much in terms of lower body maintenance right uh and looking at this picture I think it's pretty clear why it's such small muscles that have such an unfavorable angle at their attachment right in terms of like the contraction is you know it has such an unfavorable lever arm for what it needs to do so it really has to be strong right right let's talk a little bit about um fractures so um I guess well let's put aside just kind of the you know the 25-year-old skiing accident fre freak you know it's like you're going to see that all day long but let's talk about the more predictable and far more catastrophic fractures to Quality of

[00:37:35] Life which are these fractures of the femoral neck that are occurring in people due to osteoporosis and osteopenia now I I talk about these stats all the time and nobody believes them because they're so absurd but if you're 65 or older and you fracture that hip depending on the study 15 to 30% oneyear mortality right can you EXP explain why that is like how do these people present to you and why is it so challenging to take care of that oper to take care of that fracture I think part of the a large percentage of those people it's usually another disease that has um overtaken their lives and so they may have advanced stage cancer uh they may have advanced renal disease and it's almost the last of them the last STW it's the last STW the hospitalization alone is that's right catastrophic that that's right and so it's and it's very hard to when you're elderly and if and you don't first of all you break your hip you come to the hospital there has to be some medical management to make sure that it's safe to proceed with surgery and everybody who has a hit fracture needs surgery you can't treat this non-operatively it would be essentially a death sense to do so um because the goal is to mobilize as quickly as possible because for even the people who don't have who you know the mortality of 20 to 30% within the first year you know that's been a stable number for decades I mean every time they look at look at it that's a stable number and that's within one year so our goal is to get you up and Adam how much of that is really acute it's pulmonary emble fat emble you know Mi because of surgery versus you know two weeks out they're okay but then they fail to

[00:39:27] Thrive and they die within the year it really is spread out uh and the the management of these patients is very important early on so we like to get a full team on board right a geriatric specialist you you need a team approach because you need them medically optimized before surgery so that they could safely go through the surg how long can they uh take to get tuned up before surgery so it should be done within 48 Hours wow what before before we had the medical management sort of model of hip fractures you oftentimes we're able to get the surgery done quicker an orthopedist comes in say let's just do this right now everybody signs off we have to do this let's go when we have sort of the team approach the medical doctors like listen we got to we got to get an we have to get an echo we have to do these other things we need to make sure the Bloods are okay that has delayed the surgery slightly but probably gives better outcomes itely it it has at least in the studies that I've seen it people are able to get discharged sooner which is a good thing but their long-term outcome is it still seems to be about 20% wow and part of the issue is first of all obviously you broke your hips so you're probably there's a good chance you're weak you um you now your NPO right the first day you come in they won't no one will feed you anything right you don't get a meal Y and then in bed for two days where have surgery in bed for probably getting dehydrated and yeah it's so it's just and then even for the people who don't have a who don't pass away who don't die there's a decrease about 50% lose a level of function so if you were using a cane before you're using a walker if you using a walker before you're now in a wheelchair if you were walking normally you might be using a cane so there's a 50% people that go down a level in performance I once had a patient who um I got was early on in my career I was a junior attending and

[00:41:36] Resident calls me and says to me we have a patient with a femoral neck fracture and he says so we'll tell me the story he says well he's uh he's 40 years old he was riding on the on the West Side Highway and he crashed and he broke his his femal neck I said well I'm coming and now let's fix this right away so I I said just go consent him for the surgery in which the resident was a junior resident he goes and talks to the patient about all the risks and benefits of the surgery and uh I go in to see the patient and he's got this like obviously

[00:42:05] I expect him to be miserable but he really it was like and I explained it goes he said to me says your resident just told me I have a 30% chance of dying this year he kind of forgot to AG adjust that yeah I said well don't worry you're not GNA die somebody somebody else is but not you yeah the resent um what is it about the hip well let me reframe my question um as you were talking earlier about sort of the degeneration of the hip obviously the first thing that comes to my mind and

[00:42:40] I'm sure everybody's mind listening to this is where do stem cells play a role here now we're going to talk about stem cells through all of these joints but we might as well start here um when I hear that the tendons of those muscles and those muscle themselves are going to weaken when I hear that my cartilage is going to weaken when I hear that the you know the um osus structure of the bone is going to weaken all of these things make me wish I could just have newer and younger cells there right so what do we know about the utility of stem cell therapy here what's the state-ofthe-art today right so um you know this is a this is a great conversation and there's a lot of layers to this conversation because there's you know the dark side and and the bright side of this uh the you know when we talk about orthobiologics or biologics in general basically biologics there it's a it's a class of therapies that is that are using your own natural resources to promote healing so you're using a biologic product to encourage healing of diseased or injured tissue so the most commonly used ones are blood specifically platelets bone marrow bone marrow aspirate concentrate is called and also fat so if we sort of go through those three just to start there um the we for

[00:44:15] PRP what are we doing so we take PL rich plasma platelet rich plasma we take your blood we draw it and we take it down the hall and we spin it in a centrifuge and the centrifusion Machine will separate out the different elements of the blood based on the density of those elements so after you're done spinning it you have a layer called the plasma layer which is rich in plasma and platelets and it separates out the red blood cells and a lot of the the white blood cells now you could spin it twice you could do two spin technique you can spin it so that you're keeping some of the white blood cells so we've categorized it into lucsy Rich PRP and Lucy poor PRP and this is a very simplified way that we think about it right now and there's certainly if we fast forward 10 years from now this will be a ridiculous conversation because we just are sort of in our infancy of understanding what we're doing here so the principle is we take those platelets which are involved in healing we know this because if you cut yourself the first thing that happens is the plat come to the surface to form a blood clot and to form a scar and then you heal so playlets are associated with an incredible amount of growth factors and healing factors including the 800 to a th000 proteins within the plasma and you inject that into tendon a joint with arthritis muscle and see what happens so the the problem is is that as a physician you are you are allowed to do that procedure right so there's no there's no rule that can't say that anybody comes in and they say I have this injury can I have PR can I have stem cells and you say sure let me give you a PRP and I spin it and I inject it so but what is the what does the actual science say about what's actually working and what we've learned is that it works for some things pretty decently and other things not not well at all and we can only go by our randomized control trials and and systematic reviews of randomized control trials to find out what seems to work so what are the what are those best case scenarios so tennis elbow seems to work with PRP there's good data suggests like tier one data

[00:46:44] Maybe tier two data that suggests that it works for tennis elbow it works pretty decently for gluteus medius tears and for tendons that's about it some will argue maybe in the h string tend and it works but I'm not convinced and just to be sure are you talking specifically about PRP or are you talking about the broader umbrella of stem cells broader umbrella of stem cells don't seem to work and I think it's important to bring up a a very important part which is these aren stem cells and I think that's one of the major problems is that there is no stem cell therapy anywhere unless when you go to Mexico and get stem Cell Therapy what are you actually getting I don't know but they're not stem cells I mean the only stem cell I mean I can only speak what's happening in the United States but the only stem cell the therapies approved in the United States are for you know leukemia lym blood disorders blood diseases there is no stem cell in fact the FDA has a big warning page with a video that explains there are no stem cells stem cells implies that I'm going to inject cells into you and and those cells are plur potent they have the ability to become something else and those cells are now going to become your cartilage they're now going to become your tendon that doesn't happen in fact right now what seems to be happening what's the identity of the stem cell in other words um what is the signature that allows that doctor to know or at least believe they have a stem cell because these are not autologus typically at these clinics right aren't they uh you know elic or I only say that because everybody I know is basically going abroad although I know some people that have done this here you know they tear the rotator cuff and they you know and they go and get stem cells uh injected and six months later the rotator cuff is fine without surgery sort of that an yeah that first of all it's it's illegal to actually give stem cells so there so a few years ago people were able to get um products that were manufactured by companies who were selling umbilical cord blood or some derivative of umbilical cord some umbilical product as stem cells um

[00:49:11] Wharton's jelly it's some of it's called exosomes all these things are not allowed the FDA will not let you inject this into anybody so and what's the reason for that so the FDA has a division that will that regulates the use of human cells tissues and products even if autus even if you're your even if they're your own you can use your own as long as it's not manipulated or what we considered minimally manipulated so spinning is not a manipulation spinning that's right so you can take your bone marrow out of the pelvis and we get it from the pelvis and you can concentrate that but you can't give any enzymes to it you can't digest it you can't make any changes to that product you can only give it as is now with fat because fat has actually shown some promise with osteoarthritis of the ankle very very good studies on ankle osteoarthritis and fat injection same with knee um you can do that because you're not you're minimally manipulating the fat you are you are taking it and making it into smaller fat particles but you are not essentially altering the fat itself and those I mean you're basically breaking down adapost tissue into individual fat cells it's micronized it's called micronized it's micronized fat and the idea is that micronized fat regrows as cartilage no still doesn't what does it grow as so so that so that's what we don't know so right now our best understanding of biologics in reality is that it reduces symptoms it is symptom modifying treatment and it's a good symptom modifying treatment when it works because we don't have a lot for let's say arthritis tendon problems our toolbox of things to use when someone comes in with knee arthritis or hip arthritis are pretty pathetic it's you know you're going to go to PT because that's been shown to help I'll give you a brace maybe that might help maybe take some Cox 2 inhibitor anti-inflammatories and some you know cream right we don't have like the repertoire of what I prescribe is pretty surgical treatment for these things is pretty so here's an opportunity with with the ortho the biologic field to reduce symptoms in a safer way than let's say cortisone because cortisone is quite effective and safe as long as you're not you know injecting over and over again uh so it's there's a there's a space for this that is very reasonable and the and the randomized control trials show that it works for knee arthritis probably better than anything the but the bigger I think the if we like looking forward as to what this why don't we have bigger or why don't we have rcts that can answer these questions definitively because there are a few things that I discuss with people in medicine that create more um you know sort of polarization around treatment than the use of these biologic therapies where you know the people who have had these procedures will swear up and down by them when they work which is you don't understand like I couldn't move my arm and in six months I was fine of course we don't we always fail to have the counterfactual here which is possible your arm was just going to get better on its own correct um it's possible that the initial you know MRI showed something but the follow-up MRI didn't show something or it just healed on its own because it was going so so correct you know the only way you can ever escape that is with randomized control trials are they being done yes and so to that point if we inject saline into somebody's joint a number of those patients are going to get better so that's sort of the standard we use how does PRP work in comparison to saline and there are a lot of studies there are dozens of studies randomized control trials looking at

[00:53:24] PRP and many of them have excellent results the problem and and that's for example tennis elbow for neee arthritis that's probably of all the data that's the tier one best data it but you know we don't we know so little about this because it doesn't seem to work well in hip arthritis why do you think that would be is it just possible the studies haven't been done correctly maybe and I think this is brings up a very important point when you do a randomized control trial let's say for a medicine hypertensive medication you know what dose you're giving and you're comparing comp ing it to some other treatment where you know the dose platelet platelet rich plasma I'm taking your platelets of unknown concentration unknown quality of unknown quality I'm spinning it in a machine either once or twice and and a machine different machines concentrate those platelets differently and so then I end up with a product with a with a certain amount of platelets and then I inject it back into you I don't even know your disease process spe specifically yeah so when you put people into a large number of into these studies you get a lot of crappy data so what the future holds is and there's a push in in our industry and there's a particular association called the biologic Association was like which is like an association of associations internationally where they've formed something called the Barb which is a biological Association um registry and bio um bio it's a bio registry it's a registry and a bio registry that is they have lots of centers and they want to know everything about what you're injecting they want to know what's the concentration of the blood of the patient and how what percentage of docs who are regularly giving this therapy are uh participating in the registry to the point where we can generate information very compared to the total amount very few but it's enough people that we can get really good data to find out what's the applic what's the dose what's the critical dose of platelets that we need to affect change what is the and other things we could look at the we can do a proteomic analysis of the actual fluid itself and you match that with outcomes data from the registry so you have a bio repository and a registry combined who did well and what did they get and we say and they save samples of that stuff but at best this can only inform what an RCT should do those data by themselves don't tell us anything right correct but this gives information about to actually lead to the trial right so you say okay it looks like this works let's try this particular dose so right now PRP looks more effective at reducing symptoms than cortisone in the knee for arthritis is there any reason to believe it can delay the uh requirement for total knee replacement so maybe uh the we know that it if we look over the course of a year because this is what those trials looked at cortisone works very well in a short time frame it's pretty impressive the first couple weeks you get one and it helps there are some people who the pain comes right back so it doesn't have staying power when you compared steroids to PRP The PRP if you look out of of over a year they're doing better hyaluronic acid which is another thing we inject also is doing better than cortisone if you look out if you combine

[00:57:07] Now isn't hyaluronic acid considered biologic it's not because it's an FDA approved product yes and I don't even know that it's a drug I think it's even classified differently like a device but I'm not 100% clear on that so there's a number of studies or I don't know about a number of study I know of a very well done study that looked at honic acid and

[00:57:27] PRP together and that seemed to be more effective not astronomically more effective but more effective than the treatments that we have it's more effective the combination of those two but is it disease modifying and that's the big maybe because that's your question it and there are studies that show it may be pushing off knee replacements for those patients but I think this is where we still don't really know yet but there's so much uh de seful Behavior out there with regards to stem cell therapy that the organizations involved and the and the

[00:58:04] FDA and the Federal Trade Commission and CMS are all trying to crack down on the problem of people advertising come onto my clinic I have stem cells I will inject you it's 100% guaranteed to help you you know I'm going to give you new cartilage and some one of my colleagues colleages at NYU did a study where they looked at a thousand websites and 94% of those websites who were promoting stem cell therapy were making inaccurate statements uh so and it just you know in engenders distrust between doctor and patient when you're going for a treatment and you think they're telling you something that I had a friend really like this is about two weeks ago my close friend from high school sent me a brochure cuz wanted to get an injection from his doctor of something like an umbilical cord or Wharton's jelly injection which is which is not allow and I look at the brochure I said send it to me and I I you know I made the bigger and and I circled it and on the brochure because it's from the company the company sells it to the doctor the doctor gives it the patient on the brochure it said this is not intended to treat any condition I was like and I just circled it and I send it back never never mind before we leave the hip uh what is the role of cortisone as a treatment to delay the need for surgical intervention is it particularly efficacious or do you not muck around with it uh I I don't love it because we we worry about what it's doing to the cartilage listen I think because it's such a successful operation I'm less I'm more opt to push for the hip replacement in the appropriate patient than a cortisone in rection because satisfaction rate 90 95% for hip replacement surgery with low complication rate that's not to say that

[01:00:04] I don't do it or I wouldn't do it because there's certain circumstances that I would I would give hyaluronic acid in the hip also although it's not FDA approved it it can be used off label for that application there's some studies to suggest that the gel can help uh but they're it's still we're still trying to find out figure out a better way but we also know that you give an injection right before a hip replacement there's an increased risk of infection so we know that there's something about this that uh we need to be cautious about anything else about the hip before we move down to the knee um no because I think even in the knee we're going to be talking a little bit about the hip too okay Adam so let's let's talk about the knee um again I think most people listening to this can at least relate briefly to some bout of knee pain um so walk us through the anatomy of the knee sure so the knee is a bit different than the hip joint uh it is it is more unstable than the hip joint the hip joint is a true ball and socket joint and the knee joint is inherently more unstable so when we look at a knee what are we looking at if you look at the front of your knee you often see that rounded uh area in the front that's your kneecap or patella the quadricep tendon attaches to the top of the patella right here and then that tendon continues on as the patella tendon and attaches to the Bone here at the at the tibia um if we were to fold that over what we're looking at is the under surface of the of the kneecap and this is the patella and this is the cartilage on the patella and all joints like we spoke about have cartilage all joints are made up of cartilage so the end of all of the bones allow that to Glide smoothly on the surface so we're always interested in maintaining the cartilage because once that disappears we have trouble so if we were to flex the knee a little further what we can see are ligaments in the knee so I don't know if you could see that well but here's the anterior cruciate ligament posterior cruciate ligament they're called crucia ligaments because they cross and then we have on the side the collateral ligaments so this is the medial collateral ligament this is a right knee and this is the lateral collateral ligament and then if we were to fold it over you were to look directly there you would see two semicircular structures that are called the manisi and you have two manisi medial and lateral manisi if I move the model away and we look at the picture here you could see those cruciate ligaments a little better this is the anterior cruciate ligament posterior cruciate ligament and we see the collaterals this picture is without the kneecap there you could also see the manisi or meniscus and the the main role of the meniscus is to distribute Force across that knee and they're imperative to maintain the surface of the joint the cartilage uh from wearing down and the ligaments provide stability to the joint and are or the anterior cruciate ligament is a commonly torn ligament and just again to orient people here you are looking at the right leg correct yeah correct so the fibula is that little small bone on the outside and that's where we see both its attachment to the tibia which is the platform on which the knee sits and also you have the lateral collateral ligament attaching there yes correct correct so the minisi collectively make up the bulk of the cartilage surface of the tibial Plateau then it does it it uh it the function of it is to distribute stress and it distributes about 30% of the load of the knee through the joint so without that meniscus there you end up having Point load or Edge loading and it will cause degeneration of the cartilage pretty rapidly if it's removed you know

[01:04:09] I I always hear people talk about how running and walking you know they amplify forces at the knee so I've heard people say when you're running you're experiencing eight times your the force of your body weight at the knee is a a am I remembering people say that correctly and if so why is that the case it it it is correct and so be because so it depends which joint you're talking about so if we're talking about the kneecap the amount of load that the kneecap sees with activities like squatting and lunging if you do not even a deep squat just a regular squat the pressure behind the kneecap is about seven times greater than the weight on your back that's right that's right exactly so the the cartilage has an incredible responsibility here um and I think it's really I think the one of the most important conversations that I have with patients because I get the similar questions often which is things like is running bad for me is it is this activity good for my knee or bad for my knee because you'll read a different report in the news all the time running's good running's bad um the truth is we we kind of know the answer to this in general that is no activity is horrible for cartilage if I put your leg in a cast and we then look at your cartilage in a couple weeks the content of that Matrix is going to be significantly depressed right nothing's worse for you than inactivity right but it's a it's an inverted U-shaped curve right but it's not symmetric it's like that where more and more and more activity probably better and better and better but then you can go too far and it falls off but it's not it's not a perfect you where it's pure gold Delux where you want to be right in the middle of doing nothing and doing a lot because we'll never know because we don't because it's dependent on a particular individual and so many factors so we know that condra sites respond to activity they feel the stress and they make more Matrix they make all of the proteins within cartilage so a a condra site that's being pressured is happy a condra site that's not being pressured isn't going to do anything and eventually it's going to break down and biomechanics have to matter here they do in other words you know you you watch an

[01:06:34] Ethiopian Runner you know you watch Kip chogi running a marathon and you realize okay clearly there's a lot of force there based on his velocity for him to have the stride length that he has he is hitting that ground so hard and that ground is hitting him back so hard and that's what's allowing him to stay in the air long enough to travel the distance and notest Guy the he probably weighs a soaking wet but if feeling times we're close to a th000 pounds every time but his mechanics are perfect it's I think it's all mechanics well I mean that's exaggeration but it's mostly mechanics you if you have good mechanical alignment we call it that is if we draw a line from the center of your hip to the center of your ankle and we do this regularly and it goes right through the center of the knee there's a good chance you're going to be okay Center of hip meaning where the femoral head meets the acetabulum right the center of the ball center of the ball drops you should be able to drop a plum line corre that goes that cuts the patellar tendon and the patellar bone in half correct and should land where on the foot where in the ankle you draw the line from the center and you connect the center of the ankle to the center of the ankle and and you see it goes through the knee I got interesting if you go dead center there's a good chance you're going to be okay sometimes even if you have other problems yeah um the the if you are off to one side of the another and that's where we have people who have knock KNE or bowlegged knees there is an increased amount of force through one of those compartments of the knee and you are at high risk for degeneration and then if you get a meniscus tear on top of that and you lose that that that surface area of force diffusion you're going to that conjure site is no longer going to be happy if you you you can have so once the knee is unstable just focusing on the knee let's say you have an let's say you have an ACL tear and then you measure the compressive force of that cartilage before and after an ACL tear so like a normal knee and then your contralateral knee the amount that the cartilage gets compressed in an ACL deficient knee is substantially greater than an ACL intact knee H if you reconstruct that ligament it still doesn't come back to normal there's something that happens once the knee is injured where the loads through that joint change and sometimes permanently so is that why or is it the case I think I used to believe this was the case if you have an AC injury you do increase your risk of arthritis later in life you do is that partly why because you never fully get the condra sites back correct so there's a I think there are a couple issues here that obviously we don't fully understand but the first thing I'll say is that a lot of it is baked in the cake at that injury and any injury where there's sheer stress on an ACL and I think we should talk about the biomechanics of the ACL injury but when you have that event on any joint in the stats are that in about 15 to 20 years half of the people who have an

[01:10:03] ACL tear whether it's reconstructed or not have signs of arthritis no difference if you reconstruct or not it's debatable there are some studies that show that if you've had your ACL reconstructed you have a greater chance of arth those are the literature I'm sort of familiar with and that's because you're you're active right right so you are now able to do things very good point because your KNE stable so there haven't been any rcts that have said randomize to repair no repair and let's see what happens no it's too hard to do there's you know there's a there was a fate study I think in the 90s where they look at the fate of doing ACL surgery not doing ACL surgery but you can't randomize it yeah so but it show that's that's where that data comes from where that you may end up having more arthritis if you have it reconstructed

[01:10:55] I'm not necessarily saying that you shouldn't reconstruct it by any means you need to you know why do we do why do we do ACL surgery we do ACL surgery because we want to protect the meniscus because if your knee is flopping around your meniscus is going to tear if your knee is flopping around you're not going to be able to play the sports you enjoy doing so by all means it's worth the risk of arthritis the other thing is it's not everybody has an ACL te yeah one in five not everyone who has a right so but to that point I mean I'll just use my own example when I was I was hit by a car when I was 14 years old I had an ACL tear and A miniscus Tear was this the this is the 80s I had knee surgery that week but nobody did anything he just went in and looked and I came out and said what do you mean they went in and looked I had an arthroscopic surgery and only later they're like well what what did we do they said oh nothing they just said they're going to treat it non-operatively after the operation yeah what they didn't have MRI that was high enough resolution back then no they knew well I don't know I you know I was 14 so it's like I don't you know I just did what I was supposed to do and they said after the doctor was it's funny because he's the reason I wanted to be a doctor too yeah because you know he came in he's talking to his dick the phone he is you know 14-year-old male injuries I was like that's cool that's what I wanted to do guy gets a dicted from who doesn't want to have one of those exactly so I so I didn't have the surgery they said we're going to rehab it from the age of 15 basically to 30 I did not have an ACL

[01:12:29] I had a bucket handle tear of the meniscus which is a very severe miniscus tear and only at age 30 did I have the surgery done after my fellowship was over and I recently took x-rays of my knee because I was curious I did standing alignment center of the head to the ankle I have no arthritis in my knee but my line is straight through the center I don't think that that would have happened if I had some mechanical alignment issue also so half people get arthritis half don't there's probably well I thought it was 20% 50% oh 50 I'm sorry I miss heard that 50% oh it's within 15 to 20 years that you said forget it I'm Sor y okay and we also know and I know this from my own practice because I do a lot of ACL reconstructions is that some people recover fairly well after the surgery and there's a small group of people who stay inflamed and what we're we're we're identifying this type this this cohort of patients we call them an inflamat type that is if you draw if you take out their fluid and you look under and you look Analyze That fluid they have elevated il1 I 6 inflammatory markers that are not coming back down to Baseline it's as if they in the sovial fluid you mean in the sovial fluid and so there a lot of people recover and then some people go on to have sort of low burn chronic inflammation and I don't think this is just with ACL

[01:13:57] I think this was a with a lot of problems and this is also where biologics may come in at some point to affect to to push someone from the catabolic State back to the anabolic state so um let's talk a little bit about how the injury happens and then I want to understand kind of how it's repaired yeah so in general there's there's sort of the ACL contact ACL injury and non-c contact ACL injuries and the majority are non-c compact uh some are also indirect contact we also categorize them that way and and women have a higher risk females have a higher risk of ACL tear than men um and we think there there and there's a lot of factors just the strength difference it's that's one of the reasons it's a neuromuscular control so early in in puberty uh boys tend to during the the spurt tend to have testosterone and that affects muscle growth and in in females that's delayed and if you look at sort of the neuromuscular control Factor specifically we have patients will you know you jump off uh this is pre-injury just so we evaluate why are they greater risk you have them jump off a box and see how they land and in general at that age uh females are more likely to land with a valgus knee with an aded ducted hip right the leg goes in that is you have weak gluteus medius overtight over imbalance with the adductors so they land with their knees in valgus often times with a very straight extended leg slightly flexed and a little bit pronated um so one of the sort of programs we're trying to implement which is incredibly difficult to do our injury prevention programs where we could we can take individuals and see risk stratify them based on risk to see you know we do L uh Landing error scoring system and see how people and we mark them and say okay you need special neuromuscular training what percent I know that this answer can't be known but just to speculate what percent of ACL tears do you think could have been prevented if the individual was maximally uh strong had had the highest amount of their genetic potential for neuromuscular control going into it so even though virtually all ACL injuries I assume are acute injuries um how many of them do you think are on on top of a chronic weakness so the only thing I can get close to sort of answering that question is there have been studies that looked at injur injury prevention programs and Then followed those people and the number that has come out of the literature is that you need to treat 90 people to save one

[01:16:48] ACL so the number needed to treat but I think that also probably speaks to how hard it is to treat yeah how hard it is to prevent also but it's potentially also decreasing risks of other injuries too so it's not just acl's when you strengthen the glutes and you so let me show you sort of the mechanism so when I'm going to move the kneecap out of the way so this is the so this is a right knee so this is the outside of a right knee what happens when you land in a vus position is like this right so you land with the leg a little bit like this what this does we call this cond liftoff right so that's why you often see MCL tears because this gets stretched the cond lifts off of the surface and that surface on the inside of the knee this is called the medial part of the knee is very congruent it's the most congruent part of the knee the lateral side the surface of the tiia is convex it's very unstable in general so now you're only bearing weight basically on the unstable non- congruent part of the knee when you land when your foot lands in pronation by Nature the tibia internally rotates slightly at the same time that happens the quadricep pulls and then it shifts out of place the only thing that typically will help that is that the hamstring on the back has the opposing Force so if you land with a flexx knee it can help stabilize the knee did that make sense yeah unfortunately this is going to be something where people listening to us on audio will have no idea what we're talking about it you really have to see the model in 3D um and the injur the way you just described it you could experience that if you fell for example correct is that also what's happening in a ski injury uh where I get

[01:18:54] I just seem to see more people tearing their ACL skiing that I can shake a stick at I don't I don't necessarily know ex it's hard to know because even when we have video analysis of skiing injuries or or even basketball injuries sometimes it's hard to get exactly that it's probably a similar mechanism but hyperextension of the knee will will also do this have the same problem the other problem is is if your trunk is leaning over to one side at the same time that's an extra amount of force pushing the knee that way so we see football players get it all the time as soon as they plant if they're hit on their hip their body weight goes over to that side their foot struck there's a lot of contact force the quadricep contracts the tibia internally rotates yeah it shifts out of place and it's ruptured what is the typical cooldown period you want on an ACL when a person is injured and they various considerations as to how long you might wait versus operating right away I prefer to wait until the knee is quiet

[01:20:03] I'd like the the initial inflammation to come down my practice I feel that you know if you go into the surgery with a quiet knee to the point where you almost feel like I don't even think anything's wrong I think that's a good time to do surgery but there are plenty of studies that show that you can do it right away and uh there's no adverse effect down the line but I also like people to sort of prepare themselves and just sort of think about what's happening and get some prehab before the ACL reconstruction so that you know we're all on the same page about what this means long term and and how to how to prevent the other side and and all the issues regarding recovery from the initial injury uh because you know they also ret right so we're doing a lot of revision ACL reconstruction what are you typically using to repair the ACL so we have different categories right so autographed versus allograph so the main autograph tendons that I use are uh patellar tendon and hamstring although quadricep is being used a little bit more so what part of the patellar tendon are you using there so we take the central third of the patellar tendon so the width of the of patellar tendon from medial to lateral is about 30 mm and so the central third so 1 cm we take 1 cm or 10 mm of the central third of the

[01:21:23] Patell tendon with a little bit of bone from the kneecap and bone from the tibial tuberosity and that becomes your new graph and there's so that you're doing bone to bone attachment bone to bone attachment exactly has it always been that way for Patell tendon yes okay yeah and if you did cavic ACL is that done anymore yes and you're still going bone to bone you can have you can ask for different types of aligra so you can get a BT we call it btb bone tendon bone um allograft or you could do soft tissue allograft boneo bone healing tends to be more predictable allograft is really not a great idea in the younger cohort if you're I think under there was a recent study show that you're safe with allograph after the age of 34 that is before 34 the risk of a rerupture is is unnecessarily high if you use allograft because allograph tissue is somebody else's tissue and it takes longer for that tissue to mature and to get strong and typically how old are the cavas from which you're getting that you hopefully a young person do you get a say in this well you do you ask for you I won't take it unless they're under this age and there is there are ways to make sure that you only are provided so why I get is the main incentive to do allograft to avoid the patellar injury there are a number of reasons why people want it um number one it's an easier surgery to recover from upfront so people are busy they work they may not be skiers or play basketball they may just do some recreational stuff occasionally like hiking and they're in their 40s and it's perfectly reasonable to use allograft the rates are higher of rerupture but it's not as if I mean it's still being done because it's still it's still a reasonable option so that's why people are doing it but if someone's a is in participates in high-risk activities high-risk Sports level one sports then it's not a great idea patella is that much better it's that much better yeah and sometimes we we you know when we compare so the question the big question is what's better the hamstring the patella tendon uh the quad tendon and the quad tendon there's not enough research to say definitively that it's you know it's not in the game yet as far as and which hamstring tendon are you taking it depends some people take the semi- tendonosis along with the gillus some people just take the semit tendonous and again you can you can access that from the front cuz the the tendons attach right here in the front of the medial tibia and you make an incision in the front and you find the tendon and take it so what happens to the rest of the hamstring it's great great question tends to scar in but that is one of the reasons why people don't necessarily want to do hamstring because you do have weaker hamstrings after now you have the biceps femoris on the other side and you have the semiosis that's not affected which are the other components of the hamstring but your hamstrings will be weaker and the hamstring is there also to protect you from an ACL injury because as the tibia moves forward the hamstrings are pulling you back too so it sounds to me like if you can handle the additional recovery and the pain of having your patella tendon yeah cranked open that's the better operation right the gold standard

[01:24:49] I think still is the patellar tendon and um the the downside of that is it's a little harder recovery early on and people do complain of kneeling kneeling pain because of the Gap bone removed from the kneecap the incision on the front of the knee so people truly do complain about that so if I have an individual who so if you're Catholic correct correct or you're a you know if you're act if you Garden all the time or you love yoga I'm going to say listen let's do the hamstring strength tendon instead so you can sort of tailor it to what seems to be more appropriate so 50% of people who get an

[01:25:35] ACL repair or frankly just tear their ACL it seems like there's no difference 50% of those people within 15 to 20 years are going to need a total knee replacement no no they're just going to have arthritis right and it doesn't even mean it's symptomatic I see okay okay so that's important um again x-ray tells a big story here I

[01:25:55] I've seen my knee on x-ray I've got you know I'm fortunate I don't have arthritis so I've got a big clear space between the femoral cond and the tibial Plateau um how narrow does that need to be before you would make the diagnosis of arthritis and how correlated is the reduction in that space with symptoms it's not correlated well and even when I say arthritis it's hard to Define so the way I think about it is there's arthritis and then symptomatic arthritis so you can have cartilage loss and we consider that quote unquote arthritis but it very often isn't symptomatic and so when we really think about arthritis it's a whole joint disease the cartilage starts to break down an inflammatory reaction happens the synovium which is on the inside of the knee also gets inflamed the bone under the cartilage goes through changes so the arthritis that you're worried about that I'm worried about is that whole joint arthritis not so worried about narrowing of the cartilage I see in isolation it's the it's much more systemic to the knee as a system it's it's like a biologic process we're really trying to avoid and

[01:27:11] I see them come in they were perfectly normal I see people with horrible looking knees who come into my office they say my knee started hurting last week I've never had a knee problem before I get an x-ray and then there is no cartilage left and they won't believe me they said but I don't have arthritis

[01:27:30] I said I know you didn't know you have arthritis but now you do so what tipped that person over because clearly if you took that x-ray a year a year ago it would look almost as bad if not the same what flipped the switch it's usually a traumatic event it's usually a stumble it's usually nothing it's like I lifted something heavy and twisted funny I felt a little something maybe the meniscus tears a little more right so it's it's a very slow process the condra sites have been not doing their thing the cartilage is worn away but it's been such a low burn that it hasn't tipped the scale into a very painful process and then it goes over the overboard and it's hard to bring it back at that point because there's not really any healthy cartilage left and those are the that's very difficult it's a very difficult problem and those people get KNE Replacements before we go to newe Replacements let's talk about the meniscal tear this is such a controversial area I assume there have been sham surgery studies that have been done what do we know about meniscal isolated meniscal tears yeah so I think that just the the principle is if you have a meniscus tear and you don't have arthritis you need to strongly consider fixing that meniscus because that's what's keeping us from getting arthritis and the meniscal tear means separation from the tibial Plateau is that what the means or is it a tear across the surface so here we have a cross-section of the knee this is the lateral meniscus here and this is the medial meniscus here so if we were to look at the

[01:29:11] model that's what we would be looking at so there are different types of meniscus tears there are tears that are at the periphery where there's very good blood flow and in those types of Tears you can sew it back together and should there are tears that go all the way across and then this piece can flip that's called a bucket handle tear and that often will lock the knee the inner piece or the outer piece the inner piece the outer piece is connected to the capsule mhm there are tears that we call radial tears that go through here occasionally if it's close enough to the rim you could put sutures there but sometimes you just need to trim it where you take out the torn piece of meniscus and you just leave what remains so that's the difference between a miniscus repair and a menisectomy so when we talk about the bucket handle you repair primarily yes you put it back to where it is and you sew it back together so all the controversy around meniscal surgery that is no better than sham surgery is it based on a particular one of those or is it based on the fact that these studies didn't stratify for those right so it's it's a specific type of tear so in general we want to save the meniscus when we can so if you're young and you have a meniscus tear and you heard that sham surgery is no better than that's not you you need to have your meniscus fixed if it can be fixed if you have degeneration of the knee already if you have arthritis let's say you have advanced arthritis of the knee and your doctor gets you and again sorry to interrupt I want to come back to this point sure the diagnosis is made how of arthritis because it's clearly no longer just a radiographic diagnosis well if it is even with a radiographic diagnosis because that's what the studies use to say this isn't effective so you don't need inflammatory synovial fluid to make this diagnosis no but they are inflam they are inflamed because that's why they came to see you okay because it if they're T the problem is we don't know is there pain from the arthritis or is there pain from that paniscus tear that they had so I have a patient comes in who has radiographic arthritis evidence of arthritis and they have pain and I get an MRI I mean often try not to get an

[01:31:44] MRI because I really just want to treat the arthritis but let's say they come in with an MRI and they say look I have a meniscus tear if they don't have Al cartilage and they have a miniscus te I want to do nothing and really that's the population of patient where those studies really help us to say to our patients listen we do nothing you're going to be just as fine as if we do surgery and here's a study to show that but those are just studies and the truth is it's easier for me to make a decision about a particular patient than to base it on some randomized control trial it's a nice starting point to say let's try but I have

[01:32:24] Untold numbers of patients who've had some arthritis they have a new injury a meniscus tear try conservative treatment not getting better do the surgery later and they do okay and so making that regardless of which of those tears they have it depends on what kind of tear they have there are certain types of

[01:32:43] Tears where you would always repair a bucket handle no not if it's because if it's it depends if the person's 60 years old they don't usually get bucket handle tears it's more of a complete complex degenerative just like the tendon and the cartilage the meniscus also goes through these changes with senescent cells and and Matrix that is unhealthy and so those you can't repair you put stitches in it it's not repairing so in those cases you trim the piece okay so the young person the runner who comes in they're 40 years old they're having knee pain it's new onset they don't have radiographic arthri the MRI shows a in iscal tear any of those versions you would fix I would try to yes this is assuming that their pain is from the meniscus and that's where this gets a little bit more like art than science because you can have some tiny tears that I'm not that worried about and their pain may be from Patel

[01:33:42] Emeral syndrome anterior knee pain so to be able to you know so it depends where their pain is if their pain correlates to the tear and it's significant it's a good idea to try to to address that assuming that tear is a type of so what are the things you need to rule out how do you rule out the patelofemoral syndrome how do you rule out the MCL sprain which might not show up or other injuries those things usually happen with an injury so you know you're not going to tell your MCL running unless you slipped and fall you're a lot of but a lot of my patients have patelofemoral pain which is basically overloading of the patelofemoral joint right so we talked about how if you squat at seven times body weight well running is a similar type of problem problem with the force at the kneecap and if you increased your duration of running your your mileage and the amount of times you've done it in a week you're going to overload the cartilage in the kneecap and you're going to generate pain so but that has a very particular feel to it an examination you can tell the difference between patellar pain in fact on examination patella femal pain I can't find anything I can't load it enough to generate the pain I can bend your knee every which way if you have a meniscus tear and I put some tor into it you're going to feel it so there just a different it's a different presentation with regards to injury also meniscus tears if there's no history of injury I want to know why why would this happen and so if something twists and then they have a miniscus tear the pain happened after an accident then I'm like okay I have to what is the treatment for Patel femoral syndrome great question so if they if they haven't been doing anything if they haven't been very active I send them to PT they need to strengthen your qu and what yeah so it's quads yes but it also is difficult because I'm asking them to do an activity that increases the load of the on the kneecap is a quadricep strengthening for a problem that is causing pain so and the cause of their pain exactly is what we don't always know in a particular situ in a one particular situation sometimes sometimes it can be so this is a knee from the This Is A sagittal or a view from the side and what we see here is this is the thigh bone or the femur and this is the leg bone or the tibia and the kneecap is in the front on this image so this is looking at the side of your knee you see the quadriceps tendon and then you see the kneecap with its cartilage and the cartilage on the femur and the tibia and you also see the meniscus there as well when you overload this part of the knee your pain can be coming from the col tendon the quad tendon the cartilage the bone the fat pad there's fat inside the knee and that sometimes gets pinched and inflamed when you're running and and that will generate symptoms so we don't always necessarily know well we do know that strengthening the quadricep helps the the kneecap to potentially Glide better and can reduce symptoms but I've had numbers of patients who go to PT and they have horse pain so there's we need to be creative and they may have bad mechanics it seems to me that the recurring theme Here is inactivity or poor mechanics is the root cause of most of these injuries right so this is where it's important when I send in a PT I may say listen I don't want you to do any quad strengthening this week I want you to do hip strengthening I want you to focus on the glutitis medius because if your leg is AD deducting y you're pulling the kneecap outside increasing the force on that area and so I want to cor correct that without doing anything to this and I'll also sometimes use if I really need to work on the quad I'll do

[01:37:38] Blood Flow Restriction in those circumstances because it's lower loads and provides a very similar amount of injury to the muscle as high load training would do how long after ACL repair do you let patients do bfr I don't I don't really I send them to a place that does it a lot and as long as the swelling is down and they can tolerate I don't mind starting relatively quickly because you can you can titrate how much you're doing what percentage of blood flow you're decreasing and and I think it's a great way to start that process early before letting more atrophy set in yeah so what are the indications then for the total knee replacement so if someone comes in and they have advanced arthritis that is all compartments of their need the medial compartment the lateral compartment the pelop femal compartment or really too severely degenerative compartments and they've failed conservative treatment it's a conversation to have what is failed conservative treatment have we tried PT have we tried injections have we tried a steroid hyaluronic acid potentially PRP if they're interested um bracing and they their quality of life is so poor that they want to have something done we talk about new replacement do you have a sense of how often body weight is a driver of this arthritis in other words you know I don't know what the numbers are today but it's roughly a third of the country would have a BMI over 30 right uh many of those people don't have a BMI over 30 because they're overly muscled right um although I'm not sure that the knee cares how much that weight is muscle versus fat so just in terms of excess weight how often is that Dy ding the problem it's driving it a lot which is why I show them the chart of this is what you do this is four times body weight when you do this this is s times body weight when you do this just walking up the stairs or down the stairs down the stairs even worse right and I say if you lose five pounds I don't you know let's start small this is how much weight you're taking off your knee if you multiply that I said if you can lose this amount of weight you may not want an ear placement and you may not need one and so I never tell someone when it's time for them to have a near rep placement they're going to tell me listen I can't do this anymore I want something and as long as they're healthy enough to have the surgery it's reasonable but obviously you know the satisfaction rate after knee replacement is different than hip replacement and it's just an inherently less stable joint and so it's it's harder to feel like it's a normal knee people feel like it's a normal hip but they don't feel like it's a normal knee when it's replaced so so this is probably a decent diagram to show the anatomy of the knee replacement huh so I have a model for for that ah perfect so this is a model of a replaced knee I'm going to take off this portion Flex the knee and what we see here is fake knee replacement but basically has three components before we put those components on we make Cuts in the surface of the distal femur we make a cut on the surface of the proximal tibia and that matches an implant that fits right on that surface and same with the tibial surface and that is made of the high molecular weight polyethylene and then also occasionally we also will replace the surface of the kneecap with a plastic button and that's your new knee and do you do you sometimes keep the native patella if it's fine yeah occasionally sometimes you know there's some people who it's called resurfacing the patella and some people who don't resurface the patella and the studies show that there's probably not a difference in Europe I think they hardly ever resurface the patella it's more common in the United States but I know a lot of Surgeons who don't and I do sometimes I do most of the time but sometimes I don't the reason I do it most of the time is because if there's significant arthritis there and I'm there I'm too afraid that they're going to have pain after because a lot of people after new replacement still are 85% satisfaction means that 15% are dissatisfied and if I haven't replaced the patella I'm thinking to myself maybe

[01:41:57] I should have replaced the patella too how long does this operation take it depends anywhere from an hour to two hours depending on the complexity of the surgery and how big is the incision it's straight it's a midline in it's a midline incision anywhere from 10 cm it depends on the knee it's it's it goes from here to here and unlike the hip which we talked about earlier where the difference between what happens today and 20 years ago is night and day and these patients are they just feel amazing um these patients still struggle post-operatively yes less so we learned a lot during Co that you can do these outpatient very safely and uh there the the technology is improving with total NE Replacements too where the incisions can be a little smaller I do what's the dominant source of pain is it the incisional pain I assume it's much more the bone pain of what you've had to resurface right so none of that's changed yeah but the peroperative management of the pain has changed we give injections into the capsule during the surgery there's other nerve blocks that are used we send them home with pumps to get them through that initial stage what is the time to recovery for a motivated patient who has a knee replacement and what are the limitations I should have asked the same question by the way on the hip replacement so we can do that after but when when a 50-year-old or a 60-year-old comes to you at the end of the Rope they have the knee replacement what are you telling them is this is when you're going to feel normal again assuming you're in that 85% and these are the activities you I don't want you doing anymore right so I I will I will always tell them all this is going to take you a year of recovery okay because

[01:43:39] I don't know who's going to be shorter than that and there's a number of people who continue to improve up to a year and sometimes even longer but I don't say more than a year because it's just too painful to even contemplate a year is pretty long y but people are showing improvements even Beyond a year and it's nonlinear I mean corre it's you know you're probably getting 80% better in 6 months and then you so you know how do I how do I know how people are doing well other than the research and reading it but I see my patients at regular intervals and it's always the same so I see someone about 10 days after surgery and then I see them at two months after surgery and I see them at 6 months after surgery and I could tell you that everybody's different I have people walking in at 10 days who are without a cane walking up and down the hallway doing very well they're they're not they're not you know jumping up and down but they're like not as bad as I thought and then I have patients who are coming in at their six-month visit and they're saying I think something's wrong my knee still hurts I'm still having trouble and

[01:44:40] I always have to remind them there's a reason why I said it might take a year what do you think differentiates those two patients I wish we knew sometimes it has to do with muscles right their strength of them their protoplasm before uh and then sometimes I think it's sort of the similar inflamat type that I mentioned with the ACL I just think that some people show prolonged inflammation after injury and I think we're still tring have you ever looked at sampling sovial fluid as soon as you get in there seeing how well the inflammatory milu of that correlates or corresponds to the recovery so I know it's been done I don't know the data on that and I and it's been done in acl's too where you check the cyto and this is how we know that there are these types of patients um so I I don't know the details of that but it is done it is done be so I mean there's so much to to think about as far as immune modulation as well as as I mean to me if I think about like how would you advance this this field that could be one way is what if we utilized immune modulators in a personalized way based on that inflammatory environment at the time of surgery given that that's probably playing a role in this yeah so

[01:45:51] I think that the more information we get from the ACL injury will help figure out the total knee replacement the reason I say that is nobody wants to put a needle in a knee that had a knee replacement because it just slightly increases oh I'm thinking before you before you make the I mean I'm saying when you're doing the incision so a lot of them have we know that we know that's il1 I6 tumor necrosis factor it's we know what those presumably what's there right before surgery is right there after surgery it's not like it so yeah you could sample that before you do the total it's probably it's probably been done yeah um okay and then so you're at the oneyear posttop appointment right patient says Adam God I feel amazing yeah anything I can't do so I let my patients do the things that they enjoy doing and I just talked to yeah like they can I have a patient right now who's who ran a marathon with a total new replacement I mean she's young right so she's young and she knows the risk it's more likely to how young 50 what led to the knee replacement in her case alignment mechanical issues it was mechanical issues okay and are those are those mechanical issues fixed now or is she just going to need another knee replacement in 10 years it's it's fixed it's fixed when we do a knee replacement we make the cuts to allow for better alignment although not everybody does that there are different ways to do a knee replacement where people maintain the alignment it's called the kinematic knee but from the way I do a knee I align it you align it so you say this is the hip you got this is the foot you got

[01:47:22] I'm going to drop that Plum line and I'm going to make the cuts in those two surfaces such that the hardware lines up right and I use computer navigation so I can really titr trate the exact amount that I want to make the cut so that the alignment is as precise as I can make it right now um and so a lot of the newer technology and software allows us to be more precise in our cuts and the angles we want and sometimes you need to do a little bit of angulation just so it fits properly but in in general that's the principle and going back to the hip just for the sake of completeness uh 6 months

[01:47:58] CU these guys heal so much quicker 6 months post total hip replacement uh hey Doc anything I can't do yeah what you saying and this is also with the knee I don't want any contact sports right no contact Sports okay because you're at high risk of FR is skiing considered a contact sport no I mean it is but it's not part of the sport okay I mean it is sort of but I let people ski with total new repl and total hip replacements they allowed to SK uh but there's two there's a it's called a stress Riser right above the metal and the knee is a is an area where it can break easily and that is a really devastating injury to have a knee placement and then have it broken so I don't want anybody doing any compact sports but I let them play tennis it used to be we would say only doubles tennis but you know someone's doing really well I'll let them play but I tell them I say listen the more you're on this High molecular weight polyethylene which isn't perfect it's going to we out cu it's mechanical too that that was my thesis in engineering was looking at the axis of failure in tibial plateaus so I I spent interesting so much time under a microscope um looking at uh failed tibial plateaus and um using a a discipline of mathematics to map out the planes of failure from polyethylene from from exactly that

[01:49:21] Ultra but just in the tibial plate yeah um so I think that's I think that's a pretty good uh we talked a little bit about the success rate of PRP here potentially and a greater appetite for here than in the hip um any other knee pains that you look at that are quantifiably not surgical where you say boy you operating on you would be a mistake right so you know in general the it's injury dependent often there are some injuries where there is there's no doubt about it you have to have surgery if you rupture your patellar tendon or your quadriceps tendon I don't is the conservative treatment is to do surgery because you your leg will not work unless we reconnect the tendon right is the patella tendon typically ruptured above or below the patella so the quadriceps tendon is oh we could use this picture so this is the quadriceps tendon and this is oh the patella tendon is the below so if either one of these is ruptured the patella will go with the unruptured side they're not connected anymore you have to fix that otherwise you can't it's very hard to extend the you can't yeah you can't do it I mean essentially you can't do it so that has to be fixed for a lot of problems you can try conservative management right meniscus tears occasionally you could try conservative management there are even people who don't necessarily need an ACL reconstruction there are people who have ACL tears who cope well without reconstruction and we talk about that possibility if someone does not participate in level one sports they don't do pivoting or rotational types of activities then and they they can you can bike without an ACL tear you can you can run without an ACL tear so even that with an ACL te with an ACL te you can so and there are a lot of people who cope quite well I did from the AG of 15 to 30 and I was fairly active with occasional swelling here and there and during those 16 years that you had the ACL tear outside of the acute phase how many times did you lose stability or did your knee go out dozens dozens does but I were you causing more injury were you increasing the risk of arthritis through that activity through the instability which is amazing very similar to the sublux shoulder right the more you sublux the more you increase the risk of arthritis so you're ing the labram you're creating more instability and if you wait too long yeah you'll get it repaired but you might actually start to have arthritis at the glenoid gleno humoral joint the you know arthritis is not as common in the shoulder as the hip and knee and if you've had a shoulder dislocation you're 10 to 20 times more likely to get arthritis of the shoulder than someone in the general population without a shoulder dislocation so we know it's that traumatic event and the same thing is true for ankle sprains and fractures around the ankle it's because that joint is so congruent that car in the ankle isn't even that thick it's so congruent that if you don't have an injury to the ankle that ankle can last you quite a long time it doesn't have the same incidence as hip and knee arthritis and why is that despite how thin it is it's just so engaged because the because the surfac to surface level is so perfect correct and whereas you don't have articulation in the same way where you have more more degree of motion right think about the hip we talked about where it's Edge loading in the developmental dysplasia right it's not congruent that's who gets the arthritis y the the patient with the bump on the side the acetabular impingement they get arthritis the knee which is in the middle it could that weight could go through the inside or the outside the ankle it's right down the center cuz that's where the plum line goes so there's not a lot of play cuz it's closer to the floor does that make sense yep absolutely so that's why we see it less in the in the ankle we see it a lot in the knee and the hip we see it when there's a mechanical problem all right so the uh the Foot and Ankle are very complicated and um the number of bones here and the number of ligaments is simply staggering uh obviously we're not going to you know provide a master's class on this due to the complexity of it but let's kind of focus on the big picture here um which is what are the areas what part of the anatomy do we need to understand to really get a sense of where people have pain here sure um well it depends obviously on on the population we're talking about so if we just talk about athletes for a second or people who are very active and for example run a lot we're we're interested in a number of things um let's focus on the top picture here this is uh this is the heel bone and this is where the

[01:54:31] Achilles tendon attaches to the Bone and we do see a lot of Achilles tendinitis and that's a very difficult problem because there are not a lot of great treatment options um surgery doesn't do great with tendonopathy of the Achilles tendon and only when it's ruptured is there sort of more more of a a plan on how to address it um interesting

[01:54:52] I don't think there's an increased incidence of tendon ruptures in the setting of tendonopathy we don't really see that so tendonopathy would just present as pain there but that doesn't necessarily increase the risk of rupture my reading of the literature up to date and I don't do a lot of foot and ankle surgery that's been my understanding and

[01:55:12] I've treated lots of people over the years with Achilles tendinitis and I don't remember ever a case where they came back oh I I look at that I ruptured it interesting while we're on the topic of rupture how much of a concern are Floric quinolones everybody ask me this question I don't really know the answer so right you know cylin drugs leave leave a Quinn these antibiotics I know that you know we're told that they slightly increase the risk of a subsequent rupture how big is that increase in risk and for how long does it preside after the antibiotic I don't know the length of how long it presides but I do know that and I'm mine is sort of a sampling error because I see it I see it more than you do so because that's who's coming in and uh I've seen it after one dose so I don't I don't know how to guide long after a dose someone has a dose and then they with then a week or two I've seen it so and it it usually so this is what I tell people it's not a reason not to take the medication but if you start to feel anything you have to stop and rest because I feel like that is one of those situations are there warning signs to an

[01:56:13] Achilles rupture they start to develop pain and that's when I sto but I we but it's not tendonopathy something it's some I don't know what the mechanism is for it that would there is some sort of tendon inflammation that's happening but I'm not I'm not sure okay that's a little disconcerting so what what are we doing to prevent this because this is definitely the middle-age person injury right the tendonopathy well or just the rupture alog together you know it's the I'm going to go run around with my kids and lo and behold I hear the loudest bang and your calf balls up and you're next thing you know you're in a boot for God knows how many weeks I think maintaining muscle strength calf flexibility making sure your your Gastro and your Solus have good flexibility both of those separately uh I think that overtraining can be an issue in this circumstance so just to proceed with care you can't necessarily do everything you wanted to do when you're 20 and 30 because that tendon degeneration is a biologic event that affects all of us and again if you if you're staying healthy throughout your lifetime it may or may not help you but it's certainly possible that M I feel like such an important part of this is is jumping yeah so you know literally just you know jumping rope doing the types of activities like my warm-up always sort of consists of of I have a particular jumping routine I always do and it's not super taxing it's not I'm not jumping you know onto 36 inch blocks or you know doing plyometric explosive stuff right um I do it sometimes but on a daily basis I'm trying to make sure

[01:57:51] I'm putting some bounce yeah in there my belief is that that's a valuable way to maintain elasticity uh in that part of the body I would agree and I think it's also your it's a neuromuscular training the neuro part is just as important because I think that's really what happens is that it's always vulnerable when the tendon degenerates but there's a mismatch between the firing of the of the calf musculature and what you're actually doing at that moment and so having more motor neurons and well-developed motor neurons neurons may may help prevent that and just like you prevent ACL injuries I think it's the same thing I I there's no way that that's not helpful for all of lower extremity injuries is to be able to know where you are in space and to have good training in those Dynamic situations because that's when people are injured nobody wanted to trip on the sidewalk but what happens when you trip are you able to recover quickly or do you end up with an injury okay so let's go over some of the Bony structures here maybe it's easier to look at that model huh sure so this is the the ankle joint proper which is this this is the leg bone or the tibia it joins here with the

[01:59:04] Tais um on the and Al also along with the fibula so these three bones make up the ankle joint um and the surface is coated in cartilage just like all the other joints we talked about the Tais then articulates with the navicular bone here and then their kinea forms a cuboid bone on the outside the metatarsals the fanges if we turn it to the side this is the inner side of the ankle this is the the medial malus and along this area is where the tendons uh that help to maintain your arch rest so if we were to look at the tendons of the ankle

[01:59:54] this on the bottom image is the medial aspect of the ankle and this is the posterior tibialis tendon which is incredibly important for maintaining your arch uh and then we also have the flexor halis as longus here which goes to the first toe and these are the flexors for the for the digits as well uh if we look at the ligaments on the medial aspect of the ankle we see here this is the medium malis this Broad ligament is the deltoid ligament and then we have this uh spring ligament here and this is the planer fascia as well which helps to maintain your arch and these are important structures to examine uh to make sure that the the plants are fascia which helps to maintain the arch is competent and that the posterior tibialis tendon is also working so it's important to go through um walking on your toes walk on your heels see how the gate uh progression is managed yeah and all of these things will show in the exam of course on the outside of the ankle or the lateral part of the ankle where this is where the fibula is this is where most ankle sprayings happen so there this is the main ligament that's injured it's called the atfl or anterior Tao fibular ligament and then we have the calcano fibular ligament posterior tof fibular ligament which is not as often sprained and then we have this ligament up here which connects the fibula to the tibia and when people have high ankle sprains this is often the ligament that's injured whenever someone has an ankle sprain it's conservative treatment and most people get better but not everybody and is a sprain what degree of tear to that ligament it could be any degree if you have a sprain that is if you your ankle twists and you have swelling you've torn the ligament the question is is it a complete rupture of the ligament and so we arbitrarily say this is a grade one grade two high ankle they're all tearing of the ligament the degree to which they're torn or which they heal um will dictate The Next Step so no it's very rare to have a severe ankle sprain without any dislocation of a joint that would require surgery except for some syndesmosis injuries up higher those often will require surgery but for the run-of-the-mill twisted my ankle playing basketball the treatment is conservative strengthening strengthen the perennial muscles uh but the doesn't necessarily mean everybody's going to recover because sometimes what happens is the cartilage gets injured and just like we talked about in the shoulder and the knee and the hip any mechanical trauma to the Joint puts you at increased risk for arthritis of that joint and which cartilage in particular for the if you took the most common right sprain right um with which would be the FIB the the atfl atfl yeah so the anterior Tor fial ligament connects the fibula to the T yep and when that rotates this way this does not rotate at all you will cause injury to the cartilage because it abuts in this area uhuh y makes sense right so you will see what we call osteochondral if you did an MRI would you see bone edema there in that patient yes yes and so if someone is not rec cing after an ankle spray and I get an MRI cuz I want to see what the cartilage looks like to see if they've injured the bone if they in their cartilage and if anything else needs to be done and if there's a small fracture there is it still conservative put them in a boot um fracture here or fracture here if there's a crack in the depends depends if that piece is what we call stable or unstable so you can have a crack in the cartilage and Bone unit that is in place in sight you and you could leave that alone maybe give a boot um if it that piece is detached then that's a different volume that's unable what about if you have a distal fibula fracture because the sprain is so bad that when their foot went out it actually broke the bone right so usually if it's if it's just does that ever happen the taus will break that tip of the um some so sometimes if this if the the for foot is externally rotated this will hit the fibula and the fibula will break yep and that doesn't necessarily need surgery that can often heal without surgery but if you've also at the same time torn the inner ligaments the deltoid ligaments now that you then you now have instability on both sides of the ankle and then you go in and you fix the fibula and sometimes even the deltoid so I'm guessing that the sprained ankle is hands down the most common injury to this part of the body yes and obviously to your point I mean I

[02:04:51] I can't imagine there are too many people listening to this who have never experienced a sprain ankle um they don't require surgery what is the bread and butter of the Foot and Ankle surgeon what is the type of surgery that is most commonly being done for either uh well let not yeah I guess acute or chronic injury there are different types of practices I mean there's a lot of degenerative problems where you have arthritis of the ankle and I'm I'm not a foot and ankle surgeon but the there are you know once the foot collapses the arch collapses and the posterior tibialis tendon is is attrition to that that's a very painful condition and you often have to fuse the small bones of the joint in order to to better create a stable platform to land which bones are you fusing so occasionally it's the midfoot occas occasionally it's a sub tailor joint and then you can have an arthrodesis even of the ankle itself it's called a triple arthrodesis and that um and that occurs when the person's Arch is so weak that they lose their Arch so what so it's there's stages so there's early stage where you can treat it in a boot sometimes we just go in and and uh address the tendon itself more advanced stages you start to see changes in the ankle joints so you would never how is this occurring I mean why isn't this a problem that is fixed with foot exercises and and PT and like what why would we let a person get to the point where they're Arch completely collapses and the musculature becomes so compromised because some people have anatomy of their foot they're pronated flat feet that is not easily correctable even with exercise it's just mechanically different and that tendon itself once it becomes so stretched and and these aren't people who would benefit I mean

[02:06:46] I'm not a huge fan of of orthotic arches but wouldn't these people benefit from that yes and they are prescribed that but it doesn't it doesn't mean the disease process won't progress a lot of this is mechanical we've talked about that and a lot of this is biologic too and so there we have we have decent ways of helping people if they don't have a biologic problem we have decent ways of helping people with mechanical problems but it's all of this all of these factors uh play into whether someone would benefit from EXC excise right but so there are things that can be done nonetheless so you can give people rigid shoes to help with their feet and allow them to exercise other parts right so just because one area is deficient you can fuse the ankle so the pain goes away and still go get on a plan to maintain the health of the rest of you but if your foot kills with everything you do you can't help any of the rest of it so when people talk about an ankle Fusion normally they're talking about tibia to

[02:07:54] Tais that's the normal Fusion now that was traditionally what's used now again this is not my field but there's also ankle Replacements now too which are becoming more popular because again the technology is improved but that's not the same patient necessarily what are the other injuries to the ankle and foot that require surgical intervention so there are there fractures of the fifth metatarsal so this is the fifth metatarsal and you can have fractures of the proximal fifth metatarsal where there's a tendon attached here called the paranas tendon which um pulls off that piece and that rarely requires surgery and that tends to heal if you fracture it right here less than a centimeter higher up that fracture is in an area where the blood supply is pretty deficient call it a water water shed

[02:08:51] Zone and that often won't heal so sometimes we'll make those people so you break it here oh don't worry about it you could wear whatever shoes you like as long as it doesn't hurt you break it here oh you need to be in a cast or a boot for six weeks non weight bearing or surgery to put a screw in there wow right so there are certain types based on the blood supply to the Bone certainly navicular stress fractures are another one of those fractures that are serious that typically in a runner yes correct correct what about the other metatarsals you have stress fractures tend to heal the you know we we see it commonly second and third metatarsal stress fractur do they have Watershed zones as well no they heal it's just the fifth one but you know a lot of people have I worry about the stress fractures because often times you'll see somebody they have foot pain they're Runner and then you find out they had three other stress fractures right so this is their third stress fracture yeah you at the first visit you have to have a conversation about um relative energy deficiency right why why are you not healing do we we need you to see an endocrinologist vitamin D find out yeah you see this a lot in i' I've seen this at least anecdotally so much in female

[02:10:01] Runners who are basically being put into Eating Disorders by you know running coaches right right so yeah they're they're they're way undernourished it's a we call it the the female triad and it's a risk of osteoporosis stress fractures and menstrual AB abnormalities okay okay so so what about um a bunion surgery I guess show us what the bunion actually is and what the what the anatomy is that leads to the procedure and what it what it what it is sure well some people develop an abnormality of the first Ray where the metatarsal and the metatarsophalangeal joint this will start to deviate where this portion which we call the bunion starts to be prominent on the inner aspect of the foot at the same time that can sometimes affect and crowd out the toe and you'll get something called a hammer toe of that second digit and so if it gets severe enough as long as you're comfortable in your shoes and it's not painful it's not necessarily something to do about but if it starts to crowd out the toe and you start to get develop pain now we have to talk about correction and and osteotomies or

[02:11:12] Cuts in the bone will be made to straighten out that area and often times you need to correct the hammer toes of the other digits if they're also effective how do you correct those does moving the great toe over do it sufficiently or do you have to no you often because after a while what happens is the tendon length changes and so you often have to cut the bone and just pin it to a shorter stump so that it no longer painful and when when you replace or sorry repair the great toe there's a screw that runs along the metat Taro there's different ways to do it some people use plates some people use screws

[02:11:52] I see and that can be quite a recovery yeah that's hard that's just why we don't recommend it unless you're starting to have pain I mean how much of that is driven by wearing super tight shoes you know being you hear oh I wore dressed shoes my whole life and um how much of it is that how much of it is anatomic uh variation it's a it's a combination I think it's a factor where some people are predisposed to develop it but there's certainly a lot of cultures where tight shoes you're going to have more a higher incidence of uh of this problem got it anything else on the foot and ankle you want to focus on what about the calanus how often do we see injuries to that well we see stress fractures of the calanus as well um also plantar fasciitis is very common so it's important to recognize that this area of the foot um heel pain is its own animal and sometimes it's it's attrition of the fascia or the ligament the plantar fascia that attaches on the inner plant or surface of the bone um you could have stress fractures in this area you can have insertional tendinitis where the Achilles attaches to and sometimes you can have heel pain because a nerve is compressed much like you have carpal tunnel syndrome you could have tarsal tunnel syndrome and sometimes people get just heel pain because they have a discreation that's affecting S1 nerve root only presenting as heel pain so it's one of those things where you sort of have to really take a close stepbystep approach to diagnosing that problem so taking a step back from all of this if someone watching this is sort of in the process of interacting with with the medical community um specifically the orthopedic

[02:13:27] Community how how can they pick a good surgeon what are what are some of the Tells that you're speaking with a good orthopedic surgeon versus someone who's a hack it's a good question I think you use the same judgment you have when you speak with anybody you know are they sitting down when you when they walk in the room are they sitting down are they looking at you in the eye are they talking to you um do do you feel like you're being rushed I think that's big sign if you feel like you're being rushed you probably are being rushed uh and so just the ability to listen have someone that you're you're is listening to you um you know I hear a lot of people come and I've seen people all the time who they had surgery with someone and they're seeing me about 3 months after their surgery and they say to me uh I said well you really should ask that question of your surgeon um because they know what they did for you and they're still in pain for example and they say to me oh yeah but he's just a surgeon he just does the surgery I said well what do you think I I'm also just a surgeon you know you can ask them these questions you you're entitled to have a conversation with somebody so I think that's a good you're not going to know till you meet them and and some people some people mesh well with people other people don't and what are some questions that they can ask specifically to get a better sense of um you know a person's competence basically it's a it's a good question I think if if you just have to it's a it's a good question I think just again the Rapport you're having with the person let's say for example they say I think you need surgery just a simple question are there

[02:15:09] Alternatives or um what are the Alternatives or why do you think I need surgery now and I can't do non you know is there are there any non-operative approaches to it and just the answer right you know right off the bat you could get a good sense if they're if they're defensive about the defensive in the response that's you know that may not be someone who's who's right for you even if they even if they're right and you do need surgery doesn't mean you're not allowed to ask the question about

[02:15:38] Alternatives if someone comes in with a ruptured patellar tendon and I'd say to them you need surgery even though that visit could be 4 seconds I could say oh you ruptured your patellar tendon I'm scheduling you for surgery next next week I'll see you then I'll be right in my assessment of what needs to be done but that doesn't make me a good doctor or a good surgeon you need to explain why that's the case what to expect afterwards so everybody deserves a conversation about these things yeah I I

[02:16:06] I when when I talk to people about this in general with with especially with surgical procedures I feel like when a surgeon can't give you a clear breakdown of what the complications are and what the probabilities are of those complication PA especially in their hands it's one thing to quote the literature but I want to know what is your risk of wound infection here what's the probability how many times do your patients get wound infections how many times do your patients require reoperation how many times do your patients uh you know still find themselves in pain a year out all those little things and then the other question is what will we do if so if I'm still in pain in six months what does your intuition you is going on and how will we work that up and in my experience people who can't surgeons who can't go through that thinking right aren't very good at their job right and you're you're you're playing a little bit with fire when you uh go under the knife from them you might get a great outcome and you're fine but if you don't they're not going to be the ones to help you troubleshoot yeah that approach is also important I found even when you're not recommending surgery for example if I have someone come in with an ankle sprain and I say oh just need to do pt and I don't explain to them what would happen in 3 weeks I say follow up I could just say follow up with me in a month if you're not doing well I need to go through the steps with them listen here's the story not everybody with an ankle sprin is going to get better you're probably going to get better because most do but you might not so if four or six weeks goes by you're still having swelling pain you don't feel like you're making improvements I really need to see you because you may have an injury to the car cartilage and we have to get an MRI so I always give them the answer to what we are doing next if what I've just recommended isn't going to work well Adam this has been super helpful uh very interesting i' I've learned a ton I again Orthopedics is a little bit of a black box to me uh I think it is probably even to a lot of doctors we don't you know you don't have enough of an overlap it's such a subsp specialty there's so much you're learning um that that this will be very um instructive for people especially when paired with the exam videos that we'll do um so thank you very much for your time and for sharing all these insights I appreciate the opportunity thank you Peter [Music]
