This clip is from episode #352 ‒ Female fertility: optimizing reproductive health, diagnosing and treating infertility and PCOS, and understanding the IVF process | Paula Amato, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Finite Eggs from Birth – Women are born with all the eggs they'll ever have, peaking at 2 million in the womb and dropping to 400,000 by puberty
- Hormones Drive Egg Selection – FSH and LH stimulate growth of follicles; one dominant follicle is selected (somewhat randomly) for ovulation
- The chosen egg is released, travels into the fallopian tube, and may meet sperm for fertilization, typically on day 14 of the cycle
- Barriers to Conception – Sperm must reach the egg, but fertilization only allows one to penetrate before a “force field” blocks others
- Implantation Timeline – After fertilization, the embryo divides over 5–6 days before implanting in the uterus—if the egg is chromosomally normal

## Transcript

[00:00:00] Unlike sperm which seem to be an infinite uh resource, men are constantly generating literally billions of these things. Uh the exact opposite is the case with with women. Tell us a bit about that. That's right. Well, first thanks for having me. Thanks for inviting me. Uh it is true that when an embryo or fetus develops uh the gonad differentiates into either a testes or an ovary and the main difference as you said is that sperm is produced throughout a man's lifetime whereas women are born with a finite number of eggs. Actually, the most eggs you'll ever have is when you're in your mom's womb as a fetus. And by the time you're born, there's about two million or so eggs. And by the time you start menstruating, you're down to maybe 400,000 or so. And Wow. Five. So, a five-fold reduction from birth to say I average age would be maybe 14 when a

[00:00:55] Yeah. Yeah. 12 to 14. And we don't know why exactly that happens, but most of the eggs in the ovaries actually undergo a process we call a treasia. They basically die. So once uh a woman goes through puberty or girl goes through puberty, every month if she's not on hormonal contraception, one of those eggs grows. actually probably a group of eggs every month starts to grow. But then one kind of takes over and is released from the ovary and usually finds its way into the fallopian tubes.

[00:01:27] That's the tube connecting the ovary and the uterus. And then normally if there's not sperm around the egg is just resorbs and there's no pregnancy and the lining of the uterus sheds and a girl or woman has a period every month. If there's sperm around there's a chance that that egg might fertilize and that fertilization usually happens in the fallopian tube actually and then that now zygote or embryo travels down the tube into the uterus and some of the time implants into the wall of the uterus or the lining of the uterus and establishes a pregnancy. Okay. So let's now talk about a woman in the prime of her reproductive age. She's 20 years old. um as as an example and um let's let's talk through the cycle of um what is happening and the role that hormones are playing. Um one of the things that to me has always been fascinating about this is the selection, right? So with with males, we don't have to think about that problem. The selection tends to be maybe more metabolic or stochastic. In other words, which sperm is the sperm that makes it isn't really predetermined. How is it that let's say from day zero when a woman begins her menstrual cycle and all of a sudden everything starts to turn towards the next cycle, she's about 14 days out from ovulation, we start to see the interplay of luteinizing hormone and follical stimulating hormone, particularly FSH. walk me through what's happening in that period of time that ultimately leads to one and only one egg being the chosen one. Yeah. Yeah. It's a little random in women as well actually, but it's true that the pituitary hormones namely FSH or follicle stimulating hormone and LH luteinizing hormone are what drives growth of the we call them follicles.

[00:03:25] The eggs are inside the follicles. And as I said, usually a cohort of eggs starts to grow and then tell me what grow means. The follicles start to um get bigger and the cells surrounding the eggs start to divide. And what do they look like prior to all of that happening? These are cells that only have 50% of the genetic material, right?

[00:03:49] They've already undergone meiosis. Yes. It meiosis. They're kind of arrested in meiosis and meiosis not completed until they actually ovulate and then in some cases are fertilized. Yes. So we have an arrested cell that has uh one of each of the mother's chromosomes including one X chromosome by definition, one of her two sex hormones.

[00:04:17] And I don't know if this question makes sense, but it's is it still in its young phenotype? In other words, if the if the woman is 20 years old and all of the cells in her body are functionally 20 years old, is this egg prior to uh ovulation still basically an infant cell? As far as we know, although there's some data recently to suggest that um perhaps the cells surrounding the egg are um metabolically active and may be aging. Certainly, we do know that the quality of the eggs decreases, right, as women get older. So, that affects how the eggs and the chromosomes ultimately divide. That's part of the reason it's harder to get pregnant as you get older. Even though you're ovulating, you may be releasing an egg every month, but that egg could be abnormal. And if it's abnormal, it likely won't fertilize, and you kind of don't want it to fertilize if it's abnormal and establish a pregnancy. Um, but you're right, it's they're pretty much arrested in time during um certainly, you know, before puberty and then every month a few start to develop and then one we don't really know how that one egg is selected. Okay, it's definitely hormonal factors play a role.

[00:05:42] Um, but it's somewhat random. one kind of grows and then eventually is released and because the as we know that as a woman ages the probability of successful division goes down, right? So something changes as a woman ages but we don't understand exactly but whatever it is that's going on makes those chromosome errors much more likely. Back to this process. So it's day zero. So a woman just begins her period. We're just getting ready to embark on her next fertility cycle. The pituitary gland is secretreting luteinizing uh hormone and follical stimulating hormone. Walk me through what is happening in the next 14 days that leads to that ovulation. Um right. So a group of eggs or follicles are starting to grow. One gets selected.

[00:06:31] We don't really understand. We don't understand why. It's random. Um and that follicle that's egg is in a follicle. follicle is kind of um fluid-filled cyst-like structure that surrounds each egg. So that continues to grow and then eventually uh what's happening hormonally. So those cells surrounding the eggs are producing estrogen. That estrogen is preparing acting on the uterine lining to build up the lining to potentially support a pregnancy. And then what happens just before ovulation is there's um a surge in a hormone called LH luteinizing hormone. And that's what we think triggers ovulation or release of an egg.

[00:07:15] So all that has to happen before an egg is released. So it kind of busts out of the ovary, finds its way to the tube. Okay. How long approximately? Just give people a sense of how long a fallopian tube is. probably a few centimeters, like 5 to 10. Okay. And um you know, everyone's probably used to seeing the image of ovaries being these little eggs and fallopian tubes having these little fingers that hug up on the eggs. What what is actually in between that space?

[00:07:44] How does the how does the egg get from an ovary into a fallopian tube? Is there an actual connection there? There is actually. Yeah. They're not stuck together, but they're kind of in close proximity so that those fimbria or finger-like projections kind of sweep up the egg once it's released from the ovary. Got it. And it's otherwise in direct contact with the parnium.

[00:08:07] The ovary and the tubes, the space between the space between them. Yeah. Yeah. The pictures always show like the tubes out here and the eggs out here, but they're actually everything's like a lot closer together in the pelvis. Yeah. And um you mentioned okay so egg is now in fallopian tube. How long does it take to get through the length of the fallopian tube into the uterus? About five or six days. Okay. So completely different experience from the sperm which are racing at breakneck speed and cover that distance in seconds. Right.

[00:08:41] Um so what regulates the speed with which the egg travels through the fallopian tube and how does that impact fertility? Is there a scenario whereby it happens too quickly and things don't work? I don't know about too quickly but there uh hairike projections in the tube cyia that kind of help with motility of the egg down the fallopian tube into the uterus. Uh the abnormalities in on the female side have to do more with potential abnormalities have to do with like scarring in the tubes or if the tubes are blocked that and then it interferes with the egg like encountering the sperm and what what leads to that a number of different things. Infection probably most commonly but also scarring from previous surgery potentially or a condition called endometriosis. So there are a number of things that can affect the the tubes as well. And so is the day for if assuming a woman's cycle is predictable and normal and we would just say day 14 is ovulation that is the day that the egg leaves the ovary or that is the day that the egg reaches a certain place within the fallopian tube. Pretty much the day that the egg is released from the ovary.

[00:09:54] Yeah. Okay. Yeah. and usually encounters sperm in the fallopian tube and that's where fertilization usually happens. And then it takes a few more days for the embryo now or pre- embryo to travel down the rest of the tube into the uterus and hopefully implant if it's normal. Now, one of the most interesting things here that is worth repeating even though we talked about it last week in case anybody missed it. How many sperm is the egg encountering at the time of fertilization? Roughly millions. Yeah.

[00:10:25] Millions. So why is it and this I know the answer to this question but it is so cool. Why is it that one and only one sperm out of millions or even less than that but let's just say it's hundreds of thousand. Why does only one get to uh transmit its genetic material into that egg? Well, once an egg is fertilized, there's sort of a chemical reaction, if you will, that happens that prevents any other sperm from fertilizing the eggs.

[00:10:52] Cuz that would be bad, right? You only want one sperm and one egg to combine. Yeah, it's incred like there's like an electrical force field that immediately activates around the egg. Exactly. I I find this so fascinating. Yeah, it is fascinating and brilliant. Yeah. So, okay. So, now we have And by the way, uh what is the relative size of an egg to a sperm? The egg is actually much bigger than the sperm. I don't know exactly in microns how how big it is, but I feel like I used to know this answer and it's shocking how how disperate they are in size. Like the egg is, I believe, the biggest cell in the body potentially.

[00:11:27] Yeah, I've checked on that, but I believe that's true. All right. So, yeah, you have this massive egg that's basically like the sun and like this tiny little sperm which is like the earth and you know colliding with it. Okay. So um fertilization takes place um and how long from fertilization for how long from impact um until you have that single cell zygote that actually has a lined up pair of chromosomes is that a matter of hours? Yeah, within a few hours. Yeah. Okay. And then what is the process that occurs uh for cell division for when that zygote goes from one to two to four to eight cells and and how so a how long does that take and and and b at what point does it implant into the uterus? Yeah. So most of what we know actually about this is from in vitro fertilization or IVF because we can actually see that happening in the petri dish. So, so usually the with IVF um an egg is fertilized with sperm. By the next day, we can see if it's fertilized and we know if it's fertilized because it has what we call two pr-uclei. So,

[00:12:42] DNA from the sperm and DNA from the egg. And then over the course of the next couple of days, it divides into maybe six to eight cells. So about 3 days after fertilization it's it's 6 to eight cells and then by 5 to 6 days it's about 60 to 80 cells and that's kind of the stage where it implants in the uterus. So 56 days after fertilization I'm Peter Aia.
