## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com hi everyone welcome to this special edition of the Peter Atia drive this is a special edition because it is the longest podcast ever recorded in the history of podcasts maybe it was a 7-hour only getting up to pee once interview with dr. Tom Dayspring who a number of you will immediately recognize my name tom is one of my most important mentors and is generally the mentor to the mentors in the field of lipid ology we're breaking this into five parts so this is going to be the week of Tom so today if you're listening to this and modestly real-time on Monday we're releasing part one and there will be a part released each day Monday through

[00:01:25] Friday so this 7 hour podcast will be released over the course of a week I'll call it the week of Tom and what you're listening to right now is part 1 I'm gonna use part one to give the bio and background on Tom and give you just the insights over what is covered in part 1 or episode 1 and then prior to each episode I will just highlight what's going on there

[00:01:48] Tom Dayspring is the chief academic officer for true health diagnostics a laboratory company Tom is a fellow of both the American College of Physicians and the National lipid Association he's board-certified in internal medicine and clinical lipid ology he practiced medicine in Jersey for just under 40 years and in the last two decades he's given about 4,000 domestic and international lecture - lipid ologists and cardiologist everywhere including a little over 600

[00:02:17] CME programs on this topic he's listed in the guide to America's top physicians and is on the Editorial Board of the Journal of clinical lipid ology he's authored and co-authored more manuscripts that I was able to count although that's obviously a countable number and he has received the 2011 NL a national lipid Association President's

[00:02:39] Award for service to clinical lipid ology I actually spoke to the President of the NLA who gave him that award and he described it as the most important award he had ever given out Tom's really active on Twitter at dr. lipid that's Dr Li PID and more than anything else as I think comes across in these interviews I shared just the greatest affection for

[00:03:03] Tom he can be rough around the edges and when I asked Tom a dumb question boy do I get an earful about it and he'll always tell you I'm sorry I'm just a Jersey boy I just don't know how to sugarcoat it but I don't know how to express my gratitude towards Tom other than the way I probably do so in this podcast and I really wanted to do this to share so much of the knowledge that

[00:03:26] Tom has given me with so many other people there's obviously been such an interest in understanding this space as I think I probably lude to in this podcast back in 2011-12 and maybe even into 13 I wrote a nine part guide on cholesterol called the straight dope - cholesterol it was about 30,000 words it was quite a lot of work obviously could not have done that without Tom's help and to this day tom is probably the single most important clinical mentor that I have in this first episode which is probably gonna be a little bit longer than the others this is where I'm gonna really kind of introduce you to what I call the national treasure and that's just the way I described Tom he is just a national treasure and I am not the only one to say that you ask any card-carrying lipid ologist who they look to as their go-to guy on education and it's going to be Tom we talk about some of the definitions of things but we actually start by talking about things about Tom's personal life that most people don't know his obsessions firefighting hockey and ultimately lipids and there's a common thread to

[00:04:30] Tom's obsessions he's an amazing author and illustrator and we talked a little bit about some of that stuff and his gift to teaching so in many ways the first episode is the soft one this is the one that kind of gets you warmed up gets you ready to think about what we're about to do and then in episodes two through five we get into sort of the more technical stuff the other thing I just want to say for this episode as some of you may recall for the episode with Dave Feldman we splurged on getting a transcript so that we could you know really make this technical information available Tom was so kind to go through and edit and correct all the things that

[00:05:06] Dave and I had said incorrectly which is invariably gonna happen in a long podcast and he also did the same thing for this podcast so when this podcast came out I want to say it was 80,000 words or 90,000 words it's basically a book medium-sized book Tom went through with a fine-tooth comb and made all of the corrections there so what you'll also find in the show notes is sort of an editorialized corrected version of the transcript I think it is safe to say that you could learn more in the next seven hours meaning episodes one through five and you would learn in a lipid fellowship and I suspect that many people who are studying an elephant fellowship will find great value in this that's the level of detail we go into and at the same time if you're a patient if you're a primary care physician I think you will still find this incredibly valuable so this was a little more work than usual to prepare for it to record it to edit it to break it down to do all of the things we did but I believe it's worth it and I am so happy to have been able to have done this because I think there are a few things that I get more pleasure out of than sharing Tom's knowledge with other people so with that welcome to episode 1 of the week of Dayspring any tom how are you I'm very good Peter thank you so much for slapping all the way up to New York to talk with me not the world's longest journey I think a lot of people have been looking forward to this I think many people have sort of relied on your insights your knowledge over the years as I have and I think what follows and I have no idea how long this is going to be but I suspect it will not be one episode but this will this will certainly be the master's class in lipid ology but not just for physicians you wanna understand this more but I think for patients too but there's so much stuff to talk about before we get into that and I figure if you're willing to talk about it what I'd love to do is have you explain a little bit about this kind of remarkable physical transformation you've undergone in the last year which this is only this is actually the first time I've seen you in person in eight months and I could barely recognize you as you walk down the hall to my apartment yesterday well many people who have seen glimpses of me on the internet or whatever in person

[00:07:26] God knows how many lectures I've done across our great country have always known geez for a lipid guy in a cardio metabolic guy he's kind of obese so it probably doesn't always practice what he may be preaching and everything so indeed I've had a long long experience with obesity and insulin resistance and cardio metabolic disarray and everything and always had any of the usual million excuses why I didn't have to do anything about it or so I felt good nothing was happening to me and I just did kept ignoring it but I did keep aging so for those who don't know um reached 72 years of age this year 71 last year and I've been great friends with Peter for a long time and

[00:08:19] Peter of course has been harping at me to do better nutritionally and everything and I just stumbled into his podcasts done up at MIT where he talked to a lot about longevity and Haiti average age of death in the United States and as an old man I you know I can see it a little light at the end at a tunnel like geez if 80 is the average age of death how much longer do I got to go and over the last five six years I've dealt with a bunch of morbidities a lot of them arthritic in the spinal nature but cholecystectomy and fatty liver and things like that we're sneaking up on me even though other than my bone issues I felt pretty bad so I just said you know since I do see the end of the tunnel and

[00:09:07] Peter's making a lot of sense what he's talking about all about longevity here maybe I ought to listen to what he's preaching here and he did raise the topic of intermittent fasting during that talk and everything I've sort of figured I got to do low carbs finally more than I ever did but the fasting was kind of new to me you know and in further conversations with Peter he just put me on an incredible regimen he's developed it's a modified intermittent fast that I said I can do that and I did it and as Peter says that was 67 pounds ago over the last 11 months I just finished my 11th month of uh I do one week a month of 700 calories or less pretty significant carb restriction and it's not only the weight is gone off but

[00:09:58] I mean a bunch of residual orthopedic symptoms that I was having and I just thought I'm gonna have to live with the rest of my life I've had a hip replacement several spinal surgeries I almost 90% of the time 95% I feel like I've got my normal head back my normal spine back I can walk in you and we walk to dinner last night and you said that that was a walk you would not have been able to do a year ago yeah a year ago I could walk on a short block and I have to sit down and wait for my bones to say okay try it again and nowadays don't have any of those limitations so it's been miraculous in a lot of way and I think it's way beyond just the weight loss - I think this fasting whatever it's inducing in me has just changed a lot of things and we know that because look I work for a laboratory I can do a lot of sophisticated testing on myself and checking every cardio metabolic marker that pretty much a lab can do nowaday and there was some ugliness to my report a year ago and it's those who follow though have I work for no we it's reported in red yellow and green and green is you got an optimal level of whatever and went from a pretty yellow red report to a 100% green report so it's not only cheese I'm feeling so much better biochemically I'm doing an unbelievable amount and I mean I'm happy about all of that but the disappearance of the amanece levels have been especially impactful yeah so I'll interject to just add some commentary so the first thing I would say is you were quite resistant I recall when we first had the heart to heart so you called me after you saw the

[00:11:41] MIT video I don't even know why you saw it I did I don't think I said thank you linked it today and one last joke about that yeah I'm good friends with Peter I don't want to ignore anything he sends me I send him a lot of stuff and I know he reads most of it and I said are al humor I'll listen to ten minutes of this lecture and at least I can be honest say yeah I listen to it and I put it on and

[00:12:04] I'm a busy guy I don't have an hour and I have to listen to a podcast and I just couldn't stop listening to it I went right to the end I've listened to one more time I referred to many other people to listen to so is one of these things in a life that somehow it really impacted me on that day which is interesting cuz the first 10 minutes are not particularly interesting so I don't know like you through but so I'd always had this concern because over the past seven years we've known each other you know you see my labs I see your labs and

[00:12:35] I'd always been kind of concerned about those lfts and it was like they were getting higher and higher and there were a number of other things I was concerned with so when you responded to me saying hey I want to do something about this and I said you know in the past you've had a hard time just adhering to carbohydrate restriction I think we need to try something a little bit more stream and so what I proposed as you said was this idea of doing a modified fast and this is sort of loosely based on vaulter along those five-day FMD but we kind of took it a little more extreme so a slightly higher ratchet up on the caloric restriction during five days and also doing it every single month as opposed to quarterly and also in Longos version of The Fast it's focusing on the restriction of protein so it's actually relatively high carbohydrate we wanted to restrict carbohydrates both inside and outside of the FMD well you expressed enormous reservation just at a practical level like I Peter I don't think I can do this so what I think I wanted to to point out was that it was amazing that you took that plunge the first time so I remember that first one you did last I think

[00:13:43] October right and you worked very closely with Nicole who's our dietitian inside the practice and she you know was just incredible at sort of guiding you through the the logistics of what does it actually mean to eat 700 calories a day of basically no carbohydrates and then once you emerge from that what are you going to do you remember what it felt like that for that first time and look I was highly motivated because of morbidities I had my age and I'm a timebomb something more is gonna happen

[00:14:15] I sure don't want to go undergo more orthopedic degenerative our thread of cages and my gall bladders come but that fatty liver and how many liver cells so I have left my big worry for what I do is cognitive impairment as time goes on and I was certainly headed towards ugliness in that direction also so and as you start approaching it I want to hang around I got a son I got a great life I'm gonna be here for a while I was super motivated which 20 years ago if we even knew this stuff I don't know how motivated I would have been so the end was near and just being so motivated even though and I looked at Peter's recommendation and Nichole's and wow I don't think I can do this you want me to me the caloric restriction for those five days which you're starving yourself and I just didn't think my body will help me to do that as a guy who's used to nibbling all day long every day of the week in everything but the motivation made me I'll try it yeah you know if it doesn't work it doesn't work but he had convinced me in that talk there was a good chance to shut down a lot of these metabolic pathways that were contributing to my morbidities so with Nicole's great help and understanding how to put together meals especially during that week and with an uncredible wife who's willing to prepare my meals and everything I did it and you know that first five-day fasts you know by day two or three the hunger pangs are there and oh my god can I do it but I got to do this and it's kind of funny like after day three the hunger disappeared a none subsequent fast sometimes I go five days I don't even feel hungry during it maybe some like last month I did it the third day which was I do it a Monday through Friday the

[00:16:01] Wednesday all gone I'm kind of hungry I feel kind of weak today but it was lasted half of that day and then just passed so I'd really tolerate it took life as well and the results are so astronomical the weight just pour it off we rapidly repeated some of the biomarkers and weather for a guy like me who's my life is looking at biomarkers in people and seems just so impressive that this has got to be doing good things to my body and symptom eyes I mean just symptoms disappeared that I didn't realize you know I didn't realize

[00:16:33] I couldn't walk up a flight of steps without being a little bit dyspneic or things like that and that's just all gone so there are a lot of rewards that came quickly and the fasting wasn't as horrific as I thought it was going to be yeah I think people who who listened to me talk got the sense that I've become more and more a proponent of fasting as an adjunct to dietary restriction of course dietary restriction meaning the restriction of certain macro nutrients so carbohydrate restriction would be a former dietary restriction protein restriction would be you know meat restriction for those who choose to you know be vegetarian or vegan that would be a form of dietary restriction and all of these things can offer benefits potentially but caloric restriction the actual restriction of the total number of calories for limited periods of time I think has to be a cornerstone of what we do because it is simply the most powerful way to deplete glycogen it is simply the most powerful way to reduce insulin it is the most powerful way to turn those nutrient sensing organelles and molecules off and we know that we don't want those things off indefinitely but we know that our current living environment where they're basically always on you have these you are constitutively fed it's evolutionarily unnatural and in the metabolically ill person it might be the single most destructive thing you can do and I've said this before and I'll say it again Tom my intentions

[00:18:02] I wish I could say it was just altruistic it was incredibly selfish my motivation for this I remember sitting down and saying this to you in October September last year I was like look Tom the impact your teachings have had on me personally and therefore by extension on all of my patients it can't be measured and so I started jokingly and I've been calling you this for a couple of years

[00:18:26] I've been referring you as the national treasure and I remember saying it's your brother when we had dinner with him a few years ago any kind of rolled his eyes at me I'm sorry to your son to Brad and so I just said look this is a selfish motivation that I have to keep Tom around as long as possible so as long as I can be transparent about that oh you're very kind and the other good thing about your talk look I'm basically a scientist I don't try and ad-lib and make things up like so many people do to support whatever they believed there was just so much plausibility and the science behind a lot what you said seemed very real to me and and did a little reading and so that sort of boost that me to Peter's just not making this stuff up it's beyond the theory stage I think and if we look at our evolutionary genetic ancestry and what our human ancestors the way they eight years ago it just makes a lot of sense so any time soon I'm holding out hope that my dad is listening to this or will listen to this

[00:19:26] I don't think he's ever listened to one of my podcast but I might insist that he at least listen to this portion of this podcast because if I could get my dad to do this that that would be again probably for selfish reasons that would be sort of the highlight of my life and you generously offered to speak with my dad because I don't then he certainly won't do what I would recommend so it would have to be Nicole and you sort of cajoling him into trying this that

[00:19:53] Nicole has also offered to help in any way so dad if I can get you to listen to this I hope you'd consider doing this so with that said thinking a lot about well first of all just watching the transformation you've just described unfold over the last seven eight months it's blown my mind because I've worked with many patients over many years and

[00:20:15] I've almost never seen the level of fastidious dedication to adherence that I've seen from you and I've known you for many years before and you'd been sort of ambivalent towards this so it was sort of this question of once the switch flipped there was no wavering now I didn't make the connection at the time but I think more recently I've realised that's just kind of the Dayspring way so before we get into lipids I want you to tell me about the very first obsession you had well I've had a few obsessions in my life there is more to me than just understanding biochemistry and cholesterol and other lipids or so and probably the first thing in my life was being born to two incredible parents one of whom was a professional firefighter in the city of Paterson New Jersey in

[00:21:07] New Jersey's third largest town so when you're a son of a firefighter real early in life you're visiting fire houses and being exposed to the incredible men who are firefighters and all their glorious machines that are sitting near in the fire has these big red things with bells on them and sirens that when they start them up make a lot of noise every once in a while your mom brings these to some major conflagration where you see your dad we running out of buildings that are collapsing and on fire so I just developed an leavel passion and love of firefighting which remains to this day I'll put in a plug I run one of the most viewed and largest historical fire Matic firefighting websites in the United

[00:21:56] States it's Patterson Fire history.com if anybody like to do it and you'll see and there's just thousands of pages of thousands of photographs and incredibly documented dad on the Paterson New Jersey Fire Department which has very unusually United States it goes back 200 years Patterson was formed by Alexander

[00:22:17] Hamilton right after the Revolutionary Wars a mega industrial town because of a giant waterfall as it was in the town so that a need for firefighting early on so you can really trace the entire history of firefighting in the United States by focusing on Patterson and it applies to New York and other towns that have been around for a long while so I've just had a great passion doing that so of course

[00:22:40] I wanted to be a firefighting too so look to collect the 30 40 years of data that is now my website it you got to be a little bit of a nutjob with a passion for firefighting to do that and I was able to collect that material through of course having a father who's well-connected in firefighting a world and everything but I put my heart and soul into it when I was an adult after med school I used to go to every antique market around fire Matic flea shows to collect

[00:23:10] I I collected one of the largest displays of fire Matic antiquities that were around in the United States outside of a museum so I need to know that was a word by the way I just like the way that sounded funny yeah nutjobs like me who are very much into this it's very recently given an award I was because of my dedication in Patterson documenting all this they're so proud of it is probably the most visited historical fire department website in the United

[00:23:43] States the department very much respects what I do at a certain point it became very cooperative with sharing some of their archival material that my father hadn't stolen when he was the 400 years ago so the latter years have had their cooperation but they brought me up to a memorial ceremony they had in June recently cuz very much they have a monument up there where if you make the supreme sacrifice if you're a firefighter who dies in the line of duty you get your name on this beautiful bestowed monument outside their fire headquarters and they've had 28 firemen unfortunately had their name on that monument over the last couple hundred years and through my archival analysis in 1938 I found the name of the firefighter who died on the job he dropped dead as he was carrying a big hose running to a fire hydrant to hook it up and it sort of got ignored now 1930 he obviously died of a heart attack at the scene he was 50 some years old dying of a heart attack while you were fighting a fire was not considered a fireman's death at that time if a wall collapsed on you it would have been but nowadays it certainly is if you have a heart attack of the fire you would get your name on the mind I mean your colleagues would mourn you heavily so

[00:25:01] I've actually found the data buried deep in the files that this guy dropped dead at a fire scene I went to the library got the newspapers that documented that and I presented it to the department so lo and behold they added the twenty-ninth name to the monument a fireman Edward Moore died in 1938 a little belatedly but his name is there so I wanted to go up and see that presentation and the chief said Tom would you get up and just tell this crowd a little bit about who Edward

[00:25:28] Moore was because none of them will certainly know him so I made a little three four minute speech on who he was what happened to him and I started to walk back to my seat and she said no Tom don't leave the podium yet and he said you know to make a long story short what you've done for the department we are for the first time in a department history making you an honorary battalion chief it's the highest honor a professional fire department can ever give to a civilian they will never give you a rank above a battalion chief a deputy chief assistant chief or a top chief but me battalion chief my dad was a chief for 30 years in the Patterson fire

[00:26:08] Department starting as a battalion and a deputy and assistance it was a rout I just can't display the emotions that went through me because my life I always wanted to be a fireman bad twisting my arms I know you're going to college and you're gonna study whatever you want to study but you're not joining a fire department out of high school which I probably really wanted to do and as tears when my eyes in a row 400 people in the audience at this big ceremony I just looked to the skies and I hoped I was additionally making my father very proud of me and it was a very proud man of me because of my medical career of course but so my love and passion of firefighting got me this and just had finished that story because they told me you're the first person that's ever we've awarded a battalion chief to but they didn't know I know their history back in the 1960s a woman was made an honorary battalion chief in the

[00:27:08] Patterson fire department and happened to be a nun at one of the big hospitals in Patterson a sister Loretta Agnes now what do you know I one of the major reasons I'm a doctor and had I trained actually at st. Joseph's Hospital in Paterson New Jersey because I really wanted to practice in that area she was a friend of the family and nun and would visit our house all the time and she knew us pursuing a medical career and she used to always harp imijo you got to come and visit our Hospital I'll give you the Grand Tour and you can hang out there in the emergency room if you were and just get to know our hospital mr. smart ass here no I'm gonna go to some big University Hospital here and say I want nothing about a hospital in

[00:27:53] Paterson New Jersey even though it's 700 beds and it's a gigantic Hospital what a teaching program but I took her up on it as I was a freshman medical student at the time and I'd just hang and let me hang out in the emergency room and I hooked up with a couple of Doc's who would work they would go in the evening after finishing classes I'd go hang out in st. Joe's and it's a large part of who I am what I do it fit imperfect I'm a fire and emergency room is where all the action is happening or stuff so sister

[00:28:25] Loretta had an a mega influence and I did go to train there and she was a godsend to patient so I interacted it so much but sister Loretta was made an honorary battalion she by the department because of her tear that she extended to every firefighter who was ever brought to st. Joseph's Hospital in Paterson New

[00:28:43] Jersey so the two honorary chief sinner history are are linked in other ways you know so it's just kind of spooky there how that turned out you know but just a great honor and on my desk at home I have a blotter that you know is like a plastic top so I can stick things that are important to me underneath it I have my mother and father is the little card that was at their funeral that who knew Holmes put out I got some pictures of my son there and I've got a NASCAR that my wife and I gave to sister Loretta on her passing it's just such an impact on my husband at least the fire department actually now does an annual sister Loretta

[00:29:23] Agnes dinner for the clergy in Paterson and stuff and I kind of laughed about two years ago they called me up said oh you know did you ever hear sister Loretta Agnes actually on our website now I have a whole page dedicated to her in what she does he's done for the fire department and everything so it's kind of funny well we could probably spend another hour talking about that and I know that our listeners would actually appreciate it but that said there are a couple other things I want to get to even before we get to the lipid stuff the other thing that we connected on pretty early was I realized you were a hockey fan of course I grew up in

[00:30:01] Toronto and I don't think you can grow up in Canada without being a hockey fan without playing hockey and being obsessed with it you know and certainly when I was a really young kid probably till I was about 13 it was hard to think of anything but hockey and it turns out you kind of just as you had this for a light switch moment with it you know all these things we've talked about you've had kind of that flip of the switch moment in hockey too right I sure did and it was very easy to grow up in New

[00:30:29] Jersey in the 1950s and early 60s without knowing what I saw walls are even ice-skating per se other than a month or two on a pond maybe in January you know when I was a young boy a defining moment in my life was the first visit my dad picked me up in a car and brought me to Yankee Stadium and I walked into probably in the early 50s into that stadium and the green grass and easy hankies running around in their white uniforms and Pinscher so I became a mega baseball fan growing up in a New

[00:31:00] York Yankee diehard which I remain to this day and that was a transforming moment to be sure it's the sport we played as a kid wiffle ball all the time me pretending a Mickey man on the picture would be whitey Ford throwing to me and everything but in 1962 while in high school my best friend was another young man who also had firefighting as a passion I always joke I think I became his best friend because he knew my father was one of the fire chiefs and

[00:31:29] Patterson want a thing around what a fire chief's son but who cares I love the guy and we grew became so close in high school and everything but some of the reason he was a hockey fan or sanyasis I want you to you know I go to Madison Square Garden occasionally I'd like you to come with why not you know so I went over and I remember to this day it's probably 1962 moons a freshman sophomore in high school you walk into the Hall and I'm talking the old garden up on each Devin 49th Street it was a dark dingy place you're walking in you almost meet night vision goggles eyes but all of a sudden you walk into spot where they glow it at white ice strikes you and out come these guys in red white and blue the New York Rangers who at that time we're wearing no helmets and you really and the other team they're only six teams they're sort of competition was unbelievable so I just fell in love instantly one game I knew I just have to start following this sport and I hope Peter within the year not only did I say I have to watch this I went out and bought myself a pair of skates which wasn't easy to do back in those days and made him one other buddy at night in the winters we started going to a local we knew about what every two people out there and we just thought ourselves how to ice-skate both some hockey sticks thought of playing one thing led to another convinced a few other young friends to do it and within a year or two we knew the one or two rink set were in 50 miles of our house so we would drive down and rent the ice for an hour so became a pretty decent hockey player considering I didn't grow up in Canada and everything at least playing against

[00:33:10] New Jersey competition and overtime join men leagues and some of my best friends in life now are not doctors they're guys I played men's league ice hockey with beer hockey as they call it nowadays or whatever cuz after you're done with the rink you know where you wound up for and I played until I was 50 years old and the last part of my hockey story of course when I was so lucky my wife and I to have a child who turned out to be a boy when he came home from the hospital my wife and I drove him home bore him upstairs put him in this wonderful bedroom we had put together with a crib in it and what was laying in his crib a small hockey stick does about 4 feet long and I wanted him to imprint on it like the ducklings do to mother duck and as it turns out my son turned out to be an incredible lifelong hockey player at every level youth hockey high school and college and it was a team captain in college wasn't he he's just had leadership abilities I credit that to my father and yeah he was probably the captain of every team user run from might up through high school and into college and so very proud of him so a large part of my life was not only playing hockey as I grew up watching hockey but when he started getting every night of my life I was at a practice watching you and so again some of my best friends were other hockey parents and stuff again I wasn't hanging out with all the docs and going to the doctor's balls and that kind of stuff they like never saw me and in practice for 37 years I just thought I godsend of a fellow I'm a brother really my associate who just covered my tale every time I wanted to run to a

[00:34:54] I gotta go to practice or Brad or I gotta play hockey he just covered the practice and it was made my life easier so so yeah that's the other super passion of mine when I say he dedicated to hockey what he when I was in med school when class was over I was going to a rink or someplace or I'd show up in my greens cuz I hey guys cover for me for a few hours we got a game tonight and that's how crazy I was in my medical school yearbook you'll see a picture of Tom day spring and the class voted you know we're gonna predict what everybody's gonna wind up and I was predicted of course to be the future New York Rangers team physician which I he never did achieve but close enough well it's not too late so we should add that to the list of things that we might try to figure out how to tee up you know it's so funny because I grew up in Toronto of course in Maple Leafs were also one of the original six now I grew up in the 70s and 80s so by then the league had expanded and I very quickly fell in love with the Edmonton Oilers who would very soon go on to become the most dominant team of the 80s but even watching them come up before they became that most dominant team they were just electrifying thanks to of course Wayne

[00:36:08] Gretzky but also guys like Mark Messier who would go on to become captain of the New York Rangers and finally bring glory back to the Rangers after one of the longest hiatuses in sports it was 94 when they won the Stanley Cup again right yeah but it's the same experience I remember the first time my dad took me to Maple Leaf Gardens which of course is not where they play anymore but it was this old sort of you know historic kind of dingy arena and I remember one game because it that there was like gold seats were the best then red blue green and gray and you know we could afford the grays but I remember and for an exhibition game where the tickets were a bunch cheaper the Oilers came to play the Leafs and we got gold seats and I mean I couldn't I couldn't believe what it was like to sit ten feet maybe a bit more maybe 20 feet from the glass and actually see you know at the time there was a goalie named Grant Fuhr who was like I was a goalie I played goalie in hockey so Grant Fuhr was actually the guy that I was trying to emulate and to see these guys you know yari Currie Glenn Anderson Paul Coffey

[00:37:14] Mark Messier Wayne Gretzky I mean yeah it's just it was a very special thing to do as a kid and I can certainly relate to that and the older I got the more I realized that the experience I had was basically going to be shared by every kid growing up in Detroit Chicago New York I mean the the stuff that you know you would have seen Montreal nevermind I mean you know you might argue that it was even more fanatical in in Montreal than any other place so let me just expound that he peter is right if you ever have the opportunity I mean any hockey game is great but if you can get such a seat and way back when we were kids going over to the garden you know the lower best seats a lot of more corporate you know those who couldn't afford those seats but they didn't always show up those guys so almost always by the third period we'd be sneaking down there and sitting there as young kids and they ushered wouldn't give you too much trouble if you were showing up in the third period there and it's just a different game back then and look I love the military nothing can be like in a foxhole when you're fighting for your life but when you see what those guys with the way they look at each other and the way they hit and at top speeds wow it's a different sport yeah it's funny you bring that up I totally forgot but as a kid that was my mo as we'd get the gray seats which I think were five dollars maybe nine dollars but they were you know that was what we could afford and we would just take binoculars and lock eyes on seats where we thought people had left and then we'd weasel our way on and it's the same thing I he was just a different era back then they weren't electronically scanning tickets so usually by the end of the game you were sitting close very very close yes but God just the special memories well let's get to what everyone really wants to hear I'm sure nobody wants to hear us bullshitting about hockey and stuff like that like I said I don't even know how we're gonna organize this I mean we've talked very briefly about kind of like a loose framework for what we want to talk about I don't want to put any restrictions on time I just want to go as long as we got to go I've set aside an entire day which for me is almost impossible to do I think I'm seeing one patient all day today and then we'll divvy this up in the end so let's just start with kind of definition what what's a lipid what's cholesterol what are these before we even do that let me tell you how I wound up in this world or so no look I you went to med school 68 to 72 residency in internal medicine for three years after that and I've already told you I've done a extensive amount of time working in emergency rooms yeah you know where everybody comes in in those days acute myocardial infarction was you know very very common you didn't spend the night in the ER without seeing a couple of them people coming in and forming pulmonary edema and everything and you know I just recognized early on that

[00:40:09] Patras kartik heart disease and its clinical endpoints are bad news and a lot of those people were young and dying way too prematurely and in those days when you come in even if we got to cure acute coronary syndrome pulmonary edema no no 50-50 no some we're dead by morning or those that survived then had this morbidity you had to deal with so I grew up in an era when it was rampant the acute episodes that I don't think they see anywhere near with the frequency that I did back then and I just latched on to it and I was lucky those were the days when the concept of a coronary care unit was invented Mason sones invented coronary angiography at that time in our Hospital developed a big deponent he probably first departments in New Jersey that was doing coronary angiography and that's the world I decided to start hanging out in my electives in medical school were all spent in the coronary environment one year of our residency the third year was pretty much elective like all I did was hang in the angiography lab or the coronary care unit or the post coronary floors providing care my first opportunity going to practice a cardiology group actually brought me into hey you manage our hypertension you do a stress testing which I've done a lot of as a resident and of course I've taking call every fourth night in that group too and you know Delinda I'm a gun every night I'm being called back to the hospital at 2:00 Tarina more it's another acute MI for God's sakes so I jumped really on to the prevention strategy it would be far better to prevent heart attacks and getting up at 3:00 in the morning and praying you could help them survive this episode that they at least made it to the hospital with so early on in life I just said what's involved with atherosclerosis and early in my career hey please don't smoke try not to be fat which I was not the best example of and let's attack your blood pressure aggressively and when I pause for a second here because you said something really interesting that I just hear so often from physicians of your generation including a physician I'm really close to here in New York who I share office space with and he's you know he's about your age runs a very nice concierge practice in the city and he basically said the exact same thing you just said which is we just saw em eyes all day every day non-stop you know a week couldn't go by where one of his patients didn't have an MI and then he contrasts it with today he's like I don't know the last time I saw one I don't know the last time I saw QA of MI I just you know he doesn't recall I get that all the time from young docs residence or physicians women in practice but they're not I didn't know a baby-boomer of my age or anything and they've all seen obviously acute coronary syndromes or but it's a different type of acute coronary syndrome they don't see these people coming in informing and pulmonary oedema they just don't know what it's like the ice of transmural em eyes with

[00:43:18] Q waves developing dropping dead before your eyes because they're rushing them right to the cath lab now and dissolving their cloths and every day never adieu so how these people survived or didn't so I was talking to Peter last night in it would not be unusual during my residency if you were the first year resident well you covered every admission in our 700 bed hospital there or nights where I'd get a dozen admissions to the coronary care unit a dozen of some sort of exacerbation or a clinical event related to death or sporadic heart disease most some of our most horrific nature so and I just don't believe that they see that nowadays yes they see a Q Kearney syndromes but they don't see the the type of acute coronary syndromes we saw back then so it has changed and look we got a long way to go to still eliminate this heart disease I think if we all jumped on prevention but you're in life we'd end this disease but yeah there was a different world back then Shirley was is there one person that would sort of be your first mentor the person that specifically got you not just interested in cardiovascular disease but pointed you towards lipids like something about these lipids matter no I sort of discovered lipids by myself as I said it was evolving I wanted to be a Preventionist so I was on the hypertension bandwagon and it became pretty obvious after a lot of the big epidemiologic trials started coming in with more data framing him mr. fit that lipid specifically cholesterol was the one they sort of focused on early on was a real big player in here so I realized and I'm a self education guy and most of the things that alright

[00:45:01] I'm as up-to-date as I can be on hypertension in the 1980s and now it's me to start doing some lipid education so I started doing a lot of reading and stuff and first of course I ever went to to take lipids to a different level was out there at the Cleveland Clinic but the guy that I hooked on earliest that rarely became a major mentor a good friend was Dan Reiter down in

[00:45:25] Philadelphia who turned out to become a world high density lipoprotein expert but just an expert in my mind and all things lipid he was so far curved so Dan was one of the real early ones others I jumped on to where Tony got oh and Virgil Brown and now insider men and Ron Krause and people like that who are really doing the type of investigations that when you started doing lipid reading you'd find all pointing to these guys yeah really did and they were gifted enough also that you could semi understand what they were writing about and talking about I told Peter so how long did it take you to math it was ten years of serious reading anything you could get your hands on I think the first five years with your red Sun you didn't even know what you read but I you just motivated to keep going back sooner or later and one day I woke up and it sort of thought it all made sense or so so it took a lot of Education and I think it's easier nowadays because there are phenomenal reviews have been put together by a lot of pigs issed in those days you had a sort of discover it yourself if you didn't spend two years at the NIH doing research on it and you would be exposed to it that way or so well you've also played a big role in that I mean when I now get to think about how I got into this interest you know what sparked my interest was there wasn't a single moment but I do remember reading a single document that you had written in 2011 and I think I was introduced to it by remember that guy greeny up and yes you know yeah yeah so

[00:47:05] I think greenie had sent me a document you wrote and it was the first time I even heard of NMR I mean I knew what NMR was for from chemistry but I didn't know what NMR was with respect to lipids and so he sends me this document it was like a PowerPoint but with notes embedded so it was printed as a vertical you know I printed it as a vertical and each so each page had a slide which I would learn to go on were like famous

[00:47:28] Dayspring figures at the time I didn't realize that and then you know just great text and prose explaining it and it was 26 pages long or something like that and it was dense like you can't imagine well you can imagine as you made it but it was there was a density to it that I was like and I'm thinking okay I know I'm just kind of a dumb surgeon so it's not like I ever knew this stuff but it was just so it was just so captivating I was like it was like there was a whole other world that I didn't know existed and these particles mattered and I never I remember feeling like did I not want to know this when I was going through medical school and training you know I was just you know I guess when you go down that surgical path you're not thinking about this stuff you're thinking about you know the surgical ways to address these problems and I mean I read it so many times because the first few times I was kind of frustrated I was like I don't know what the hell is going on here like I really have no clue what he's talking about and what are these a PO this and a

[00:48:29] PO that and I just kept getting confused by the concordance and the discordant between all these particles but that you know mid-2011 was kind of when I just I don't know I guess that was just a bug that bit me too but to your point I think so many people today whether it be physicians patients anybody who wants to understand this topic better really can look to you and your work as a great way to synthesize the work of these luminary folks that you've alluded to it's kind of funny because who could have ever imagined that when I start up my lipid journey I just was a a real-world internist with a big practice in northern New Jersey my only real goal was to be a better internist to my patients most of whom were getting after score of ik or cardiovascular events so rather than mastering ulcers and GI bleeds I just went where the money was

[00:49:28] Athos Kotik heart disease and I invested all my time and effort on learning this with no grand design that hey um hey Dave spring whether you know it or not within 10 or 15 years you're gonna be the most requested a lipid educator in the United States how did that ever happen and it just happened because I self-taught myself as a dumb real-world internist made it understandable to my brain part of the Dayspring learning curve is visual you said you used to draw graphics as I'm reading this stuff and initially and I have no artistic skills or whatever if I draw a human being it's that stick figure with a circle as a head but PowerPoint came along and there are tools there which are not that hard to master so I was able to draw and I'm now known as one of the best lipid lipoprotein illustrators in the yeah we're gonna we're gonna probably not probably we will unquestionably link to maybe your 50 finest diagrams in this podcast which is to say about 1% of what you've produced but I remember the first time you sent me one of your powerpoints

[00:50:36] I was like oh that's really interesting like either tom has contracted with an illustrator to do this or he's found somebody else that's already done these and when you said you had done them I was blown away because you have to remember I cut my teeth in PowerPoint at a place like McKenzie where we're

[00:50:56] PowerPoint ninjas I could do anything in PowerPoint I couldn't do what you had done simply because I couldn't I didn't have the time like those were such complicated figures that like if I ever came across something that was that complicated that I needed to make a slide for I would just get the illustrator to do it I wouldn't actually be able to sit there and make it happen so I couldn't believe it and I think the listeners who aren't familiar with your illustrations are going to find themselves incredibly surprised and and and grateful for for that sacrifice so illustrating things made me understand and look my illustrations got better and better as time went on early on they were a bunch of colored circles and stuffs and then I learned shading and making them move and animate on the slide so I've really progressed there but I just learned by illustrating I've since had serious educators tell me the human brain just understands things better by seeing pictures and graphically than reading thousands of words put together and there is no doubt my gigantic success is a lipid educator were I could dumb down the talk and try and make you understand complex and zoom ology or anything else the April proteins and how to interact but as I'm saying it in my dumbed down version you were looking at it moving on a screen with a graphic so it made comprehension of advanced lipid related areas much easier for even a layman or certainly a physician to understand or so so just the part of who I became and then somehow because of all my intense purple eyed notes as Peter said I became pretty good at putting together prose so

[00:52:43] I've done a little bit of research in my time because the places I wound up on and have an author research publication but most of the things you'll find in the literature of me are reviews and discussing this trying to make you understand concepts then you can go read the geniuses studies and you'll understand what they're talking about and everything so I just evolved into that and actually the first guy I was it was a cardiologist down in Florida

[00:53:10] Michael McIver he's the first guy ever so I use PowerPoint for lipids and I just used him and he shared a lot of his early stuff on and I learned all for him and it's made my life as a well-known lipid educator I've got opportunities to start doing lipid education and if you go out and you're lucky enough to have some people come and listen to you you better be good at what you do or they're gonna bad mouth and you'll never be invited back or if you do want to come back they're gonna like you they're gonna be in touch with you and I just developed ways of explaining lipids and illustrating lipids that became huge in a lot of just the finishes Mike gave it's in who's one of the all-time gods in the lipid world in Chicago still a university professor they're one of the big founders of the National lipid

[00:54:02] Association did at one time during his presidency bestow their President's Award to me which is given to people who make contributions to lipid ology but this is the top lipid organization in the country how does some real-world internist with no formal lipid training ever work his way up to an award like that or so Mike told me we polled our the NLA and a lot of people join this organization cuz they heard a ton Dayspring lipid lecture and mike was a big advocate if you teach through illustration I've Illustrated many things from Mike over the years and so he's right and that's my claim to fame I hope some of you follow me at their lipid because Twitter is the way to get a lot of my graphics nowadays yeah and there's a lot of stuff that will make sure we link to but the Lippa holux anonymous you used to write a lot more into yeah I used to read those case reports constantly we'll have to make sure we can pull all those things out of the archive because there's some amazing cases there but yeah we'll make sure people know where to find you on Twitter and all that stuff because quickly I know when I was on this giant lecture tour for 10 15 years of my life I did generate a weekly newsletter called lipid hall X anonymous where they were one case discussion all real world that were in my practice or sent to me by other Doc's and I would just take it in to the next level so I would explain it basically and then I would like I'm talking to a lipid ology Illustrated and he came immensely popular I had several thousand people it was free I sent it out each week in a group email but it really enhanced my and it found itself on how death stops you know so yeah that's a big part of who I was you know and I do have most from so layer but I am really people give me all it because

[00:55:50] I don't want you to know what I was saying in the year 2002 because it's mostly all wrong nowadays because we've evolved so much but if you want to see what we were talking about in lipids in 2002 they might have some historical interest yeah well you just touched on kind of an important point which is I like to say facts all facts have a half-life and some of them are really really long half-lives you know the earth being round is we would call that an incredibly long half-life fact we're gonna you know the half-life is nearly infinite on that but elevated levels of

[00:56:22] HDL cholesterol are necessarily a good thing that's a that's a that's a fact that I think you know it used to be deemed a fact based on the epidemiology of Framingham I think today anyone who's serious about the study of lipid ology would say that's grossly oversimplified potentially incorrect that's certainly want to the old time facts that really disappeared I personally think it's a waste of time to even put it in the lipid profile other than it's used in certain calculations that are popular nowadays like non HDL cholesterol but I encourage no one to ever make a judgment on any humans cardiovascular risk based on their high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level or think you know what you're doing to a human being if you somehow change that HDL cholesterol metric in that patient has nothing to do with anything all right so now I'm chomping at the bit we got to get into this so where do we even begin do we want to start with what's a lipid what's cholesterol what let's say I want to you know well let's explain what these things mean hdl-c and stuff sure well a lipid is basically a molecule that is not soluble in water it's might be soluble in certain organic solvents but not in water so it's a hydrophobic compound and oils and fats are what everybody thinks of as a lipid some you know cholesterol is in theirs

[00:57:48] I know I never liked calling cholesterol fat but it's a lipid fats to me or fatty acids and combinations of fatty acids or so glycerides so that's what lipids are and different lipids have different degrees of soluble e summer extremely hydrophobic cuz both ends at a molecule the can't be seen in water some lipids have a one n is a little bit water-soluble hydrophilic and the other one is and that would be where cholesterol fits in phospholipids fit in so that's what a lipid is and there's several types of lipids in your body but the ones that those of us who live in a clinical lipid ology world are focused on our cholesterol basically two types of cholesterol and there are fatty acids but fatty acids stick to a lot of things and it's sticking is called esterification in the world of lipids so they can bind to carbohydrates cholesterol a 3-carbon sugar called glycerol is the most common thing they bind to so if you have one fatty acid on a glycerol that's a mono acyl glycerol if you have to that's a diacylglycerol if you have three fatty acids stuck on your glycerol compound that is called they try a so glycerol which most people would call a glyceride if you're as old as me in not used to hear in those terms and you're used to hearing triglycerides but initially they were just called glycerides and glycerides would be the whole family of mono a soul and try a soul glycerides or so and its basic the way in which the human body transports fatty acids or stores them it transports them in the plasma or stores them in various tissues in case you need a fatty acid for a certain purpose be it energy or a structural purpose then the fatty acids would disconnect from its glycerol backbone that would be called Dias tera fication and that fatty acid could be used through whatever whatever cell wanted to do with that fatty acid or so the cell didn't need it could store it till when it did need it as a glyceride so those are basic definitions but the one glyceride that is of incredible importance maybe in the future t1 we're gonna be looking at most seriously and the one that nobody ever looks at or even brings into the discussion now they are phospholipids and phospholipids are simply glycerol compounds so you got your three carbon alcohol sugar there and there's two fatty acids attached to it there's a lot of fatty acids in the makeup of every phospholipid might have the same two fatty acids different fatty acids fatty acids come in different lengths different types of double bonds and then they got a head group which usually got a phosphorous moiety in it and that's what a phospholipid phospholipids are kind of cool because part of it is water soluble part of it is hydrophobic doesn't like water they're called anti files and B Pathak is their name it's huh and that allows them to sit in certain positions in our body where hey they're hydrophobic lipid tails the fatty acids can exist in a lipid enriched environment inside the cell inside a core of a lipoprotein which is all hydrophobic lipids but it's hydrophilic surface can interact with plasma so where do phospholipids exist on the surface of our lipid transportation vehicles lipoproteins are on our cell membrane every cell membrane in your body as phospholipids and what nobody seems to know is most your phospholipids are made in the liver or they're made in the small intestine because the intestine absorbs fatty acids repackages them into glycerides phospholipids are triglycerides and then they become part of lipoproteins that enter your lymphatics from the gut chylomicrons or your liver gets fatty acids and as fostered it makes phospholipids and your liver makes lipoproteins and excrete some so few people know that a gigant everybody talks on lipoproteins as if they're delivering cholesterol all over the place that's what we have lipoproteins for that's probably the last reason we have lipoproteins because every cell in your body makes every cholesterol molecule it needs to do what it has to do with a few rare exceptions so if I'm a nose cell I don't need some lipoprotein to come and deliver cholesterol to my cell because I need cholesterol in my nasal cell membranes that so will make cholesterol every cell has the genetic power and the protein the enzymology to make cholesterol till it's heart's content the tragedy is a co-op we eat most of ourselves make way too damn much cholesterol which becomes then not a absolutely life-sustaining molecule needed in your cell membranes but a cell you're a toxic molecule because it crystallizes and kills that cells so evolution has given ourselves incredible powers to evict he flux out cholesterol so they don't suffer cholesterol toxicity in those cells and that will be certainly something we'll get into how do cells get rid of all this cholesterol because of what we're eating they're making too much other so it's not that lipoproteins are delivering too much cholesterol to most of these cells although they can in certain areas we some people do get cholesterol builds up in their skins and almonds and things like that and I want to just interject for a moment to go back and clarify something for the listener so we talked a lot about fats but many people are familiar with the term saturated fats monounsaturated fats polyunsaturated fats you touched on it very briefly but just so that they understand the broader context a saturated fat means a fatty acid hydrocarbon that has no double bonds in it a monounsaturated fat has a single double bond in it and a polyunsaturated fat has two or more and of course depending on the position of the first double bond within with respect to its carboxyl group that's where we get into these omegas and things but the point here is when people talk about saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat they're referring to the positions of these double bonds within these long hydrocarbons that also can be of variable lengths so for example a saturated fat can be very short six seven eight carbons in length or it can be much longer and each one of them has its own name and the same is true with the Manos so once you get into the Manos and the Polly's the nomenclature starts to get complicated because you're describing both the position of the double bonds and the length of the hydrocarbon now these things have all of these complex properties but in many ways it still pales in comparison to the complexity of the cholesterol system because those fatty acids can also mean even though they're not soluble in water and therefore they can't float around willy-nilly they have the luxury of being transported on albumin right it is which is another protein in the plasma that can hide this hydrophobic part of them in an ability to transport them through but yet why can't we transport cholesterol which you've just explained is not soluble in water it's hydrophobic why can't we transport cholesterol or phospholipids in albumin something that's so ubiquitous and benign well you can cholesterol can attach to albumin and just before I answer your current question what I was explaining before is you know the lipoproteins everybody thinks their purpose is to deliver cholesterol to tissues that's their last purpose they don't do that they your a real purpose of our lipoprotein or lipid transportation system is to develop the transport energy to tissues that need them that would be triglycerides the fatty acids which are cells oxidize to create ATP so they are brought to tissues that are very good at extracting triglycerides from lipoproteins muscle cells but if your muscles because you're not using your muscles don't need any energy today those triglycerides will be dumped in and adipocyte to be stored as your fatty acid until you need them but what nobody talks about of what else are the lipoproteins deliver and that cells cannot be a cell without their phospholipids and what is the surface of every lipoprotein phospholipids where do the phospholipids come out of lipoproteins produced in the intestine or the liver so what are the biggest lipoproteins because they would have the most gigantic surface area chylomicrons coming out of your gut very low density particles coming out of your liver so we all talk about our delivering cholesterol there delivering maybe triglycerides because they're very triglyceride with their delivering phospholipids so just to clarify again this spherical lipoprotein has an inside yep which carries the cholesterol ester and the triglyceride but the phospholipid isn't carried inside that central cargo it's actually embedded within the structure of the lipoprotein and therefore the chylomicron being the largest followed by the VLDL the very low-density lipoprotein the larger the surface area of these things the greater their capacity to carry phospholipids since the phospholipid is carried in the wall correct and when these gigantic triglyceride rich particles go to your muscles are out of passage to deliver their triglyceride in their core very hydrophobic in that core is a special type of cholesterol that has a fatty acid to it cholesterol as they're incredibly hydrophobic also those two tissues that I talked about have a very powerful triglyceride dissolving enzyme called lipoprotein lipase which starts hydrolyzing the core triglycerides now these big dumb trucks full of triglycerides like that they start to shrink when a the triglycerides are undergo hydrolysis Dias Tara fication the particle as it shrinks that's called lipolysis removal of a lipid from a lipoprotein so you can imagine these big fat balloons full of triglycerides if you could suck water out of a balloon it becomes a smaller balloon - and it would get wrinkles on it well lipoproteins don't become wrinkles they just evict their surface phospholipids which can immediately attached to a contiguous cell where the decrease in diameter of the lipoprotein is a current or they jump on a protein that evolution has given us called phospholipid transfer protein which then takes all those phospholipids and brings them to cells that say hey I need phospholipids or the only lipoprotein that is not made in the liver or the intestine but grows itself matures itself in the plasma high density lipoproteins you couldn't change a baby apo a1 which is a structural protein of an HDL into a big fat mature large HDL if you weren't supplying it with what phospholipids where would an HDL give phospholipids as these big triglyceride rich particles shrink and extrude them phospholipid transfer proteins is here little baby HDL here's your phospholipids B and they can mature into its anthropomorphizing these things little babies HDL it helps so that's all being said I want everybody to reoccurs nobody cuz we don't measure them because it's complex on how to measure them and there are so many different types of phospholipids based on the exact fatty acid makeup the length of the fatty acid remember a glycerol has three positions they're called stereospecific number one number two and number three everything depends the lipases attack various fatty acids on different positions and so it's really complicated so the phospholipids affect a lot of functioning since phospholipids are making up not only the surface of lipoproteins basically because they're water-soluble it allows these dump trucks to float around in plasma in the cell membrane what

[01:10:14] Peter was just talking about that fatty acid makeup and the phospholipids become so crucial because saturated fats are straight they're rugged they don't bend so it gives some structure to a phospholipid if your phospholipids cake contain a lot of saturated you got a strong cell membrane there that's hard to get through but the real reason cells function and interact with the rest of the cells of your body is they signal each other in signaling occurs because something occurs at a certain member of the lipid cell membrane that we're gonna call a lipid RAF which is a specialized collection of special phospholipids with a little bit of free cholesterol intersperse but the structural positioning that a phospholipid takes up if you have several double bonds in that thing if you've ever seen a 3d view of a phospholipid that's got a several double bonds and it takes up an incredible amount of space so it's two legs spread out and you change the structure of the cell membrane and that structure of that area called the lipid rath allow certain cellular proteins to locate there and those are all our receptors that pull things into cells or extrude things out of cells so the fluidity of the membrane is highly highly dependent on the nature of the fatty acids in the fluidity and the ability to shelter or let certain proteins be expressed in that area if

[01:11:49] I'm an LDL receptor or some immuno receptor there's certain areas of cell memory and I could never locate - because the phospholipids wouldn't allow it but there are other areas they say welcome here's where you're supposed to be expressed and cells know that and they construct their lipid membranes hopefully if you have the right type of phospholipids and everything so as we start to talk and those who study and investigate membrane physiology it's one of the more advanced areas in lipid ology but as we also are starting to understand some of the qualities beyond just measurements of various lipoproteins they're phospholipid makeup is going to be crucial and as we talk about HD else we're gonna start throwing around the word HDL functionality and a giant part of HDL functionality what a specific HDL particle does in your body what it might be capable of accomplishing or not accomplishing is due to the fatty acid makeup of its phospholipids and one day

[01:12:52] I think we're gonna be analyzing the lipid dome of various lipoproteins and we're gonna have a lot more insight of what lipoproteins do or don't do you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter DMV com what's a nerd Safari you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
