## Description

Full title: #47 – Matthew Walker, Ph.D., on sleep – Part I of III: Dangers of poor sleep, Alzheimer’s risk, mental health, memory consolidation, and more

Original release date: 4/1/19

In part 1 of this 3 part series, Matthew Walker, professor of neuroscience at UC Berkeley and expert on sleep, describes the different stages, and cycles, of sleep, including what he calls the 4 pillars of sleep, and how they contribute to memory consolidation and numerous important pathways to mental health. We also get into the dangers of chronic sleep deprivation, such as the development of dementia, and the more acute dangers of sleep deprivation like fatal car crashes which are most often caused by drowsy driving. We also discuss the different and important roles of REM vs. non-REM sleep, and the impact that bad sleep habits can have specifically on those sleep stages.

We discuss:
-Matthew’s background and interest in sleep [5:00];
-Sleep and Alzheimer’s disease, and the 4 pillars of sleep [11:15];
-Stages of sleep, sleep cycles, and brainwaves [40:15];
-Memory and sleep, and the risk of insufficient REM sleep [54:45];
-Evolutionary reasons to sleep [1:01:00];
-The early riser vs. the night owl, and tips for overcoming jet lag [1:09:15];
-Is there one type or stage of sleep that is most important? [1:16:30];
-The dangers of drowsy driving [1:25:45];
-The timeliness of Matthew’s book, and how the conversation of sleep has changed over the past several years [1:34:15]; and
-More.

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination and obsession with this topic I practice it professionally and

[00:01:05] I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon such as the downloadable transcripts for each episode these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our show's members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:28] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription welcome to the kickoff of this Matthew Walker three-part series unsleep this is one of the topics we were asked about the most and I think this will be a fan favorite this series of podcasts will be released over three weeks with this one being the first now at the end of this series we're going to take questions for a follow-up ama with matthew asking questions on the AMA forum and listening to the AMA podcast with Matthew along with all AMAs will only be available to subscribers so if you haven't signed up yet you can do so now at Peter TM decom forward slash subscribe my guest this week is Matthew Walker professor of neuroscience and psychology at the

[00:04:45] University of California Berkeley and the founder and director of the Center for human sleep science Matthew earned his undergraduate degree and PhD in neurophysiology in London and subsequently became a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School before moving to Berkeley his research examines the impact of sleep on human brain function in healthy and diseased populations today he has published over a hundred scientific studies he has received numerous funding awards from the National Science Foundation National

[00:05:11] Institutes of Health and he's a fellow of the National Academy of Sciences he's the author of the international bestseller why we sleep which also happens to be the favorite book of my not-yet two-year-old son he holds many patents covering various consumer base LEEP recordings sleep tracking and sleep simulation he's a sleep scientist at Google where he helps the scientific exploration of sleep in health and disease he is also an enormous fan of Formula one and my hero Ayrton Senna and in the third part of this installment we actually spend quite a bit of time discussing this here in the first part of this series we discussed the relationship between sleep dementia and Alzheimer's disease the four pillars of sleep sleep stages measurements and the overall importance of sleep the lack of sleep and dangers of drowsy driving and how the conversation of sleep has changed over the past several years so without further delay here is the first installment of my three-part series with

[00:06:07] Professor Matthew Walker Matt thank you so much for making time to meet on a Sunday absolute privilege and intellect to be with you Pisa what's with the weather in Berkeley is it always this bad now when Peter says is it always this bad it's probably in the low 60s and it's there isn't much blue sky it's dry and there's a very pleasant breeze and there is some wonderful blossom so I know it's not San

[00:06:34] Diego everything is utopian and people are singing Kumbaya at the end of the day and holding but it's pretty good day when you consider it's still February right right I know it's like I live in these extremes like in you know in San Diego the bar is like it has to be perfect and then in New York you just sort of expect it to be sort of you know like I was there two days ago when it's dark I mean are all three of those our best that in the United Kingdom you know my home country were essentially you have nine months of really bad weather and then three months of winter and then that's your that's your year so this today

[00:07:05] February like this low 60s I'm a happy man I came from Canada where it's bad in a different way but the first time I saw California was my interview for med school and it was a February day and it was 76 degrees and that was the first time it occurred to me that you didn't have to suffer you know like I just I never realized I mean

[00:07:26] I guess intellectually I understood that it could be warm in the winter but I'd never occurred to me that you could choose to do that so well now speaking of this so what brought you to the u.s. it was science I did all of my education back in United Kingdom actually started off at medical school so back in the UK at aged 18 you can actually go to medical school it's a five-year program and after about two years this wonderful professor came up and said look you're a nice guy but you're always asking questions and you're asking them I think genuinely you're not asking him to be an ass but I think you're actually a scientist not a doctor because at the time you know he was thinking doctors are interested in answers scientists are interested in questions I think you're a scientist not a doctor so we didn't have

[00:08:16] MD PhD programs back at that time so then you know I thought about it for the summer came back switched neuroscience so essentially brain science did that as an undergraduate then went on to do my PhD at the Medical Research Council in London and then came to Harvard for my first faculty position there and I was there for seven years as faculty in psychiatry at Harvard and the winters just got to me and you know the environment at times as well academic was perhaps more combative and competitive and I think that's one way to breed productivity in a department and I'm not shaking a finger at it but by nature I'm just a person who is much more collaborative and collegial rather than combative and competitive so Berkeley fit my mentality better came out here weather was great

[00:09:09] California it's an immensely easy place to arrive in a very difficult place to leave and I think I probably won't I know that feeling I'm probably leaving California I'm going through the mourning process of accepting a departure because you're right you'll be fast it's a hard place to leave when did the switch sort of flip in terms of your passion for sleep I think back at medical school I was always interested in states of consciousness I guess you would describe it as I was fascinated by anesthesia I was fascinated by even hypnosis I remember actually went out to meet this hypnotist to try and understand not you know the act and the show I wasn't interested in that I fundamentally wanted to understand what did he think happened within the brain to produce this altered state of consciousness so I got really interested in how the brain can switch between sort of states mental states and then just fundamental awareness states that then naturally led me to just be fascinated by sleep I mean there is no better demonstration of a gigantic shift in conscious state that happens to almost every single living creature on this planet every 24 hours and back then this was 20 years ago we had this fundamental question why do we sleep and what was staggering to me is that it took a third of our lives every species that we've studied to date does it sleeps it seems to have evolved with life itself on this planet even more we've understood the functions of the other main biological drives eating drinking and procreation for tens if not hundreds of years but the fourth main biological drive the drive to sleep had continued to elude scientific judgment was that possible and back then 20 years ago if someone were to ask you you know why do we sleep the crass answer was we sleep to cure sleepiness and that's the fatuous equivalent of saying well we eat to cure hunger well that tells you nothing about the fundamental nutritional benefits of macro nutrition but that's where we were at with sleep so it was for me this perfect collision of fascination in an innate biological problem and universal behavior conserved across evolution together with the fact that we did it for a third of our lives plus the fact that science had not been able to crack this this nut it was one of the last great remaining scientific mysteries I thought well you know if you want to pick something that's gonna sustain you for the rest of your life and some of the most acerbic brilliant minds in science had tried to crack this note and failed including Francis Crick wonderful scientist who discovered the helical structure of DNA it's unlikely

[00:12:11] I'm going to do it in my lifetime but at least it will sustain me as a problem and I could not let it go and so that was where the intellectual bite happened the date of the empirical scientific bite happened when I was doing my PhD I was studying brain wave patterns in people with dementia and I was trying to do differential diagnosis very early on in the course of cognitive decline seeing which type of dementia did they have was it frontal lobe dementia was it

[00:12:38] Lewy body dementia was it Alzheimer's dementia and I was failing miserably for two years I was getting nothing I used to go home I was living this doctor's residence I had this sort of in the middle of my room this little egg glue of journals that used to sit in on our Sunday just this kind of like sort of sanctified circle of knowledge and I was reading one Sunday and I realised that the different pathologies and these different dementia some would hit the sleep centers and others would leave those sleep centers completely untouched even within forms of dementia that clinically presented very similarly that's right yeah you could see certain brainstem nuclei certain centers within the basic base of the brain some of those were getting eroded by the dementia and those asleep generating centers whilst another of those pathologies those centers were spurred until very late in the disorder so they probably weren't affecting my early patients so I realized I was measuring their brainwave activity at the wrong time I was measuring my patients whilst they were awake what I should have been doing is measuring them whilst they were sleep got a small grant set up a sleep lab learned how to do it got some great results and then the question became if their sleep is so disrupted is it not just a symptom of dementia could sleep disruption actually be a biomarker of dementia could it actually foretell when you are going to develop dementia and which type or even more profound is sleep disruption an underlying cause of

[00:14:14] Alzheimer's disease and I think right now based on the weight of the data that we have and we and others have got large research programs doing this work the evidence I think is causal I think that sleep at this stage may be one of the most significant lifestyle factors at least that determines your risk ratio for Alzheimer's disease

[00:14:34] I feel the causal evidence for that now in humans and animals is strong enough to make that statement and I don't make that statement lightly yeah that is profound because when you think about the other really big ones vascular disease and insulin resistance they both feed into a very similar mechanism which is a neuronal energy deprivation that's right so do you think that sleep disruption or poor sleep and I want to come back to the semantics around that because I don't actually think I'm well equipped to talk about this intelligently but do you think that that also disrupts some aspect of energy metabolism in the brain or where in the sort of chain of events do you think that that impacts I think one of the places that it impacts is in oxidative stress I think it's safe to say that wakefulness is low-level brain damage and we need sleep to avert of that low-level brain damage that wake from sleep is the price that we pay for wakefulness essentially and you know something I mentioned in a book that I put out was just a little book just a little just a little New York Times bestseller yeah which by the way before we're done I brought my copy because my youngest son who's named after our mutual favorite racecar driver loves moons it's all he thinks about moons boots every his pajamas moons everything and he loves your book except for the fact that on the inside there are no pictures of moons so he'll sit there and he'll look at the cover and go moo moo moo and then he flips through it and gets so frustrated that there's no moon pictures inside

[00:16:14] I will cause correct that if there's a second edition and I will just try to place the words underneath but it is for the benefit of I know if you know but in the book you know I proposed that we didn't evolve sleep that perhaps we've got it the wrong way round perhaps the default state of life on the planet was sleep and it was from sleep that wakefulness emerged Wow why could it not have been that way now I don't have any good evidence to support my hypothesis I think it could be utter nonsense but I think it's a tenable hypothesis it's just one that's difficult to test but to come back to your question about Alzheimer's which i think is critical I think the first thing is that we see that with insufficient sleep you get increases in oxidative stress those oxidative stress processes lead to a whole cascade of kind of a finger flick domino effect of things that lead to neuronal death one of the areas in the brain that is most sensitive to that is an area that we call the hippocampus which is a critical memory center it's probably one of the first structures to undergo damage in

[00:17:28] Alzheimer's disease it's part of the reason why the sort of the phenotype of Alzheimer's is forgetfulness problems with memory I think perhaps the stronger evidence though in terms of sleep and Alzheimer's disease risk is a remarkable discovery that was made probably about five or six years ago now by some folks at Rochester you versity in rats and what they discovered is that the brain actually has a sewage system inside of it now your body has one that you're all familiar with called the lymphatic system but it turns out the brain has one it's called the glymphatic system named after the cells in the brain that formed this system called the glial cells also known by sort of from a greek derivative meaning glue so they used to be just thought as the sort of the cells sort of irrelevant stuff between the neurons exactly you know yeah it was like junk DNA and of course what we always learn is that mother nature is far too efficient to leave inefficiency on the table like glue or junk and it turns out they form this sanitization system within the brain and what happens they discovered is that when you go into deep sleep at night this sewage system kicks into high gear and essentially those glial cells which surround the brain cells themselves the neurons proper they shrink in size by up to two hundred percent and then all of a sudden it leaves a vast amount of room for cerebrospinal fluid to start perfusing the brain and washing out that to try the metabolic detritus of wakefulness so it would be like New York City at night all of the buildings Runk down to 200 percent you know they became miniaturized and then there was this big effluent flush that had just happened across Manhattan to clear out all the debris and it's essentially good night sleep clean that you get this power cleanse at night why is this related to

[00:19:27] Alzheimer's well one of the critical ingredients that they found that the glymphatic system washed away was a sticky toxic protein called beta amyloid beta amyloid is probably one of the two core proteins that we know underlie your risk for the development of Alzheimer's ergo if you're not getting your sleep at night you're not getting that washing away of the toxic Alzheimer's protein every night then you are building up more amyloid within the brain if you keep doing that night after night it's like compare interest on alone it's just escalating you're out Simas risk that's why we can then explain the associational evidence which I I don't like associational evidence in epidemiological studies and

[00:20:11] I don't think you're a huge fan of it perhaps either just don't tell anybody at the Harvard School of Public Health yeah or maybe the NIH and I'm applying for grants for epidemiology what we certainly see is that if you bucket people into the amount of sleep on average that they've got across the lifespan and at the end of the sort of life or in late life in their 70s and their 80s we do a special type of PET scan to map the amount of amyloid in their brain and then you just sort of look at those brain scans anyone on the street would not need any statistics they would not need any training in brain science to see that one of these maps is different to the other it's like

[00:20:50] Sesame Street and what is remarkable is people are getting you know seven hours of sleep or less compared to seven hours of sleep or more there is marked differences in the amount of amyloid that's built up now that's just associational evidence but then when you take it down to the level of animal studies where they selectively deprive animals of either deep non REM sleep or they fragment their sleep you get an immediate amyloid buildup centrally within the brain you start to have what looks like a sort of you know an amyloid sort of genic process that's happening that's rats so then we can all wave our hands if we want because we would like to beat our chests and sort of you know say I don't need my sleep and that's just rat stuff well the studies have now been done in humans were we will take a human being and for one single night we will take away their deep sleep and the way that you do that is that you just play these auditory tones at night so they never wake up so the total amount of sleep that they get is still eight hours but I can just selectively excise your deep sleep when that that sewage system should be kicking into gear and then the next day we do something that's really rather unpleasant we do a spinal cord puncture and we suck out some cerebrospinal fluid and we can measure the amount of the two toxic proteins linked to Alzheimer's one is called beta that we've discussed the other is called tail protein and we see the next day after one night of sleep disruption a significant increase in circulating levels of amyloid and tau for me that was kind of like the turning point where

[00:22:29] I finally felt comfortable going on record and saying at this point folks I really feel comfortable saying that your sleep is a critical component of your prevention of Alzheimer's disease I really think the evidence is now you know in that direction and way in that direction it's not just epidemiological it's not just prospective longitudinal studies which are better than cross-sectional sort of epidemiological it's not just causal in rats it's experimentally causal in humans after one night of sleep do you see variation there because one of the things that I find difficult with understanding all diseases and

[00:23:12] Alzheimer's would be sort of more so than even cardiovascular disease because we still have so much less data is there must clearly be enough variation between people that it's very easy at the heterogeneous level to miss things that you would see in other words homogeneous population so for example when you look at the coinage of the term Alzheimer's disease it's quite likely that that was coined based on a patient who probably had a PS and en 1 or 2 mutation is such an early onset of the disease versus the disease we typically see I mean today those patients make up less than 1% and it's it's almost a different disease from the one you know these are people that are presenting in their 50s and they're usually dead before they're 60 whereas the 99% of the population you're getting a sort of later onset disease and even of course then within that population all of the variation with a phony genotype it almost makes you wonder if there's different susceptibilities to this deprivation because everybody on their brother can point to the exceptions to these rules right the person who did everything right slept like a baby every night and ends up down this one path and then of course the person who does everything incorrect and seems to be you know completely fine or at least from the perspective of you know no obvious disease so your analogies really interesting because I don't really find myself hugely in the Emily bata camp as the main causal driver I think it's more of a result but it's interesting what you posit is if it's more about the clearance of that than the generation of that that would be a congruent view with this idea that you know there could be other things on the back end that are driving this primarily but of course I think with Alzheimer's disease it strikes me is just so complicated because of the genetic predisposition coupled with the multiple pathways that can seem to drive comparable insults to an otherwise incredibly sensitive organ

[00:25:09] I hugely cleave to the idea that probably what we call Alzheimer's right now is going to be subtype in the future that we'll imagine it's like cancer right we're in 30 years hopefully the rate of growth has slowed that it's not you know a pandemic but yeah you might have five subtypes or something for that that's right you know and I think we will see that I think and then we will start to pattern match what features are I think the fact that sleep already let's just call outsider's disease this strange heterogeneous sort of mix right now that we feel uncomfortable about in terms of pinning one exact pathological ingredient as the causal trigger for that in fact I actually probably think Tao is if you look at the data I think the data are better on them in terms of predicting cognitive decline at least then amyloid is but the fact that you know we've now found that insufficient sleep will also lead to tower aggregation - I think it is concerning the morning but let's accept that this Alzheimer's thing this disease state is heterogeneous the fact that sleep and we can find such a strong predictive sleep signal in terms of that risk despite it being such a diffused gray matter ball itself the other disease must mean that the links between insufficient sleep and this heterogeneous thing are I think probably quite strong otherwise the dirtiness of the equation would be such that those associations would be far

[00:26:40] Rikka rather than stronger the fact that they're already present leads me to believe that when we do eventually subtype Alzheimer's disease we will then find that there are subsets of sleep features that are deterministic of those subsets of Alzheimer's so for example deep sleep will be predictive of one form of Alzheimer's sleep fragmentation which is more about sleep quality than it is about physiological quantity you know sleep fragmentation will be predictive of something else another sort of subtype of Alzheimer's disease then I think you know basic duration could matter I think there probably are four pillars of sleep there is probably regularity how consistent is your sleep schedule from are you undergoing what we call social jetlag which is where you're bouncing around you're going to sleep it you know 1 a.m. then 10 p.m. and all over the map so there's a sort of regularity there is the continuity of your sleep is it fragmented are you waking up many more times or is it just a nice one long shot that's a second feature I think the third feature is quantity how much sleep you getting and how much of the different stages of you get are you getting and then independent of how regular your sleep is how continuous your sleep is and the amount of the quantity the final is quality and quality is come big in the last five years in the sleep field in other words what is the electrical signature of your sleep and just because you're getting eight hours of sleep doesn't mean that you're getting eight hours of good electrical quality deep sleep and you know I hope that we get the chance to speak about sort of things like caffeine and alcohol other substances of abuse that can make you feel like you're sleeping eight hours but so quantity just fine quality poor so to come back to your question I love the way that you think about that problem and I agree with it very much that out sums disease is probably going to be a heterogeneous

[00:28:41] I think the pathology already points to that and its complexity the way that sleep plugs in to that heterogeneous disorder that we call Alzheimer's is also going to be heterogeneous in nature different sleep features will be predictive of different aspects of the amyloid pathology cascade and were we just submitted a paper which I'm gonna blow now in terms of media sort of outlet it hasn't been accepted yet but we just tried to ask the question across someone's lifespan if you bucket them into 10-year decades and you ask what was the quantity and quality of their sleep from their 30s and 40s 40s and 50s 50s and 60s so on and so forth and then at the end of their life you stick them in a brain scanner and you map how much amyloid is in the brain and how much towers in the brain which is what we can do here at the sleep center and then you essentially can in a retrospective manner say was sleep at certain times of life more critical in predicting how much amyloid you will have late in life so in other words are the certain decades during an adult's lifespan worse sleep is even more important for determining your how can you do that retrospectively so let's say you had this cohort of patients maybe at best you could through questionnaires infer duration but how would you be able to infer anything about depth or quality so depth we can't do but quality we can do so we've got a set of standardized questioners that have been essentially validated against gold standard what we call polysomnography which essentially is sleep laboratory grade recording with electrodes and what we find is that those questioners have good predictive validity relative to objective gold standard measures so it's a hop skip and a jump but you can say look these subjective questioners seemed to go pretty well hand-in-hand with sleep quantity and quality let's take those questioners and then let's ask of those patients what they were doing in terms of their sleep quantity and quality in those different bucket decades of their life and it has all of the problems that you can imagine because this seems like a slightly better version of a food frequency questionnaire which your peers would be relying on to do the same question so it's reliant on an individual you know it's got problems with history cuz you know the further you go back does that signal of accuracy degrade how big are the hazard ratios because I guess this is where one of those things where if sleep could account for 25% of this disease or if it if it increased their risk by say 25% would be a better way to say that it strikes me as unlikely that you could see that signal because that's not a big enough signal with all the noise you've just described but if you were talking about a hazard ratio of 6 or 7 or you know it's so funny today one of my kids asked me about smoking like why do people smoke and this I couldn't resist going down the Bradford Hill pathway of unfortunately he's four and a half but he got a probably about a 12-minute lecture on epidemiology and the hazard ratio of small cell lung cancer and smoking but the punchline in my story to him Peter attea ladies and gentlemen PETA I was trying to explain to him what it would mean to have a 14 X increase in risk which was basically what was observed in the first physician study of smoking and you know the point there is that is such a massive signal that I mean as you describe it I love whenever you can get these things that's statistics that are necessary when you don't need the p-value to figure it out that's it so does your intuition and if again I don't want you to scoop what's already in this paper so if you can't speak about it no problem but do you have a sense of that magnitude and therefore if even a crude backwards looking metric is directionally pointing you at something that you think wow this isn't a subtle change yeah I mean we're up in the region of you know from 0.45 2.6 so it's you know it's in risk reduction for those doing it correct okay yeah so it's substantial but what was interesting to me which gave me more confidence was that the windows of sleep sensitivity were now by the way across the entire lifespan though if you're getting less sleep at almost any point in the life span the risk that you're going to have higher amounts of these

[00:33:16] Alzheimer's disease proteins in your brain is greater that's what we find across the board but what's interesting is that when it comes to those two different proteins i'll amyloid and tau there are different decades that are predictive so if it's just one global subjective bias in your questioner that you shouldn't see that result so there is a sensitivity and specificity to these two different proteins that to me got me more excited that it transcended some of the limitations that are inherent in this approach and also the fact that for amyloid you get a very strong predictive signal you know 30s to 40s and then again sort of 60s to 70s and for tau it's actually somewhere in sort of the starts in the 50s to 60s and then goes through until the 80s so when I was a child years old so we actually we didn't go back in terms of challenges because at that point it's really difficult to feel confident about that data you'd have to get parents who are not living at that stage but to me I think the fact that you got these strange kind of and you describes bimodal distribution or a more varied Emily you know which then lends me to believe that that result is difficult to explain by sort of just general memory biases which would be kind of more of a linear approach but I don't I mean I think the point is that you know the evidence that continues to build in favor of this story that insufficient sleep is a significant lifestyle factor in your deterministic ratio odds of developing Alzheimer's disease is ever stronger now and the fact that unlike many of the other lifestyle factors the mechanism underlying it has now been demonstrated causally in humans and adults and it's been done so acutely within a 24-hour period of time that to me just knocked me sideways and the controls did not have so if you controlled for everything except the perturbation you didn't see the amyloid or tau rise and reign trolls yeah this is kind of interesting too because one of the reasons I've been a little less excited about amyloid there's two reasons one is what can only be I think described is just the abject failure of the pharmacologic approach to amyloid reduction at our last counting oh I don't want to miss being misquoted on this we'll include it in the shownotes what the actual number is but it's basically one amyloid antibody quasi success at disease stabilization to the tune of 2,000 failures that's one thing the second is the autopsy studies of people who died without any clinical evidence of Alzheimer's disease who still have amyloid making me wonder if amyloid is necessary but not sufficient and therefore what if there's something else going on and of course the third thing I would now add just based on thinking about it for two seconds so this might not be well thought out is in the next couple of hours we're going to talk about a whole bunch of other things that sleep does that are in and of themselves completely devastating to your health that also would feed into that for example the impact that negative sleep has on cardiovascular disease and it's become quite clear that if you're doing bad things to your heart you're doing bad things to your brain and of course we're going to talk about glucose disposal hyperinsulinemia and all those things which also have a clear impact so

[00:36:44] I think this would only strengthen the case that sleep deprivation is bad for you and bad for your brain it timmi makes it harder to tease out potentially the mechanistic links although there's no reason as you said that it can't be multifaceted yeah and I think there are certainly those conundrums where you see patients with non-trivial amounts of amyloid in the brain let's say at post mortem who are even only in the early stages of MCI of what we call mild cognitive impairment they haven't transitioned yet

[00:37:15] I'm glad you remember to explain these things because I'm nodding away like but that aside I think the idea that it's it's necessary maybe not sufficient but necessary if you truly don't want necessary in your life and if you're getting insufficient sleep you're placing and necessary there where it doesn't necessarily have to be no the analogy could be with lipoproteins you know there's a let's have a yeah right I mean lipoproteins are absolutely necessary but not sufficient for atherosclerosis and so some people say well there's no efficacy in reducing lipoproteins and I think part of it is its diffuse right you're only a tackling one of the four constitutive elements four things have to happen for you to get atherosclerosis the lipoproteins being one so that's actually an interesting idea and it's a great argument for why would you want something that's necessary but not sufficient there why would you decrease your odds yeah I mean you know think about it like this if your goal the two most feared diseases in developed nations right now I believe a cancer and

[00:38:17] Alzheimer's disease and I would say it's in the other order and yeah and I think outsize is is you know top of the list that do you want to de-risk the probability of Alzheimer's disease in your life if you truly don't want to invite right - you know this thing called out times disease and invite it in in the mail coming at you but you're getting you know less than seven hours of sleep a night you're not working in the direction that you wish you're going against Alzheimer's disease prevention and you're working well towards

[00:38:52] Alzheimer's invitation people will often say you know how much sleep do you get and now I say like I give myself a non-negotiable eight hours sleep opportunity and that's not because I'm trying to practice what I preach I don't want to be some poster child for sleep if you understood what I knew about sleep and all cause mortality as well as most disease processes you would realize that I am being nothing short of utterly selfish in my preservation of an eight hour sleep opportunity I don't want to die young and I don't want sickness and disease in my life my family for example has got a very strong history of cardiovascular disease and we know that deep sleep is probably the best form of blood pressure medication that you could ever wish for that would be an easier one to study I'm guessing we'll come to that later yeah the ability to herb deep sleep and then see the change in defense yeah I think the point is I think - people over the head with this sufficiently but the link between a lack of sleep and

[00:39:55] Alzheimer's now I think is very strong what I find though positive about that is without Symes disease just as you mentioned when comes to pharmacological approaches we just don't have anything that looks robust right now so medicine in many ways and especially for Alzheimer's disease has started to shift from a model of late stage treatment to early stage prevention and I think I feel comfortable saying that one of the best preventative actions that you can take on the basis of the science right now is start to capitalize on your sleep at night so let's shift gears just a little bit and go back to the Pali Somme let's explain to people because we're gonna eventually have to talk about tracking these things and I want to bring up some of the sort of commercially available ways that people do that which I think by definition are still not accurate enough for people to you know compare them to their Pali some but if I came into your lab tonight and I was willing to go to sleep there and you would hook me up to an EEG what are the different patterns of brainwaves and how would you morphologically describe them and then bucket them by these stages you've already sort of touched on a little bit as deep REM deep REM deep non REM etc yes so upon falling asleep human-beings and in fact all mammals will experience two different stages of sleep one of them is called non rapid eye movement sleep the other is rapid eye movement sleep non REM sleep has been further subdivided into four separate stages which are unimaginative Lee called stages one through four thank god I know yeah I think that's all that the sleep-deprived people who had you know experimenting could come up with at that time so increasing in their depth of steep sleep so stages three and four of non REM sleep are the really deep restorative stages of sleep stages one and two of the lightest stages of sleep and then on the other hand we have rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep which is named not after the popular Michael

[00:42:01] Stipe pop band but because of these bizarre horizontal shuttling eye movements that occur during this stage of sleep these rapid eye movements so you have these two different types of sleep and they will essentially as you fall asleep here in at the Sleep Center at Berkeley they will go into essentially a battle for brain domination throughout the night and that's cerebral war between non REM and

[00:42:27] REM is going to be won and lost every 90 minutes and then replayed every 90 minutes to create what we call a standard cycling architecture of sleep or what we call a hip negraph of sleep and so what you will see is that upon falling asleep you'll go into the light stages of non-rem stages before we do that let's say before I fall asleep when

[00:42:49] I'm just laying in the bed how would you describe my brainwaves under the wakeful condition so at that point what we typically see is that when you close your eyes the back of the brain goes into what's called an alpha rhythm so when you're awake your brain shows this remarkably frenetic high frequency electrical activity in other words your brain is going in terms of its brainwaves it's going up and down many many times a second and isn't any amplitude and the amplitude is very small which kind of is paradoxical you think if I'm awake then my brain is active and so the size of those brain waves should be big it's not it's actually very small and here's the reason different parts of your brain are doing different things at different times so those brain waves sort of are all cancelling each other out so the analogy would be if I were to dangle a microphone above a sports stadium what

[00:43:47] I'm picking up is the signal from the the crowd of a hundred thousand individual neurons that sit underneath it that's how an EEG electrode is now before the game starts that's wakefulness and at that point the hundred thousand people in the stadium 1,000 brain cells they're all speaking to each other at different moments in time so there's a lot of cancellation there's a lot of cancellation they're not all coordinated but it's very fast and frenetic so I just get this signal that is very D synchronized and it's not synchronous so they're not summing their power together so the size of that brainwave is not very big but the frequency hello hi the frequency is high meaning that yoke sort of going up and down maybe 50 60 times per second now as you start to fall asleep or actually even before you start to fall sleep as you're lying in bed awake the back of the brain is the first part of the brain that really starts to settle down it goes into what we call alpha rhythm when you close your eyes and I assume that's just because the occipital cortex is in the back and you've closed your eyes brilliant so the back of the brain visual brain if you close your eyes that part of the brain essentially stops processing the outside world and it goes into it's sort of default state when it's a wake of slowed frequency it drops down from maybe 50 times per second down to about let's say 10 cycles per second but still relatively low amplitude it's still relatively low amplitude then once you start to actually transition when you make that bridge from the world of wakefulness to sleep as you sort of cross through that window from one of those worlds to the next something bizarre happens and if anyone out there is lucky enough to be listening to this and they have a bed partner you can actually see this just look at their eyelids as they're falling asleep and what you'll see is that their eyeballs start to roll in their sockets and they're called slow rolling eye movements now we don't know why the eyes roll in their sockets like that but it's the first sign that you're making the transition from the world of wakefulness into sleep we use it as almost an indicator of the transition into sleep now by the way if your partner wakes up sometimes Kuwait will wake up from that state and they see you just looking over them in bed staring at their eyelids if you're in early in a relationship that's usually the end of the relationship it's just a point of note please don't blame me usually wait till you're married and then stuff everyone the divorce usually is harder to come by so then you start to go down into the light stages of non REM sleep stages one and two then after about 20 or so minutes you'll go down deep into stages 3 and 4 and I mean 1 and 2 have we transitioned out of that alpha wave I mean yes we start to see the erratic Thetas and theta already happening in stage one in stage two you actually go into theta activity which is now down from fifty cycles per second maybe down to just sort of six or seven cycles per second and the amplitudes getting a bit bigger is getting a bit bigger yeah and then every now and again during stage two the way that I know that you're in this lighter stage of non

[00:47:11] REM sleep stage two is that you'll get these synchronous bursts of electrical activity that we call sleep spindles that's the case bender and that sort of yeah where you get this actually you get a nice big slow wave or like almost like a single slow wave and then you get this burst of a sleep spindle and we actually did this great project here at the Sleep

[00:47:31] Center where we did the sonification of sleep and we we extracted brain waves from human beings and then we sort of you know smooth them a little bit with some sort of audio software and then you can play them back and it's beautiful because when you hear these sleep spindles they are these short synchronous bursts of electrical activity that lasts for about a second and a half and they go up to about ten or fifteen cycles per second so it's almost like that beautiful rolling are in sort of in the Hindi language you know sort of like a cat pairing so so you get these big slow waves and then you get this ripple of a spindle and when you hear it on the speakers it's just sensational you get this Shh you know it's every time I hear it I mean this is spine-tingling stuff when you realize this is going on right now physiologically in someone's brain and then from there you start to go down to the really deep stages of non REM sleep stages three and four and at that point the brain goes into this incredible synchronous mantra chant of these slow waves so the brain waves slow down you go down to maybe just one or two cycles per second very very slow brainwave activity but the size of those waves crashing on the beach of the cortex as it were they are huge and the reason is this go back to the sports stadium analogy let's say that we're here at Berkeley and were playing Stanford arch-rivals which hopefully you're gonna kick their butt fingers crossed make sure there's no band anywhere to be found it is a terrible to serve but at that point they're chanting in unison chanting so it's louder but they're now making the same sound together and you can actually hear what's being said exactly so now in that single microphone you can hear

[00:49:33] Stanford sucks mm who's Stanford sucks so all of a sudden all of for reasons that we are only now starting to understand the brain coordinates hundreds of thousands of neurons unlike it does at any moment elsewhere in the 24-hour period hundreds of thousands of brain cells all decide to join hands as it were physiologically metaphorically and they all fire together and then they all go silent they all fire together and then they all go silent and what I find amazing about that by the way is how slow that frequency is you're basically you could be this could be only happening once a second right that's right and that's why it got a terrible rap for 20 or 30 years because it actually looked not dissimilar to some aspects of coma that's how slow those brain waves were so sleep scientists were you know understandably fooled into thinking that deep sleep was a time when the brain essentially was just doing nothing now we realized the exact opposite is true because it's during that deep sleep that you get essentially information transfer within the brain it's a file transfer mechanism and the way to think about this is let's see it's like a long wave radio if you're in the city you tune in to FM which is shortwave radio you can pick up a bunch of signals then the further you drive out into the desert let's say here in California you just lose those channels because then range from the tower is so short that you just lose that range but if you go on to sort of you know the long wave radio stations you can still pick up stations for hundreds of miles why because the carrier frequency of those radio waves is much slower and so the distance over which you can transfer information is much further deep sleep is a brain state of long distance information transfer is their morphologically a difference that you can see between stages 3 & 4 which are obviously both delta waves but how do you distinguish those two technically no the way it's defined is that what proportion of a 30 second period of time and that's the way that we score sleep

[00:51:50] I'll have you sleep for 8 hours then I'll chop up that 8 hours into thirty-second bits of information and for each 30 seconds you'll get a sleep score and then we add them all up and what differentiates stage 3 of deep non REM sleep from the very deepest sage which is stage 4 non REM sleep is simply what proportion of that 30 seconds is consumed by that deep slow brainwave activity if it's sort of less than 50% then it's stage 3 if it's more than 50% stage 4 so morphologically no although if you really look at it morphologically on average yes the waves are typically larger in amplitude and slower in frequency in stage 4 than they are in stage 3 and do people always progress monotonically through these or do sometimes people go 1 2 4 3 REM for example no you will have to go through 3 to get to 4 you have to go to 3 to get to 4 you have to go from 2 to get to 3 to get to 4 with the exception of probably let's see two examples one is pathological if you suffer from narcolepsy one of the things that typically happens is that you go from being awake straight into REM sleep so to sort of finish the 90-minute cycle and this will make sense you go sort of stage 1 to stage 2 stage 2 3 3 4 then after out 70 minutes you'll rise back up into stage 2 and then finally you'll pop up into REM sleep and then you'll have a short REM sleep period and then you'll go back down again down into non REM sleep up into REM down into non REM sleep up into REM and you do that as I said every 90 minutes however what changes is the ratio of non-rem to REM within that 90-minute period as you move across the night such that in the first half of the night the majority of your 90-minute sleep cycles are comprised of lots of deep non REM sleep and very little REM sleep but as you push through to the second half of the night now the seesaw balance changes and the majority of those sleep cycles are comprised much more of rapid eye movement sleep and almost no deep sleep and that's why it's always dangerous when people say you know I'm one of those who survives on you know six six and a half hours of sleep at night I wake up you know five five thirty to get a jumpstart on the day and you can ask well let's say you're getting six hours of sleep how much sleep are you losing and they will say well according to your definition of eight hours of sleep well I'm 25% off because I'm getting I lose two hours at the end of an eight-hour night of sleep so I'm sleeping 75% I'm losing 25% yes and no because yes it is proportionate exactly so yes you're losing 25% of total sleep but you could be losing up to 70% of all of your REM sleep because it's the REM sleep rich phase that you are shortchanging to get a jump start on the day so you've got to be very careful when you try to think of your sleep dynamics but to come back to your point sorry yes you always have to go through that linear progression narcolepsy is a standout case there you'll usually go from wakefulness sometimes immediately into REM sleep very frightening because people don't experience you know logical rational waking consciousness and then go immediately into irrational hallucinogenic consciousness which is what REM sleep is it's very disturbing when you speak to these patients the other is if you are horrific ly REM sleep deprived or chronically sleep-deprived occasionally you can make the transition straight into REM sleep we see this in people who are abusing alcohol heavily who are alcoholics alcohol and will come onto this blocks your REM sleep you can build up such a hunger for REM sleep that the brain says well tonight I'm gonna forego the non REM sleep I'm just gonna go and feast on REM sleep straight away there's hysteresis in the system maladaptive ly so that's a bad sign when you get hysteresis like that that type of pressure does this explain and maybe this is not even really correct but but you could see that someone who's constitutively sleeping six hours a night would suffer perhaps fewer of the memory consolidation issues because they're still getting much of their deeper sleep earlier in the evening presumably where that hippocampal consolidation takes place and the lack of REMS manifestations are just harder to see like it does that partially explain any of that or is that is that even accurate it turns out that different types of memory rely on different stages of sleep at different times of night so what we found is that you need sleep after learning to essentially hit the Save button on new memories so that you don't forget and for that it's all about deep non REM sleep so as long as you were getting let's say the first you know half of the night the first five hours then it's likely that you may have been able to protect those memories but here's the other problem that stage two non REM sleep which actually happens most in the second half of the night in the second half of the night you're having either

[00:57:09] REM sleep or stage two and in fact if you look at those sleep spindles they exponentially increase towards the end of the night so you get most of your sleep spindle rich sleep in the last two hours of the night the reason that's important is because you not only need sleep after learning to consolidate to save those memories you also need sleep before learning to get your brain ready in preparation to actually lay down new memories and they're it's stage two non

[00:57:40] REM sleep and these spindles so what we've discovered is that the more of those sleep spindles that you have the greater route fresh of your memory encoding ability to so think about it like yes and this is a very beautiful experimental demonstration because you can surgically deprive people of each of those and I've seen other talks you've given of course and in your book you touch on this where you could preferentially from an experimental standpoint prevent somebody from consolidating memory and you could similarly prevent them from forming new memory even though we keep the total amount of sleepy existence so it's not a stress or it's not that wakefulness it's you can selectively excise just like you said individual stages of sleep what's the biggest detriment that person's face clinically with the reduction of REM I think right now based on the weight of the evidence it probably starts with mental health anything from depression anxiety through to disease anxiety depression and then suicidality I think one of the most striking things that we've been seeing in our hands and other people have demonstrated to them this is a probably the second of the big area of work that we do here at the sleep center is sleep and mental health you know sleep is emotional first aid bottom-line period and what you find is that in young teenagers one of the strongest predictors of firstly suicidal ideation in other words thoughts of taking their own life strongest predictors of suicide attempts and tragically a very strong predictor of suicide completion is insufficient sleep and sleep fragmentation and what we've been finding is that it's REM sleep that seems to provide essentially a form of overnight therapy and it's REM sleep that resets or recalibrates the emotional networks in the brain and there's a series there's a network of them that involves an area called the prefrontal cortex and particularly the middle part of the prefrontal cortex which acts like a top-down regulator of your emotions so this deep emotional brain centers centers like the amygdala which is a center piece region for the generation of strong impulsive aversive negative reactions anyone with a young boy knows what the amygdala does exactly if they have a temper tantrum in the middle of you know the supermarket because firstly their prefrontal cortex you know has just not yet and what little of it that there is if they haven't slept well is obliterated that's actually a really great example of one of the most obvious observations like we we taught you know I mean any any parent listening to this knows how emphatically you protect the nap correct you know and it's like mental for emotional verbal yeah just for behavioral health of the child right right and it's sort of like your day revolves around the nap like can you go to Disneyland today I don't know it depends if we get the nap schedule and you know yes or no and what you're basically providing is a technical explanation for something that is so important I believe me for a moment when it comes to the broader mental health stuff you could easily construct an argument that says the arrow of causality is the other way the person who is anxious it's the anxiety that's keeping them awake now my guess is in reality these two feed off each other constantly I so your apps that you're right you might be predisposed to anxiety that Foster's lack of sleep the lack of sleep amplifies and boo boo boo it's a two-way street but is the traffic flowing more dominantly in one direction than the other I think this is what your point you're gonna make but then the behavior of a four-year-old is a perfect example of you only need to screw that up one night you give a four-year-old one bad night or miss one nap I mean it's very obvious how that translates into the behavior so that would point in the direction of the sleep can really be the driver of the pathology if you want to use pathology to describe that which of course is a strong term to describe you know outbursts of four-year-olds but but just to make the point right that's it that that to me is one of the most interesting albeit somewhat glib examples but I think it's so consistent you know and I use that frequently where you often see a parent with a child and the child is crying and they look at you and they say well they just didn't sleep well oscillate as if there's this universal parental knowledge that bad sleep the night before equals bad mood and emotional reactivity the next day and what's striking is that if you look at the data somewhere between infancy and even childhood not only do we abandon the notion that sleep is absolutely essential and non-negotiable but we start to stigmatize it with this label of laziness that you're slothful or that your child is slothful for getting sufficient sleep and the reason that upsets me and I am getting a little bit getting a little bit animated which is all for a British man but the you know the reason I I do is because firstly you know it took Mother Nature three point six million years to put this 8-hour thing called a night of sleep in place and within the space of seventy years if you look at the data we've locked off almost twenty to twenty-five percent of that you know imagine coming along and saying you know in the next hundred years I think what I'm going to do is for the entirety of human society I'm going to reduce their oxygen saturation by about twenty to twenty five percent do you think that's a good idea no it's such a great example I'll pause for a moment just to tell a funny story that you you and I have talked about off mic which is up until about 2012 I was in the I'll sleep when I'm dead camp and

[01:03:28] I know what led to that it wasn't that there was a very deliberate decision at the end of medical school when a good friend of mine with all the best intentions who was a year ahead of me so he was now in at the end of his internship as I was about to begin mine he said and this is in the days when we didn't have the 80 hour work week requirement in residency so we averaged

[01:03:52] I think about a hundred and fourteen hours a week in the hospital so he said to me look Peter you're you're signing up for you know whatever five seven years of this thing if you spent every moment outside of the hospital sleeping you would still be tired and when difference is you wouldn't have any fun so make sure you live every moment that you're not in the hospital to the fullest and so for me that basically meant if I was in the hospital I was swimming I was going out with my friends

[01:04:22] I was trying to meet girls like and I was doing anything everything such that during that period of my life I I do no because I was pretty adamant about recording how much time like I was very wed to this idea there's 168 hours in a week if I'm spending you know 114 of them here and I spend this many driving and I spend this many getting groceries and I spend this many swimming and bubble blah I think I was about 28 hours a week of sleep so it wasn't for every night because you'd have none and then six and then three and then eight like you could binge sleep from time to time but it was pretty much 28 a week I'll come back to some of the implications of that but fast forward a few years I'm talking to a good friend of mine Kirk parsley who's a physician who like you is adamant about you know the importance of sleep then we're having dinner one night and he says he's challenging me on this and he says so let me get this straight you've just decided that you're gonna sleep half of what is evolutionarily programmed and I said yeah because does it strike you as odd that evolution would have designed us to spend a third of our life not mating not watching out for predators not hunting for food but doing this thing for some other purpose do you think that thing must have been important and it was such an obvious argument but it really overnight changed the way I thought about this which was evolution went to great lengths to do this and superficially at great cost to us right I mean you could argue what imagine you didn't need to sleep and you could spend 24 hours a day foraging for food or a mate or some other thing but it didn't so it's sort of it's sort of like there's probably a reason we are not anaerobic to your point about reducing oxygen saturation by 25% you know if you were to think about that you know during sleep just as you said you're not eating you're not finding food you know finding a mate you're not reproducing you're not caring for you young you're vulnerable to predation on any one of those grounds but especially all of them put together as a collective completely anti evolutionary it sounds like the dumbest thing and you know often said and it has been said before if sleep doesn't serve an absolutely vital set of functions it's the biggest mistake that the evolutionary process has ever made and we now realize from this constellation of evidence that mother nature did not make a spectacular blunder in putting this thing called an eight-hour sort of need of sleep in place it is the greatest life support system that you could ever wish for it is a remarkable health insurance policy and what's great is that it's largely democratic it's mostly free and in terms of a prescription from a doctor it's largely painless so I almost wanted to title the book consciousness is overrated or just sometimes dark consciousness is overrated but when you really look at the evidence in terms of risk de-risking just about every disease that is killing us in the developed world it's very hard to look no further than sleep and that's why I don't want to trivialize diet and I don't want to trivialize movement and activity but what I would say is that if you want to put sleep up against either one of those two and kind of play the whole head-to-head game which I don't think we need to do here I would simply say that sleep is the foundation on which those two of the things sit it's not the third pillar of good health I think it is the foundation that's a really interesting way to think about it because I typically describe four pillars or five if you include all of the exogenous molecules that you could lump together but another way to think about it which again I don't think is necessarily the right way to think about it but sometimes it makes the point if you deprive yourself of food how long can you survive well we have one person up to 382 days even someone who's as lean as you could survive 30 days with no food how long could you survive without water depends greatly on the temperature etc but you could make the case the deprivation of sleep would result in the quickest reduction of health certainly more than not eating or not exercising for you know a period of time and those studies have been done and yes and actually we know some of this from humans who have been trying to in fact didn't the Guinness Book of World

[01:08:51] Records I came over if I read this in your work they've actually ban attempts at longest period of sleep deprivation so I mentioned this yeah yeah yeah when you could still try and beat the world record of sleep deprivation and it got up to about sort of I think the last true effort was about 24 days oh but I think it was debatable that one but based on the weight of the scientific data the relationship with between sleep loss and mental health sleep loss and cancer sleep loss cardiovascular disease sleep loss and metabolic syndrome guinness started to feel very very uncomfortable and then when suicide came on the table it pulled it so in other words think about this you know there was a gentleman Felix Baumgartner I think his name was who sponsored by Red Bull went up in a capsule in a hot air balloon to the outer surface of our planet this was about four years or years ago remarkable he opened the door and then he jumped out and he fell back down to earth at over a thousand kilometers an hour using his body alone he broke the sound barrier and he successfully came back and now Guinness says for that just fine however to sleep deprived yourself know much more unsafe right we're not going to let it happen you are allowed just to put it in your context you're allowed up to twelve jumps off Niagara Falls basically but that's actually but no no you're not gonna that's such a great point I want to go back to one other thing to close the loop on this and again I the listener may say boy this is where there's a lot of stuff going on here but but there really is like this is I think you have to have a lot and

[01:10:37] I'm trying to think about all the questions I can ask that others would have if you took two individuals who are sleeping six hours a night if you have one person who just for the argument's sake is doing it from 9:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. and another person is doing it from midnight to 6 a.m. would you expect or even if it were that let's make it even more clear it's the same individual but you do it over a period of weeks you transition them from 9 to 3 versus midnight to 6 would their sleep wave cycles look the same would they still be truncating the same amount of REM at the tail end of that or would they start to do some forward truncation forward truncation so essentially what happens is that your brain has a different hunger or different appetite for different types of sleep so think of those different stages of sleep like a finger buffet and at different times of the night that buffet is going to be sort of you know consumed more heavily in terms of you know the deep non REM sleep phase which would probably be the hours from 9:00 p.m. through until about sort of 3:00 a.m. and that's really that the window of preferential appetite for your brain when it comes to deep non REM sleep that's when it will preferentially eat at that type of sleep but then from about 3:00 a.m. through until about midday then the brain shifts in terms of its pattern if you let people just sleep it out you know if you look at sort of extreme owls who and we should speak about Krone types at some point but people who you know like to go to bed very late and wake up very late essentially there then the buffet is gonna get hit hard in terms of REM sleep devouring so I make that point that your brain has different taste sensitivities to non REM and REM across the 24-hour clock face because it means that if you're short changing your sleep by two hours but you're doing it by going to bed very early and waking up very early then what's going to happen is that you're probably going to be losing most of your REM sleep because most of your

[01:12:41] REM sleep happens in the late morning hours and you're already awake by 3 or 4 a.m. in the morning and so you're not getting the chance to get into those REM sleep rich phases and which of those patients would develop more appetite for sleep the subsequent evening the person who is deprived and you know why I'm asking by the way it's exactly what we were talking about earlier it's this jetlag question right if you know you've got that flight and you need to force yourself to sleep at a time zone that's not right I'm just now thinking about well I always do the 9:00 to 3:00 right would I be better off doing that in other words I'm depriving myself of REM what I'd be better off just striving just well pretty much depriving yourself of rent but you're also still depriving yourself of total sleep as well you know when it's like modeling and you know there are there's some I think that that's an interesting model and I think it does work that you can try to in the week before you start to fly let's say you're going I'm going home to London which essentially is eight hours ahead so I need to now essentially start to sort of by the time

[01:13:47] I'm waking up people in London have already been awake for it essentially eight hours so I need to start to get myself on the schedule so I start to wake up you know ten minutes earlier for about five days before and you know so I'm only about an hour shift in but it helps and then the morning of the flight

[01:14:05] I'll wake up really early and then I won't the make the mistake that everyone makes on those transatlantic flights which is they sleep in the second half of the flight you shouldn't do that you should sleep in the first half of the flight which is when most people in the UK are asleep and by the middle of that flight most people in the UK that's their time to wake up and so you should be waking up that time so that you build up enough of this sleepiness pressure by the time that you want to get to bed once you've landed that evening in

[01:14:40] London and this won't make too much sense right now and I think will will speak probably a lot more about this when we speak about caffeine and adenosine Russia but that but to come to your point you're building up what's called sleep pressure the longer that you're awake the more of that's healthy sleepiness that builds up but to come back to the real question at hand yes just because you sleep you know five hours from one point in the clock face maybe earlier in the night sort of early in the morning versus five hours late in the morning until later in that that day the type of sleep that you get will not be the same you will be selectively shortchanging yourself of sleep either of deep sleep or of REM sleep on either side of that equation this points out another interesting observation which I do want to spend some time talking about wearables be as of course you know we're both wearing our wearables at the moment and I think we both acknowledge that look I mean these things are still not quite at the level of the poly some and maybe they never will be I mean that's a very difficult thing to replicate from you know something on your wrist or your finger but it's so funny this might explain an observation I always experience when I come from New York back to California which is I generally try to stay on California time even when

[01:16:00] I'm in New York going to bed later waking up later and in California I'm a very early sleeper in an early Rizer so even if I'm trying to keep it at 8 hours and 8 hours and I can do that very well in California not as well in New York my first night back even my first two nights back in California I have much higher deep sleep and that would explain it it's this phase shift that

[01:16:22] I'm capturing this I mean last night was because I came back from New York last night you know went to bed it I don't know 8:30 p.m. and got up at 5:00 or yeah probably 4:30 or 5:00 in the morning so you but had it beeps lease oh you've dragged your eight-hour window if you think about the sort of eight hour window and you slide it back on the clock face from midnight to 11:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. it's in fact 9:00 p.m. you're dragging that eight-hour sleep phase back closer into the deeper sleep rich phase the deep non REM sleep that you want so what you're sort of aura ring will be telling you is you got more deep sleep and perhaps you may actually see a little bit of a reduction in in

[01:17:08] REM sleep there as you go to New York you may see the opposite as you sleep later in the morning you'll get I generally do pattern which is I get and it you know it pisses me off too I'm like I didn't get as much deep sleep and I got more REM sleep and not that REM is bad but I'm generally more upset by the dearth of deep you know this is interesting it's now really I rule I really need to think about that because of course on some level our body is responding to cues in the environment it's not just responding to the intellectual knowledge that hay in

[01:17:36] California it's this time it's time to go to bed it's I mean light is playing a role meal timing is playing a role huge meal and yes I went where I want to definitely talk with you about this because this is to me is such an important topic and then of course the accumulation of adenosine and of course the melatonin soaps oh by the way I would just say that you know I think REM sleep some people I have this kind of bimodal distribution of questions some people will say how do I maximize my REM sleep and I say why do you want to maximize your REM sleep let's say well let's dream sleep and that's the good stuff right as if you know it's like saying you know how do I maximize the amount of yolk in my egg you know do I get like vo can I go the ostrich egg whatever it is

[01:18:17] I don't know what the analogy is and the question is Mother Nature's found this equilibrium don't mess with it it's the da vinci code of sleep and stick to it you're good to go but also then other people will say you know how do I get more deep sleep or you know I you know who get upset by that lack of deep sleep to come back on to REM sleep and how important it is the studies have been done well firstly they deprived and by the way these studies have never been done again since the 1980s and they probably never will be because of the ethics regarding them because they are just so devastating that we probably won't be allowed rightly so I think to do these studies to animals ever again but they essentially deprived animals of sleep until they died and what they found was that rats will firstly die as quickly if not quicker than almost by about 20 percent from total sleep deprivation as they will from total food deprivation so if you want to put sleep that's interesting that their gap is much narrower because for humans the gap is is very well you'll die way earlier from sleep deprivation than food deprivation unless you're you know the leanest person on the planet and there is a tragic disorder that I described a little bit in the book it's a very radically inherited disorder called fatal familial insomnia and it's really the only evidence short of the disgusting travesty that is total sleep deprivation used in certain countries for interrogation tactics that we know of that has led to death but withstanding that this disorder fatal familial insomnia says it in the name that essentially human beings how older people typically survive it usually takes about 18 to 24 months before they die but the problem is this is not they wake up one day and they are no longer sleep at all there's a gradual thing so it's kind of like it masquerades is just typical insomnia first restless nights for the first two or three months then it gets worse then you're only sleeping for hours then you know by 12:00 you're really sleeping two hours how much of this is genetic versus environmental versus we don't know it's strongly heritable that we know so it's within the Mendelian sort of you know pool of genetic disorders and it's testable we know the gene interestingly it what seems like it's a single yeah and it's a prion protein gene abnormality which is if you don't know about prion proteins you may have heard of mad cow disease which was rife in the

[01:20:49] United Kingdom that's another thing that's another prion protein disorder that's why you can't donate blood and it's also why yeah I'll probably forget half of what I've been saying and start repeating myself because I've been vegetarian for about twelve years but before I went that route I think I definitely was in the phase of eating beef when it was filled with these four rounds in the United Kingdom so my brain is probably Swiss cheese at this stage but essentially this disorder fatal familial insomnia it gives us some degree of disease proof that insufficient sleep is fatal for human beings but we knew it in these rat studies because these rats would die as quickly from food deprivation as they did from sleep deprivation but the most striking thing was then mated a second round of studies they selectively deprived them of either just non-rapid eye movement sleep or rapid eye movement sleep and what they found is that the rats were dead within about nine to ten days with total sleep deprivation they were dead within just about the same period of time from REM sleep deprivation duration was kept constant or also reduced it was still reduced somewhat but you could probably look at a control that had a same duration without a selectable yeah and there is a what's called a yolked paradigm it's a very clever technique where you can mimic the total amount of sleep deprivation in one other animal but the other animal is still getting the chance to get REM sleep

[01:22:15] REM sleep selectively removed the rats diet basically almost as quickly as they did from total sleep deprivation and then non REM sleep deprivation was deathly ultimately it just took longer it took about twenty days total sleep deprivation let's just say for argument's sake you die in nine days sleep reduction but selective REM deprivation you die in the same period of time basically a sleep reduction but deep deprivation you live maybe twice as long yeah so everything definitely everything fatal just that one takes a little bit longer to kill you than the other and what I find either strange or exciting about that is if you look from an evolutionary standpoint those two types of sleep did not emerge at the same time we only have observed true rapid eye movement sleep in birds and mammals we don't see true rapid eye movement sleep in reptiles amphibians fish or insects now birds and mammals evolved separately along the evolutionary path from amphibians fish and reptiles so what this means is that when we went from the transition from being reptilian to either avian or mammalian that's when REM sleep emerged because we see non REM sleep in every species even in insects we can observe something that looks like non REM sleep in reptiles fish and fibia 'ns birds and mammals every one of them has non REM sleep not every one of them has ramps the only birds and mammals have REM sleep in other words REM sleep is the new kid on the block in the time course of evolution REM sleep firstly emerged later in the course of evolution and secondly what's kind of wonderful is it emerged twice independently once in births and once in mammals so you could argue that well if deep non REM sleep which is much more evolutionary from an evolutionary perspective it's in much older form of sleep wouldn't it be the much more necessary fundamental one and therefore wouldn't dice una no see it's easy it seems the opposite because you'd say well for the same reason that the cockroach can survive the nuclear disaster the avian mammalian pathway is more evolved neuronal e presumably and therefore probably requires something essential in rem that when it deprives you it takes away your super power which is a cortex and I think that's exactly what it is which is when you look at anything that has essentially a complex nervous system maybe that's where the pressure for this thing called REM sleep emerged even though we know that non REM sleep actually supports many essential central nervous system functions like synaptic pruning and some great sort of neural thing you know the glymphatic system clearing up it's sort of similar to your oxygen analogy which is you when you go from being an anaerobe to a faculty vana robe to an a robe who's going to be most sensitive to oxygen the implication exactly and so you know it's always a dangerous scientific hypothesis where you can argue it both ways but I always found that interesting and it's uncommon today but I just wanted to note that for you know 20 minutes ago in kind of in defense of REM sleep that you know if we should all be worried about the amount of deep sleep that we're getting absolutely but we also need to be worried about how much REM sleep that we're getting because from a pure mortality risk standpoint REM sleep is arguably even more important than and we'll come to this later but my recollection of the literature is and I think you even alluded to this earlier ethanol x' biggest hit is gonna be on

[01:26:04] REM isn't it hands down this is where we come on to substances that are misunderstood and misused when it comes to sleep now before we go there mat look for me I don't need any more of a case in the importance of sleep and I think honestly the Alzheimer's thing alone should be sufficient for anyone to take this seriously because certainly my patients that's the single most important thing to them now there are some of them that are more high-risk you know people that have you know a Polly for genotype that's in the you know the direction that would increase risk or family history but I don't think I've met a patient yet who doesn't say on some level preserving cognition is their single highest priority in life that said can you spend even just a minute a couple of minutes it's the drive after all we have all the time in the world making the case the similar case in the presence of cardiovascular disease and cancer yeah and I want to touch on that point before we go on about this Alzheimer's disease risk you know a lot of people out there may be having this sort of like sleek machismo moment where they have this braggadocio attitude of getting insufficient sleep and they say look I'm in my 50s and you know I'm fit as a fiddle and my cognition is razor sharp and I sleep five or six hours a night so we've got you know heads of state for example who are saying there's people who you know have a huge impact on the public and they're saying these things and it makes me sad because you can look at two other heads of state who were very vociferous about their proclamation of the uselessness of sleep Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan both of them were chess beaters when it came to insufficient sleep they were very proud of saying that they only got four or five hours of sleep that they were immune to the effects of insufficient sleep that sleep was for the week and that you can sleep when you're dead which PS is mortally unwise advice based on the evidence the shorter your sleep the shorter your life that's what all of the studies tell us I don't think it's coincidental now looking back that both of them went on to develop Alzheimer's disease and it makes me so sad because I saw pictures of Margaret Thatcher in an enfeebled state of dementia and I'm just thinking you know if only when she was you know in her 50s and had that bravado about sleep if she could see herself in that bed in that later state of life in such a crippled mental cognitive functioning state would you be so brave about it and I would hope that she wouldn't that humility would come into place so that's the first thing about I think the insufficient sleep argument and people rightly being frightened having the Daylights friend out of them about preserved cognition you should have that regarding your sleep the other one though that frightens me too is the other way that a lack of sleep can get you is not chronically across the lifespan without Simas disease but acutely with car crashes and I know that will come on to this at at some point too but the only thing I would say is that I get many emails from people who've read the book and two months ago

[01:29:18] I got an email from a gentleman I won't name him and he was in his late 30s and he described how three months before that he had lost his wife and his 18 month 18 month old child in a car crash and it later became apparent that the person who hit them had basically been surviving on about five and a half hours of sleep for the two months prior that they had had what's called a micro sleep they actually lost control of their car at 60 miles an hour at a moderate drift angle you are essentially in the next

[01:29:56] Lane within less than a second and you're in the ditch after a second and they went straight head-on and now he was going to have to raise his four-year-old son by himself without the wife that he loved without the 18-month daughter that they'd invested in because someone perhaps had heard from someone vocally in the public that surviving on five hours of sleep was something that was okay to do and to me that just breaks my heart like I just don't feel comfortable in you know having the responsibility like the head of a state of a country and then speaking about this thing this kind of magic attitude of insufficient sleep because that's what it can lead to it can lead to the travesty of the explosion of a nuclear family and my guess is even though it's going to be very difficult to actually quantify this I believe that the story you just shared is an especially tragic poignant example of something that probably occurs much more than we were able to quantify I sometimes say to pay patience you know the four horsemen of death would be these big chronic diseases that kill us but but we can never forget accidental death and then when you look at accidental death how do you quantify it well it turns out that three forms of accidental death form 80% of them and the biggest among them is motor vehicle right and so the question is what can you do to reduce that risk so if you look at it some form of distraction and I've included sleep deprivation in that but now I almost feel like they need to be separated out distraction meaning your putts in with your phone your check in ways you're you doing something you shouldn't be doing with your phone sleep deprivation ethanol failure to wear a seatbelt and reckless driving I mean that basically accounts for it it wouldn't surprise me if that's that sleep deprivation bucket is bigger than we think I mean we've got some decent data on this and firstly what we know is in the hour that we've been talking already numerous people have lost their life in a drowsy driving related accident based on the statistics we know that already and the way that we can tell that is both from speaking to the people who are involved in the accident but you can also pick this apart from the dynamics of the accident as well and here's the problem when you are underslept that we're not talking about a night of total sleep deprivation that's where you fall asleep at the wheel and that's the obvious one the much less obvious one but the much more common one is what we call microsleeps so when you are trying to survive on seven hours of sleep or six hours of sleep then it really just takes that little of a dose by the way I haven't forgotten our cardiovascular question I will come back to it but what you essentially have are these small lapses we call them micro sleeps where the eyelid will partially close and you can pick this up on a camera and they've done these studies systematically where you dose people from getting nine hours of sleep to eight hours of sleep seven six five four three four one week two weeks three weeks these studies have been essentially looked at sliced and diced parametrically that probe the best that he's done within the field of sleep and so we know them very well what your lapse rate is what your micro sleep rate is and what you find is that the eyelid partially closes and at that point you no longer react and the reason

[01:33:42] I'm bringing this point up is that drowsy driving accounts for more accidents on our roads than either drugs or alcohol combined combined now I'm not condoning drink driving or driving and II created under any circumstance what I am saying however is that first the drowsy driving is a huge part of this problem on our roads and the reason that it's not just problematic is because it's usually much more deathly when you are drunk you typically react but you react too late so you do something but it's not enough and you crash when you have a micro sleep yeah it's a project you do nothing that's why drowsy driving is more fatal than drunk driving typically is because there is no smell appreciation a break there is no application of brake there's no course correction of steering wheel angle there is nothing there is simply a car with no one in control and it's a two-ton missile on the freeway at 65 miles an hour with no one in charge this is why I feel really uncomfortable about the idea of public proclamations of insufficient sleep and I get that and you know there are people sports stars pee all sorts of people who I respect hugely and and I have an immense amount of sympathy for where they're coming from because I think there's a lot of public pressure to be this outspoken I'm gonna be crushing it on the sports field and then

[01:35:20] I'm going to be you know back in the gym the next morning and sleep is for you know XY and said who cares but then you get someone in a car and you hear a story like that and I can't help but just have my heart broken but I think you know Matt your work has come along at a really interesting point I have to be honest with you I remember when your book came out and my initial thought was does the world need another sleep book because there's 2,000 of them out there and I think there's two things that are different the first is your book is exceptional I should say three things your book is exceptional the third is your understanding of the topic and your credibility is exceptional and those aren't necessarily synonymous you can have really credible thoughtful people who write a book but the book itself isn't exceptional or it doesn't hit the tone and some and conversely you can have someone who puts together a good book but they themselves don't have the credibility I think that so you can take credit for the first two I think the third is is the little bit of luck which is I think we are at a point in time where people are ready to hear this in other words if you the exact same professor wrote the exact same book 20 years ago I'm not convinced it would have the same impact it is having today now I don't know you probably have a better sense than me I don't know exactly what accounts for that difference today is it that today we are more interested in you know the thin end of the wedge for this might have been our interest in performance maybe that is the thing that first got people to think about this which is well wait a minute you know if I want to be better at X Y & Z whether it be my sport my craft my whatever is sleep a tool I need to be optimizing the way people have for many years realized hey what you eat and how you exercise absolutely affects your performance so no I'm not sure what it is but I I have a feeling and actually had this discussion with my daughter a couple of weeks ago that we will look back at the way we think about night time electronics sleep deprivation and things like that we will look back at that in 20 years hopefully sooner the way you and I would look back at you know a smoking mother being told by her doctor smoke this brand versus that brand like we can't even fathom that that was a discussion that took place as recently as about 1966 in the United

[01:37:53] States and yet we're kind of in the our infancy in the dark from a clinical perspective some sort of a public health perspective we unfunctional on this so firstly I mean so much great stuff to unpack that I think you're absolutely right I think the success of the book is largely despite my my ability to to write and convey ideas I think what happened is that it was a perfect storm were the rivers I gave you I give you two-thirds of the credit thank you

[01:38:23] I don't know if I can take them I feel so ashamed but I think that the middle point is the erosion of sleep time has hit an all-time high we are now sleeping less than we have ever done in what seems to be the history of our species now we can't say that for sure but what we certainly can say is that back in the earliest record that we have of a systematic questioner which was in 1942 by Gallup what they found was that the average American adult was sleeping seven point nine hours a night now that number is down to six hours and 31 minutes that's the average 6031 that must mean that how linear has that decline been mat has that nonlinear yeah it's accelerating as accelerating yeah so I think you've had this ballistic erosion of sleep time this decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations and it's not just America by the way

[01:39:22] Japan is even worse it's down to six thousand twenty-one minutes you know my home country United Kingdom not much better six hours and 49 minutes and these are averages you know you've got to imagine that you know at least a third of the people are probably trying to survive on five hours of sleep certainly during the week they are it's that plus this incredible explosion of sleep science over the past thirty years and this perfect storm has led to a collision where society is sleeping less disease and sickness has been escalating in a manner that you know we've almost never seen before and the knowledge of what sleep is doing we know far more now sleep is not just curing sleepiness sleep is actually supporting there is no physiological system in the body and there is no operation of the brain that isn't wonderfully enhanced by sleep when you get it or demonstrably impaired when you don't get enough that knowledge and the causal knowledge of sleep in that it's not just associational it is many of them are causal links with those disease states I think led to this ability to write this book at this time that felt as though it was somewhat unequivocal that it was very difficult to argue with you know you can pick apart once three from another but when you build that blueprint manifesto when you build the scientific cold hard rational emotion free case for sleep it's very difficult to argue with and it just happened that we were at that time in our human history with sleep and we were at that time in our scientific journey regarding our understanding of sleep I think that's why the book felt like it was it needed to be written and needed to be written now for what it's worth you had many moons on the front and back covers so my little IRA and was delighted he's probably read from literally from cover to back cover everything nothing in but yeah exactly that's just fine I ask people they please you don't have to read the book you just have to buy it that's okay there's like literally a hundred more things I want to ask you about so can you make the case for why cardiovascular disease is worsened by or accelerated by sleep deprivation and then same question
