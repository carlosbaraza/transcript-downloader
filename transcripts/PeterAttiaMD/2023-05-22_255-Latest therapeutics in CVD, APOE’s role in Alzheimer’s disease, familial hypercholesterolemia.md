John Kastelein is a renowned expert in lipoprotein metabolism and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) research. In this discussion, John delves deep into familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a genetic disorder characterized by high levels of LDL cholesterol in the blood that increases the risk of developing heart disease. He covers its definition, genetic underpinnings, and clinical identification. He then explores the therapeutic options available for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, including the captivating history of CETP inhibitors. He explains the past shortcomings of previous CETP inhibitors before underscoring the compelling potential of the latest iterations, not only for cardiovascular disease but also for conditions like Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, he unveils the intricate role of APOE, shedding light on why the APOE4 isoform codes for a protein that significantly increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease. Concluding the discussion, John shares a profound sense of optimism, envisioning the possibility of targeted therapeutic interventions for high-risk patients in the near future.

[00:00:01] foreign [Music] welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter attia this podcast my website and My Weekly Newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode

[00:00:38] I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to Peter attiumd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode my guest this week is John casteline John is a genetic researcher and clinician scientist known for his work in the field of familial hypercholesterolemia and the development of lipid modulating drugs he is currently a professor of genetic medicine at the University of Amsterdam where he leads the department of vascular medicine John has been the main driving force behind the development of a treatment for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia a severe form of FH now some of you may be listening to this saying what the heck are you talking about well it's important to understand that FH or familial hypercholesterolemia is the second most common form of hereditary heart disease right after elevated LP little a and you know from probably listening to previous versions of this podcast that elevated LP little a is staggeringly prevalent in the population and by extension therefore so too is various forms of FH and while we use FH as an important place to start this discussion because it becomes an important way to understand therapeutic options the subject matter that we cover here is of course applicable to anybody who's interested in minimizing their risk of cardiovascular disease John has also LED several clinical trials including the pivotal Odyssey long-term and odyssey outcomes studies which helped to establish the safety and efficacy of pcsk9 Inhibitors in the treatment of FH and other forms of hypercholesterolemia as I said we start the discussion by focusing on familial hypercholesterolemia we talk about what it is how you define it how you can be aware if you have this what the genetics are that underpin it what we do with kids that have this Etc we then talk about the history of c-type Inhibitors which is indeed assorted history these have been a class of completely unsuccessful drugs that have resulted in much hype and Fanfare without any tangible results however John makes a pretty compelling case for the most recent version of these drugs to be not only a potential Game Changer a word that I hate for cardiovascular disease but perhaps even more interestingly for

[00:02:54] Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes this dovetails very nicely into our final topic of discussion which is that in the role of APO e now traditionally when you hear me talk about apoe I'm talking about the Gene apoe and it's three isoforms apoe2 apoe3 apoe4 it's important to understand that of course those genes code for a protein mean that goes by the same name APO e although it is not fully capitalized and that's how when you're reading it you know the difference what we talk about in this episode is what that actual protein does and why is it that someone with the APO

[00:03:30] E4 Gene codes for a version of that protein which by the way only differs in one amino acid from the one coded for by apoe3 and we talk about why the protein that is coded by the apoe for isoform produces a much greater increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease what's most interesting to me about all of this is that it ties back very nicely to the discussion of how this most recent c-tep inhibitor might work and what I'm left with is a sense of profound optimism that sometime in the next five years we may indeed have therapeutic molecules that we can use specifically for high risk patients such as those with apoe4 so overall I would say this discussion surprised and delighted me much more than I expected and I know that even though it's a technical topic it is something that is going to be of great interest to anybody who cares about heart health and brain health so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with John castling [Music]

[00:04:36] John thank you so much for staying up late into your evening in Amsterdam to make time to speak with me this is a podcast that really came across my radar courtesy of one of my mentors Tom Dayspring who basically got me interested in the work you were doing and said look if you'd like to speak with John we might be able to twist his arm that to make time for this and so

[00:04:59] I'm both gracious that Tom got me into your work and and that he was able to convince you to uh to sit down with us so am I as you know because you you mentioned to me earlier that you've listened to the podcast you're probably familiar with how much we talk about cardiovascular disease it's not really an accident right I mean it is the leading cause of death globally I've I don't think you can State the stats enough right I mean the last time I looked 19 million people died in the world due to ascvd and the second place killer was cancer at something like 12 to 13 million so it's not even close that what we're talking about is the leading cause of death and it's for that reason I think that we need to make sure that we take every opportunity to educate people about this and I want to start with a genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia which is probably far more prevalent

[00:05:54] Than People realize in other words there are thousands of people listening to this podcast who are affected by that so tell us what FH as it is abbreviated is yeah so we were the first in Holland who actually had a very large scale organization to find these people so I trained in Vancouver I was a visiting

[00:06:21] Professor also in Vancouver by Michael Hayden I had my Canadian exam so I did lipid clinic in Vancouver in a time when there were no lipid clinics in Europe or Hartley so when I got back in Europe and I started the lipid clinic in Amsterdam about 60 of all my referrals were FH and I thought why would that be and then when you go back into the history of my country my country is about the size of

[00:06:47] Rhode Island and it has 18 million people these people have not really moved in the past so there are large provinces with consanguinity it's not consanguinity as for example with the French Canadians or the South Africans but it's nevertheless grand-sanguinity so we got a huge 30 million euro Grant from the Dutch government to actually start actively find these people because when I started doing this in our large lipid clinic in Amsterdam we still had mortality or severe anterior Mis at ages between 20 and 30 in men for example wow so I can almost remember all of them people that were fit like you but didn't know they had an LDL of 300 mix per deciliter from their birth onwards and actually we're playing some tennis and then they got a massive interior Mi and in those days there was not much stenting yet and so the only thing you could do is put someone in in a cardiacare unit and actually do all kind of vague superficial things so FH is a true autosomal dominant disease meaning it's not sex-linked uh you don't need two parents to get it you only need one parent to get it it's almost a hundred percent penetrant meaning that if you have a robust mutation in one of the genes that cause

[00:08:09] FH you're almost certain to get the phenotype and the phenotype starts very early we have in Amsterdam the largest pediatric lipid clinic in the world we have seen over 2 000 children with heterozygous FH so we know that this disease starts very early in life then becomes symptomatic in your teenage years in the sense that the cholesterol that is elevated in the circulation starts depositing on your tendons especially the extender tendons on the dorsum of your hand and in your Achilles tendon and then also you start very slowly seeing the Arcus so the Arcus in the eye and sometimes the deposits on your eyelids the chantalosmeta and so those are the physical manifestations of the disease and then very often especially in the old days the first really serious manifestation is either angina or a heart attack and one of the things that is so dangerous about this disorder is that it's the plaque that you get in FH is a soft plaque it's a cholesterol-rich large plaque that is very often proximal in the coronary arteries meaning that if a black like that burst you either have an occlusion of your entire LED or you have a main stem occlusion which kills you right on the spot you know sudden death actually those sort of proximal left main or distal left main are we it's referred to as the Widowmaker I want to just back up and make sure some of the stuff that you said makes sense to people so you said so much there that has my eyes wide open and I understand this stuff so I just want to make sure everybody gets it so a couple things let's differentiate when you use the word phenotype and genotype let's explain to people how one defines the phenotype of FH in other words what is the objective metric by which we

[00:10:11] Define this condition so the objective metric as with all patients is history first and very often in these families there is a family history of premature coronary disease that's one of the first things that speaks for these families then second these people have elevated LDL cholesterol without any other abnormality so hdl's normal triglycerides is normal LDL is elevated and you need to find elevated LDL in first degree relatives also so in

[00:10:44] Children of that individual or in one parent and in siblings and with that LDL you can reasonably construct a family tree where you know who's affected and who's not but unfortunately as you undoubtedly know there's overlap between no effect family members and affected family members in LDL cholesterol that's why we decided a long time ago to go for the mutation so to go for the genotype because for of course for the genotype there is no overlap either you carry the mutation or you don't carry the mutation now this is where we have a bit of an issue right

[00:11:23] John because unlike for example LP little a which we've had several podcasts on where the phenotype is unambiguous you have an elevated level of LP little a the lipoprotein the genotype is also very clear it's a one-to-one mapping right LPA is the gene that codes for apollypoprotein little a and away we go here we have a very heterogeneous genetic set of causes in fact I could be wrong on this so please correct me I believe I've read that there may be over 3 500 different mutations that would roll up into fhiee that would produce this phenotype of and are we using by the way an ldlc cutoff of 190 milligrams per deciliter yes that's what we are mostly using 190 of course if you start a lipid clinic and you get referrals there's referral bias so the initial patients that I saw all had ldls of 300 or more now the genotype is very interesting so what we've done is of course if you start determining a genotype you have to be absolutely sure that your diagnosis is correct because if your diagnosis is not correct and you don't find a mutation it's meaningless so what we've done is we've used the children as our kind of diagnostic linchpin because if a child has high cholesterol with the exception of primary hypothyroidism there's almost no other cause for elevated LDL cholesterol in a child then FH right and it's important to explain I think to people that although you've alluded to it I want to make sure people understand there are a lot of people walking around with an LDL cholesterol of 200 milligrams per deciliter oh yeah but they might have triglycerides of 300 milligrams per deciliter they might have type 2 diabetes they might have thyroid disease that is untreated they might have renal disease that is untreated there are lots of other diseases for which a side effect is elevated LDL cholesterol and what you're saying is look we got to rule those out right yes and therefore we started in the children

[00:13:35] Peter that's my point yes because in the kids there's far less likely to see those other diseases yeah it's almost in all the thousands of kids we've seen were just a handful had had a secondary course for elevated LDL the vast majority actually all had a genetic cause and we've published this in Jama and in Lancet so when we we had a cohort of 220 children where we had three generation family of elevated LDL so there was no doubt that they had FH then we started sequencing we could find a mutation I mean next Generation sequencing everything excellent interim the whole in 95 percent of cases so that is a very different number than what you normally read in the literature for adults where people can find 50 60 at the max and they have no explanation for the other 40 percent telling you that the diagnosis the clinical diagnosis is not that good yet in adults unfortunately but it's very good in children 95 mutation so out of those 220 pits five percent which is 11 kids we also have never ever found a mutation and we've really tried so that tells me that there are more genes there are mutations we don't know about yet exactly now the 95 if you make that a hundred percent then it's 95 tldl receptor four and a half percent

[00:15:11] Applebee and 0.5 pcsk9 gain of function mutations so that in a country like ours is the division between the different genes ldr receptor vast majority and here it's it's not that profound right I mean here in the U.S I was always an impression it's probably call it 70 80 percent is LDL receptor it's probably more like that in the U.S yes and let's explain to people what's going on here again I think it's worth understanding the pathophysiology because we'll get into treatment but when we say mutation and LDL receptor or mutation in apob or gain a function in pcsk9 protein explain briefly what each of those means and why would each of those Translate to the higher biomarker that people are used to seeing right everybody listening to this knows what their LDL cholesterol is but why would these mutations lead to 3x normal levels of LDL cholesterol that's actually a wonderful and very easy to understand story so every LDL particle has an apob protein kind of cringled around it almost like a snake and one area of that protein is sticking out of the LDL sphere and that is a binding domain that is around amino acid 3500. we actually know that then there's a receptor for that particle sticking out from your liver cell your hepatocyte and these two bind normally so the LDL receptor grabs the LDL particle and then the whole complex is internalized into the lysosome endosome where it's basically dealt with now next to the LDL receptor on the hepatocide surface sits another protein called pcsk9 and that protein degrades the LDL receptor and that is the balance in nature because you can't have an at least not in the old days in evolution you can't have an overactive ldr receptor because then you clear every LDL particle from your circulation so you have to have a balance and the PCS canine protein that degrades the ldr receptor gives that balance but if there is a mutant in The Binding domain of apple b you have something that we call FH or familial defective

[00:17:37] EPO B which is basically the same if you have a mutation in the ldr receptor you can't bind the fob and then if you have a very active pcsk9 and you basically degrade all your LDL receptors the end result is the same there's not enough LDL receptors for the LDL particles so all three things converge at the surface of your liver cell and the problem with either one of the three always leads to elevated LDL cholesterol and that leads to all the downstream things that we just discussed so for folks who like to anthropomorphize things you can picture the LDL with the APO B wrapped around it as a baseball the LDL receptor is a baseball mitt sticking out from the liver and the pcsk9 protein is something that smacks the mid and closes it and so basically one form of mutation is mutations that change the shape of the baseball mitt so it can't catch the ball or it catches it very poorly another mutation changes the shape of the ball so the ball doesn't fit in an otherwise perfect baseball mitt and then the final mutation is one that makes too many of the things that SWAT the baseball mitts absolutely but if you make the diagnosis right in a child with elevated LDL cholesterol you've excluded the rest you know his father has high cholesterol his grandpa had a high cholesterol one sibling has a high cholesterol you know yeah well this is FH then you do a mutation screen you find in 95 of cases you can find a mutation the vast majority is the LDL receptor then comes

[00:19:15] Applebee and then comes PCS kind of so in our country pcsk9 mutations gain of function are very rare 0.5 percent you know another mutation that we've seen Even in our practice and we have a very small practice but I suspect we also disproportionately collect people who are higher risk but I've seen two cases of what appears to be ATP binding cassette G5 G8 loss of function so we see people who have FH and I mean I can't rule out LDL receptor defects or data function pcsk9 because we're not going to do that genetic test but what we can see is that they have levels of cytosterol and composterol that are more than a log fold higher than the 95th percentile and from that I don't know would you agree that we're imputing it does change our management because as nmi becomes first line but more importantly just as a very curious finding would you agree with our likely inference that that's probably the driving mutation in those people I would completely agree and I'll take one little step back so mutations in these three genes that we just described are very preferent in the general population in fact we have calculated that they are probably like 1 in 250 which makes FH by far the most frequent autosomal dominant disorder in men now the Koreans and a number of other people have actually looked in children with high cholesterol at cytosterol and campestral levels as you know they should be like 12 for cytosterone and 14 for campestral however if you put the level at like 35 they find a preponderance of kids who have increased plant sterols in their circulation and they find mutations in

[00:21:14] ABC G5 G8 so in the old days we thought that cytosterolemia which is the disorder associated with ABC G5 G8 was like one in a million that is probably a huge underestimation and based on a number of studies in different countries we now think it might actually be like one in 150 000 or so ten times more frequent than we originally thought and what we also didn't appreciate is that if you are heterozygous for a loss of function mutation in ABG 5g8 you also have exactly as you said increased cytosterol and capacitoral levels and so very likely these disorders especially in an advanced Clinic like yours will coincide quite frequently because they are not rare they are actually both not that rare so I have exactly the same experience let's go back a little bit to this clinical presentation we talked about it but I think some of these physical signs might be surprising to people that go beyond the obvious which is atherosclerosis so you mentioned tendon xanthomas you mentioned cholesterol deposits elsewhere in the body explain a little bit more about if we understand why does cholesterol tend to accumulate in those particular areas for example extensor tendons over flexor tendons do we have a sense of why that's the case the theory is that it's linked to movement Peter so that tendons that are used very very frequently that there is around those tendons there is a preponderance of macrophages and monocytes these monocytes macrophages are capable of storing LDL cholesterol and when there are enough of them you actually see it you physically see it and you can feel it also so the two most frequent places where you'll find these deposits are the extensor tendon of your hands which you use the whole day and of course your

[00:23:16] Achilles tendon but in my career which as you can see on my gray hair has has been a while I've seen xentometer also in the patella and so that tendon actually on the tibia I've seen them under wedding rings so actually a xanthoma under a wedding ring I've seen them everywhere and then the deposits on the eyes are probably also linked to movement because you're blinking your eye the entire day and then you have a deposit of cholesterol in your cornea which is called an Arcus cornealis so it's not in your lens it's in your cornea why that is there is a lot of conjecture about it but I don't think people really know but sometimes actually I have made the diagnosis of FH once in a KLM airplane so I was kind of lying there was a stewardess who wanted to give me a drink and she had very blue eyes you know these Dutch blue eyes and I looked in her eye and I saw a ring I said when you go back you need to have your cholesterol checked and she proved to have FH so sometimes you can make the diagnosis by really paying attention in the Subway or Etc because also the extended tendons on your hands are sometimes really visible there are a number of Old Dutch paintings from the 17th century where you can still see the tendons and Thomas on the hands wow and of course they obviously had no idea what was causing that shape but it was they wanted to be as accurate as possible and they painted it so we've established how the diagnosis is made do you require the clinical manifestations for the diagnosis in other words if you have a 50 year old person who has had elevated ldlc for as long as they've had blood tests so they would say to you yep you know doctor going back into my teens or twenties I had ldlc north of 200 milligrams per deciliter my doctors always said that's too high and I didn't care blah blah but now he's standing in front of you and you examine him and he has no evidence of xanthomas no Arcus nothing at all no physical sign whatsoever you send him for a CT angiogram and his coronary arteries are clean but lo and behold his father also has elevated cholesterol let's say he died of heart disease at the age of 78 so he died but not prematurely absent a genetic test which I assume would seal the deal do you say at least phenotypically he still meets criteria for FH and also let's assume that you've ruled out every other medical thing so he doesn't have hypothyroidism or kidney disease or insulin resistance you don't need the physical Stigmata to make the diagnosis because we've seen that time and time again there are people for some reason that have very elevated LDL cholesterol it is genetic it is dominant it is but it doesn't lead to the physical stigma what I haven't seen that many times is what you're describing is that the CT angio is normal in a 50 year old so if someone tells me that they had in their teens or late teens or when they went into the military you know when they're 18 they had an elevated LDL cholesterol and when you then see them when they're 50 and they haven't been treated to have a normal calcium scoring and or a normal CT angio that is really rare for ldls let's say you know between two and three hundred that's really rare but we've seen them and it's interesting is that so there is a cholesterol overlap it's like a gaussian distribution for people like you and me then there's also a gaussian distribution for heterozygous

[00:27:07] FH there is an overlap between the two but now we know and evanstein and I have actually published about that is that there's also an overlap between homozygous FH and the end of the distribution of heterozygous FH so you can never use LDL alone as a hundred percent certain marker for your normal UF heterozygous

[00:27:31] FH or UF homozygous of age this is a syndrome diagnosis so you need family members history and archives and this and that and then what's also very important is what you said in the beginning that this is a unique LDL disease the moment there's elevated triglycerides for example in low HDL then you immediately have to think about something entirely different especially in a individual that's not obese or diabetic let's go back and make sure we explain to people the difference between what I assume is much more common which is heterogeneous FH and homogeneous FH can you explain to folks what that is determinology I find sometimes difficult so we know and I'm sure you've discussed that also I think with Dan Rader is that there's called polygenic hypercholesterolemia that sometimes is so severe the polygenic hyperglycemia that it looks a lot like heterozygous FH and some people even say if you've had those genes also from birth onwards and you've had a high

[00:28:36] LDL cholesterol you know from a young age the risk of that severe polygenic hypercalemia is just the same as for heterozygous FH I still find that difficult because I see when you go look at premature Mi for example patients with premature Mi there's a huge enrichment for real heterozygous FH so the homogeneous heterozygous FH the heterogeneous FH or polygenic hyperglycemia whatever you want to call it is in my view still a less severe clinical picture I've never seen people with that side of the spectrum get heart attacks in their 20s or 30s so we have found 25 000 heterozygous of age patients we've published on this so it's humongous database and the monogenic especially LDL receptor gene mutations and especially if they're severe so a premature stop code on so you don't have any protein at all that is the most severe form of inherited hypercholesterolemia in my dictionary and in my experience but truth is is that your polygenic or heterogeneous FH is probably much more common even more common than heterozygous the monogenic form of heterozygous FH

[00:30:00] I want to come back to this distinction when we start to talk about therapy in as much as it changes either the initial steps we take or the expected number of steps we take therapeutically but before we do I want to put a bow on a few other things can you formally State again the Dutch lipid Clinic criteria and then let me know if that sort of differs from others because I want to make sure that because there are different criteria for this correct and I think one could argue maybe you're biased but I might share your bias that the Dutch criteria might be the most rigorous is that there's the

[00:30:37] Simon broom criteria there is the who criteria and the Dutch lipid clinic now the Dutch lipid Clinic criteria were put together by one of my co-workers Peter Landsberg and this set of criteria was externally and internally validated with mutations and huge numbers and every time you do a comparison between the

[00:30:59] Dutch and the rest the Dutch are winning in terms of their power to predict FH so it's not unlike Max verstappen winning the most races also being Dutch right just to clarify that well I don't know I don't know how much of a fan you are I think Max verstappen is actually totally brilliant guy and a fantastic athlete this is just something that you get points so if you have a first degree relative with known premature coronary disease you have a score of one or if you have a first degree relative with high LDL you get one then if you have children or you have this xentometer you get two I know this is an audio but it's a long list and what's interesting is that if you have a mutation you actually get eight and a diagnosis of definite FH is above eight so you have definite FH probable

[00:31:55] FH possible FH and unlikely FH which is great because you can divide your patient population into these categories and as you're saying it has a therapeutic consequence because if someone has definite FH we treat from the age of six that's in our national guidelines and then we start treating immediately just to give you a feel for that let's just make sure people understand what was just said there right if we can through this very rigorous diagnostic criteria that just for the record was not developed by Max verstappen if we can establish that a person has f8 with such a high degree of certainty that we would call it definite we would be treating an individual as young as six years of age which means our certainty with which this person's life is at risk in as early as the third decade of their life I.E in their 20s we're so sure of that we would do something that honestly I think a lot of people who don't especially if you don't really understand the pathophysiology of lipid metabolism would think that's absolutely insane now I obviously share your view which is that's absolutely not insane that's the only way that person is going to go on to live a long life but I I would imagine that that's a very difficult discussion to have with parents well sometimes yeah yeah I was just about to say it would depend on what they've already experienced absolutely it's all basically determined by family history

[00:33:28] I have seen in the Pediatric lipid Clinic especially in the first five to ten years mothers with no father anymore so mothers in their 30s uh their husband was deceased she came with three children and then one child had a total cholesterol of 10 which is like 400 or something the middle child had normal cholesterol and the youngest child had a cholesterol of 300 or something and so that mother really wants her child treated yeah she knows that two of her three children inherited the genes that killed her husband at 30. exactly totally unannounced the first heart attack was the last terrible one more question actually John before we get to treatment what is your best guess as to two things one the fraction of people with FH who do not go on to develop premature ascvd so we'll call this the fraction of people with FH that seem immune to the phenotype and then of course the more interesting question is what would be some plausible explanations you would offer for them so let's start with the easier question if you even if it's knowable we estimate based on our long-term follow-up of that large Dutch cohort that about five percent of people escape any disease symptoms at all so that includes coronary artery calcium scoring

[00:35:07] CT angios xanthelasmatism is Arcus anything they seem completely immune to the elevated LDL cholesterol now I have to say that the vast majority of those are women so that's the first thing in men it is extremely rare to have that so the majority are women and very often we discover those women when we go into the family a child is referred total cholesterol 380. there's no thyroid problem no renal problem then we go to the father and the mother and the uncles and then we find an aunt who's 76 has never been treated and we measure cholesterol and she also has an LDL of 250. and then we do mutations because in Holland to mutation screening is free the government pays for that so we do mutations in every one that comes to our Clinic basically free and so then we find a mutation in her too and there are some explanations very frequently those women have very high HDL cholesterol so perhaps some people have such an efficient reverse cholesterol transport system that they can take care of the deposited

[00:36:24] LDL in the macrophage on the tendons everywhere it's almost like the reverse cholesterol transport back to the liver is so fast that you can dump anything on them doesn't matter so in other words they have something protective yes they absolutely have something protective and so they are almost never smokers so if you're a man and you smoke and you have FH it's a death sentence if you're not treated in the old days or people that are not discovered right now then really that interaction between one pack or or two packs a day with LDL is the worst in terms of heart disease risk so the women are very rarely smoking they also almost never have diabetes so they're thin active women have high hdls and don't smoke but we have desperately tried we even had grants and everything to understand genetically if something maybe with these people we and no one I think on the planet has ever found a real good biological reason as to why some people are so resistant against LDL cholesterol and I assume the sample size is not that large but has anybody looked at monozygotic twins both with FH to see if there are differences in progression as a function of various lifestyle factors that might give us a sense of how much of that is driven by

[00:37:52] Divergence in Behavior it's very interesting by the way there is one of the largest monozygotic twin cohorts is in Amsterdam at the other university a wonderful researcher but FH is just too rare to have enough of those monozygotic twins to make any conclusion by the way I just add something based on the discussion with Dan Rader that you referenced that is the HDL cholesterol story is a pretty complicated story it's a far more complicated story than the

[00:38:23] LDL cholesterol story The LDL cholesterol story is actually relatively straightforward we don't know when we measure an elevated HDL cholesterol if it is a biomarker of something good that is happening IE hdl's delipidating foam cells macrophages things like that or if it's a bad thing I went really down the rabbit hole three years ago on the literature of people with elevated HDL cholesterol who were developing premature ascvd so deposited that these people with elevated hdlc that was actually a biomarker for very dysfunctional hdls yeah those are people with srb1 mutations exactly we found one family and published that in New England very interesting these people have very high HDL but they had premature coronary disease but remember the woman I'm describing is a nice thin elderly grandmother who's very active jumping up and down doesn't smoke and her High HDL is definitely not a sign of something dysfunctional my point being is this is such a complicated or lack of a a more productive word it's a multi-faceted problem for which there might just be in these five percent of people again mostly healthy women who seem immune to the phenotype there's an alignment of the Stars where enough other things are working in their favor that it's offsetting this damage so let's now talk about treatment and I want to talk about it through the lens of are there any differences in how we treat people by sex by age and by level of disease at time of diagnosis so whether we're dealing with primary prevention and that's a term I don't know if you would agree with me on this but I describe primary prevention as treatment when there is not a single discernible sign of disease whereas I would call secondary prevention if you have a calcium score of five we're already in secondary prevention even though you you haven't had an event or if there are abnormalities on a CTA of course that's right no I completely agree with you primary prevention is rare that's exactly right so secondary prevention is yeah your CTA might be zero calcium score but there's a soft plaque well inside the artery zero luminal obstruction doesn't matter you have ascvd that can be documented by the naked eye effectively not even microscopically so we're in the secondary prevention world so maybe walk us through primary versus secondary prevention men versus women children versus adults and take that in any order that you like as far as how you think about treatment let's start with the child so the child comes to us at the age of six years is the first time a child understands what they eat and in heterozygous FH it's very important to start with a very healthy lifestyle early on so we give them extensive anti-smoking training and we give them extensive dietary counseling for all the good healthy choices and also tell them sports physical exercise so there's a large okay but that never detracts from the fact that we will start with a Statin at the age of six before you get to that can you give some

[00:41:48] Insider color around what type of dietary advice are you recommending saturated fat restriction because obviously saturated fats I think in FH you probably have a greater likelihood of exacerbating the condition is it true that people with FH are more sensitive the dietary saturated fat or does it just seem that way anecdotally to me yeah that's I think anecdotally the problem is is that we all know that these lifestyle measures are not going to cure FH they are just supportive it is very different than for the general population of course but heterozygous is driven by the LDL and how long a patient is exposed to that

[00:42:29] LDL so the earlier we can intervene the better well actually it's pretty clear that if you start intervening early in LDL you probably add 15 to 20 years to that life versus doing nothing on the medication phone so you need to start treating the child and of course you start with a Statin do you have a preference for

[00:42:51] Statin John we used to have a preference for pravastatin because it was kind of seen as the mildest and we were only allowed in the beginning to use pravastatin because we had done a two-year trial where we showed that carotid IMT in these children in a randomized trial of Pravastatin versus placebo there was attenuation of progression so we showed already in kids between 8 and 18 years of age that was a Yama paper actually that we could stop the progression of lateral when we treated them with pravastatin and this was way back and now there are guidelines for the

[00:43:30] American College of Pediatrics there are European guidelines and in some countries they start at the age of eight other countries is six but it's somewhere between six and eight and then you have Statin and I don't think there's much of a preference anymore for a certain Statin actually some people have a preference for rosuvastatin because you can dose it at two and a half milligram to start with which is a tiny bill for a kid and then you add a zitimipe because you don't go to goals like you do in adults but you try at least to have an LDL below 130. so 130 is kind of the num I mean there's no it's very interesting because there's no intervention evidence for this at all like in adults you must have seen the uh

[00:44:14] Fourier Olay results that came just out two weeks ago where even ldl's below 20 are better than below 55 are better than below 70. we don't have those data for kids so but I was gonna say I was actually kind of surprised to hear that you would have such a modest goal of 130 given that kids without FH have LDL cholesterol levels of 20 and 30. in other words we know that's fighting conservatism yes yes no I understand I don't agree I personally don't agree with the 130 like probably you don't agree because you and I know well the healthy LDL is for your for your endothelium and is much lower than 130 so but this is always a fight you know where there are people that say yeah maybe we've done a lot of research we've looked at growth mental state and learning ability we've looked at maturation hormones monarchy puberty development and we've never found any negative effect in kids of statins but there are conservative people and so we have more modest goals but I think it's very diverse there are pediatricians who treat kids more aggressively I guess my point is it's so ironic because we have the natural experiment right in front of us which is kids are born with an LDL cholesterol 10 milligrams per deciliter and as they go through puberty it starts to go up but during the most important periods of development I.E when their brain is developing that's doing so in an environment where cholesterol is virtually undetectable absolutely the first year your brain Grows by far the fastest and you have basically no

[00:46:02] LDL left to go anywhere so it's completely scientifically agree with you and by the way John has the thinking changed with pcsk9 Inhibitors because I guess you could make the argument well statins are impairing cholesterol synthesis and maybe in a developing child that could be problematic but a pcsk9 inhibitor has no bearing on cholesterol synthesis it's simply amplifying LDL clearance so does that change the thinking at all well it changed my thinking and I agree with you but there are other indications all pre-clinical so pretty useless in my opinion that in the embryonic stage pcsk9 has a role in brain development and there are some mendelian randomization studies that pick up an increased signal for Alzheimer's disease with low pcsk9 while all the trials actually have never shown any effect on cognition but of course those arguments are again used by people that are more conservative listen we have done all the trials because we have so many kids with heterozygous FH for the files of both early Roku map everlocumap we've done all the trials in children for heterozyx

[00:47:22] FH also for Simvastatin plus acetamide all the statins alone we've done Brava we've done Rose superstatin we've done simvastatin and then acetamine and then the pieces can I monoclonals and so we've done all that and the kids are it's so interesting kids are not Statin intolerant meaning you don't see kids developing myalgias and statin-related muscle symptoms no at the free because in adults we see that about five percent of the time you're saying you don't see that in kids no because they don't write the inserts they don't read the inserts yeah exactly so they don't read the answers but do you think it's also because you're disproportionately using pravastatin which is milder or do you think it's true even in the presence of reservistat no it's also true in the presence of atorvastatin and rosubastatin yeah and listen it's very interesting because we have now a follow-up and I think that was a New England paper we have of course the kids that were eight are now 18 10-year follow-up and the kids that were 18 are now 28. so we have compared these kids with the generation above them at that age and none of these kids actually got a heart attack or angina or anything and the generation above them who didn't get any treatment of course because there were no statins or nothing their early mortality early coronary disease was rampant so I think we've already shown although it's not a real randomized controlled clinical trial but it's the only way you can do this you can't randomize a kit of course you can only do observational data is that treating from an early age actually protects the kids against premature death and premature coronary disease okay so I want to move on to another topic but before I do I guess the last thing I want to contrast this with is the adult middle age or otherwise who shows up either with or without disease how aggressive do you go there as aggressive as the guidelines tell us to go for non-fh patients so the kids are transferred from the Pediatric lipid Clinic to the adult lip Clinic when they're 18 and then be immediately start with pcsk9 monoclonals and pretty soon within glycerin and the sidomite and we really strive for the lowest LDL possible for that individual and in the homozygotes we do high dose

[00:50:04] Statin acidymite everlocumap and now effenakumab the regeneron ngptl3 monoclonal antibody so those four things constitute the state of the art therapy for homozygous FH it gets a lot of patience to relatively normal LDL levels and that is a miracle for homozygous FH in heterozygous FH there are about 10 percent of patients that even with triple therapy we can't get them to a reasonable LDL so we call these now severe heterozygous FH they probably have more than one mutation they probably have another mutation somewhere else that makes it a more severe phenotype but that we officially don't know that meaning these patients on pcsk9 inhibitor plus Statin plus acetamide you can't get below 70 milligrams per deciliter what oh no we don't get them below 100 or below 120. so some of them are are really they've nasty opposition against your therapy and it's linked by the way to the starting LDL so we say that if you're starting LDL is above 300 you have severe heterozygous FH and that's about 10 of the overall heterozygous of age population of course when you start at 300 and you have a

[00:51:31] Statin that takes off 45 then another new Baseline 15 to 20 and then then you can calculate that it's not that easy to get below 100. is apheresis even a viable option is it easy to pull out I know it reasonably works for LP little a but does it work for the majority of the APO B bearing lipoproteins it does we have an aphoresis Center in Amsterdam because we've sometimes diagnosed homozygous FH after six months in kids of six months that had a very severe homozygous of age and then we've had two

[00:52:08] LDL if Reese's kids but I can tell you one thing every nakumop is the golden rescue for these children it's still only used in adults but I hope that we will be able to use that quadruple therapy rapidly in kids also because it obviates the need for the lafaresis in many instances what's the Frequency that it needs to be given the drug is dosed how frequently it's intravenous dosing I think once a week wow but they are working on a subcutaneous formulation of it because of course intravenous but you know these kits are are used to something yeah I mean these kids don't have veins I mean you're basically putting PICC lines in kids to give them treatment or something yeah wow so there is a small but vocal Cadre of people out there who kind of refuse to believe that LDL is causally related to ascvd or another sub variant of this group who believe that it's only causally related to ascvd in the context of metabolic

[00:53:15] Illness but if you're metabolically healthy then LDL is not problematic based on your knowledge and experience with FH which spans the spectrum of metabolically healthy to unhealthy people How likely do you think that is these patients that you mentioned before are always used as the stick to beat people like me because they say if LDL is truly causal it's impossible that some people don't get heart disease while having FH I try to explain that most Z genetic diseases are modified by other environmental and genetic factors but someone these cholesterol critics.org it's a website of a strange bunch of people that absolutely don't want to accept that LDL cholesterol is bad but my experience with FH my entire career I've seen these families I've worked 100 hour weeks for years to find all these people and we were able to find the largest cohort on the planet of heterozygous of H and these stories are all heartbreaking so for me it is so simple because these people have one thing one a mutation in a single Gene that doesn't do anything else then raise LDL cholesterol and they drop dead you know when they're like 25. so for me I don't even listen to it anymore yeah I mean it's the sort of mendelian randomization also makes that clear because it doesn't just include FH it goes all the way down in my response to people when they point out the observation that there are some people with high LDL cholesterol or high APO B who don't have coronary artery disease is there are also people who smoke their whole lives and don't get lung cancer and by the way there are people who never smoke who do get lung cancer neither of those facts remotely diminishes the causal case for smoking and lung cancer

[00:55:17] I couldn't agree more Peter absolutely and I find it also because of course the FH argument was always the scientific argument of proving that LDL cholesterol if it's elevated sits at the core of atherogenesis and then of course when it became clear that there were a few people among these families who could actually live without a problem they used that as an argument but I completely agree the smoking is a very good example but there are many more so let's pivot now to a class of drugs that I discussed at length with Dan

[00:55:54] Raider the c-tep Inhibitors because you're very involved in not just the latest of these but potentially the first one that really appears to have a shot at working so let's back up for a second and for folks who either don't remember the podcast with Dan or didn't hear it let's provide an explanation of what ctep is and maybe a little bit of the sorted past of the ctep Inhibitors and you know basically what is prologue to where you are now the prologue unfortunately is very long breeder and it's one of the best examples of how big Pharma can make big mistakes so the CTP protein was discovered by Phil barter the Australian kol that's now retired but he discovered this protein and I think he actually discovered it in rabbits and why did he look in rabbits because if you give a rabbit egg yolk or cholesterol that rabbit gets atherosclerosis if you do the same diet to a mouse or to a rat or a hamster for that matter they don't get athero and so it was extremely interesting what made a rabbit different from other rodents and that is CTP so a rabbit has CTP so all strategies to lower CTP were tested in that New Zealand white rabbit like s-i-rna gene therapy small molecules antibodies against ATP and in all instances you could cure the ethero with lowering of CTP activity at the same time it became obvious that in Japan there are many people with a mutation in

[00:57:48] CTP so they have very low CTP and initially the first report said these people live longer than we do and they are free of coronary disease so then loss of function of CTP became a longevity Gene it is still by many people called a longevity Gene because if you don't have it you live longer you have less Alzheimer you have less diabetes and in general you are just simply more healthy sort of like pcsk9 loss of function as well also a longevity Gene yes you don't need that you don't need pcsk9 the theory is is that we all went through the evolutionary funnel about 10 000 years ago during the last ice age there were very few humans alive especially in the north and they went through the evolutionary funnel where everything was directed against being

[00:58:42] Thrifty people that could absorb the last calorie out of a mammoth were favored and actually we now think that those genes that we selected during that evolutionary funnel are now bad for us like we don't need pcsk9 we don't need CTP we probably also don't need anchptl3 and so all of these genes Were Meant to conserve energy and to conserve cholesterol and so what CTP does is a very simple thing is it grabs a cholesterol Ester molecule from HDL from an HDL particle CTP sits on the HDL particle like a little cap it's a curved protein that sits on top of a sphere and it has an opening and it sucks a cholesterol molecule out of HDL then that particle collides with an LDL particle and there's a little tunnel and it spits the cholesterol Ester molecule straight into LDL so the consequence of that is is that

[00:59:47] HDL cholesterol goes down and ldlkaliso goes up which in the days of very active ldr receptor activity was a great idea because then all the cholesterol went back to the liver and a cholesterol molecule is very expensive to make it costs 2780ps in a nasty environment like the Ice Age you want to conserve that molecule and the best way of conserving your cholesterol is by sending it back to the liver and then the liver can decide what to do with it put it in vldl or in bile or or it can do a lot of things with it but in a situation where our LDL receptors are not that active anymore adding cholesterol to LDL is not a very good idea and all the mendelian randomization

[01:00:38] Studies have shown that people with high activity of cgp have more heart disease more heart failure more kidney disease more diabetes more Alzheimer blah blah blah the whole works and so Pfizer was the first to say ah atorvastatin's patent is going to expire within a few years let's have another atorvastatin so we make a ctap inhibitor called torsetropip

[01:01:05] I was involved in all these large trials so I was on the steering committee of the fset repair trial on all of these trials except reveal that was done by Oxford but Pfizer did a phase two and in the phase two after four weeks blood pressure went up a little bit and then comes the big Pharma mistake why do we care about a little blood pressure increase if HDL goes up by 70 percent they didn't understand why the blood pressure went up and they moved the drug interface tree that is a fundamental mistake if you don't understand a side effect in phase two you don't move a drug interface tree until you've understood it but listen it was my fault also I was on the executive committee of the outcome trial with dorsetta Pip and we all thought oh my God this is gonna you know this is gonna be the next fantastic wave of drugs in cardiovascular disease but that drug killed more people than it saved I remember in September of 2006 exactly the street I was standing on in the financial district of San Francisco when the trial was announced that it was being halted and I was so I mean to quote uh Planes Trains and Automobiles if I had woken up with my head sewn in the carpet I would have been less surprised than that outcome because I too was so optimistic based on the HDL cholesterol increase even though it was clear this trial was kind of a stupid land grab from an IP perspective on the part of Pfizer you know you had to combine it with the torvastatin and all that kind of stuff exactly putting that aside I thought this is going to be a world beater and it turned out to be an enormous failure then everybody was fired except the basic scientists who got the assignment to understand what happened and they it was so interesting because they took the drug and they infused it into a rat now a rat does not have CTP but the blood pressure went up in 10 minutes boof so that told everyone that this is a drug that has an off-target effect fortunately has nothing to do with CTP but the drug actually raced straight into your adrenals where it promoted aldosterone production cortisol production it raised into your endothelial cells where it promoted endothelium one which is like an

[01:03:36] Angiotensin II terrible vasoconstrictor and all of that led to water and sodium retention low potassium high blood pressure because these were secondary prevention patients and you don't want a drug like that in a secondary prevention patient so that was the most unfortunate beginning of a new story in our field the wrong drug you know it's so funny this was not too long after another epic failure but one that I would argue resulted in a drug being removed that shouldn't have been removed but instead required a little bit more work to determine who the susceptible individuals were and of course that's the drug vioxx I don't know if it had the same name in Europe but truly a remarkable cox-2 inhibitor in a league of its own makes Celebrex look like drinking water in terms of its impotence and there's no question that there were a subset of patients in whom viocock slightly raised blood pressure and led to a small increase in events but I think Merck I think it was Merck that was the company that made vioxx there again I don't want to over speak but I think their arrogance and refusal to act in a timely manner resulted in just the loss of of a drug that I think to this day we'd be better off with and without there's just something about big

[01:04:56] Pharma where they are often deserving of the reputation they have not always but often they are their own worst enemies yeah this was a prime example of how can you make such a main I I'm now a drug developer myself so with Michael Davidson whom I greatly admire the idea that we would push a drug in phase three while not understanding a side effect in

[01:05:23] Phase 2 is just incomprehensible and then what's interesting and not many people realize that Peter then came Roche yes and this is what this was uh

[01:05:36] that drug was extremely important for all the signs because that drug only raised HDL it was a very weak CTP inhibitor it only raised HDL by 30 percent and there was no effect on the koplamaya curve in the cardiovascular outcome style whatsoever and what people didn't realize that drug was the end of the HDL hypothesis because there was no effect on LDL no effect on apple b no effect on non-hdl but there was a 35 raising of HDL cholesterol and that did not translate into one less heart attack or stroke so that ended the HDL hypothesis in a way yeah and I think we would only go on afterwards to see two mendelian randomizations one looking at genes that raised HDL cholesterol one looking at genes that lowered HDL cholesterol neither were found to be causally linked to ascvd so when I hear people tell me that their High HDL cholesterol is protecting them from coronary artery disease in the presence of high LDL cholesterol I have to restrain myself in the context of c-tep inhibitor failure number one two three four five six seven and mendelian randomizations that as you said completely fly in the face of this hypothetical belief system but what is extremely interesting is that in those days we didn't understand that you really need to lower LDL cholesterol with a CTP inhibitor to see an effect on acvd so Merc then actually was the third they got a drug and by that time people weren't sure anymore whether they had to power an outcome trial on the basis of the HDL cholesterol increase or the LDL and

[01:07:29] Merck said to Oxford just make the trial large enough and they did a 30 000 patient trial which is I think until now still the largest cardiovascular outcome trial ever 30 000 patients but they overestimated the LDL lowering the drug only lowered LDL by 17 percent the Baseline LDL in that trial was 60 milligram per deciliter so the absolute

[01:07:58] LDL was 11 milligram per deciliter that predicts if you put it on the Matter written line that predicted a nine percent reduction in mace and that's exactly what they got so that trial validated that CPP inhibition only lowers heart attacks by virtue of its LDL lowering and that it answers to the same law as statins acetamipe and PCs canine monoclonals it is on the same regression line so then Michael and I understood that what we needed to find was a ctap inhibitor that didn't have the off-target effect of dorsetropip that was way more potent than dolls atropy and lowered LDL robustly so we could repeat the anacetrapip trial but then with a much bigger effect size and we found that drug at Mitsubishi before we talk about obesity I want to kind of highlight two things you said the first is you have literally provided the most Lucid evolutionary explanation for our species-wide transition to the preservation of apob I have to be honest with you I had never heard it explained the way you did and it makes so much more sense than any other kind of teleologic or evolutionary explanation so I just want to make sure I heard it correctly because I'm going to use it often I'm going to be the most boring guy at the parties now because I'm going to use this story to explain it hmm it's called the Thrifty Gene hypothesis and it's more often used to explain for example that people in Asia get type 2 diabetes at a much lower BMI than weak occasions because they've gone through much more famine when the rice failed huge famine in the Far East yeah yeah and I've always been familiar with those arguments as they pertain to diabetes and obesity I just had never taken the additional leap of hey I know it takes 27 ATP to make a molecule of cholesterol but I never made the additional leap which was think about how expensive that is in in an environment that is so resource constraint which up until 150 years ago we were so we spent hundreds of millions of years in an environment where preservation of resources was the second priority only after reproduction that of course we would be so effective at

[01:10:42] LDL clearance and therefore of course we would want to be in the business of shuttling as much cholesterol from HDL into LDL via RCT because we knew it was going to a good place back to the liver it would be circulated as bile we would ultimately recirculate that pool we could make more hormones we could digest more food stuff yeah it all makes sense and then lo and behold of about effective like 150 years ago it was not such a premium on that now and we've got more than enough cholesterol to spare and that thing that Gene that we worked for millions of years to preserve now is biting Us in the ass just like the same genes are around adiposity and insulin resistance and there's a very interesting additional piece of evidence is that if you make a mouse look like a human heterozygous FH and you infect that Mouse with bacteria and compare the results of infection with bacteria in the non-fh mouse the FH Mouse is better resistant against bacterial infection and so the theory is and we've seen that in our pedigrees is that FH in 1860 was not such a severe disease as it's right now and maybe there is so much FH because again in the Ice Age having high LDL might have been an advantage as a protection against bacterial infection these two things converge yeah and think about how amazing that is in terms of a parallel to APO E4 exactly like this is the exact same story as apoe4 which basically was the only apoe isoform we had until what 200 000 years ago yeah something like that I think yeah and it offered remarkable protection against infections and of course it's only today a with our longer life but B I would argue with all of the insults that come with our longer life that APO E4 is such a predisposing factor to both cardiovascular and neurodegenerative risk factor okay so first off that was an amazing explanation of the story so that that was actually also I think a fantastic prologue for those who missed the discussion with Dan so let's recap where we are with obasipatrib right that's the that's the current one yes so it is how potent I guess you've done things I don't listen

[01:13:14] I I I am still a scientist and I don't want to sound like a Salesman but we were lucky finding this drug in Mitsubishi yeah so tell us more what that means so help folks understand how do you find a drug how is drug Discovery done how did this thing come about so I am a consultant to many biotech companies and sometimes companies ask me to look at the pipeline and see if there's anything good or bad in it so I was invited by Mitsubishi to look at a number of things and I saw the phase one data of this compound that was still called ta-8995 and I saw that at one milligram that drug lowered LDL by 27 now remember dosetropip was used at 600 milligram and it didn't do anything on LDL so I thought holy moly this drug is very potent and then I looked at the CTP inhibition at 10 milligram which is a dose we're now using there's a 97 inhibition of CTP so it's simply in that sense and surprisingly potent c-tap inhibitor and that translates into an LDL lowering of about 50 percent on top of high intensity statins and an HDL increase of 165 percent now you have to control yourself when you see those numbers because you know that the HDL cholesterol increase is not going to do anything for heart attacks and strokes but Michael and I are not only working on this drug to develop it we're also scientists and we wanted to understand all the genetic and epidemiology and mendelian randomization data and so we've gone far beyond heart disease with this drug we're looking at Alzheimer's age-related macular degeneration septicemia and diabetes because if you really inhibit CTP you not only stop the transfer from cholesterol from

[01:15:22] HDL to LDL but you completely change lipoprotein metabolism and you force the liver to produce more Apple A1 and you and I can I think agree on the fact that Apple A1 is a fantastic molecule because it is the molecule that ABC A1 the cholesterol pump on the cell membrane recognizes and actually exports cholesterol to so that was the first and then we also know that if you produce lots of Apple A1 you produce lots of pre-beta HDL particles to small HDL particles and these particles suck cholesterol out of peripheral tissues now in endothelial cells or macrophages that's probably good but what's much more interesting is that they serve cholesterol out of the beta eyelid cells in your pancreas and you undoubtedly know that with life if you're a type 2 diabetic more and more of these cells die till the point that you become insulin dependent that is because of the lipotoxicity of that cell that cell takes cholesterol can't export it the sterols are oxidized they become pro-inflammatory toxic the cells go into apoptosis and they die so that is already and this is proven now for all four CTP Inhibitors so all four CTP Inhibitors in their outcome trial had less diabetes in the treatment arm than in the placebo arm and we've published that in a meta-analysis about half a year ago just to be sure I understand John is that because you think regardless of which of the ctap

[01:17:04] Inhibitors we saw we were seeing more heterotypic exchange between the APO bees and the apoons and but okay so let's explain for people tell them the difference between homotypic exchange and heterotypic exchange which is pretty easy to Define but more importantly clinically where these are occurring and why these are leading to the outcomes that we're about to get into so the sequence is probably this you stop the transfer of a cholesterol molecule going from HDL to LDL that will make HDL Higher by definition and LDL lower now then has done stable isotope turnover studies and have shown that the reason for the lower LDL is that they are sweeped up by the liver so these ldls actually get 50 lower which is a huge drop because the liver upregulates and what can deliver a regulate their LDL receptors at the same time these large hdls take apple e on board and as you know Apple e is also a ligand for the LDL receptor so the large HDL particles are also cleared by the liver and the liver does that because it produces large amounts of Apple A1 which kind of disturbs the balance so there is a new equilibrium between removal of lipoproteins by the liver and production of small HDL particles but that only happens if you almost completely knock out CTP so you have to really inhibit it by about 90 percent which is very close to the homozygous patients in Japan they also have half LDL and about a triple

[01:19:03] HDL and every other thing that I just described so it's for me and and I think also for Tom desperate and people that really know lipids this is extremely interesting because it is complex it is complex but until now it is extremely exciting because there are two groups in the world so this is the diabetes part you know where you suck cholesterol out of the beta cell then there is a septicemia part that I never really knew about there are two groups in the world one in Vancouver and one in Leiden that have shown that if you're born with a loss of function variant in CTP you are much better protected against septicemia and not a little bit but like mortality big effect actually there are multiple presentations this year of these two groups and they of course want our drug to test it in septicemia let me make sure I understand something and I want to go back and ask a question about FH to bring it back to that is there any evidence that FH patients untreated have a lower mortality due to septicemia it's not great science but there are some indications but most of that work is done preclinically so it's not as straightforward as look if you have high peripheral cholesterol you have more precursor to make corticosteroids and therefore support immune function in the time of sepsis it's much more complicated than that no it's way more complicated and it's most likely has to do with the Scavenging function of lipoproteins so if your CDP is low when you get septicemia your HDL stays high and it's very likely that the HDL particle functions as a sink four and the toxins and everything else and so having a high HDL and a constant

[01:21:04] High HDL during septicemia is a very good thing and I on a recent podcast shared that I used to witness the opposite in the ICU which was a drop in HDL cholesterol yes you always witnessed that yeah and that would that would actually be a poor prognostic indicator not necessarily poor it's just that's the normal indication yeah yeah yes if you're if your HL drops like to nothing that's a poor prognostic indicator you are protected against that drop if your CTP activity is low because it's like having a CTP inhibitor on board which stops removing cholesterol from

[01:21:42] HDL yeah so again it this is a function issue that is not just a blind phenotype issue the sort of paint by numbers approach to this problem is high cholesterol good because it's more precursor no no it's ctep inhibition good because you have a bigger sink to dispose of toxic waste absolutely that's it so that is the septicemia part and the diabetes part now the diabetes part is proven in a meta-analysis for example The Rose The Rose Drug and that's so interesting The Rose Drug only raises HDL doesn't lower LDL no zero and so it's protective effect against diabetes can only be connected biologically with the HDL of course and so it's now thought that if you raise HDL with CTP inhibition you protect the bronchios against apoptosis it's an effect of about 16 to 20 percent in the new onset type 2 diabetes between

[01:22:48] Placebo and active treatment arm so it's not like a tiny effect it's almost as big as the negative effect of statins on diabetes which is also at at the highest dose 15 or so let's just make sure again we bring it back to this idea because am I correct in saying that obesetrapy the first ctep inhibitor that impacts both heterotypic and homotypic exchange that is very hard to say Peter because there is not much work done with the older CTP Inhibitors Dan Raider has done a huge amount of work with the Merc and as such a pip he has for example shown that HDL particles from anesthetic treated patients have more cholesterol efflux from macrophages he has shown that srb1 is upregulated in the liver by

[01:23:42] CTP inhibition with that drug so he has done a lot of that work but with the other drugs not so much not so much okay this is pretty exciting a sort of student of this world would have to be forgiven for having a little bit of anxiety and fear about being too optimistic here right this is one of those things where we've been burned on every one of these right there's a track record of four or five consecutive failures some more epic than others perhaps none more epic than pfizers and yet let's just say like if you were a Wall Street analyst trying to get your arms around this you'd have a really hard time getting excited based on how many times you've been burned but we're not stock analysts and we're really just trying to come at this through the lens of science what would you say is the greatest risk that this does not pan out so let's explain what has what we know so far you've completed phase one so there's no there's no toxicity phase two and phase two completed phase two and you had four phase two trials we have one two three four phase two trials yes and we are now fully in phase three and in fact all our phase two trials will be fully randomized this year so we have gone we've pulled every plug we could we've started the outcome trial at the same time as our lipid trials because we of course realize that what we need to show is robust ldlo ring robust non-hdl lowering robust fob lowering and then we need to show safety so blood should be no blood pressure effect nothing root safety good tolerability it's a tiny pill that 10 milligram pill and then of course at the end of the day we also need in the future to show outcomes in the cardiovascular outcomes trial of course but I have to say that until now

[01:25:42] Peter this drug is well tolerated we haven't seen any side effects in phase two and it lowers LDL by half which makes it just as potent as the injectables but then in a 10 milligram pill when we first saw these LDL results on top of high intensity statins I was kind of amazed at this yeah so I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves but I'll just assert something here which is if this pans out to be as good in large phase three studies as it has been in phase two the only thing that would stand in the way of this displacing every Statin on the planet is cost because you'd have equal or better lipid lowering efficacy and instead of having a small increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes you would be patently reducing that risk we're going to talk about the brain in a moment as well there may even be some benefits there but let's put that aside for the moment so there's a lot riding on this it's cheap Peter it's very cheap to make well I was going to say given that it's not an injectable monoclonal antibody this is cheap to make and um yeah it's actually very cheap to make I think this is public knowledge it will cost 36 dollars per year to make this drug at the time when you have lots of patients so what's called

[01:27:06] Peak sales so the drug is cheap to make and that will allow us to price it reasonably and ethically and that is something that Michael and I have always wanted is to have a drug that lowers LDL that you can use on top of Statin or in a fixed dose combination with acetamine that robustly lowers LDL and Applebee has little or no side effects and is easy to put in your pillbox because the vast majority of my clinic in Amsterdam they have pill boxes and they are a bit afraid of a needle and they they want an extra pill you know to get their LDL down so let's talk about the three trials just to be clear the three phase three trials you have Broadway Brooklyn and

[01:27:52] Prevail right so Broadway is 2400 patients one year it's looking at drug ascvd patients ASO these are high risk so this is secondary prevention yeah in people who are on their existing maximally tolerated lipid lowering therapy and you're going to Placebo versus drug it's not open label correct yep no no it's placebo-controlled two to one randomization and is the belief that this trial in 52 weeks uh with 2400 patients is significant enough to see a difference in mace or is this not powered for mace and it's just a biomarker study no it's not powered for maize but of course every phase tree trial whether you've luroka map everlocumab inclusion or even bamfidoic acid we're adjudicating events we expect about 120 events in its entirety and of course we hope to see a trend that's what you hope yeah so in other words rather than 80 40 between your two to one randomization there may be a significant difference although you're not really powered to it unless the difference is significant we are not allowed to do statistics the FDA does not allow to do statistics but this is just descriptive and exactly like in glycerin and glycerin had about a 30 difference in events if I can if I remember correctly and that at least gives you an indication that it's moving in the right direction so every everyone hopes for that of course okay so then you've got Brooklyn which is a very small trial but it's also yes exactly that's in heterozygous

[01:29:29] FH 300 patients same thing same thing and then prevails the big one right so that's where you've got 9 000 patients and are these people with uh existing ascvd as well so it's also secondary prevention yes there it's hardcore ascvd and we've even entered a lot of risk enhancing factors into this trial because we understand that the higher the risk the easier it is to show a benefit and we also strive for a baseline LDL of around a hundred because if your Baseline LDL is around a hundred and your LDL lowering is 50 then your absolute difference is 50 milligram per deciliter if you plot that on the

[01:30:18] CTT meta regression line you have a 27 maze reduction which of course you can't do because there will be people on off drug there will be people who are gonna take a pcsk9 monoclonal but at least we are very sure that it's going to be more than 20 percent mace reduction and aside from not having coronary artery disease what are the exclusions for prevail if your LDL is below 55 milligram per deciliter so we have adapted Prevail to the new American College of Cardiology guidelines so one of the things that I've talked about I think on this podcast is that when Fourier and odyssey were launched especially Fourier

[01:31:07] I was personally quite skeptical not because I didn't believe pcsk9 Inhibitors would work I really believed pcsk9 Inhibitors were going to be a home run I believed that they were going to be incredibly safe so all these things that ended up being true I actually believed but I thought the trial would fail because the patients were coming in this was also secondary prevention so a very similar patient population to Prevail these people have an average LDL cholesterol of something like 70 milligrams per deciliter on the way in so you're taking people who are heavily drugged to LDL cholesterol of 70 milligrams per deciliter randomizing them to pcsk9 inhibitor versus placebo my thought was you can't do that study long enough to see a difference well I turned out to be completely wrong right that study was halted at something like 3.2 years but do you worry about that risk here which is you've got patients that are so heavily medicated yes you're going to exclude them if they're down at 55 but look you're going to have a lot of people at 70 milligrams per deciliter yeah but it's interesting is that we have already randomized a very robust number because we expect to be ready before the end of the year but nine thousand so you can imagine that we already have a substantial amount of people and Baseline LDL is still exactly where we want it around 100 because we have actually kind of promoted the inclusion of high LDL patients into our trial in our discussions with the sites and everything and what was another very big mistake of Fourier was that it was it was not 3.2 but it was 2.3 years oh gosh

[01:32:45] I got my numbers mixed up and it becomes even more yeah it doesn't matter that's the 2.3 and that was too short it was too short so we've said after our last patient goes in we at least want to have a two and a half year follow-up so that determines that your trial because of course everyone before that already has follow-up and then you add another so we think that we'll have a median follow-up of three and a half to four years and that's really long enough to see the full effect of lipid lowering is is Prevail being run in Europe and

[01:33:23] North America yes absolutely Canada North America South Africa Europe Eastern Europe Western Europe any other side effects show up in phase two obviously you're not seeing insulin resistance you're not seeing any muscle soreness any of the typical Statin related side effects any GI side effects anything or is this truly of zero

[01:33:44] I hate to sound like a Salesman we have a paper in the nature medicine Lancet and we are submitting our Rose to which is our fixed dose combination with acetamide to another very good Journal and so you look at the tables there are no side effects we have not identified a single side effect related to study drug until now now of course that will change because in phase three the numbers are bigger but in Phase One and phase two we have seven phase one studies and four phase two studies there's nothing by the way which was also true for the

[01:34:20] Lilly ctap inhibitor the row sheet epidemic and the Merc sheet app inhibitor and there were none of these three had side effects 60 000 patients and outcome trials so the drugs if you discount the Pfizer Misery the rest of them was very safe yeah so in that sense from a side effect profile we're really moving into a world where between perpendoic acid acetamide potentially obisetrapy and pcsk9

[01:34:51] Inhibitors you're talking about a class of drugs that don't have side effects it's really the statins which obviously do have side effects although in relatively fewer people than is generally perceived that kind of give the overall class a bit of a bad name in terms of side effects yeah there's still you know books out there like the cholesterol myth and statins are toxic and it's interesting because in people that really need it like severe heterozygous FH you see a lot less statinine toroids than in people in primary prevention that just have it as a lifestyle drug so there is a large psychological component to all of this undoubtedly so do we see any benefit on LP little a reduction we do how much 56 percent oh so more more than with a pcsk9 inhibitor then yes okay so say say more about that so again

[01:35:56] Dan Rader you know he he's my Lifesaver so Dan did a stable isotope study with anacetrapy and found out that that CTP inhibitor inhibited the synthesis of Apple little a now how that is possible I have no idea at all because I cannot connect an intercellular synthesis of a protein to a drug that sits on an HDL particle in your circulation so there must be a link that that we still don't understand so he but he that was a stable isotope study published in a good Journal he's going to do all of that again for us so we are going to do a stable isotope study with Dan for apple b containing lipoproteins and we're going to look at

[01:36:46] Apple little a but in our Rose trial which was you know the nature medicine publication LP delay went down by 56 percent of the 10 milligram dose and 43 on the 5 milligram dose what's interesting is that other CTP Inhibitors lower lpdla by about 20 percent but they are about one-third of our efficacy so it feels like the lp little a lowering is in conjunction with the LDL lowering but again sorry Peter I I'm I can't explain this I can't no no it's amazing and of course for those listening with elevated LP little a which of course is hands down the most common genetic finding that leads to premature ascvd I mean if we know that there are a few thousand people that are you know listening to this who have FH or some trait there's tens of thousands listening who have elevated LP little a is impressive as a 50 reduction is we don't yet know if that's clinically enough to reduce outcomes and that's where I still think I have not had Sam tamikas on the show but remains to be seen if the ASO Inhibitors will be the lifeline there so I think that we'll have to put a TBD pin in that I want to go back to something else that we didn't talk about but I want to just remind the audience of the mendelian randomization so we go back to the observation which is that ctep activity is is largely genetic and we've already talked about the fact that there are some people who basically are c-tep hypo functioning individuals these people tend to live a very long life they have less heart disease they have less Alzheimer's disease they have less diabetes less heart failure and less renal disease also oh I didn't know about the renal disease okay so what we so we basically say look in addition to apoe2 as a longevity Gene foxo apoc3 hypofunctioning we can now add hyper functioning ctep to the list of things like hyper functioning pcsk9 when you go and look at the Mr the mendelian randomization it makes it very clear that for every one microgram per milliliter decrease in a genetically determined c-tep concentration we're going to see about a 0.1 millimole per liter reduction in ldlc about the same reduction in triglyceride this enormous two plus nanomole per liter reduction in

[01:39:27] LP little a the 0.2 to 0.25 millimole per liter increase in HCL cholesterol et cetera et cetera but one of the things I never realized was you're also seeing a reduction in blood pressure about 0.2 millimeters per Mercury which again doesn't sound like much until you realize that this is just normalized to one microgram per milliliter you also see a 0.1 roughly millimole per mole change in hemoglobin A1c in other words this is a potent anti-hypertensive agent as well what in the heck explains that yes so there's absolutely no explanation for that it was by the way very interesting because those data on blood pressure were already known at the day of torsetrapy which should have been a red flag to these guys right exactly which should have been a double red flag to these guys that if you inhibit CDP you can't the blood pressure increase has to come from something else okay but no no one understands the blood pressure at all there's no because CTP is made by the coup for cells in the liver and it gets synthesized excreted it sits on the back of an HDL particle one in 10

[01:40:43] HDL particles have a CTP protein on their backs and the half-life is actually the half-life of an HCL particle which is about a week so it's a very simple protein it sits in your circulation or an HDL does what it needs to do and how on Earth it can have anything to do with blood pressure I I would surely not know the relation with brain lipid metabolism there's much more known about that now than let's say two years ago so there we're making great strides in understanding how loss of function of CTP influences brain cholesterol metabolism that's fantastic science so I know I promised you that I wouldn't keep you up too late in the evening in Amsterdam but I I just don't see how we can end this podcast now without going down that rabbit hole a little bit would you grant our listeners a little bit more of your precious time that you've been generous in Sharing okay thank you John so if you look at late onset sporadic

[01:41:45] Alzheimer which is the vast majority of Alzheimer patients 65 percent have an apple E4 molecule on board they're either e44 or E34 or e2e4 so they have an E4 if you have E4 E4 your risk for Alzheimer is 16 times higher than when you have E3 E3 and if you have E3 4 your risk is about four and a half times higher we now begin to understand why carriership of Apple E4 is so bad for the brain Apple E4 is an insufficient molecule to get cholesterol out of cells in the brain that have too much or bring cholesterol to cells in the brain that have too little so it fails on both accounts it is not a good acceptor of cholesterol and it's a bad bringer of cholesterol and so if you are E4 and those cholesterol abnormalities accumulate over life you actually get sterile accumulation in neurons and if you have sterols in a Cell too long they get oxidized

[01:42:57] I mean everything oxidizes in us we rust like anything else if we are exposed to oxygen we get oxysterols oxysterols are what kills cells it gives a pro-inflammatory signal it drives cells into apoptosis it is the worst thing that you can have now an oxysterol is not much of a problem if you have a functioning particle in your brain that sucks the sterols out of the cell and then converts it to 24 hydroxy cholesterol and that gets to the blood-brain barrier to your liver up into bile and it's gone that whole normal process where the brain needs a lot of cholesterol for myelinization building synapses building these sprouts and at the same time if they have too much they want to get rid of it fast in order not to get is all wrong in an apple E4 carrier so what is the protein that can help here it's only one protein

[01:43:56] Apple A1 Apple A1 can take over all these functions of Apple E4 and how do you get Apple A1 in the brain by raising it substantially in circulation because unlike Apple e Apple A1 can get through the blood Bray barrier because it's small enough and there's very likely a specific receptor that actually pushes it through brain cells and which drugs do raise Apple A1 by far the most cetp inhibitors so that is the connection so these large hdls they acquire Apple e because they get larger and they lose their Apple A1 and we think and we have pre-clinical already some evidence for that but we're doing a trial in humans where we tap CSF to look at Apple A1 that if your Apple

[01:44:54] A1 concentration goes up at the circulation enough you'll push it into your brain and once it's in the brain it takes over the function of this dysfunctional Apple E4 it's a fantastic story Peter the nomenclature makes this complicated so I guess let's make sure people understand what we're talking about it's always a problem when the Gene and the protein have the exact same name right at least with LP little a we have the LPA Gene and then LP little a the lipoprotein but here it's the same name we denote it differently right we use all caps versus not and italics and all that but when we talk about the apoe4 gene having these three isoforms two three and four you're gonna get six different combinations of them but what you're talking about is the protein you're talking about the thing that is made by the gene again what's just another remarkable insight into the complexity of biology is the protein apoe which is not designated two three or four it's just the protein apoe the one that is made that is transcribed and translated by the E4 isoform I believe it only differs in one amino acid from the wild type it's a very subtle difference right it is it is an Arginine for a glutamine I think or something at amino acid 152 or 118 I can never remember it I always thought it was 127 so yeah we're one of us is wrong but yeah whatever yeah well I'm sure I'm wrong it's only one amino acid and that changes the three-dimensional conformation of that protein completely and makes it basically a lousy cholesterol acceptor and transporter if you carry an E4 you have like a list this long of things that go wrong on your brain it's pro-inflammatory it is insufficient in lipoprotein metabolism it is no longer a chaperone for beta amyloid you know it's like a very long list and it's terrible for for people that have E4 I think one of these Hollywood actors actually knows that he is he is an E4 carrier he's that that athlete Chris

[01:47:05] Hemsworth yeah he disclosed this during the the Limitless series which which I I think was was really valuable for a lot of people to see to bring a lot of awareness to this and by the way I've made the point many times that it is very valuable for someone like Chris to know that he has APO E4 because the earlier you take steps to prevent the exacerbating risk factors the better your odds I mean the one thing that's important to point out you you open this discussion by explaining the risk factors I look at data that suggests it's a little less than 16 and four-fold

[01:47:42] I think it's sort of maybe closer to tenfold and twofold but we don't need to worry about that there's no question it's high risk but it's important to note it's not deterministic no it's not determination and in fact it's far less penetrant than FH is yes it is there are lots of people walking around with APO

[01:47:58] E4 that are not getting Alzheimer's disease and as you pointed out a third of people with Alzheimer's disease don't have apoe4 so everything we're talking about here is is fair game to everybody what you said that's interesting that I didn't realize until today was APO A1 can Traverse the blood-brain barrier and therefore if you have a therapy that raises apoa1 you can potentially offset the damage of a defective apoe in response to apoe4 do we have a sense for many of the pre-clinical work that's been done or even the early clinical work that's been done what the magnitude of that can look like where I'm going with this of course is how could we begin to quantify the potential benefit of this is this something where as you probably know

[01:48:49] Mike Davidson also very involved in the clotho space right also very involved in looking at the observation that those with clotho klvs variants seem to have almost complete protection from their APO E4 Gene it's remarkable finding yeah so there is one large mendelian randomization study in E4 carriers and which Gene can protect you loss of function of CTP so we already have mendelian randomization data in humans that low CTP protects an apple E4 carrier against Alzheimer's but what you just asked me is can we have an effect size here we are doing a proof of concept trial where we tap cerebrospinal fluid and we look at I mean like 50 biomarkers because what we hope is that Apple A1 goes up in the brain that the consequence of that is that the cells are going to normally synthesize cholesterol so the desmosterol and latosterol levels should go up because cholesterol synthesis is normalized again at the same time 24 hydroxy cholesterol should also go up because cells are getting rid of cholesterol in a normal fashion and the inflammation biomarker should go down because you basically substitute for this dysfunctional E4 so in order to understand the effect size we need to be able to make a story where we say this functional E4 replaced by A1 normal cholesterol synthesis is on again normal cholesterol removal is on again inflammation goes down and of course this proof of concept trial is only six months so there won't be much in

[01:50:45] Alzheimer biomarkers but if we can show that we improve lipoprotein metabolism in the brain it is a first step into a fascinating journey I would say will you be measuring desmasterol and lethostarol in any of these trials or in all of them yes yes no we uh in the Alzheimer trial we do which is Prevail is the one where you're gonna no no the Alzheimer trial has no name the Alzheimer trial is a trial in oh it's a fourth try it's a fourth tree it's a fourth trial yes it's a four trial but we have no name for it because it's in a single Center in

[01:51:19] Amsterdam and it's a large Alzheimer's center where we have basically mild cognitive impairment with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's so early Alzheimer we give them our drug and be serially measure both blood and CSF by spinal taps I got it but you will not be in Prevail for example will you be looking at with Australis master all levels we have a lot of spare tubes so that is definitely something that you know we have a quite a wish list of things where we want to look at yeah well inquiring

[01:51:54] Knuckleheads like me want to know let's close out our discussion John with an explanation of the role of APO e in cardiovascular disease because it you know apoe gets a lot of attention for what it's doing in the brain we just had a pretty brief but insightful discussion on that but I think people are less clear on the relationship of apoe in the heart so what can we say about atherosclerosis and apoe again Apple E4 might have been wonderful in during the Ice Age but now it's bad because it's associated with higher LDL

[01:52:30] It's associated with a more pro-inflammatory state and it's associated with more heart disease now if people have a hard time believing how it's possible that when you're in E4 that you have higher LDL the explanation is is that Apple e of course sits on vldl and on vldl remnants and apple E4 actually is a better ligand for the ldr receptor it's an amazing story better ligand than e32 and so especially the chylomicron remnants and the vldl so IDL races into your liver and that will down regulate the ldr receptor and therefore LDL goes up sorry just to make sure folks understand that because that's it's a bit counter-intuitive right this is a little bit of a paradox it is totally counter-intuitive if you have APO E4 and it's a higher Affinity ligand for the LDL receptor it should mean that apoe4 generated proteins lead to more rapid clearance of LDL but if I understand economically not LDL there's no Foe on LDL yeah yes yet okay sorry sorry yeah so it's all on the remnants and on vldl I see and that's the point so because it's the remnants and the vldl those readily get attracted down regulate the LDL receptor so there's less LDL receptor to get rid of LDL is that the chain of events that's the chain of events but there's much more to E4 than just a little lipoprotein metabolism there's a like in the brain there is enough association with other things that are that you don't want I mean this chronic pro-inflammatory state that people like

[01:54:18] Paul ritger you know has made his life's work of is also Associated within with an E4 carrier ship and does the association with APO E4 in terms of risk vanish once you normalize for apob or is there still residual risk based on these other factors such as inflammation that exist and persist once you've normalized for apo3 versus apo4 in the context of the same ldlc slash apob uh if you ask Alan snyderman he'll say that if you control for Applebee everything falls away and that it's the number of you can also look at NMR LDL particles but that EPO B is really is really what drives all our statistics in cardiovascular disease and it's very interesting for example you've seen the bamfordoic acid data so the clear outcomes trial was on the line of absolute LDL lowering versus maze reduction so where is the room or the space for the CRP lowering effect if you're on the line and I really admire Alan him and he has been stoic in his emphasis on EPO B for so long and finally he gets this kind of vindication now where where most people would agree that non-htl and EPO B are a better prognostic marker and a better measure of therapy than LDL cholesterol by the free DeWalt formula but if you ask me personally Peter I think that

[01:55:52] Apple E4 has a few properties that you cannot completely knock out statistically or biologically with Applebee lowering yeah I don't think that's a big stretch and it might be that Allen's View and that view are not completely at odds right it could be that those other effects are small enough that on a clinical level you would need really large sample sizes and lifetime exposure metrics to see the difference it also could be that there are other amplifying features in other words if you take two healthy people one

[01:56:30] E4 One E3 with the same APO B the risk is relatively similar but if you take two unhealthy people type 2 diabetes nafld profound insulin resistance One e41 E3 with the same APO B it could be that those other factors create more of a gap between those people on a kaplan-meyer curve I think that that's very reasonable and I tend in that same direction I mean I think for me part of the takeaway here is just that I'm trying hard not to be excited right I think that as I said before when you're

[01:57:06] Once Bitten Twice Shy and I've been a very vocal critic of these trials meaning the the you know the last 15 years of c-tep Inhibitors and I would say that perhaps I've been too harsh and I've been mostly a Critic of the HDL hypothesis and I've relied on the ctep story along with the mendelian randomization as my rationale for that and in reality I think that that has created a little bit of a blind spot in my eye towards a more pure biologic understanding and of course I'm the last person who should have this blind spot because part of my interest is in longevity and it's clear to me that ctep is a longevity Gene meaning the hypo functioning variant is as much a longevity Gene if not more than the hypofunctioning pcsk9 so it's it's with the tincture of embarrassment that this is sort of my Mia culpa to say I have been too down on c-type Inhibitors and

[01:58:06] I'm very hopeful that obasetramib not only redeems the field but also gives me something to be excited about clinically in my practice thank you very much for that and to be quite Frank I was much like you for a long time and it is you know you have to imagine that the kind of turnaround you have to make in your head I was a strong believer in the HDL hypothesis until the rose trial then I had to turn around away from HDL back to LDL and Applebee and then understand the blood pressure effect understand the mistakes in the trials try to find a drug that didn't have all that baggage my first New

[01:58:46] England paper was in 1987 what we did is we measured CTP activity in a coronary angiography trial in those days we only had coronary angiography with pravastatin and it was if you had high CTP activity you had the worst progression of coronary disease over that two-year trial so that taught me that CTP was bad and since that day I'd wanted to find an inhibitor that was something that I could work with it's such a beautiful Story You've articulated it very well John and I do hope that at some point you find the time to write kind of a clinical philosophical paper about science which is we lost our way we as the field meaning like meaning I'm just observing the field but the field lost its way in this drug based on the wrong biomarker we were using hdlc as a biomarker because we didn't have a better biomarker for c-tep inhibition and so the initial

[01:59:51] Insight in the biology was right but by having the wrong biomarker and failing to understand the mechanism of that 15 years and I don't know how many billions of dollars but it's probably approaching 10 billion if not more dollars were wasted and tragically by the way it should be noted some lives were lost right we don't want to lose sight of the fact that this resulted in absolute lives lost during these clinical trials and that's the price we do pay as a society to advance knowledge

[02:00:23] I don't want to suggest that you can never have a loss of life in a clinical trial but it's just a sobering story but if you would forget about everything that happened before what we want nowadays is strong mendelian randomization evidence we want lots of phase one and phase two trials to show that there are no some bizarre side effects and then you gently go into a phase tree where the D is MB and everything and you don't do a phase two where you see your blood pressure affecting you say oh what the hell and you know we're up that would not be possible today anymore fortunately and that's a good thing yeah yes well John I'm really glad that Tom reached out to you to ask if you'd be willing to be on this podcast I'm grateful that you're able to accommodate my time today and thank you again for the work you're doing and I'm very excited to follow this story as will the other listeners today we'll have data on Alzheimer in the summer really thrilled to understand what's happening in the brain yeah fantastic okay thank you so much John have a great evening have a great weekend Peter thank you for listening to this week's episode of the drive if you're interested in diving deeper into any topics we discuss we've created a membership program that allows us to bring you more in-depth exclusive content without relying on paid ads it's our goal to ensure members get back much more than the price of the subscription after that end membership benefits include a bunch of things one totally
