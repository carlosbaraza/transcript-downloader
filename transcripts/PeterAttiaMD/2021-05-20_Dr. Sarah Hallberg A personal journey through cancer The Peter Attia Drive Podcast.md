## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of the interview with Dr. Sarah Hallberg:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This deeply personal episode features Dr. Sarah Hallberg sharing her journey with stage 4 lung cancer, diagnosed in June 2017. As a non-smoker and health-conscious physician, her diagnosis came as a complete shock. The discussion covers her medical journey, treatment decisions, and how she's balanced being a mother, physician, and patient advocate while facing a terminal diagnosis. The conversation highlights significant disparities in cancer care access and the importance of patient self-advocacy.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- 12-14% of lung cancer patients are non-smokers [00:08:30]
- EGFR-driven cancer and ALK-positive cancer are common in non-smoking lung cancer patients [00:09:15]
- Median survival for stage 4 lung cancer is typically 8-12 months [00:07:45]
- Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can be effective but resistance eventually develops [00:09:30]
- Non-smoking lung cancer is increasingly common in young, fit women [00:08:45]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Importance of self-advocacy in healthcare [01:02:00]
- Value of getting second opinions [00:55:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Cancer patients should seek genetic/genomic testing [00:58:00]
- Consider pharmacogenetic testing for medication metabolism [00:59:30]

**4. Notable Quotes**:
"Cancer changes you... I'm not that person anymore" [00:06:30]

"I refuse to accept being a sitting duck" [00:52:00]

**5. Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Genetic pharmacogenetics testing revealed mutation affecting gemcitabine metabolism [00:59:00]
- Full genomics reports importance for clinical trial eligibility [01:02:30]

**6. Follow-up Questions**:
1. What specific genetic mutations are most common in non-smoking lung cancer patients?
2. How can the healthcare system better support cancer recurrence patients?
3. What improvements are needed in cancer care navigation systems?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] something that that is you know been such a big part of your life in the last few years and people who don't know you may be almost surprised at where we're going in this discussion now but you know this discussion could basically continue down the path if we could talk more about diabetes we could end this discussion here and and people would say wow that's a really insightful uh thoughtful person but but there's a whole other side uh to to your experience with healthcare sarah that started uh gosh four year almost four years ago um and i'll tell it from just i'll tell the beginning of the story just from my end so you and i obviously uh met each other uh through virta your your you know an early part of the the creation of this this company which is basically scaling up a way to remotely treat patients with type 2 diabetes this is a company of that that steve finney is also a co-founder of along with jeff folek i believe um i have a minimal involvement in that company i'm a small investor and and at one point was an advisor uh but it was during one of these advisory meetings that you and i happen to be sitting next to each other now we've met many times before that but i do remember this very well it was i think june of 2017. it was up in san francisco a large u-shaped uh table in the room and you know it was a two-day ordeal and uh you were sitting to my left and that gave us more time than most times to be chatting about this that the other thing and you looked in perfect health as always and at the end of the second day i said goodbye and see you next time and blah blah blah and then about a month later i heard from a mutual friend that you had been diagnosed with lung cancer um and i just about fell off my chair so can you tell people what happened that summer the summer of 2017. yeah so you know i'll just start by saying i i've been someone who's taken taking care of themselves to um the max you know all my life eaten well i've kept my weight in a normal weight you know even nine months pregnant i would have still been considered normal weight um exercise like crazy competed in you know half marathons triathlons olympic distance you know i did everything right never smoked you know um never drank to excess um and you know it was it was june 30th so right after that it was june 30th of 2017 i was having a normal day i was went to exercise i had a big irb meeting in the morning went home due to my wonderfully full house of three kids and uh took a business call in the basement because that was that's always my escape place you know where it can be a little less noisy and all of a sudden i couldn't talk and i i couldn't figure out what was going on i knew something wasn't right but um i i couldn't speak and um all i know is that i hung up the phone at some point because i was embarrassed i was remember thinking there he's going to think i'm drunk and i hung up the phone and you know the next thing i remember was being in the car with my husband and him saying i don't think we could take you to urgent care i have just very flashes of this day and the next memory is in the trauma bay at the hospital the hospital that i work at where i had seen patients many many times and i'll have to tell you the other thing is the last time i had been in that particular trauma bay was when i brought my then four-year-old daughter in or my husband did i met them um via an ambulance after a traumatic brain injury so it was like a very bad place for me although my daughter completely recovered and i remember screaming at my husband that they're wrong they're wrong and i wanted to see the computer because what had happened when they first came in is they thought it was a stroke and so my poor husband was all of a sudden tasked with you know are you going to give her clot busting medication or not because we think she's having a stroke but lo and behold the imaging showed a really large tumor in my brain um and um then they imaged the rest of me and it turns out i had multiple tumors in my chest um and so you know they presumed you know correctly at that point that this was lung cancer but i also needed emergency brain surgery and this is all you know i i remember most of this by people telling me about it so um anyway the next day i did um had a virgin brain surgery and then you know i being a physician in lung cancer you know i was like that can't possibly be you know i have never smoked you know how do i have lung cancer i am the healthiest person i know i remember being in the hospital because of course you know you're on drugs and everything else and and shock and everything and i kept saying look at my nails these are the healthiest nails you've ever seen how can this be a person who's sick because somehow that was like just one example you know of how that's impossible talk about the stages of grief and denial right and um being a physician and knowing what lung cancer meant the next thing that came out of my mouth is i want to move to oregon because i was like i know what this means for me and i know what this means for my family and i don't want to play any part in this i don't want them suffering can you tell folks what you mean by that not everybody might understand the implication of what you're saying yeah i wanted to go to oregon because they had physician-assisted suicide because i you know i knew i had treated so many patients with lung cancer i knew the horrible end i knew what this meant you know um especially when it spread yeah and it had spread everywhere i mean i had stage four lung cancer you know the day before i had been fine a hundred percent fine that morning i had exercised vigorously and suddenly i'm in the hospital recovering from a brain surgery being told that i have a rapidly fatal disease and you know all you can think of in that moment of panic is your family right and so you know my only thought was i don't want to watch i don't want them to watch me go i want them to remember mom and so i mean there began my so far almost four year journey of a new me you know i cancer changes you so i'm not that person you know and and one of the many things is sometimes at this point in time you know i mourn that person i mean one of the things that i think is very shocking for people to understand is that probably between 12 to 14 percent of people who get lung cancer are not smokers and they all tend to get a certain type of lung cancer you know lung cancer is broadly divided histologically by small cell and large cell or non-small cell i'm sorry and within the non-small cell there's large cell adenocarcinoma squamous cell and most of the people like you who are not smokers get this type of adenocarcinoma non-small cell and it is really shocking to think that given the prevalence of lung cancer and the lethality of lung cancer lung cancer kills more people than any other cancer and i believe that's true for male and female still to think i mean by far yeah to think that such a high percentage 12 to 14 percent could be non-smokers uh tells us this the severity of this um i also think it's worth reiterating something you've said which is sort of the miracle of the fact that we're sitting here having this discussion four years later the uh median survival meaning if you took you know a hundred people with stage four which means a type of cancer that has spread from its original site of origin and in your case it went to your brain which is a particularly devastating place for this cancer to grow the median survival of people with stage 4 lung cancer is probably 12 months or less correct well it depends on what kind of lung cancer that you have but yeah i mean um and sometimes even eight months or less and um those were the stats that i knew when i was first diagnosed and you know one of the things that i'll say is non-smoking lung cancer is growing at scary rates it's being diagnosed and it hits people in their prime it's growing rapidly especially in young women so it's hitting a lot of moms much more common in women than it is in men although it does happen in men happens in caucasian and asian women predominantly and the interesting thing is most of the people that it impacts are thin and in shape or athletes do we have any insight into why no and and it's one of the things that's not being investigated as much you know when you look at okay you know what what studies have been out there oh we get the typical you know it's radon it's you know um you know being next to a smoker i never was okay my father was a smoker he quit smoking the day i was born and never went back i was not raised around smoke um so you know you the fact of who it's impacting and and the fact that the the demographics of the people that it's impacting are the healthy people you know unlike what we associate with you know our epidemic of insulin resistance that's not who these people are we know that insulin resistance is responsible for a huge number of cancers and and cancer rises that's not this you know and so you know it's it's young women um and again who have presumably done everything right um and and it's just it's something that is not getting enough press i know the guardian did a big story about it about a year ago um but otherwise it's not getting the attention it deserves and these women really wind up um with two different kinds of cancer they wind up with egfr driven cancer that's epidermal growth factor receptor or they wind up with something called alka-positive cancer i have the egfr specifically something called egfr exon19 mutation and the thing i didn't know at diagnosis because again i had been focused on obesity and metabolic disease and diabetes for so long um you know i hadn't been seeing as many people with active cancer as i did when i was in primary care and so i was quite frankly behind um on some of the newer treatments and newer diagnoses if you will and we're talking the genomics of cancer but for egfr cancer there was something called a targeted therapy this class of medications is called tyrosine kinase inhibitors and you know people can go on them and they can get better okay they can even in many cases have all of the cancer go away okay doesn't mean they're cured though because it always comes back and so after initially you know again going through all these i mean i'll tell you the the denial grief stage well i i wanna i wanna actually ask you exactly about that sarah i i wanna go back to what is it like when you were recovering in the hospital from the brain surgery because i assumed they had not taken out the primary tumors in your lungs they were just alleviating the most life-threatening symptom you had at the moment which was a mass inside a part of your body that can't accommodate a mass which is why you had a seizure so they take that out you're recovering from a surgery that by itself is difficult to recover from but then coupled with the knowledge of here's this disease and my lungs are full of this i what do you remember of those days overwhelming grief to the point of not being able to think and again it's it's you know of course i come and approach everything in life as a mother right i mean and and i'm not saying as a mother only like fathers would do the same thing but you approach every problem in life through what it means for your children how old were your children at the time sarah they were 7 12 and 14 and they needed me they still need me um and so the grief is overwhelming about what i quickly realized is i'm gonna break my children's heart and there's not a thing i can do about it and to have that realization because it comes quick and have to sit with that

[00:14:51] is a grief i can't i can't even explain and so i mean initially i just was i couldn't handle the grief i i had to be denial in denial i came home from the hospital i had just been discharged from icu and i walked seven miles the day i got home and my fee was see i can't be sick i i just got out of this brain surgery i'm still on medication i walked seven miles today i'm healthy i don't know what you people are talking about what did your kids know at this time had your husband already spoken with them well sadly enough and i actually didn't find this out until quite a bit later they are the ones who found me in the basement so you know talk about not telling the children we had that was never an option for us you know they knew i was having surgery that there was a tumor in my brain and that this was cancer this is not good um and that's a lot for a kid to unpack right especially a kid you know again it's hard for any kid to unpack but you know one of the things i remember when my kids were going through each of their own everyone kid goes through it the phase of what if something happens to you mommy what if something happens to your daddy right all kids go through that and the one thing we used to kind of laugh together my husband and i about that say oh honey your mommy and daddy are the healthiest people um we are so healthy you know you don't need to worry about that and and i remember that you know it's one of the one of the first things that you think of when you're put in this situation is oh my god you know they have to unpack this in that context and it's hard to be a teen it's hard to be a seven-year-old but to be one whose mother suddenly had a you know diagnosis of advanced cancer and we it was a hard decision on what to do but you know in talking and how do we handle the kids but the one thing we decided together i mean my husband and i um is that we were never going to lie to them you know we were always going to tell them the truth because i thought that the worst thing for a kid is to constantly be wondering if something if there's going to be a huge shoe that drops and so we told them we tried to open up the lines of communication they mostly didn't want to talk about it um but we told them that we were making that promise to them and we have never never gone back on that problem and promise and never will i mean that's one that it's really important to me we may delay telling them something for a little bit until we really know the facts but as soon as we really know the facts they're gonna hear about it so um anyway i mean you know and over time in grief you learn to accept many things you know my husband and i our dream had been to um retire to a farm and make um gourmet butter like that's what we were gonna do that was going to be the second career right and you learn to make peace with that's not the case anymore you know our we always used to joke that the way we wanted to die was 95 years old on the way home from a skiing trip in a fiery car accident where our kids would not have to deal with the bodies right recreationally we wanted to make sure it was on the way home a twofer it was going to be on the way home because we were going to be having fun up until that point um and um you know you so that's acceptance you know you're not going to retire you're not going to have all these things but you can't accept that you're not going to be a mom impossible now at some point i'm guessing kind of the problem solver in you started saying like hey i i'm going to learn as much as can be known about this and we're going to talk about this in the context of the asymmetry that exists i just had a discussion about this with you know we have a weekly meeting in our practice with all the providers and you know we just had this weird situation recently where you know basically a patient of ours who has another physician was kind of caught in the middle of a recommendation that turned out not to be the right recommendation and you know we were able to get them a referral to somebody else who basically got them out of a very unnecessary surgery and we were just sort of thinking man like we're so glad that that patient was able to dodge that bullet you know they were going to have a surgery that they totally didn't need that's a very big surgery with lots of risks and we realize like the asymmetry of knowledge in medicine is so overwhelming that it is it's it's it's not even just about money or education outside of medicine like a smart person still has a hard time digesting medical literature and i know like i said we're going to talk about this but i you know you very quickly must have figured out hey i have this egfr 19 deletion [Music] so we no longer talk about this as you have lung cancer or you have adeno or you have non-small cell we're really going to refer to it by its mutation and everything will come down to how do we treat that how long was that process for you to say i'm going to i don't know if this is the right word but i'm going to partition my grief and my problem solving brains and i'll i'll do both of them but i'll i'll you know i'll move back and forth pretty quick it happened pretty quick um which is okay you know this is terminal right you have to come to to grasp with that but terminal when right and what can i do to control the when but when you say that sarah did you really come to that realization so soon because technically life is terminal i mean there's nobody listening to this podcast watching this video who isn't going to die so that's all terminal but when you say that do you mean that immediately and without question or reservation you felt that you would not live a normal life expectancy there was no hail mary out there that was gonna you know take you to being the 95 year old skier um yeah i mean i i think just the reading and understanding although the advances that that this was going to be terminal really soon you know in my life and i was only 46 at the time and you know my first thing was just please let me make it to 50. i'm 49. you're gonna be 50 soon yeah i'm going to be 50 um in the not too distant future so you know that was like my first one was just like okay let's let's but right from the beginning i'll tell you the when was 11 years okay and and that has not left i just i don't need to be 95 i can accept all those things that i'm going to miss out on by not growing old i just need 11 years which to everyone was unrealistic but why 11 years because my youngest would be graduated so so immediately my goal was i can't settle for less than 11 years i have to make it to 11 years and so in became that like my war cry 11 years 11 years i have to make it 11 years and so you know it started i mean and that started me on a path of so much so the first thing i thought in reading all the i mean read everything is i got to get this primary tumor out you know i'm considered inoperable but we know that having this primary tumor here increases my risk for mutations okay remember i said that the tyrosine kinase inhibitors or the tkis they work amazingly well but only so long you know somewhere between eight and say you know on average eight and with the more um advanced ones you know at the long end is like you know 24 to 30 months okay um so that's not enough time that doesn't get me to 11. so i was like okay you know this is increasing the risk for mutation which is how these develop um resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors and remind me sarah you because i remember you emailing me probably by august and and starting to you know explain some of the details you had your biggest tumor was like five centimeters that's a monster tumor how how many tumors did you have it was six centimeters or you had six tumors i had it was six centimeters wow which is amazing in the sense that i never had pain from it you know it never i never had a cough probably because you were so healthy i think so because you know i this talk about being caught out of the blue you know there just wasn't this premonition of something is awry and i'm just not addressing it and so the standard of care sorry to interrupt was just that you know we typically don't operate on patients with metastatic tumors it's it doesn't the only reason they operated on your brain was it was an acute way to save your life i think it's hard for patients listening to this to understand that but that's sort of the that's the playbook in oncology right when a patient shows up with metastatic cancer they're considered not surgical candidates and this was the exception and not the rule you were going to be dead probably within days if they didn't operate on your brain but all this time afterwards you still have these this burden of tumors in your lung and now the question is can we improve your prognosis and maybe that doesn't mean you live to 95 but can we reduce can we make your cancer less resistant to therapy by taking the majority of the cancer cells out of your body right you know um and and decreasing the tumor burden because really quickly the tki got rid of every single small tumor i had them throughout you know like paint splatters on throughout both lungs and they were gone in a matter of weeks that's staggering isn't it i mean it is it's it's remarkable but the you know again the primary tumor was huge so um i had unfortunately the large tumor in my brain was not the only one i had two other ones that they radiated they didn't need to be surgically removed they were small they could be radiated and then i set about trying to find someone who would take out this primary tumor um can i ask you about the stereotactic radiation sarah that's i mean we glossed over that but that's not a benign process either did you suffer nausea from that what how difficult was your stereotactic treatment did you take it all in stride i did great with the treatment to the brain i didn't have any issues you know i did have issues at the beginning but they were more to the tki you know one of the things with every specialist that i saw you know they couldn't believe it or they told me if i saw them earlier it wasn't going to happen you know at least you'll keep your hair all my hair fell out like it wasn't supposed to happen like your hair is not supposed to fall out with tki's all my hair fell out anyway so the brain radiation went fine um and then i met a surgeon who was going to take out the primary tumor for the reasons that i was saying we just anything to decrease the risk of you know um developing a mutation that keeps me from being sensitive to the tkis and so i went in you know for surgery in september and i can remember her saying we're going to take this tumor out we're going to take out your right upper lobe unless of course we've seen that there's disease in the mediastinum but there was no disease on the pet scan in the mediastinum so she was feeling pretty positive about being able to take that out but i knew for several weeks beforehand that that was a possibility and just so folks know what we're saying on the on the right hand side you've got these three lobes here but they drain into these lymph nodes that are in this middle structure called the mediastinum and so you had this monster tumor that was going to require the entire upper right lobe to be taken out but if the surgeon felt that on visual inspection at least or maybe even sampling nodes that any of those nodes had cancer it was her opinion that this is really futile because now we know it's already escaped the lung it doesn't matter so so you went into that surgery knowing you could wake up with a huge scar in your chest chest tubes coming out and the cancer is still in you right and that happened um and that was i mean it was terrible i mean you know i kept apparently you know under the influence i mean everyone told me i was so hysterical screaming in the recovery room i'm a mom you can't let this happen to me i'm a mom that's all i kept saying and i of course don't remember any of this but they had to actually take me away put me in a private room and and that was all that i kept saying and um so you know i had to come home and learn to accept that um i now was bald and um i was definitely fell into a deep depression but at the same time you know i refuse to completely give up i mean like for example i went back to work at the clinic the same month that i had brain surgery you know which sounds crazy but this part of this whole process and then but after the surgery failure i i mean i was it was that was terrible um and then i didn't really recover back into my determined place until a really very specific moment and that was just a couple of weeks before my diagnosis um i had been selected to be an aspen health innovator fellow which was i mean this is among the higher highest honors for your work you know this is the aspen institute is you know a place that brings together thinkers in all kinds of disciplines and you know to be chosen to represent people who are innovating in the healthcare space was i mean such an honor and in order to do that you had to commit to four weeks of leadership sessions in the next two years which of course at the time i was like of course sign me up but as that first session inched closer it was in november i i was so what do i do i couldn't make up my mind i literally didn't make up my mind for sure until i sat i got on the airplane and because i was ready to run back because it was like i'm going to leave my kids for almost a week i have terminal cancer and at that point i decided you can live feeling sorry for yourself and of all the things that you're going to lose or you can go out and live and your kids are going to be better for it this is what really made me decide your kids are going to be better if you choose to live and so that was the moment sitting on that plane seat crying never i've cried on a lot of planes since this diagnosis deciding i just chose to live this was a moment i made my choice now i gotta stick with it and that's how i've tried to live my life since then because i you know i have a platform i had a platform i had done what i feel was a lot of good for a lot of people and it wasn't finished and i knew that this was good for my children and i'll tell you one of the most impactful moments of my whole life happened before my diagnosis and it was one of these times where we were at the dinner table and the lottery happened to be one of those you know hyper-inflated lotteries oh my god you can win you know bajillion dollars and so my husband and i were at the dinner table joking around about it right i mean we don't play the lottery but we were joking maybe we should buy tickets you know we could retire we could retire and here at the time was my 13 year old son at the dinner table and he got really upset about us discussing this you can't retire mom you're doing so much good for the world how could you even think of it i've never been so that is a defining moment in my life and and like i was like oh my god you know at the time i just i was so taken aback by that and um certainly that weighed heavily on my decision to get on that plane and to continue doing what i'm doing and what i'm doing has morphed since my cancer diagnosis into an even greater focus on health equity because of my experience as a cancer patient and someone who is privileged because i'll tell you you have a much greater chance of surviving cancer if you are uh has privilege uh you know one of the lucky ones and i didn't realize the stark differences until i became a patient i want to talk about that in some detail sarah but i want to also understand how it is that we're still talking today frankly in other words how have you managed to um stay in an equilibrium with this disease right i've always i mean let me let me share with you a couple of things that i i i've always struggled with when thinking about cancer i i'm not fond of the language that we sometimes use around cancer and that we beat cancer and that you know we can't give up and things like that because it almost suggests that the patients who don't survive cancer have somehow given up and i i just i i i just don't find that in my experience uh having taken care of many patients with cancer to be true i think um i just you know it doesn't make sense to me and i think the way that you said it and described it earlier makes the most sense which is basically finding a way to co-exist with your cancer for as long as possible and you've exceeded all odds and i want to kind of understand that journey a little bit more um you know it's it's one thing to to go through the tyrosine kinase inhibitor have this immediate response um that's remarkable but then get this set back you know three months later where your primary is not only still there but you actually realize now there's there's media steinle involvement which basically means there's no question you have cancer cells elsewhere in your body um it's not like they stop when they get to the lymph nodes so pick the story up for us in terms of what your ongoing treatment has been like like how have you stayed in this in this state of uh of equilibrium so to speak yeah so i haven't okay um on many occasions i haven't um but so so after the surgery um the next thing that happened is they found another brain tumor um there's argument as to whether it was there from the get-go or [Music] whether it was something new but either way they decided it would be considered that the first line tki that they had put me on um had failed me um and so i got switched to i got more radiation to the brain and i was switched to um the newest tki happens to be called asa martinez or tregrisso i was put on that in november um right before i went off for my first aspen leadership conference and i had decided that i do not accept being a sitting duck because what the cancer world then you know wants is for a patient like me to just sit and wait for the cancer to come back right that's what you're doing you know it's coming back there's no question about it and you know what's coming back soon and you know you are just waiting and i couldn't accept that as a mother i think i could accept it as a human but i couldn't accept it as a mother and so i went on a journey to find someone who could treat me in the most aggressive way possible who shared my view that sitting around and waiting for this to come back was totally unacceptable i traveled the country i saw everybody let me tell you first of all of course that shows i have means to do that right that a lot of other people don't and i actually along the way met another mother physician my age just a bit younger younger kids who had the same attitude towards it i refused to accept this we sort of became a team so to speak and wound up by complete serendipity meeting a group of physicians who really felt that the way to treat this long term was to be constantly battling it with something new so in other words you know the the cancer dogma right now is you put people on something at the highest dose possible and you keep going until it doesn't work anymore that that's how we deal with cancer and then we switch and it's the same thing over again and the idea is what if we hit it with less and then change it up all the time right and this goes to the idea of beating the mutations before they can get you so thankfully i had a physician here at home who was willing to say okay that that is worth a shot february of 2018 2019 okay because it took a long time to get to this point right of searching trying to find something i started chemo um regular chemo i went through the regular cycles of chemo and then when i was done with that i immediately went to anti-estrogen therapy okay because i had a very specific mutation besides the egfr one and there was a medication to treat it it just so happened to be a breast cancer medication but it was the same mutation for either cancer so immediately upon stopping um the chemo i went on the anti-estrogen therapy so i was put into early menopause with the number of you know regular medications lupron full of strand and then i was started on a medication called pablocyclip okay which again is primarily a breast cancer medication but was targeting one of my very specific secondary mutations i was on that for the summer and all this time i'm still on the tegris or asymmetric nib that never stopped as soon as the eight weeks of that was over with i went back on chemo but very different low dose chemo um single agent very low dose which agent so the first one was cisplatin okay and you know everyone says oh cisplatin you know you're you know you're gonna do terrible on this i mean this is harsh it and it is but you know i did fine i did fine i was able to still you know i mean i'm not saying i wasn't tired you know i've basically been nauseous for the last four almost four years every single day you know it's just you learn to manage that you know so i learned to manage it i learned to manage you know being tired um and the things that came along i still traveled for work i still did i was still able to do everything um i just i can't imagine i can't like i i could tell you some really crazy stories of of things i had to do while traveling to accommodate how i was feeling um that nobody knew about at the time but anyway um some really wacky stuff that you do but you just you manage you you figure it out right you improvise lots of improvising um and then um i got switched to another after eight weeks got switched to gemcitabine or gemsar which again these are so crazy you just don't think of this because that's a drug that's typically used in pancreatic cancer right well yeah and it can be used in lung cancer i mean it just depends on the mutation i think that's the point right right right right yeah um that believe it or not there's no standard chemo for lung cancer it's can you believe that there's not a standard like standard of care regimen so the thing is i wasn't doing any outlandish things here okay these are all treatments for lung cancer okay i mean like like you said gems are is used more for other things but this is not an outlandish thing that's never heard of for lung cancer i mean same with cisplatin i mean um none of these things are you know you know i was oh my goodness we're gonna you know do something you know that's never ever been done before you know so to speak and at this point which is now the fall of 2019 where if if you go and get a pet scan where do you actually have tumor in your body at this point so yeah let me back up for a second because well the quick answer is i had no tumor okay there was no tumor anywhere and to back up is that the tagrisso this is pre-chemo had stopped shrinking my primary tumor in march of 2018 so this was you know almost a year before i began chemo and so since they wouldn't surgically operate it to get it out i had it radiated again you know i was lucky enough to have a radiation oncologist who worked with me and and like i said i tolerated brain chemo well the same was not the case brain radiation for lung to the lung yeah the radiation i had real issues um and interestingly enough you know we were leaving for to hike the inca trail in may of that year so i had had radiation that we're leaving to hike the inca trail and i started having kind of bad chest pain it was like like a day or two before we hiked the ink trail i was like okay i'm sure this is just reflux i'm gonna take some reflux medication and then i was like look okay if it's not if it's more you know what a better place to die than surrounded by your family you know on the inca trail and all the beauties of the andes mountains okay i can accept this let's go you know i didn't even tell anyone i was like going forward and um did that successfully you know um it was great my eight-year-old toodling along you know she was always the fastest of any of us we went with our friends and um uh i mean amazing experience i just have to say that those things especially if you can get kids in it i'll never forget that when we all got back and we went and checked into the jw because we were like give me a shower a very clean bed in a spa my middle child my daughter said to all of the adults i developed my third eye during that it was one of those experiences like you don't normally think you're going to get that out of a you know she was what 14 at the time you know that's that we were all like what but anyway so it was a super special time i was still having pain and then my rest of my family flew home i actually had to fly um from lisbon to switzerland because i had a conference i had to go to and at that conference thing started to get really bad um i made it through but you know not with again some funny stories that of how i accommodated to it because i was having crushing pain got homes turns out of course i had some rare i had this rare complication where actually impacted my bones and my radiation oncologist said the only treatment for this is to put you on long-term opioid therapy and i was like oh no thanks i will accommodate there was no way i was doing that so i had to get through that which was a which that was a little bit of a saga but anyway i had no disease then after that radiation none and so i was in this state they call it nad or ned excuse me no evidence of disease i like to always say ned right i hadn't i was ned for a really long time i had no evidence of disease it was a great place to be right still on treatment still trying to do everything to keep this from coming back and started gemsar and you know everybody had said all these terrible things about cisplatin and gemsar was 10 times worse everyone was like you'll be a breeze gemsar is a breeze compared to cisplatin you you are really the exact opposite of everybody because yeah i mean we used to tell patients gems are is it's non-chemo yeah yeah everybody tolerates gems are i can still remember sitting because i was too feeling too crappy to drive my mother driving to pick me up to take me to chemo one day sitting on my front porch and throwing up in a plant on the way to chemo there are nutrients in there sarah that are very good for the plant so i wouldn't i wouldn't yeah about that that's very it's very healthy part of the carbon cycle i'm sure but i was determined to you know keep on i was really close to getting switched to taxols which you know i'm like this is gonna that'll be better um and um so then had to take another trip um for another meeting and had lots of friends there and i can remember them standing behind me after we had eaten and they were pushing me up this hill in san francisco because i literally couldn't walk and i kept thinking to myself i'm a hypochondriac this is just because i'm anemic you know whatever i was super short of breath but i'm like okay i had convinced myself i was making it all up in my mind i fly back from that trip and the very next morning head in for chemo and they immediately said oh my god no chemo you know everything is mass my i you know my liver numbers were through the roof my kidney numbers were you know high um i had pan cytopedia so bad um how anemic were you sarah so i was like six at this point okay i mean it was bad you know really bad the low sixes at this point right and just so the listener understands yeah the the normal would be 13 or 14 of a hemoglobin and you're six so that's really low and your platelets were how low 23 which means you basically don't have the ability to form a single clot right you know i was a disaster and the funny thing is i was still up and doing okay you know what i mean i was tired i was shortness of breath with activity but i was doing okay and they sent me home and i was like that doesn't seem right am i crazy that i shouldn't be home so of course i call some of my other physician friends a-ha privilege right because i was getting sent home and they're like oh my god we're admitting you right now right so i actually get a backdoor admission to the hospital and a complete workup starting right then you know i had to be i had to have a thoracentesis drained a whole bunch from my lungs that was unknown when i got sent home so you had tons of fluid around your lungs that's right yeah um and once i was admitted i was promptly transferred to icu things were going downhill i had to be put on bipap so i had multi-organ failure i you know had respiratory failure liver failure kidney failure i was a big failure okay everything was bad and was this believed to be the result of your body's response to the tumor or the chemo it was the gems are so i got taken care of in the hospital i i just want to cry to think about the care i got it was so wonderful you know and i got i just had the best team i would have died you know nobody can believe that this was well over a year ago now and i'm healthy with no persistent failures um because i was near death you know and um i was in the icu for a really long time and everyone every day it went from i think your kidneys will rebound to 50 50. they're never going to be normal i was on plasmaphrasis and it turned out i had something called atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and you know to just explain you know over 70 percent of people are either dead or on dialysis you know right away i mean it's it's got an incredible mortality right incredible it's incredibly difficult to treat um and so you know outcomes are you're dead or you're on permanent dialysis um and so i was put on a new medication after you know going through kidney biopsies all these kinds of things in the hospital um sent home uh did outpatient plasmophoresis for a while um and then things miraculously started getting better right not miraculously it was because of this medication i was put on um of course that meant an infusion every eight weeks and the worst part to me is it meant no one would put me back on chemo just just they wouldn't put you on gems or they wouldn't put you on anything it wouldn't put me on anything and to me that was devastating because i said you know well kidney failure is one thing but you know having this cancer that we know come back is another so that was another hard pill to swallow and you know long story short i got better i went to um genetic pharmacogenetics which is where they actually take a look at what your genetic profile is in in response to different drugs and it turns out i had a genetic mutation hey i have lots of them it turns out i had a genetic mutation that didn't allow the gems are to break down so i was getting toxic doses of this and i was on a very low dose but the thing is that i couldn't get rid of it so normally if you see atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome with gems are it's after months and months of treatment and i got this within four weeks why because i was getting mega doses of it because my body couldn't get rid of it due to this mutation was the explanation so you know and they said there's no reason you can't take any other chemo this is very specific to gems are but that was that sit in weight mode back to sit in weight mode and it took another year but the cancer came back in september of 2020 and um here's my story from that which really made me so determined to work even harder for health equity here i am a physician able to grasp really difficult concepts able to read and scour the literature and know what i'm looking for able to call at a moment time you know anytime someone to help me sort through something i didn't understand or help maybe refer me to someone you know i had all the resources in the world and the reoccurrence was in september even with all my constant pushing and self-advocacy okay the one thing is i had by by the time i was diagnosed with cancer i was an expert patient advocate expert hardcore and you know one of the other advantages i had is it didn't take much to switch that and to become a self-advocate an advocate for myself so i was diagnosed in mid-september with a reoccurrence i did not get on a clinical trial until um i got started december 30th that's a four month delay that's a four-month delay for me and in hindsight now looking back before i was panicked right and i couldn't really i was like something has to get done something has to get done something has to get done i can look back in hindsight and say how many people die during that time how many people who don't have the advantages i had just die during that delay how many i shudder and i i just want to cry and what i've done is i've reached out to other cancer patients to say has anyone else been in this situation and i find out it happens all of the time it seems that we have a really good system as i experienced when someone is diagnosed with cancer they get a health net a cancer navigator you know they get all these things and we're boom boom boom boom boom but when that cancer comes back it's kind of like the system seems to give up on you i had to advocate advocate the heck out of getting a biopsy done a biopsy that would be enough tissue to make me eligible for a clinical trial that would actually get me a full genomics report i mean that wasn't going to happen i'm telling you i had to get almost obnoxious about it and the stories that i'm getting from people are the same where was the recurrence in my right upper lobe so they had to get you had to get another lung biopsy to to do this and can i ask you another thing sarah what has been you obviously have health insurance but i assume that there's been a non-trivial amount of out-of-pocket costs as well in the last four years oh yeah do you have a sense of what the out-of-pocket cost has been for your care tens of thousands of dollars which obviously speaks to another challenge um i don't know if this is still true but it certainly was true at one point that the greatest source of personal bankruptcy in the united states is health care uh an inability to pay her health care costs and a cancer diagnosis is so high up there i would have to believe that cancer is the leading subset of that as well so you know it just so now i'm like especially when i got feedback that i'm not alone in this it wasn't just me you know and again i always keep saying in the backdrop of i am um one of the privileged and and i was put in this situation and the fact of the matter is by the time the reoccurrence was diagnosed to the time i finally got treated i had progressed so much that i had compression in my bronchus i couldn't get up a flight of stairs without desaturating i mean this all just happened i was in horrible shape which of course again and remember i'm starting out you know before my diagnosis in general i was so healthy and so it just is which gives me an advantage in this which gives me a significant advantage in this but it goes back to that question of how many people just die sarah you're very realistic about the fact that your time on this earth is less than it should be right a a 49 year old otherwise healthy person who's done all the you know done the right things for their health should have another 40 years on this planet and at least statistically speaking that's that's not doesn't seem likely it suggests to me that you're very cognizant of how you spend your time so i should take a moment to thank you for spending a couple hours with me here but how do you now think about the time that you allocate to your family to your work in the diabetes community and now to this third important pillar to you which is cancer advocacy how are you how are you how are you managing that and how do you how do you think about how to even balance that because i think time is the most important currency i think everybody can appreciate that in a vague sense it is the great equalizer but of course most of us can't appreciate it the way you can because you have a real visceral appreciation for it that comes exactly with this type of an illness and so therefore i think that your appreciation for the balancing act of what you described earlier which is living your life to the fullest regardless of its duration that's your legacy that's what your kids are going to remember about their mom being the advocate for other patients so that in 10 years when another sarah halberg gets this diagnosis even if she doesn't have your education or your means she can have an extension of life the way you do i it's it's it's a bit overwhelming for me to think about how i would do that because as i put myself in your shoes my intuition is i'd want to retreat from everything outside of life everything outside of my family like i i would imagine uh and it's hard to put yourself in another person's shoes without being there but my intuition is i would say i don't care about anything outside of the walls of this house and i would take a selfish approach in some ways i think and you've done this very selfless thing which is continuing to sort of prioritize everything else as well how do you do that well a couple of things you know number one believe it or not originally it was it was actually hard to be around my kids when i was so deep in grief because and that sounds crazy right that sounds counterintuitive but they reminded me of everything i was gonna lose right they were the they were what i didn't want to lose and so it was challenging and i i knew i had to overcome that you know and that that that was that was a big motivator for me to not be you know thinking about that um in thinking in that way and i i'm happy to say i i clearly have overcome that but um my kids come first you know i'll drop anything and everything if they need me now but i also think again and i go back to sort of what i alluded to before they need to see me um not letting not getting knocked out by the stressors and bad things in life you know i mean bad things happen to good people you know like i said there's been a pivot in every part of my career based on anger and i certainly am angry about this but what do you do with it that's that's what's going to be the important question in life you can take anger you can take all these things and you can get lost and buried in it okay or you can try to turn it into you know something else and i have to say i haven't become as big a cancer advocate yet and i'm working on it but the reason for that is and this was a question i had to ask myself a long time ago which is shouldn't you be a cancer advocate now was but i have a platform for diabetes and damn it that's important too all these people suffering from this is important so i can't just say i'm gonna switch away from a platform that i have to one where i don't yet it doesn't mean i'm ignoring it but it's like it makes me want to work more again for health equity because it spans both right it has to do with both diabetes and cancer you know um and and that is so important so yeah how i spend my time is really critical and i want to say it's not like i'm i don't want to paint the picture that oh my gosh i'm the superwoman i have a terminal cancer and yay life is great no you know when people ask how i'm doing okay if i say okay you know i'm doing okay there's never good or never great okay and that's just where i live right now i'm definitely not sitting around and feeling sorry for myself okay definitely not not enjoying things in life but great is hard to think about you know great is hard to think about now and you know the some people say well so cancer really helped me get a new perspective on life and what i care about and you know i'm happy to say i don't know that i got that okay i mean having cancer sucks and i'm still mad about it and you know sometimes i have to sit and have a pity party every once in a while because the fact of the matter is i loved my life pre-cancer and i think i was living every minute of it i think i cherished my children i cherished vacations i mean you know that i cherish travel and showing my children travel and that's you know that's a bit of a wonderful thing and it's also like a dagger too it's not like i've gotten some new life and new perspective that's so different from my old damn it i liked my old life and i liked the old me and it's still a little hard to get used to who this person is now she's still motivated she still exercises although not doing the things i used to she loves her children with as much passion as one could have but i'm i'm fundamentally different it's tough sarah you've uh [Music] you know you've you've said a lot of things that obviously resonate um

[01:09:11] um and i think we'll will resonate with a lot of people so i um i wanna i wanna thank you from the bottom of my heart and uh certainly wish you the best thanks i appreciate it it's uh it's been it's been great knowing you through this journey as well you are uh as many of your colleagues have have undoubtedly told you and we've certainly discussed it behind your back uh you are an inspiration and nobody wants to hear that because nobody wants to be the inspiration you just want to be the normal person but uh you are an inspirational person yeah yeah well thank you for setting aside time thank you yeah and i mean i thank you so much for having me on i mean believe it or not this is the first time i've told my story you know um in any way shape or form so i have been kind of preparing for this um and i i'm glad i did it and so thank you for giving me an opportunity to do that and thank you thank you for trusting us thank you for trusting me and the listeners
