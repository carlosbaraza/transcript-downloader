those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode [Music] my guest this week is dr irene davis irene is a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at harvard medical school she's also the founding director of the spaulding national running center one of the premier centers in the united states devoted exclusively to the diagnosis treatment and prevention of running injuries in runners of all ages and abilities irene holds two bachelor's degrees one in exercise science from the university of massachusetts and one in physical therapy from the university of florida she then went on to earn her master's degree in biomechanics from the university of virginia before finally going on to get her phd in biomechanics from penn state in this episode we talk about a lot of things and irene is someone i've been wanting to talk with for about six months and i was hoping to do it in person so i could actually go to her lab but alas kovid turned this into yet another video interview nevertheless the weight was worth it in this episode we talk about a number of things we start with the evolution of running so when did we stand up as homo erectus and then when did we begin to run how did we run what was the mechanic of that run and then what changed about 50 years ago because what's really interesting when you think about this is we went from 2 million years ago till about 50 years ago sort of doing the same thing and then 50 years ago something changed we talked a lot about what that change was and how that change led to where we are today we had a little nerdy in this episode but i think the show notes are going to make this really easy to follow and i go out of my way to stop and have irene re-explain things and try to re-explain things myself so that people who aren't as familiar with the terminology can understand it and i think we do a pretty good job of explaining the direction of the forces and just making sure people understand some of the lingo that we use but that said the show notes will be very valuable as we especially discuss some of the movement patterns the gait patterns the muscles within the foot and the legs and even things as simple as the different types of strike patterns and what we mean by minimalist shoes we have a very lengthy discussion about minimalist shoes versus conventional shoes motion control shoes cushion control shoes we do talk a lot about running and walking but i think a lot of what we talk about goes even beyond that and we have a also a pretty detailed discussion about orthotics plantar fasciitis and all the common injuries that many of you have probably either heard about know people who have suffered from or have suffered from yourself so without further delay please enjoy my conversation with irene davis [Music] irene thanks so much for making time today i know you're incredibly busy as evidenced by the fact that you had to change our last meeting in exchange for something that was obviously much more important that we certainly could understand which was making time to speak with folks at the dod and i can imagine how they're very interested in what you do tell me a little bit about how you came to be doing what you are doing for example what did you study during your phd i'm actually gonna go back a little bit further so when i started out in college i really didn't know what i wanted to do i honestly wanted to be an fbi agent and wrote a letter to j edgar hoover who wrote me a letter back that i still have and framed that said that women aren't allowed in the fbi so at that point i really didn't know what i wanted to do so i went to school and started taking classes in exercise science which led me to wanting to understand how the body works and combine it with medicine and most people who go into physical therapy often think about either medicine or pt and i decided to go the pt route got a degree in physical therapy and worked for a while but i think i've always had a an inquisitive mind and i kind of knew that i would go back to school for just for additional education and thought that i would probably end up going on for my phd so i went on they did my master's in biomechanics and then went on to penn state and did my phd in biomechanics the person at penn state that i went to work with was dr peter cavanaugh who is one of the pioneers in running mechanics and what i thought was really cool was i was able to bring in my medical sort of physical therapy clinical perspective to biomechanics and marry them that's really what i did it's when i started that sort of journey of understanding the relationship between mechanics and injuries and then i took a position at the university of delaware to start my career and on a personal level was there an injury that you had growing up do you know somebody were you close to somebody who'd been through the churn of physical therapy either with or without successful results that kind of created this passion within you so the physical therapy part early on i had a cousin who in a diving accident became a quadriplegic when i watched the physical therapist work with him i was really inspired and i actually started my career in spinal cord rehab but then moved on to after i started my graduate degrees i moved into outpatient physical therapy because it was easier to do part-time pt in in that kind of environment and then because of my interest in biomechanics and injuries really orthopedics was really kind of the better match for me but really started with that that's how i kind of got interested but my interest in biomechanics actually came from the fact that my cousin and other people with quadriplegia have to move 100 of their body with 25 of their muscle power and it's a biomechanical feat so you have to learn how to use your body in ways that we don't normally use it and you have to understand mechanics and that's really what got me interested in biomechanics you know i've been thinking about how i wanted to approach this subject with you and a lot of times i come into an interview and i have a pretty clear sense of how i want to do that and i got to be honest with you i'm still sitting here as we're talking thinking god we could well maybe we approach it this way maybe approach it that way so i'm just going to take a stab at one of the ways i wanted to talk about this with you and if it goes in a place that's interesting wonderful and if not we'll pivot but does it make sense to talk about this through an evolutionary lens does it make sense to start from the standpoint of what did our ancestors do biomechanically i don't know several million years ago that today we do radically different so in terms of our evolution having been the driving factor even more than sort of the environmental change which i know we're going to talk about the environmental changes later but just help me understand sort of what the step function changes have been if any in the biomechanics of our species so if you don't mind i wouldn't mind stepping back one more step and talk about the evolution of my thought that leads to the evolution that you're referring to so when i started out at the university of delaware i had done some work as a physical therapist doing orthotics and i became the person who taught the orthotics the foot orthotic component of our program i was making orthotics i was doing research in foot orthotics and really kind of got into the mindset that some people have feet they can't support themselves and it was interesting it was kind of like a perfect storm for me because i was doing research in the area of impacts and injuries and i realized that when people land on the ball of the foot and i'm sure we'll talk about this later the impacts are lower and people who are barefoot runners tend to run in the ball of their foot so maybe that's really the way we were meant to run and footwear can interfere with these things and so all of these things kind of came together at the same time that the born to run book came out and again made me start to think it wasn't really the born to run book but again it kind of made me re-examine my thinking and it kind of brought me back to when i was a physical therapist in rehab where we would try to take away as much support and bracing to our patients even in wheelchairs a lower back less lower extremity bracing so that they would use what they had and yet my thinking in terms of feet was completely opposite and then the other part of it i was thinking about as a physical therapist we don't brace anything else permanently if you have an orthopedic problem and yet with the feet somehow we think someone needs and i did thought we needed to have bracing in the foot i needed to give them orthotics for every pair of shoes they had and they were going to need those forever instead of thinking that these feet actually have these amazing muscles and that they have just as much of an ability to strengthen as my quads and my hamstrings and my my biceps and so i really started to change my thinking then and then there were papers that came out that showed that when people are placed into shoes that match their foot type which is really how we got to these motion control and cushion shoes and i can give you a little history there too when we have a chance but when you look at the studies that have been done what they found is that when you match the foot to the shoe so a motion control shoe for a very low flat foot that's flexible a cushion shoe for a high arch rigid foot and stability shoe for normal arch and then you compare that to a group of people who all got the same shoe regardless their foot type there was no difference in the injury patterns this was done by joe kanapic in the military i think something like 7 000 military individuals in different branches of the service so that may start making me think wait a minute because i used to prescribe footwear in that way as well so all of this along with really kind of meeting dan lieberman who's an evolutionary biologist who invited me on to the nature paper from 2010 and it was at a time when i was moving from the university of delaware up to harvard which is where he was as well i really started thinking about the evolution so when we think about the evolution of our foot when we went from walking man to running man so that would be australopithecus to homo erectus we actually started to develop not just changes in our feet but changes in our body and there's a great paper by dan lieberman and dennis bramble it's bramble and lieberman looking at the changes the anatomical changes that occurred as we went from walking to running and what we found is that things like the longitudinal arch the medial longitudinal arch developed at that point our joint surfaces got larger because we had higher forces going from walking to running and so those those surfaces had to be larger in order to distribute the forces our achilles tendon got longer in order to store the energy you can walk with a very short achilles you don't need to store energy but for running you do and so we saw these changes that occurred and that's really kind of what i have focused on is it changes from walking to running because my interest has been in running but those changes occurred probably not just simply for running but they certainly optimized us for running and they had i think 23 markers of endurance running it's a very fascinating paper it's the title that's called born to run which is interesting i think that we really evolved to have feet that are very well on their own well equipped to be able to walk and run without any kind of support when you think about the structure of our feet we've got 26 bones we have 33 articulations those articulations that have six degrees of freedom of motion the foot is a very complex structure just like the hand it's very much like the hand the anatomy it also has four layers of arch muscles four layers of ten muscles just in the arch so it allows this foot to have diverse function from being a stable base of support to being an adapter on uneven terrain to being a shock attenuator to being a spring to be a rigid lever for push-off all of those functions come from the fact that it has that kind of complexity and that kind of beauty that was really interesting and there was a lot i'd like to unpack there you mentioned dan lieberman i saw dan lecture for the first time in the summer of 2011. i actually remember it quite well and i remember being blown away by a lot of things he said one of the things he said if i heard him correctly and if i remember correctly was that over 24 hours no animal could cover a greater distance than humans and obviously there are lots of animals that can run faster than humans for short distance but over 24 hours we're gonna win the day and again this was part of the sort of born to run thesis i want to just go back and make sure i have a couple things correct so when did we approximately stand up how many years ago was that oh now you're testing me i can tell you when we started to run we've been running for two million years wow okay that's longer than i would have thought so two million years of it was essentially a transition from walk to run do you have a sense of how much i mean again how much speed did we give up acute speed when we went from when we stood up in other words i'm guessing that when we were on all fours we could move very quickly over a short period of time 100 yards or so but probably not that quickly over miles and so standing up gave us that transition right we were able to then go slower potentially over the first few meters but we could as libramen pointed out go much greater distances is that accurate yeah it probably is accurate but i think i would really yield to someone like dan for that kind of information because i wouldn't be confident that i'm giving you accurate information well dan is definitely someone i'd like to have on this show i'll save those questions for dan yeah i think that would be good but i do know that when we transition from walking to running it was at a time when our brains were getting bigger and we needed meat and we didn't have spears at that time so we had to really outrun our prey so we're not very fast runners but we are good endurance runners and the reason for that is because we can pant off our heat whereas these big animals like kudus have their guts sort of slosh up against their diaphragm and they can only do one breath for every step and so they aren't able to paint off their heat very well so basically what we would do is we would carve them out of the herd because we would be able to follow one and we would just run them to an exhaustion and then club them so that's why that endurance running was so important for us so we are probably among the slowest of the animal kingdom when it comes to speed but as you said we are very good endurance runners the other thing you said irene that impressed me was effectively the malleable nature of your thinking i've met many people who come up in one school of thought and i'll just use the example you gave but it's true of doctors it's true of anybody which was hey we're going to put everybody into orthotics if they have the foot issue and we're going to try to fit you to the fanciest motion control shoe or cushion control shoe or whatever and it seems that somehow in the presence of new information you seemed to very easily be able to let go of that and actually challenge yourself and say wait a minute i was very impressed by the way you described it because i'm sitting here saying how the hell did i not see something so obvious which is and i'm not an orthopedic surgeon but i certainly am familiar enough with the field to say there's really no long-term use for a brace i mean we always want people to strengthen themselves intrinsically rather than rely on extrinsic support and yet i think up until probably two years ago i took it on face value that yeah orthotics are a great thing if you need them never questioning it as you did i felt the same way about myself at that time i said to myself how have i thought this even for this length of time and i think it really was because of what i had said to you there was a number of things coming together with my research with other people's research that started to make sense to me that maybe we aren't supposed to be in this kind of footwear and maybe this kind of footwear changes the way that we run and and maybe we should be trying to strengthen our feet there were just a lot of things that came together at that time that kind of pushed me into thinking differently but i really believe that you have to evolve we have to evolve in our relationships right and we have to evolve in in our spirituality we have to involve in our scientific thinking as well and i've always believed that does it make sense first in your opinion to talk about what perfect intrinsic support of the foot looks like and then start to talk about how we got where we got in other words do you want to follow this through a time sequence of okay so two million years ago we're out there running basically we did that up until when i mean when were shoes even brought into the equation let me talk about it in that way so if we look at the fact that we've been running for two million years and we don't know exactly when the first emerged some of the first footwear that we found were found in the caves in fort rock oregon and they were dated to be ten thousand years old not saying they're the first but when we looked at them they basically were made out of sage brush bark and had a flat surface with straps that kept it on the top of the foot when you think about that they're kind of like karachi sandals the purpose of it is to protect the bottom surface of the foot from the elements and when you think of other clothing that has developed short of being fashionistas it's been to protect us from the cold the rain the heat the snow and that was really the prime purpose of footwear up until i'm not exactly sure the dates of when we started to get into some of the high-heeled shoes and some of those things but in terms of athletic footwear i'd like to talk about that before we do i just want to go back to this thing which why is it that we even needed anything to protect our feet like there's no other animal out there that needs to protect his feet so a polar bear has enough padding and insulation on the bottom of its feet that it can easily walk through its environment this is true of every single animal why did man not evolve enough protection of the foot to be resistant to scratching cutting and extremes of temperature i think that's probably another really good question for dan i hate to pass that on but we do develop calluses on our feet that help us to protect us from the elements i don't know what happened that made us maybe it's a comfort issue where it was just more comfortable you can walk out on rocks and you've seen people walk across really sharp rocks and be able to do it very lightly but it's just maybe easier maybe faster maybe more comfortable i mean that's what i'm thinking is likely to be the reason why we ended up developing footwear so we basically short-circuited natural selection on that particular element perhaps yeah and maybe that speaks to all of clothing actually aside from maybe some of the social modesty or whatever that came from it but it might have been that hey we could wait another million years and we'll develop really tough feet but what the hell we've now got a brain that tells us how to put something on these things that will short-circuit that evolutionary period okay but you know that if you end up going barefoot a lot that you develop calluses on the bottom of the foot that are protective to the feet so we do have the ability to develop that protective feature it's funny that you mention oregon where they discover the first shoe because of course oregon is the epicenter of another big revolution in shoes vis-a-vis running shoes so where did running shoes per se this idea that we're going to put something that's more cushiony on our feet it's funny like i haven't paid much attention to what running looked like 200 years ago or 100 years you know if you look back at the olympics at the turn of the last century what were athletes wearing in the marathon were they wearing basically uh just a flat piece of leather that protected the bottom of their feet exactly and up until probably the 60s the kind of footwear that we were wearing were really what we would call minimal footwear today and it basically was something that protected the bottom surface of the foot there were some developments in terms of spikes for track and so there has been a development of footwear and along that line but we're talking about distance running endurance running people were running in very flat shoes and then what happened is we had the running boom and people got very excited about running and a lot of people who were not very fit better than us today but in their time not as fit as say runners who were part of a high school team or collegiate track or cross country team took this on very quickly they developed some injuries and some of the first injuries were achilles problems because people are used to walking around with a little bit of a heel in their shoe two inch heel men's shoes got a little bit of a heel and these shoes were flat to begin with and the achilles it doesn't take much if you take out a lift you know if you just go down and walk in a flat shoe for a period of time you can develop an achilles tendon nice if you don't do it slowly and so people started to develop some problems with their achilles so they started to add a lift in the shoe just to explain that for folks who might not be familiar enough with the anatomy the achilles is the tendon that's basically joining the bottom of the big muscle of the calf the gastrocnemius right around the heel right exactly it's an extension of the calf muscle and it's the attachment structure to the heel so the more pointy your toe is relative to your heel or the more your heel is raised the more compressed that achilles tendon is in other words the less stretched out it is that's right that's exactly right so if you're used to walking around with two to three inches of heel elevation and then you start running with something that has no elevation you've got a double whammy which is one you're applying a huge stretch to something that hasn't been stretched and then going back to something you said a few minutes ago the force of that the force transfer in that transition from a walking to a running stride multiplies that stretch by some factor that's probably not linear and therefore quite destructive exactly you hit the nail on the head that was one aspect so that created this change of adding a little bit of a heel lift to athletic shoes and this is where the heel to toe drop comes from the next thing that happened is that there were some other injuries that occurred and i learned about this because i was writing a paper on the re-emergence of the minimal shoe and i wanted to know how we ever got to having a motion control and a cushioning shoe how do we get these divergent types of footwear can you explain what those are i mean cushioning to me sounds obvious but explain it in some detail so a motion control running shoe is a shoe that actually has a very stiff hill counter and it has material that's stiffer on the inside of the midsole of the shoe that helps to prevent the foot from rolling in and also may have some plastic support reinforcements on the inside of the shoe and more arch support to prevent the foot from rolling in so that would be a motion control shoe and that's typically designed for people who roll in too much this was what the original idea was the other shoe is called a cushioning shoe and it's for someone typically who has a high arch that doesn't move a lot and needs more cushioning but what happened is we started to see many more injuries in runners after the running boom and interestingly if you look at pubmed and you try to determine when the first i think the first running injury article was in 1970s it was in the early 1970s right so before then we had lots of people running and if there was a lot of running injuries you would have seen literature on it i'm not saying there weren't any running injuries of course there probably were but it wasn't such a huge issue as it has become so i really think that it's part of the fact that these people were not trained to cushion the landings because when you land you've got to cushion it and you've got to control it so if you don't have the muscles and you don't have the motor control to be able to control as your foot comes down so that you can actually attenuate the shock that you get when you land so you're not using the muscles correctly you're not landing softly then you're going to have injuries are related to impact and related to too much motion does that make sense it certainly does i want to make sure i understand what we're calling a running injury because as i've become more and more obsessed with this topic what i've come to realize is that if the feet aren't working correctly the injury can go all the way to the neck in other words what i used to assume is if your feet aren't working right your feet can hurt but then you realize well actually that translates up to the knee and oh that translates into the hip well actually that translates into the pelvis and the back and the l-spine and the t-spine and the c-spine and before you know it you realize if a person isn't connected to the ground correctly a lot of things go wrong so when you talk about this wave of running injuries that showed up on pubmed in the early 70s do you mean specifically foot injuries or what type of injuries are you referring to i think the very first reference might have been tibial stress fractures but if you look at the distribution of running injuries you're right they can go all the way up to the neck the majority of them are from the knee down if you look at the distribution the knee is the most common sight for injuries the lower leg the ankle the foot from the knee down and the knee is the primary attenuator of shock so it takes a brunt of the load you do a most of your shock attenuation through the knee what is that load by the way i mean i remember knowing this at one point you know my undergrad is in engineering and mechanical engineering so we did a few courses in biomechanical but i've forgotten so much of it but i do remember being blown away at what the load was that it was experienced by the knee so if you took like 175 pound man and he was running the shock forces felt in the knee were astronomical we're much higher than what you would expect if you were just thinking about this the ground reaction force when you land is typically the peak ground reaction force in running is typically about two and a half to three times your body weight that's the force that your body feels at the knee itself it's even higher so it can be seven times your body weight so if you're 200 pounds it could be 1400 pounds so nike actually called in three sports podiatrists when they saw all of these injuries that were occurring i got this information from an individual called jeff johnson and jeff was with nike in the early early days of nike and he worked with them and he's the person that told me that when the injuries started to occur they brought these sports podiatrists in but he said that when he was running back in the 50s and 60s in high school and college he said that nobody was getting injured and that people were running in rubber soles with canvas tops on them and he said they developed legs of steel those were his words legs of steel and they weren't having the knee pain and the stress fractures and of course that's very anecdotal but i think it's interesting that speaks to that but then when the running moon started we started to see this very quick rise in injuries so they brought these sports podiatrists in and what they told them is based on what they were seeing they felt that the injuries were related to too much impact and too much motion and it was that they had no science behind it and i truly believe that's what they thought clinically but it was that information that created this divergent motion control and cushioned shoe that we described what they did is they rather that have the runners adapt to the running they took the shoe and adapted it to the runner so instead of making their feet stronger and making them land softer runners who are running and shoes that have no cushioning at all basically like minimal shoes they adapted it and the problem with that is that then you start into the cycle where if you gives people cushioning they actually land harder and that's been shown by a number of different research studies and when you put a support the muscles get weaker and there are lots of studies that show that when you take the support away take an arch support away the muscles of the foot get stronger when you add cushioning you land harder there have been a number of studies that have shown that that new hoka shoe causes people to hit harder let's unpack that for a second because the first thing makes a ton of sense i can really see why removing an arch support will actually allow the foot to become stronger take away the extrinsic support the intrinsic muscles are forced to adapt help me understand why the cushioning of the shoe will have the relationship you've described which is a bit counter-intuitive that it would actually increase the force assume you mean the force all the way from the ground to foot and then foot to knee that's exactly right i'm going to give you an example so if you are going to hit somebody with your fist you think you're going to hit them harder if your fist is bare or if you have a padding like a glove in boxing you're right we typically do hit harder with a glove and i think a lot of it has to do with the weight of the glove you wear a 12-ounce glove you have more mass that is being thrown so are you saying it's the mass effect as well of the shoe potentially i don't think it's just the mass effect i think it's the fact that you have this protection so you can hit harder and it does attenuate some of the load but it doesn't attenuate all of the load what i believe and what's difficult is we don't have a lot of good data pre-cushioned shoes that is high-speed data that looks at foot strike pattern i think that we evolved to primarily land on the ball of her feet because when you land on your foot barefoot it's going to hurt and there was a study done by one of my colleagues looking at the pressure pain threshold of the heel and what they did is they applied pressure and then they determined when somebody felt pain and what they found is that when the pressure exceeds the pressure that you have in walking that's when people start to have pain which tells us that we naturally this hill pad was designed was adapted for attenuating the loads of walking figure we were born to be barefoot we should be able to do these things barefoot but running on your heel is very painful can be very painful because you don't have the cushioning and there's been other studies that have shown that really is footwear that has changed our mechanics from a forefoot strike to a rear foot strike now it seems to me that maybe somebody's already done this but you could go back and look at lots of old film of runners going back into the 1800s and the early part of the 1900s and if this argument is correct you would see that everybody would be a forefoot striker until the advent of cushion shoes in other words this would suggest that heel striking is something that's really only been brought about in the last 50 years is that true it's mostly true i think that as a barefoot runner it's been shown that they do vary so barefoot runners may land on their heel if you're running in grass you may have more of a tendency laying on your heel when you land on your heel you can stride out more and so for a given cadence you can go faster so it may be advantageous if you're on a soft surface to land on your heel but when you're on relatively firm surfaces there's more of a tendency to land on the ball of your foot and if you look at some of the vases the prehistoric vases that depict man running they're always running on the ball of their foot and if you look at the boston robot that runs guess what he runs on the ball of his foot i honestly believe that optimally we were adapted to do that and that's why we have a long achilles tendon we have a much bigger calf than we do in anterior we have much bigger muscle in the back than we do muscle in the front and when you think about that one of the most common injuries that runners have when they first start running is this shin splints that they call explain to people what a shin splint actually is it's pain on the front part of the leg and particularly in the anterior the muscle in the front part of the leg and if you're not used to running landing on your heel and having to use the muscle on the front part of your leg to lower your foot down you could have an overuse injury for a while until it gets used to it and so they get sore in the front part of their leg let's explain that to people because i think a lot of people won't appreciate that i think many people might not understand that you have these muscles in the front of your leg the tibialis anterior etc they're in these packed these tight little fascial compartments and the point you're making that of course i can see because i'm looking at you is an important one which is and so the listener i just hope they can sort of picture this as the heel is coming to the ground they have to eccentrically allow the rest of the foot to come down and in doing so you're not using the big muscle in the back of the calf muscle like you have to use that front muscle to control the toes as they come down and you're saying look those muscles are not nearly as big as the muscle in the back they're going to fatigue long before the muscle in the back your point here is if you just look at the shape of the human lower leg it's designed to carry more load in the back than in the front that's correct here's another really interesting biomechanical fact when you land on the ball of your foot you shift the load from the quadriceps the muscle in the front of your thigh and your knee to the ankle and the calf and when you land on your heel as a heel striker you shift the load from the calf to the knee when you think about the knee being the most common sight for injury then it makes sense and the knee and it was not really designed to take those kinds of loads in running repeatedly so but the calf is this big muscle and what happens is when you land on the ball of your foot because you have this time in which you're bringing your heel down to the ground you have that time to attenuate that force whereas when you land on your heel you come in and it's almost like a you get a very distinct impact in fact when you look at the force that the ground pushes back up at you the ground reaction force of a rearfoot striker versus a forefoot striker a rearfoot striker has an impact peak followed by a propulsive peak this impact peak is a very quick rise to peak a forefoot striker has a very nice smooth curve that's very gentle and so this impact peak is associated with a very quick application of force to the body called the load rate right and let's explain why that matters so if you can picture an x-axis that shows time and a y-axis that shows force the narrower the force is applied over time the more problematic it is and that's what you're describing which is when you strike with the toe that force peak is spread out you can picture a curve over a longer part of the time axis as opposed to a spike function which is when you're heel striking that first transfer of force is an up and down spike before you reach the propulsive phase which is over a broader application of time correct absolutely and the steeper the slope of that first impact peak the greater the rate of loading and studies have shown that rates of loading are related to running related injuries so the softer you land the less your chance of getting injured you've obviously explained a couple of benefits to heel striking you can take a longer stride i think it's worth anybody sort of playing with that in their mind and you can see why you could take a longer stride if you could strike with your heel as opposed to your toe and you've said that look there might be times when you were running on a sandy beach or you're running in the grass where the contact surface is malleable enough that you can get away with it but so far what we've learned is for the most part we've probably had two million years of running on a tow strike or four foot strike pattern and basically what happened is once people who weren't frankly fit enough to be running due to the other sedentary changes that came with our most recent evolution coupled with some well-intentioned but probably ill-informed podiatrist suggested hey we've got to lessen the load we've got to put some cushion here and we've got to make it easier for the achilles tendon which has become deconditioned basically about 50 years ago we started building shoes to fit a modern day problem as opposed to taking a modern day problem and deconstructing it to its evolutionary origin is that kind of a summary of what you've said it's exactly right and that's exactly our approach that we take in our clinic so when people come to us with injuries and they come to us and many of them come with foot orthotics habituated to foot orthotics and habituated to standard shoes our goal we believe that the closer we are to the way we evolve to move the less the risk for injury what you and i are doing right now we're sitting it's very unnatural what we evolved to do was to squat we really try to get people back into shoes that allow their feet to do what they were adapted to do and to run in a pattern that is closer to our evolutionary legacy do you believe that there are some people who shouldn't be running and i say that not from the standpoint of somebody who is so injured and they have no cartilage left but i mean if you took the average teenager who for all intents and purposes still has their body intact but either they're too overweight or they've spent too much time in a high shoe meaning a heel to toe ratio that's too great or there's something about the length of their tibia to their femur that just doesn't seem optimal in other words like we say this that we're born to run but that's obviously a great general statement but do you think that there's some nuance to this and that you know there's just some people for which running is never going to be a good idea or do you think that no peter truly anybody who still has cartilage left in those joints can be trained to do this thing well i don't believe in a hundred percent of anything there's always going to be exceptions you know that from a medical standpoint as well but i believe that running is an activity of daily living people talk about running being a skill i don't think it is we learn to run on our own we're not taught if you have children you'll see you'll watch them go from crawling to walking to running you don't get out there and you're not training them now there are some runners that can be trained to have better technique but you know what you could train walkers to have better technique as well we evolved to run and it's something that we need for fight or flight know you're going to run away from the boogeyman you're going to run after your kids running is something that is ingrained in us having said that someone is born with a huge leg length discrepancy that is really going to abnormally load them when they run that's probably not a good idea if somebody has some really extreme foot deformities maybe running isn't the best idea but i think if we looked at the distribution the normal distribution of structure most people can run and i think that the problem it starts really peter from when we our children i would love for you to take a look at a video there's a trailer on the motivation factor the motivation factor is a 90 minute documentary about a program at la sierra high school that was in carmichael california stanley pratty a marine in 1955 brought a program to la sierra that where he had every single child he recognized that only 40 percent of kids are involved in sports i mean some kids don't want to some don't feel they can so he wanted every single child to be fit and he took those kids and every single one of them had a pe five days a week 55 minutes and they went through a marine type boot camp program but he did it in a way that was highly motivational so the kids started out in white shorts and then you moved you had criteria and you were on teams the white team shortsworth team and when you got to move everybody cheered you on you got to the red team so these kids progressed all the way up they finally had to add on what they called the navy blue team and only 21 of probably at least 20 000 people that went through their school it was a 30-year program and they had 800 000 kids per class only 21 made that this program yielded children and teenagers that were so fit peter when you look at this trailer of the documentary you're going to be incredibly impressed they look like they're all military i think about that and i think that that's not hard to do he did it without any real fancy equipment the kids were doing monkey bars they were doing push-ups they were doing calisthenics they were doing the pegboards they were doing man carries they did all kinds of things that were building not only strength but physical literacy they taught them how to move those kids are all going to be able to run the reason i talk about this and those kids today are now 55 to probably 79 years old and we're actually proposing a study to follow them to look at them now where they are now and compare them to a comparable group that was growing up at that same time so to see if that sort of critical window of exposure was gonna like an exposure to language or something during a period of time that's critical would stay with them in the documentary they all talk about how much this program changed their life they attribute their success to it some of them were in really troubled homes and but aside from that the physical part of it is that when you see this documentary you see this video of these kids every one of them are fit so i believe aside from being born with some kind of neurological disability or certainly those are the ones that i would say probably don't have that same potential but if you're born with a normally intact neuromuscular system i think everybody has the ability to look like that because i saw it i sat in this class it's amazing every single kid now their body types are a little bit different but they were all fit they were all strong every one of them ran they had to run a mile each short level was a different time for their mile they all ran so i think running this is coming back to your question i think it is innate in us and i think everyone you know who has a pretty normally intact a neuromuscular system can run but to answer your question should that teenager who's overweight and has been doing video games go out and run probably not you need to get fit to run these kids are growing up being fit but if you're not fit going out and running right away is not the best thing to do because i think you need to develop that strength and that motor control i've had a lot of people who are obese that run and run without pain if you run on the ball of your foot you soften the landing going from a rearfoot to a forefoot strike so landing on your heel versus your foot does not change the peak force the peak force is the same it changes that first impact you remove that impact and when you think about the landings you have a thousand foot strikes per mile you run 20 miles a week that's 20 000 foot strikes per week you do that for a year that's a million foot strikes per foot per year so that impact you get that every single time i think that one of the things that we feel is that by getting off your heels we actually reduce you bring you farther away from your injury threshold which we all have an injury threshold our goal is trying to make sure that we keep people as far below it as possible do you have a force plate treadmill in your lab we do can you explain to folks what you see when you put like if i were to come to your lab and we were to experiment and you'd put me in making this up one day i'm gonna run in a minimalist shoe one day i'm going to run in a hoka which would be the exact opposite of a minimalist shoe one day i'm going to heel strike one day i'm going to forefoot strike what are the different things you see in that two by two so minimalist versus maximalist shoe heel versus toe strike what does the force play treadmill show you in terms of like a magnitude effect especially as we start to now map that out for what you said which is a million of those a year is not an unheard of amount for someone even running modestly well the first thing i want to ask you is can i invite you to come and do that i would happily do that okay i would love it you're in boston when i always have a reason to be there so yeah i've never run on a fourth play treadmill by the way so i'd love to know what that what that's like so if you're running in a cushioned a highly cushioned shoe most likely you're going to be landing on your heel which by the way i used to run in a hoka so i can relate i know what that feels like i know what it's like to heel strike in a hoka so when you heel strike in a hoka compared to heel striking in a conventional regular shoe normal shoe a nike air pegasus let's say you're likely to have based on research higher slopes it's called the load rate so a quicker application of force during that first impact peak if you compare a forefoot strike in regular shoes to a forefoot strike in minimal shoes you're going to see differences there the forefoot strike in minimal shoes your slope will be slightly less than forefoot striking in regular shoes but that's the vertical direction and that's all we've been talking about so far i want to introduce the concept because a force plate will give you the amount of force in the vertical direction the amount of force you're applying in the anterior posterior front to back direction and the amount of force that you can apply in a medial lateral direction so what happens is when you forfeit strike in a pair of conventional shoes you have a tendency to land in more plantarflexion than in minimal shoes which puts a greater load on the achilles that we talked about in your calf and you have a tendency to have a greater force in the anterior posterior direction explain what you're doing with your hand there for people who might not be familiar with that terminology i'm pointing my toes and i'm coming into the ground approaching the ground with a very pointed foot and that tends to push forward on the ground and the ground pushes back at you so you get this high braking force in the mediolateral direction when you forfeit strike in a pair of regular shoes you have a tendency to be more on the outside of your foot when you land this is called inversion this is you're landing on the lateral border of your foot with your medial border up right and i think of that as inversion because the bottoms of your feet now start to point inward to the midline of your body that's correct when you land that way because you're coming down on the outside of your foot you're kind of pushing outward you have a greater lateral force that you're applying to the ground so you have a greater medial by the ground reaction force so basically what's happening is you increase the force in the medial lateral direction when you are forefoot striking in a pair of regular shoes when you forfeit striking a pair of minimal shoes your toes are less pointed you tend to be less inverted so your foot is more level when you land and so you reduce the forces in the vertical direction the rates of loading the slope you reduce the slope in the anterior posterior direction and you reduce the slope in the medial lateral direction so it's the softest landing when people try to transition to a forefoot strike pattern in a pair of regular shoes they often come to me with problems with their achilles the tendon in the back and also problems with the tendon of the muscle on the outside of the leg called the perineal tendon it's a tendon on the outside leg they're so tipped laterally and they're stretching that out exactly our recommendation is if you're gonna forefoot strike there's an interaction between footwear and foot strike and it's important if you're gonna decide you want to transition to a forefoot strike pattern it should be done in minimal shoes but if you're gonna stay a rearfoot striker make sure you put cushioning under your heel because you're gonna need it because you're hitting hard now let's get one more idea across which is there are shoes that have cushioning that have no heel raise i'm blanking on a brand i have a friend who wears them and i think it starts with an a but i could be wrong but it's got about a three-quarter inch sole but it's the same at the front and the back so it has zero elevation of the heel but it has some cushioning and of course we wouldn't consider that a minimalist shoe would we you might be thinking of the topas it's not i could look it up but i guess the point is when you say minimalist we're talking really about two features no elevation of heel and no cushion or support correct yes when i talk about minimal i'm talking about a shoe you can roll up and put in your pocket okay how many brands are there of those shoes i wear a brand called xero there are another couple of brands out there there are there's many i think but some of the big brands that you think about are vivo barefoot yep that's the one i was thinking of they seem to make a pretty nice looking product yep and then there's innovate okay so is innovate a true minimalist i mean i love innovates and i have them but i've sort of migrated over to the zero because it has a wider toe box and i'm also one of the things i've been working very hard on which i'd also like to come back to so i'll just mention it now and we'll park it is spreading my toes so at the outset when you were describing the anatomy of the foot i was using my hand to pretend it was a foot you saw me doing that and you made the comment just like the hand and i threw a colleague had an epiphany a year ago which is can you imagine how unhelpful your hands would be if they were shoved into tight gloves most of the time as opposed to being able to spread apart and since that time i've been working greatly to sort of enhance the spread of my toes so that i could actually use these feet the way i can use my hands and so for that reason that's when i went from the innervate to the zero was to be able to actually get those toes across but you're saying the innovate is still a minimalist shoe because it meets the criteria that it can be rolled up into a ball some of these minimal companies actually have shoes that have some midsole so as long as the shoe has no midsole so some of them have real true minimal models and then some that add a little bit of cushioning into them so what i'm saying is if it's a model that has no cushioning has no arch support has a flexible heel counter and flexible upper and you can roll it up it's a minimal shoe now what happened after the vibram lawsuit which by the way was not about injury but about false reporting of increased muscle size with the use of the shoe i'm not aware of the lawsuit there was a lawsuit that came out against vibram and it was basically about false advertising although a lot of people because when vibrant shoes first came out a lot of people thought you could just put these shoes on and run and we need to talk at some point about transitioning but there were some reports of injuries with them and i say it's just like if you were to go to the gym and lift 100 pounds when you never lift and gotten injured you wouldn't say don't ever do that again you'd say don't do it that way well what happened with this is it really turned people against the minimal shoe and a lot of people think that the lawsuit against vibram was about injury because people there were some reported injuries in the literature it was about the fact that the nike free shoe which was the very first barefoot type shoe wasn't really quite truly barefoot or minimal had shown that you increase muscle size when you take away the support in the arch and since the vibram shoe took away the support of the arch they were advertising this could strengthen your feet that's what happened so what it did is a lot of the shoe companies sort of pulled back and started adding a little bit more to their minimal shoes i think new balance had a new balance minimus that had no midsole minimus trail i think had no midsole and then they started to put a little bit of a midsole in there because i think that they thought that that was what we needed to do to try to prevent injury but i call those shoes partial minimal shoes because some of them have a little bit of a heel to toe drop some of them have a little bit of arch support some of them have some cushioning and they have various degrees the nike free for example was the very first shoe there was somebody at nike his name was jeff pachada and he was tasked with studying barefoot running and coming up with a shoe that mimicked it that's why it has all those flex grooves on the bottom of the sole so it can be very flexible he took away the arch support he took away the stiff hill counter i mean that's a pretty thick shoe isn't it though an inch of cushioning right yes his plan was to have a nike maybe zero to ten like no cushion all the way up to full cushion barefoot all the way up to having cushioning and they started out i think with the 5.0 and they did do a 3.0 and a 7.0 if you remember these and they were either more or less cushioned but the problem with the minimal shoes are that the studies that have been done have demonstrated that when people run in a partial minimal shoe they run closer to running in a regular shoe than barefoot in which case it defeats the purpose because they're still heel striking but now they have less cushion exactly and a study that was done looking at a regular shoe partial minimal shoe and a minimal shoe over the course of a training cycle of 12 weeks the partial minimal shoe had twice the injuries as the minimal shoe and the authors suggest that it may be and they didn't look at biomechanics but it may be because the partial minimal shoe they still were heel striking but now you have less cushioning which is why i say if you're going to land on your heel put cushioning under it i'm not going to try to convince people to run a certain way when people come to me with injuries then we have a conversation about why we might want to change foot strike but if people are out there and they're happy i'm happy for them i just say you need to put cushioning under there and you need to change those shoes every three to five hundred miles i know if you know the shoes that you have the zero shoes are guaranteed for 5 000 miles i did not know that and i don't know if my wife will let me keep any one pair for that long i know i know they're growing on her she initially called them my clown shoes she was so unimpressed with them but then i got her three paired they've just evolved in terms of their fanciness now so she likes them a little bit more yeah yeah they're a little nicer you brought up something that i want to go a little deeper into so i made this mistake before with a friend which was they were wearing orthotics this was after i'd sort of bought into the thesis that hey you don't want to be using orthotics indefinitely you want to regain the strength that is intrinsic to your own foot and i sort of tried to help him wean off the orthotics but i think i did it too quickly and it ended up kind of causing him pain so walk us through how you handle a patient so patient comes to you i'll just make up an example but feel free to come up with a different one if this isn't instructive but this is someone who's athletic a former athlete even the former runner for that matter who goes on to perhaps they stop running and they come back to running they develop very bad plantar fasciitis they see a podiatrist who says the diagnosis is low arches or high arches or some arches and they need to be in a stiff orthotic and now they're in an orthotic and now they come to you and they say god i'd really love to run again but this plantar fasciitis just won't quit what can you do for me dr davis i always try to educate my patients because they need to buy into this our approach is 180 degrees from the approach that they've been given and i don't want to diss someone else i just want to say we've got a different approach and our approach is rather than adapt to you we want you to adapt to running and so that requires you using your muscles and your body in a different way and i give them the example of a neck brace this is always really very illustrative for them so if you put someone in a neck brace for life what's going to happen to your neck muscles and they say well they're going to get weak and i'm not going to be able to hold my head up so if i give you a foot orthotic for life what's going to happen to those muscles i think we all think that the arch is going to fall and the arch doesn't fall the arch actually gets stronger so when you use that kind of analogy a light bulb goes on like wow yeah they don't realize they have 10 muscles in their arch so i go through that anatomy with them i'll show them a picture of it now you've got 10 muscles and four layers in your arch of your foot they can get stronger unless you're paralyzed i don't think you're paralyzed right no so what we're going to do is we're going to slowly wean you from those orthotics and at the same time we're going to be giving you exercises to strengthen your feet so that it can start to take on the load that it's supposed to take on so what we do is we slowly wean them and we usually wean them out in the same way i used to wean people in which is i'll say take them out for an hour in the morning but keep them with you you don't want to take them out and go cold turkey and it depends again on how much they're doing if they're walking to work and they're going three miles you don't want that to be the hour that they take them out maybe walk a half a mile without them or a mile without them and then just slowly take them out and use your body to judge if your feet are feeling sore put them back in and we never take them away from them and they always can have them so if they decide at some point they want to go back to most people come to us wanting to get out of them because they're pain they're expensive and they've got to replace them at times and they stink and they just don't like the idea of it a lot of people don't so that's how we wean them out and at the same time we are strengthening their feet and we also once somebody has weaned out of them and they're able to walk comfortably without their orthotics in their regular shoes then we put them in a pair of minimal shoes like the ones you have there are lots of different brands we have three brands in our office where they can try them on decide what they like some people's feet are narrower so what are the three brands you like people to try i want to kind of be shoe agnostic because i love them all yeah yeah the three we have just because people have given them to us really are the innovates the vivo barefoots and the zeros those are the ones that people have donated the shoes to us i think in the to their advantage because those are the ones people are going to try but there are others as well and so we get them walking in the minimal shoes because we published a study that showed that simply walking in minimal shoes is as efficacious as effective as a foot strengthening program so we had three groups of people in this study sarah ridge from byu was the first author one group walked around in their regular shoes another group slowly progressed their walking steps in minimal shoes and the third group went through our foot core program over eight weeks and the foot core group and the minimal shoe group had almost the same amount of strengthening foot core group had a little bit more strengthening but it's very powerful when you think just putting a pair of shoes on is going to strengthen your feet and so we have them do that right from the get-go if someone comes to us with plantar fasciitis it's not right from the get-go and in orthotics we take that slowly because it's important that they develop they've got to give the foot time to adapt to not having the orthotic so what does that look like let's go through that in some detail yeah so it depends on the person and how long they've been in the shoes and how weak their feet are so what we do is we just try to slowly wean them out over the course of a maybe two to three weeks of weaning them out and that's sort of the protocol you described earlier which was maybe just take it off for an hour in the morning as you walk around and then an hour in the midday in an hour at night maybe something like that yep got it okay so the first goal of therapy for that patient is if i could get you for a day to just through your activities of daily living not require full arch support that's a win that's step one that's step one that's right and then we build their foot strength and we get them to wear the minimal shoes just walking and our program when we transition someone from regular shoes even if they're not in orthotics to a minimal shoe and forefoot strike requires what we call our pre-gate program so that program can be anywhere from one to three months depending on the person and their age the older you are the more time it takes typically we're a little less plastic as we age but it's a program in which we do foot strengthening we're also addressing other issues it's not just foot problems but foot hip knee we're working on functional activities teaching them how to use those foot intrinsic muscles when they're moving so it's not enough just to strengthen you've actually got to teach people how to engage them during the activity and then we do a lot of off the treadmill kinds of activities like hopping and lunging and plyometrics and jump roping and all kinds of things that help to get them to move dynamically but not run these are components of running and once they've met certain criteria which can take anywhere from one to three months depending on the person and what kind of pain they're in then we put them on the treadmill and we start to do the retraining when somebody is wanting to transition to minimal shoes even if they're completely healthy i can't emphasize enough that it's not just putting a new pair of shoes on it's changing the way that you even walk and it's putting greater demands on your foot and your ankle and so you need to give yourself time and so you need to walk and make sure you can walk for maybe 30 minutes briskly and then start to interject some running slowly because if you don't you're gonna load the foot faster than it's ready and you can create problems like plantar fasciitis or worse a metatarsal stress fracture the bones of the foot every bone your tibia those are really protected by muscle so when you have a one of the long bones of your foot the muscles on the bottom of your foot and the muscles on the top of your foot are balanced so that the strain in the metatarsal is minimized but if you have an imbalance in that muscle strength then you're going to get additional strain on these metatarsals which can lead repetitively to a stress fracture so it's really important that they strengthen you know irene i've looked at more ct scans and mri scans of people than i can ever possibly count and let's just say you're looking through the trunk or the legs the difference between a muscular person who's super fit and someone who's never exercised in their life is so apparent at the level of every muscle there's the obvious muscles you look at the quadriceps you look at the quadriceps of a muscular person i mean you can see those four muscles they are huge but even at the level of the rectus abdominis muscles you take a look at a person who's never done a core exercise or a crunch in their life and they barely have like half a centimeter thick of a rectus abdominis muscle and then you look at somebody who's incredibly fit all around you see a rectus abdominis muscle that's easily an inch thick i've never bothered to look at the mri of a foot for the same thing but hearing you talk about this makes me wonder if you look at a person who runs in a minimalist shoe who's been doing it forever who's got these amazingly intrinsically powerful feet and then you look at somebody who's using a highly supported shoe if i show you those two ct scans or mri scans just on the basis of the musculature can you see a clear difference i don't look at those very often just because i'm more on the rehab side of things i know that research shows it's been done with ultrasound that when people run in minimal shoes the volume we've done a study looking at volume of the foot intrinsic muscles as well as the cross-sectional area of each muscle gets bigger significantly bigger so i would say likely yes you would be able to notice it i know that those numbers definitely increase what i also know is there was a study recently done that was presented in a meeting it hasn't quite it's in review right now that took healthy feet and put them in a pair of orthotics for 12 weeks and then they had a control group that just weren't a pair of shoes over 12 weeks they measured that baseline and at the end of that time period the intrinsic muscles size reduced between 10 and 17 percent 10 and 17 reduction and the other group there was no change at all you wouldn't expect it what does that tell you we know that when you take away the support the muscles get bigger but it makes sense but no one has actually shown this that when you actually add support those muscles get smaller it makes perfect sense and yet we don't think about that we don't even think about the importance of those foot muscles there was a recent clinical guidelines in the physical therapy journal looking at clinical guidelines for treating plantar fasciitis and they have all kinds of recommendations ultrasound orthotics ice stretching everything but strengthening and if you look at the clinical guidelines for something like ankle sprain or knee injury or shoulder injury they all include strengthening and that's my own profession that highlights the lack of appreciation for the muscles in the foot and they're very very important so how many podiatrists would agree with your approach versus disagree with your approach and is there a position statement taken by the field as a whole on this because i've been to podiatrists myself three times in my entire life and every time i did i walked out with a set of orthotics now it could be that that's just a bad sample size but that would lead me to believe that the entire field of orthotics is built around that and i could be very skeptical and say that it has to do with reimbursement and they're making money on the orthotics and all sorts of things i'll refrain from that speculation but where does the field as a whole sit in relation to what we're discussing now so when i first started talking about this i used to present at the foot orthotic meetings with a group of podiatrists so when i started to change i think they were very surprised and i have debated on stage a very good friend of mine colleague who is very dug in about his dogma and orthotics and i think it's because they think it's working i have to believe that he thinks that this is the right thing to do but we went back and forth now this was probably i don't know eight years ago now i don't know what he's thinking now but i can tell you that more and more podiatrists are telling me that now they think about orthotics as more of a temporary thing so i think we're moving in that direction there are some podiatrists there's one that i have been in touch with recently who is very much on the barefoot running and all of that and he doesn't prescribe orthotics at all which is really unusual i went down to australia i was invited down and again this was probably about six seven eight years ago again same time period probably they asked me to give a talk on barefoot running i thought gosh do they really want to hear this because it was a big podiatric group i found that a lot of them were very open to the idea of treating people with exercise and not orthotics so it could be somewhat regional and these were also younger podiatrists so the ones that are coming up are thinking differently my husband tells me because i am a very impatient person and he said to me irene the way that you change things the way that you bend bamboo is a little at a time you add some water and you bend it things are gonna be slow to change and you just have to keep at it so my goal is to get people back into minimal shoes from day one because i think they're important for kids i don't think we should be putting kids into really structured shoes let their feet develop i think they're important for adults i also think they're very important in the aging when you have a shoe that allows your foot to be closer to the ground you're more stable that allows the muscles to act because one of the things that happens with aging as you start to lose muscle power you lose it in your feet and lower extremities first it goes from the feet up so if you can do something to help to preserve that strength that's a good thing i think it's really important we're in the process right now a group of us are writing a paper about the minimal shoe across the lifespan because i think it's not just about athletics it's about getting people into shoes up with their feet do what they're supposed to do i've really come to believe that as well irene i got my little guys some zeros last year because i sort of realized we were putting them into an ideal world i'd love for them to run around barefoot for the reasons you suggest but look you want to protect the bottom of their feet the concrete gets too hot okay fine but putting the zeros on them and hopefully they'll skip some of the stuff that the rest of us did and to your point i think as people age you know the analogy i like to think about when i talk about feet is the tires on a race car you watch something like formula one right which is the pinnacle of motorsport and what you have to remember is all of that power that thousand horsepower engine that million dollar car has only four points of contact with the road and they're called tires every bit of force generation in the ap direction and in the media lateral direction is transmitted through the drive train through the tires to the road full stop that's it so now imagine how much you could de-engineer tires to distance them from the road how much you could create lateral instability how much you could remove grip from them and i think about that through the lens of our foot if you cram your foot into a narrow little box and remove it from the surface of the road it's sort of like making your tire have less grip more slip angle and less lateral stability none of those things are desirable in attire i think if you just sort of think about the importance of connecting to the ground it does start to become pretty obvious and i actually like the way you're thinking about it which is let's not shoehorn everyone into this box if somebody comes along and says look i'll never be able to give up heel striking well that's not a person that should be going to a minimalist shoe that's fine let's hope that everything else is going okay i do want to ask you like what is a good reference for somebody let's say there's somebody listening to this now who's wearing a maximalist shoe who's heel striking and either does or doesn't have injury but says you know i want to start thinking about this transition what are the references to learn how to forefoot strike is this just something you just go out and do and start concentrating on to be honest with you i know that there are people have written books about it there are courses on pose and she running i guess i believe that it is our if you take your shoes off it's a natural way you want to run now you might still land on your heel for a little while because you're used to it but it's interesting when i was in college i was running maybe about 20 miles a week just to stay fit and i ended up with i think i can't remember what the injury was but every time i stopped it would go away and then when i'd start running came back so i gave up running i did a lot of inline skating a ton of inline skating did some marathon races and stuff in it when born duran came out and i met chris mcdougall because chris came down to he lived in lancaster lives in lancaster now and he came down to the university of dallas because he was doing a story for i think it was the times and he wanted me to run him on the treadmill and run him barefoot and that kind of thing so we got talking and he said to me you know i haven't run in so long and i think i'd really like to run again should i get those vibram shoes and he said you know what start barefoot just start barefoot and your feet will teach you and i did that's what i did i started running again barefoot my feet did teach me it's like you don't need to be taught to walk now if somebody has really bad posture you have all kinds of postures and walking as well we can improve walking i'm not saying that you can't improve the technique of someone in running but i feel like sometimes people overthink it get people in that do these really strange things like they're kicking their butt and they're not running fast they're running slow but they're kicking their butt like why are you keeping your feet up so well that you know i was told to do that so it seems like maybe just going to grass going to a forgiving environment and running barefoot and doing it for very short periods of time instead of doing like a long run say look i'm gonna go and run a few hundred yards stop regroup i'll give you an example i learned to swim as an adult i guess we could sit here and debate whether swimming is innate to our species it seems there's probably a very early window in which if you're exposed to swimming when you're you know a few months old it tends to come naturally but certainly anyone who's watched a five-year-old who's never swim you realize it doesn't look too innate but nevertheless i'm 31 when i'm learning to swim and the only way i could really do it was to understand the technique and do it in very short bursts with lots of rest so that my technique wouldn't deteriorate which basically amounted to doing a lot of drills and never really swimming more than 50 yards or 50 meters at a time until i slowly learned how to piece those together and i haven't read chi running my wife actually has it because terry laughlin who's the guy that taught me how to swim he's no longer alive but terry created a program called total immersion for swimming he was very good friends with i forget is it danny what's the guy who wrote chi running oh yeah i've met him danny yeah i can't remember dan's last name i can't recall but terry and danny were friends and when terry knew that my wife was a runner he got her connected and i guess i should go back and read the book i'm very curious now about what the methods are but it really is whether you decide you never want to run for the sake of running or whether you decide i actually do want to run i want to use running as a form of my exercise i just don't think you can make a strong enough case for why it's imperative that we learn to use our feet better that's sort of my thinking on this subject matter is the minimalist shoe becomes a vehicle through which we learn to acquire the contact of our feet to the ground and if you want to run that's essential yeah i agree i want to go back to something that you said about when you start running this is another thing i asked chris first of all i asked him should i where the vibrancy goes now you really need to go barefoot so you get all the sensory input and i said you know i like to paint my toes i go chris i don't want to get calluses he goes honey the world is your pumice stone but he told me don't start in grass and the reason for that is that when you start in grass well first of all grass is more dangerous i've never cut my foot i have burned my foot on hot pavement at times because i wasn't smart enough not to run when it was really hot but the problem with running grass is first of all you can't see what's there i'd be a little nervous running barefoot and grass honestly i've cut my foot in the sand sharp shells and things like that so if you can't see what's underneath it but the other thing is that when you run on a soft surface you stiffen your leg this is amazing thing about our leg spring you have this ability this innate ability to modulate the stiffness of your leg so when you land on hard surfaces you make your leg compliant so if you're going to step off of a three foot step and land on concrete you're going to land as soft as you can you're going to flex your ankles your knees your hips but if you land in sand you're going to stiffen you don't want to collapse into it so you stiffen on soft surfaces and there's lots and lots of studies that have shown this this is definitely true this is why when you have a cushioned shoe go back to that that you tend to land hard if you train on grass there's nothing wrong with starting on grass it's fine but when you train on hard surfaces it teaches you to be really compliant and that's what chris told me to do she said start on the hard surfaces if you're gonna run do most of your running on hard surfaces like people who compete mostly always on hard surfaces unless you're doing track then you need to train your leg to be compliant i tell people you can mix it up it's fine but make sure you do a good part of your training on the surface you're gonna do most of your running on so don't do all of it on soft surfaces really and again if the hardest part is making your leg nice and compliant and when you make compliant you're actually using muscles to attenuate so it's work it's worked to make it compliant so yeah i would start that way thanks for clarifying that that's interesting now i want to go up the chain a little bit you alluded to the knee and i want to talk about other issues of the knee so is knee valgus an issue are you concerned with that do you see when a person's running and they have a significant valgus and i'll let you explain to people what that is how much of an issue is that and is that basically always a pathologic finding sometimes a pathologic finding and does it always result from the foot there's a lot of questions there i'm known for that irene that's what i do i'm gonna i'm gonna give you a lot of questions i'm known for saying there's never 100 of anything i'll never say always and never say never there are people who have terrible alignment that aren't injured and there are people of good alignment that are injured and part of it is because these injuries are multifactorial and if we just take the mechanical part of it part of it's related to your structure that's just how you're built and then how you move your motor control and then your dosage how quickly you ramp up and how much dosage you have so you could have someone who has a problem with their alignment but they're keeping their dosage down so they don't get injured so you can look at them and it looks like that they should be injured but they're not that might just be because they're keeping their dosage down um you get someone that looks really well lined and really good mechanics but because they did too much too quick so it really is not a one-to-one and here's the other thing that's really interesting you can have someone who's got knee valgus and have five people one could have a knee problem it manifests as a knee problem one it could manifest as a hip problem another person it could be their medial foot another person could be their plantar fascia so it's not a mapping of one to one and you can have somebody with knee problems one of them might have excessive valgus another might have a really stiff landing you see what i'm saying so it's what makes it so much fun to figure out but it's not straightforward it's not a one-to-one mapping having said that there are these patterns that we tend to see with injuries so i had to kind of preface it with that but the two features that we see most often with injuries and we've had over 700 through the running injury clinic so far at our center are high impacts landing hard and malalignment in general but the most common malalignment is a medialization of their leg so when i say that i mean there's valgus so the knees come in towards each other so instead of these the legs being straight the knees bow in they can't go out that's why there's other alignments this is most common though the kneecap rotates inward so the kneecaps start to look at each other a rotation inward of the leg often and the pelvis drops to each side every time you land the other side drops down then you land on the other leg the other side drops down it can be just on one side all those seem to go together and they're the most common and i think that a lot of that relates if we talk about evolution it goes back to the fact that when we sit as much as we're sitting now in our lives we don't have the core stability short of if we're really going at it and really making sure that we're addressing our core which not a lot of people do and that core instability just like the instability of the foot you don't have the core muscle we call it the foot core for a reason it's just like the lumbar pelvic core if those muscles aren't doing their job then the prime movers can't do their job and you have malfunction so i believe that we see a lot of this instability because we are so weak in our course and we don't have that kind of stability and those kids i mentioned from la sierra high school i betcha if i looked at them run they wouldn't have those kind of mechanics so it is a very common kind of problem that we see in terms of mechanics is that valgus irene when you talk about the elevation and depression of the hemi pelvis i think everybody knows what you're talking about which is basically the hip hiking that occurs one side to the other it's actually not a hiking it's the other hip dropping i see so the one side is actually staying level the other side is actually depressing okay right and it's the side so if you're on your right leg it's the right hip that keeps the left hip from falling down so it's the opposite side that drops so if on my right leg it's my right hip muscles that hold my hip my pelvis level i got it because the left foot's not on the ground that's not under load it's swinging through so this drops unless these muscles are doing their job and then when you go to the other leg so now i'm on my left leg then my pelvis is going to drop to my right because the left hip muscles are not doing their job you mentioned the core which is obviously a very broad term so are you referring to the intrinsic muscles of the pelvis along with the transversalis fascia and all these muscles or is it also in part the result of the adductors and abductors being too weak this is such a complicated part of the anatomy that it's hard to get a handle on what muscles let's use the example you gave so the right foot is on the ground striking the left foot is now sweeping the left hip has now gone down right so what's not firing that should be i think it's all of the above i think you need that stability of the small muscles that actually stabilize the hip in its socket i think you need the abdominals that prevent the pelvis from anteriorly tilting so you get a tilting of the top part of the pelvis forward and the back part of the pelvis backwards that tilting is also associated with rotation inward of the thigh they kind of go together and then if the abductors are not doing their job you get the drop it really is all of it but you need that stability also of the core and the core really is the sort of the transverse the deep muscles that stabilize and it's not always weakness we think about it we talk to our patients and say you've got your hardware and your software your hardware is the strength of your musculoskeletal system that's your hardware but the software is your motor pattern so we see people who are not that weak but they are a mess mechanically because they just aren't using the muscles in the way that they should another injury i'd like to ask you about is which i've struggled with not in a long time i got it under control by strengthening my abductors but is it banned and a lot of people get this really miserable pain on the side of their knee i think most people are familiar with what that is but the it band is this sort of tendinous thing that connects to a muscle called the tensor fasciae latae which is basically at your hip what are some of the things that you see exacerbating that it band syndrome and do any of them actually tie all the way down to the foot and what we've talked about it can that's a very good point so we did a study looking at people with it ban syndrome compared to healthy controls and we looked at their mechanics and we have two studies one of them was retrospective that means that these people were now healed but they had a history of it ban syndrome and we compared them to their controls then we had another study where we had people were healthy to start out with and we looked to see who got injured and who did not that is a stronger design because there you can say they didn't have the injury here are the mechanics and it led to this injury whereas when you look retrospectively which is easier to do from a scientific standpoint you've got to wait for the injuries in a prospective design but in a retrospective you can just go and get people have a history but you don't know whether the injury caused it or it was there before we've done both kinds of studies and we found the exact same results which to me is very compelling what we found in the mechanics was that people with it band syndrome had greater inward angulation of their thigh which can kind of contribute to valgus and the reason that that's important is because the it ban attaches to the distal thigh there's a very robust attachment not just to the tibia gertie's tubercle which is a little bump on the lateral lower leg bone but it also attaches to the end of the thigh bone and so when the thigh comes in too much it stretches it the other thing that stretches is when the pelvis drops because the it band comes all the way up and it doesn't certain fasciae latae and the glutes so the drop of the pelvis and the inward angulation of the thigh just puts a big strain on the it band and if it's already tight as you flex and extend your knee it goes back and forth over the bump on the lateral end of the thigh bone so it just rubs you get this pressure you can have that pressure excessive pressure to start with and then if you increase the amount that your hip comes in and your pelvis drops it just further exacerbates it so that's one cause of it the other mechanic that we saw both retrospectively and prospectively again very strong results was internal rotation of the tibia so the tibia is the lower leg bone now the it band also attaches to the tibia so as the tibia rotates inward it stretches the it band so when you ask me about the foot the tibia is connected to the the leg bones connected to the foot bone so if you're excessively pronating it can excessively internally rotate your tibia it can be from the foot and it can be from the hip and when you think about the knee in all kinds of knee injuries it's the joint in the middle of the foot and the hip so it often is the victim of issues with the foot or the hip pronating in this context is the opposite of inversion yes pronating and supinating it's just another term for it but yeah so you're rolling your foot inward too much the analogy would be the e-version inversion and e-version sometimes also referred to as supination and pronation that's very interesting it speaks to this idea that you've got to be able to at least try to identify the cause of this with some gait analysis i think in my case when my i.t band hurt i just assumed it was the first explanation you gave and it was because once i took on a robust program of strengthening the glute mede basically especially from an eccentric standpoint so really did a lot of eccentric strengthening of the glute mead all of a sudden you now have the ability to keep the femur out you take that valgus and lengthening away of the it ban and the pain gets better i was experiencing it on a bicycle actually not running nevertheless but the point here is i never even thought about it through the lens of if you have enough eversion or pronation you're gonna pull on the other head of that tendon which is attaching to the tuberosity of the tibia i mean it's really an amazing field you're in because it is truly an engineering field i mean it's a structural one of the things i'm doing with my daughter right now this summer is we're working on physics she's in sixth grade it's more about the fun of physics but last week we worked on free body diagrams drawing forces and the direction of this force the direction of that force and the magnitude of this versus that and we're basically just doing newtonian physics and going through the three laws this would be a great thing for me to now show her as she's sort of thinking about this muscle's pulling this way but if this one's pulling that way look what could happen and the ground reaction force is another great example because they are equal and opposite it's newton's third law you push down the ground pushes you up so when you push down on the ground you're a free body diagram of the world you are pushing down on the world but the world's so massive it doesn't move and you get all the chinese people on the other side they're pushing up remember on the other side of the world but the force that's coming back at you because your mass is so much smaller creates your movement so it is all physics and this is why i have loved being in this field is because i get to marry physics with medicine let's go back and close the loop then on that sort of forced discussion around how it is that joints can experience an amplification of that force so the reason that it amplifies the force is because the ground reaction force the muscles have to respond to the ground reaction force and so if you have a force that is directed say let's take the knee and it's directed behind the knee it's going to create a flexion moment on the knee and so the knee has to extend in order for you to be able to prevent yourself from collapsing so it creates these muscle forces around the joint and when the muscle forces act around the joint they compress the joint inward and so they create an increase that's how they get amplified it's really amazing because and this will be probably more than you would want to explain to a 12 year old but this is where the free body diagrams become really complicated because it's not just i hit this thing with 200 newtons it hit me back at 200 newtons no that 200 newtons gets into the joint and then the joint has its own internal moment arm that's going to add as you said earlier potentially 7x that force and then of course depending on the length of that moment arm i mean we're talking about really serious forces here do you ever just sit back and look at this and think how the hell did we even evolve like it's so remarkable at what our bodies are capable of isn't it yeah it is and the fact that we're so adaptable is the thing that's amazing i mean this is why i love mechanics because we can adapt we can't change our structure short of doing osteotomies which i'm not qualified to do meaning making changes in alignment in the bones mechanics though is something that's very modifiable and for a long time people did not believe that when i first started in this business i was a young scientist and i went to a meeting and i talked about gate retraining runners wow i got virtual tomatoes thrown at me i remember it and people saying you can't change the way somebody moves that we have these automatic generators of of gate but if you actually study it we do have the ability supercortical ability to modulate our gait pattern and so it's been really fun to be able to say okay i see that in your gate i'm going to change it it's not easy i have to say it's not easy because in order to change somebody's gait you have to give them a lot of practice they've got a certain pattern that they have and they've had it for 20 years 40 years 60 years depending on how old they are and we've done gateway training across that age span you need to be able to give them feedback to begin with so that they start to learn okay this is right this is what i see that's right if it's visual feedback this is what it feels like now i know what's right then you have to start to fade the feedback so now they have to feel what's right without having it because they're not going to have it and then you have to give them a lot of practice that process of changing your gait though i think it's worth it if you've been injured and we think that the mechanics are causing the injury you have to be patient with it and even when you finish so in our program i started to tell you we have a say on average a two month pregate then they have a three time a week four week gait retraining on the treadmill and then they go out for 10 weeks under our supervision they're out running on their own but we check in with them they come and see us at two weeks and at four weeks and they have to start really slow they can't go really fast because even though they've maybe got the pattern now if they want to start ramping up they've got to give the tissues the time to adapt it is a process that takes patience and if someone's going to come to us and say hey i'm doing this new york marathon two months we say we can't do this right now we'll give you some exercises and try to help you out but you're gonna need a lot more time than that what percentage of those patients irene are people that have no injury but have bought into this thesis which is my gait's probably not adequate and i'm going to get injured one day so i want to do this in a totally preventative manner versus people who are actually under the spell of some injury at the time that they show up so in order to be able to have the treatments paid for you have to have an injury they wouldn't get it covered in terms of retraining so i would say we have had people come in for just an eval for us to kind of take a look at their gait sometimes a spouse will give it to their spouse as a christmas gift or something like that but in terms of people come through the program it's a hundred percent people who've been injured which seems to be a bit of a failure of the system that's sort of the same problem we have in medicine which is look we'll wait till you have type 2 diabetes at which point it's going to cost the health care system somewhere between 7 and 12 000 a year including insulin but god forbid we spend i don't know 500 a year on prevention to make sure you never get type 2 diabetes it seems to me that a great investment at least for the people who are motivated would be taking people who are not injured and teaching them what you were talking about so let me tell you about a study of one of my colleagues he was one of my postdocs that he went on and did a study where he took 320 novice meaning they'd been running a year or less i think they'd all been running at least a year but not much more than that and then what he did is he took half of them and had them train on a treadmill because the same kind of retraining program we have where they had a monitor and they could see those impacts that i was telling you about and i can give you some graphs of these and so what they did is they were told to get rid of the impact to land softer and he didn't monitor what they did but in order to do that they probably got off their heels and then the other group went through the same eight sessions they did eight sessions they slowly ramp up from 10 minutes to 30 minutes over this eight sessions and then he followed them for a year and these are healthy people 62 percent reduction in injuries in the group that was trained to land softer 62 reduction over the course of a year that's huge what's most amazing to me in that study if i understand you correctly irene is that they weren't given an explicit instruction of how to change their form it was basically they adapted to the visual stimulus of just make that spike smaller and they figured out what to do and then in what sounds like a relatively short period of time made the adjustment the adjustment stuck am i replaying that correctly to you yes i think you are the thing that we're not sure of because he didn't and this is one of the criticisms of the studies that he never brought them back later to see if it did stick so not sure and it may be that some people did get reduced the spike where others may have eliminated it by being on the ball of their foot i would like to know if the people on the bottom foot had less injuries dan's group did a study dan lieberman's group did a study looking its retrospective of the harvard track team and found that the kids who were forefoot strikers on the track team had half of the running he classified them into overuse injuries and they had half of the injuries of the river strikers because it's retrospective it's not as strong as being prospective but another really interesting piece of information in terms of how this might apply to running teams is that there's a group it's a close christian community and i won't name them because they don't want to be named but it's a closed christian community the doc of the close christian community basically went through medical school his physician and he had all kinds of foot related problems and all of his residents and fellows and colleagues who were giving him advice and he got like three pairs of orthotics and nothing helped him it was when born toronto had come out and he kind of looked at it and put the book down and they decided to read it and they decided that he's going to try to go barefoot and minimal and it cured his problem resolved his problem i could say it's cured it but it resolved his problem so now he as a member of this community they pay for your medical school and you come back into the community and he's the physician in the community the track team of this community had had some members that had season ending injuries running injuries but before that he started to prescribe minimal shoes for some of his patients that weren't responding to standard of care so he used to really send all of his foot related patients to a podiatrist and then he started deciding i'm going to try this because it worked for me say this first woman who just wasn't getting better with the orthotics and the standard of care so he said look i know you may think i'm crazy but would you be willing to try this and it worked and they tried it again and he tried it again and he tried again to the point where he was so convinced that this was working they actually decide the footwear they have a clothing store because nobody pays for anything it's all common money and at a clothing store he ordered minimal shoes so 80 percent of their community now are in minimal shoes and he showed a graph of the number of referrals to podiatrists went down as his prescription of minimal footwear went up and with that success in the normal community with walking he decided to try it with the cross-country team he was the physician for the cross-country team the coaches went along with it so they basically started in january and had the kids start transitioning in january before the september season so they had what nine months of slowly working into the minimal shoes and they ended up that year having no injuries and winning their division and then they had a second year of i think winning they got bumped up even though we're a small school because they were so successful they got bumped up to the next division i think they came in second and they had basically no injuries like one sprained ankle but no tibial stress fractures no plantar fasciitis no anterior knee pain no it all the things that you see and he's had a third year i think this is the third year and then we had co yeah he had a third year because comet i haven't really talked to him since i can't publish this because they want to stay private and i understand that but it's just unfortunate i can't publish it but basically it's just an example when you have this kind of ability to control it and you look and see that it can have that kind of result this is why i say i would love to see people all start their kids this way and have people run this way i think our running mechanics would improve i think we wouldn't have the same kind of problems with feet i don't think we'd have the same kind of problems with these this is my hypothesis and i admit it's a hypothesis and some people think i'm a little bit crazy but i don't we're really coming back to your points about evolution it's the way that we evolved to be and so i feel like we have everything we need and that when we start to add shoes we've been talked about this much you add torques to the ankle knee and the hip so when you look at the torques at the ankle knee and hip they are the lowest with barefoot that's like your gold standard and the minute you start to add footwear low heel and higher heel and more athletic shoes with more flares to the outer sole the torques go up now does the increase in torques cause a problem i don't know but they certainly are increased above what we're adapted for it's like how do we facilitate natural movement in a modern world and it's a challenge i share your view i share your bias i'll say that that if you took every kid when they were born and you kept them in minimalist footwear and they never sat down in chairs so you squatted you sat on logs you stood but this idea of a desk in a chair was taken away i would put those as two of the five most important things you could do like if i could be czar of the world and i could have five things that i would do to change human health and i was given the liberty of going and starting at the beginning so saying you could implement these changes from the moment a person is born those are two of the five i'd take right there i couldn't agree with you more because we see so many problems with feet and hips and it's all related to that i just couldn't agree with you more i think that we got to start it there and i think that we would be solving a lot of the problems we're going to get phys ed and this is going a little off topic but i'm really wanting to see phys ed back in schools every single day and not just dodge ball but activities that actually calisthenics push-ups sit-ups using your upper extremities monkey bars kids hanging from i mean we don't do that anymore i think we need to really encourage that kind of activity the statistics are overwhelming it's just so unbelievable i think by the time adolescence you're 12 to 17 years old on average kids have at least one chronic disease not all kids maybe it was 40 of kids i can't remember the exact numbers but it was really alarming and a fairly large percent of them had two chronic diseases as adolescents that to me is really alarming we shouldn't be having chronic diseases as kids diabetes is really high in kids now it's grown it's really increased yeah and i think the chronic injury issues another problem which is if you're a kid that if you're having knee pain and hip pain and all these sorts of issues when you're 18 or when you're in college it's not like it's going to get better when you're out of college without a very deliberate effort we definitely need to get our kids so that they're not doing a single sport it's been shown that those kids actually burn out quicker they get injured at a higher rate that it's important for kids to be using their bodies in a number of different ways that multi-sport athlete is much healthier than the single sport that doing soccer all year long irene i gotta say i'm pretty glad that hoover sent you that rejection letter yeah 50 years ago right because i think the human condition is a better place for you not having become an fbi agent though i'm sure you would have been an excellent one at that and despite what you said about your patients i don't detect in you someone who has an unhealthy amount of impatience i detect in you just the right amount of impatience which is you've kicked the hornet's nest enough you've stirred up the pot enough but what impresses me the most in this discussion and i knew from reading what you'd written and sort of your credentials that this would be an interesting discussion but what doesn't come across in all of those is how malleable you've been in your thinking and how many ways and times you've changed your view based on new evidence that's put forth and that leads me to believe that five years from now if we speak again you're going to have something different to say which i always view as a sign of good thoughtfulness with that said i want to thank you very much
