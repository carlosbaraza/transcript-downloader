Julia Wattacheril is a physician scientist & director of the Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) program at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. In this episode, Julia delves deep into the complex world of liver health, beginning with a foundational overview of liver physiology. She provides an in-depth look at how alcohol impacts liver function, breaking down the metabolism of ethanol & its detrimental effects. Julia then shifts the focus to understanding liver function tests & optimal enzyme levels, providing a detailed explanation of AST & ALT & elucidating why fluctuations in these levels may or may not be concerning. She provides a primer on the four major stages of liver disease, discussing risk & emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. Julia highlights the role of liver disease in increasing the risk of cancer & cardiovascular disease & covers in detail the various strategies for diagnosing, treating, & preventing the progression of liver disease. Dr. Wattacheril’s views expressed in this conversation reflect her own, not those of her institution.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] when I see a patient I am trying to figure out what is the leading risk for their not just mortality but quality of life implication um is it something that is liver-based or is it something outside of the liver and this is not necessarily um including malignancy risk but sometimes does for very early stage disease so not even stage one fibrosis we talk a lot about eventual development of diabetes a common thing that I'll say is somebody with an elevated cap score on a F scan here's your fat score here's your scar score your scar score is normal um your fat score is ex exceedingly high it's very modifiable six weeks to six months it can be in the normal range unchanged you will most likely develop diabetes in X number of years depending on what their insulin risk profile will be that's not usually received in a scary way that's received in a oh I can actually change my diabetes related risk in a meaningful way and see an outcome in a year or two on a scan so empowering patients with with information and then also um working in partnership with endocrinology and Cardiology in terms of what their cardiovascular risk might look like and how to modify it and how to make it sustainable I think that's the biggest thing that we deal with um when it comes to liver disease and Scar if it is five to seven years you know on average um to develop stages uh to progress that's a lot of sustainability and a lot of the behavior changes that we see are related to circumstances um so how to build resilience not just in terms of their metabolism and their metabolic flexibility but what their coping skills are what they reach for in different instances that's early stage disease hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music]

[00:01:52] AA hey Julia thank you so much for joining me today um very important topic and um very relevant topic both in the uh uh sort of narrow scope of what I do clinically and I think the broader scope of what what many clinicians do and and frankly what anybody listening needs to be mindful of given the epidemic we're about to discuss um but why don't you tell folks a little bit about uh your training uh what it means to be a hepatologist and uh what what led you there sure um thanks for having me and thanks for being concerned about the liver uh so I am a transplant hepatologist so my clinical hat is about 50% divided into liver transplant and 50% divided into General liver care how

[00:02:35] I got to that path um so I did medical school in Houston at the Baylor College of Medicine Residency there as well a GI fellowship at vanderville and Nashville and then uh my transplant Fellowship uh Colombia um when it comes to sort of my faculty time Division I I tend to focus on mled or naff as it used to be called and so metabolism and the Nexus with

[00:03:01] Endocrinology is also a big focus of mine so let's take a step back maybe and just give folks a sense of what the liver does um people have probably heard me say this before but it's always worth repeating um the liver is this essential organ for which we don't have extracoporeal support um so what that's just a fancy word that means outside of body support so if a if a person's lungs don't work we saw this a lot during covid but obviously we see this all the time you have extracoporeal support you have a ventilator that can do the job of the lung for a temporary period of time hours weeks even months um believe it or not if the heart doesn't work we have extraoral support in in terms of you know in roric balloon pumps or even ventricular assist devices and obviously if the kidneys don't work we have extracoporeal support in the form of dialysis now I'm not suggesting any of these things are a substitute for the real thing but they're remarkable bridges that save many lives and yet

[00:03:59] Julia we don't have anything that even remotely resembles extracoporeal support for the liver so we have this essential organ and yet if it is injured we don't even have a way to bridge people to transplantation um anything you want to say about that I mean is that is that just a kind of a staggering feature I think of of this organ it's it's not for lack of trying there have been um devices like the Mars machine that have been developed and I think as you're appropriately bringing up what we learned in covid um a lot of liver disease the bulk of liver disease has historically been chronic and so you have time for intervention it's the acute phases that we really need um either a 3D printed liver or an accessory liver um that could function either inside the body or outside of the body so those efforts are being undertaken but uh it's it both hearkens to the complexity of what the liver does and how hard it is to mimic one um when the liver is injured what it can do um but it also gives you a focus on sort of the the panoply of liver diseases the the timeline to development of liver disease and the functional aspect of what it takes to actually get some of these devices um to Market yeah I'll share one last funny story about this you might you might be aware of this but when when um uh when I was at Hopkins one of the attendings who had trained at one of the universities in Virginia told a story about when he was in his training they were using um baboons as a bridge to transplantation so I'm not talking about xenot transplantation they would literally put a baboon in a bed next to the human in acute liver failure they would run conduits between them and obviously they had somehow matched the baboon to the human and they would basically circulate the human's blood through the the baboon using the baboon's liver to detoxify you know and Carry Out glucano

[00:06:06] Genesis or whatever other features were critical in the acute moment um and apparently this somewhat worked you could take a person who was completely jaundice you know on the verge of death and buy them another week or so until a liver transplant showed up and according to the story of this one attending it worked really well until once a patient emerged from um basically a state of unconsciousness uh due to their liver failure and realized what was going on and freaked out and panicked and pulled the canulas out and it turned into a big bloody mess that of course ended with the baboon dying and the patient nearly dying and that put an end to it I don't know if you've ever heard any of these stories but that always stuck with me as the depths to which um you know one one had to go to try to you know basically save people during this period of acute liver failure while you um either hoped for a recovery end or found a transplant and any of those stories ever come your way not so much the animal portion but um if you read about accessory livers and so you know we learn a lot about this from living donation and so how much liver is required when people are in acute liver failure um it's not something apart from the Pediatric population that a small segment of liver could actually solve um but for accessory livers you're implanting human liver to basically function um as a temporary means of metabolism and uh recovery of immune function and all the other functions that we'll get to um but it's much more on The Human Side than than canulas to to a baboon which is a a good mimicker I think um we learned a lot in liver disease from alcohol and the baboon is was one that mimicked sort of human responsiveness more so than other animal models so I could see that being there were baboons that were forced to drink alcohol so that we could sort of better understand the impact of alcohol in the human liver and how much you know is nutrient deprivation from carbohydrate load from alcohol versus yeah direct injury to the liver interesting okay so let's let's talk a little bit about what what the what the liver does I mean why why is the why is it that this organ everything we've just said is true right that um one it's clearly complex enough that in the year 2024 we still do not have a way to approximate it the way we do most other vital organs um and two it there's something about it that's obviously quite susceptible to injury in the modern environment so maybe just start with anywhere you want whether it be just the basic physiology of it or you know how how would you how would you get people to to understand and appreciate the absolute beauty of this what I consider very underappreciated organ yeah I'll start with what comes up and when patients bring up uh misinformation it's an opportunity to learn that we need to do better about informing so it's about 3 and a half pounds sits underneath your right rib cage sometimes people get it on the wrong side that's in in most humans it's on the right um and it's the largest internal organ um so basic functions there's over 300 functions so we'd exhaust our entire time together if we went through all of them but a big one that hepatologists don't necessarily get trained in much is metabolism we've left a lot of that to the endocrinologist so we think about ranal liver diseases so common things like mled or nafl alcohol autoimmune hepatitis things that affect the whole liver um and then uh cholestatic liver diseases or bod duct the plumbing system of the liver um hopefully in your show notes you can give a basic anatomy or a diagram of what the liver looks like but a lot of what's read about the liver is focused on one versus another component so it's just really important for any audience member who's looking at a tiny piece of liver information whether it's biochemistries or a picture to understand it in the context of what the liver does and some of the basic functions of the liver so we said metabolism and that's proteins lipids and fat um carbohydrate metabolism um it serves an immune function um we learn a lot about what the liver does from what it what happens when it doesn't work well so one of the major proteins that it makes are the synthetic proteins that help you plot blood so bleeding disorders are common in people with liver dysfunction the other one that comes up a lot is detoxification um and so whether it's metabolism of pharmacologic agents that people are taking in or any supplement or exogenous compounds or even toxins um environmental toxins um all of those get processed in the liver handled by the liver um and hopefully detoxified by the liver so those are just a few of the many functions um I include the nutritional components so bile acid production all of those things within the metabolic chamber the way that I think about the functions of the liver but that in and of itself could be a whole different you know category some of the the nutrient load handling so would you would you kind of agree with my U non- hepatologist framework which is I think of the big four things that the liver does which we've largely touched on although one we didn't quite touch on but uh clearly metabolism as you've said and that includes what I think is the most amazing thing that the liver does which is regulate blood glucose um and I I think that's something that's um it's almost impossible to describe how perfect the liver is able to do this including in someone with type 2 diabetes which we'll talk about where you know you end up being about 2x too much blood sugar but that's still a relatively uh narrow band with which blood glucose is regulated compared to the extremes right if it ever Falls below about 50 milligrams per deiler or half a teaspoon total glucose circulating you're dead if it really ever gets above 4 or 500 acutely like you're dead and that it can keep most of us around 100 to 200 is incredible at the minute by minute second byc uh deviation you talked about again about synthetic stuff I'm sure we will talk about that and how again in extreme cases if the liver can't make those clotting factors um and then we we talked about detoxification which I I you know that's probably the one I know the least about but obviously we see the results of it but the other one that I think probably doesn't get enough attention for most people is the amazing role that the lipid plays that the liver plays in managing um the the the lipoproteins and you know the the clearance of lipoproteins the generation of lipoproteins and again you know just a kind of a

[00:13:02] Herculean feat for one organ to be involved in these four profoundly important things um so look I think if by now we haven't made the case for why everybody should care about this organ we probably never will um let's talk a little bit about the history of liver disease because I think there's a bit of an evolution here right this thing we're going to spend most of our time talking about um is is a you know quasi recent phenomenon in the last you know depending on how far back you look but it's it's clearly not the dominant issue so um is it safe to say Julia that infectious agents were the predominant driver of liver injury you know 100 years ago 200 years ago is that what really led to it or was it toxins in the environment I mean when people died from liver disease a 100 years ago what what was the cause and I think that's your question also hints a common popular con ions of why does someone have liver disease so I think toxins alcohol being the number one thing that we've studied since the 1700s 1800s um and then the onset of viruses um and the study of non a not b which eventually became

[00:14:15] Hepatitis C so all of that to say the liver was this recipient of external harm and so I think that goes to show why we've sort of undervalued some of the natural resilience and endogenous effect of its inherent metabolic function because we've focused on derangements which as doctors we tend to do focus on the the problem and try to treat the problem but those um perturbations in normal liver physiology based on an exogenous agent leads to structural issues leads to histologic issues and that sometimes limits us when we talk about metabolic the study of metabolic disease for instance if we perseverate on an ALT or aminot transferases that's probably not the best marker of understanding um fatty liver disease or or metabolic dysfunction um and the framing around how we think about liver injury from an exogenous compound or as a result of a metabolic derangement um plays a role in in understanding longitudinal progression of the disease um is it an external insult and then taking care of humans no one is in isolation so

[00:15:27] Behavior environment change over time habits change over time and all of those serial perturbations and how to monitor and follow those perturbations also inform how we're going to move forward from our old way of thinking about um how to measure liver disease injury um how to prevent it and and again um how much time we have to intervene so one of my favorite books I read in residency was the biography of Thomas darel who pioneered liver transplantation so you know everyone who pioneered an organ transplant is kind of a giant in the field whether it's uh you know the

[00:16:04] Pioneers Murray of of of um of liver of kidney transplantation or shamway in cardiac transplantation notice I omitted um the guy in South Africa not just because I forgot his name for the moment but because I think he sort of ripped off shway um but um but I think none of these figures was bigger to me than starel um in part because I think it was the hardest organ to to transplant um and this is is true not just technically but I think perhaps metabolically at the time when starel finally succeeded and when I say starel really I really mean is starel and all of his colleagues of course um if my memory serves me correctly it was probably in the late 60s when they finally succeeded in doing this does that sound about right 67 67 yeah that that rings a bell um what was the dominant indication for liver transplant how often was it being done for an Ute injury in that first era versus chronic injury that became untenable so I think whenever you're talking about a new intervention and surgeons or any high-risk uh taker for a new intervention the indications are going to have to justify some of the risk and so um acute liver failure um liver injury without failure would not be an indication so there has to be sort of a life-threatening um situation for someone to justify the risk um that's associated not with just the explantation and implantation but also the the post care so indications at that time from a liver disease perspective would be a little bit different than they are now um well now in the pandemic alcohol has really really um surpassed a lot of other um more chronic indications that we thought were going to sort of eclipse alcohol at this point and that's sort of behavior and coping mechanism with stress um but alcohol rated liver injury and then viral hepatiti these I'm talking about chronic sorts of chronic adult liver diseases would be the top two same same ones we've referenced before but acute liver failure um paracetamol or um acetominophen injury um most common cause of suicide attempts outside of the United States um King's

[00:18:22] College criteria how we've learned a lot about the the function and dysfunction of a liver during acute liver failure is all learn from those um toxin related exposures and acute liver failure what percentage of patients who overdose on Tylenol and who uh cause a fatal or what would be fatal injury of the liver are able to receive a transplant in time is it I assume it's a very small number it's small um I think Will Lee's work um at UT Southwestern and has has really encapsulated this so there's lots of variables um and whenever we talk about studies versus Real World I'll just reemphasize um in terms of accessing liver transplantation um there's many logistic variables including payment and social supports it's a complex decision um but for indications versus transplantation um at our Center uh it's around it's under 10% are due to acute liver failure and a subfraction of those are aaminin injuries um so it's on the order of single digit percentages if you look at large centers wow um you mentioned something a moment ago that I think was a bit unexpected um when when I was in medical school uh we were told that hepatitis C was basically going to be the sole indication for liver transplant by now meaning you know this is more than 25 years ago looking forward hey

[00:19:58] Within you know whatever 2025 uh ver virtually all liver transplant will be in response to hepatitis C um maybe a couple things happened that weren't anticipated the first was an effective treatment for hep C so I assume that hepb is potentially a greater problem than hep C although we have a vaccine for hepb so kind of curious about the the relationship between Hep B and Hep C and then secondly I will come back to this but I want to hear a little bit more about alcohol related injury as well which seems to be on the rise as opposed to the decline so maybe we start with the the Hep B versus he C distinction yeah I'll zoom out a little bit because so much of what we're talking about is limited to Bas based on what we know and the numbers of aggregate large well- done population studies where you're looking at all comers that's just not how we've been able to study diseases um we are now um but I think it's important to understand why we look at things the way that we do because it can be frustrating to patients to to not understand hey this is a a soon to be eclipsing pandemic why are we still ignoring XYZ so that aside um Nona nonb um hepatitis C we think of it being chronic we think of it being

[00:21:15] Progressive and again I'm speaking to the preaa direct acting antiviral era before 2014 where it was a common indication for transplant where it took time to actually discover what the virus did how it functions how it results in liver injury and how that liver injury is Progressive chronic and Progressive with hepatitis B it's a lot less predictable um one we have um really good antiviral medications two um you named it we have a very effective vaccine and that's a virtue of a population Health sort of intervention um in the East Asian population which is oftentimes where we see Hepatitis B it's important to emphasize that the variability and the progression of the disease is reassuring in the sense that we think that fewer people are going to progress to Advanced fibrosis curosis need for liver transplant but it's the one liver disease that is an outlier in terms of oncologic potential we see uh liver cancer develop in people with hepatitis B independent of going through the progression to to Advan fibrosis or curosis so our radar has to be up um to screen for cancer in people that have chronic untreated Hepatitis B and the effectiveness of antiviral treatment on the cancer potential is still an unknown

[00:22:41] I didn't know that Julia so let me make sure I restate it to so that a I know I'm correct and B others hear it if they missed it as well um we didn't State this earlier so it's worth restating or worth stating that hepatitis uh B or C also increases your risk of hepatocellular cancer this is a bad actor this is a very bad cancer so part of the mortality here results not just from the reduction of synthetic function in the liver but from actual oncology but then you just said something that I didn't realize which was and I assumed that your probability of developing cancer moved in lock step with the extent to which your disease progressed and what I think I heard you say is that's only true with C it is not true with B is that correct right uh so we're learning and and we're starting to reframe how we think about metabolic dysfunction as well when we think about the milu within the liver and how um injury is handled within the liver so our our big cers alcohol rated liver disease chronic hepatitis C um mled most of our thinking is when that person moves towards Advanced fibrosis their cancer risk increases where we start screening for it when someone has curosis we screen for liver cancer and chronic Hepatitis B independent of their degree of scar tissue or injury wow um and I guess yeah if I may just add to that um since we're just barely touching on the cancer um aspect of things one that is a rare disease relatively rare disease that also has a high oncologic potential is hereditary hemocromatosis um that's something again I I get the biased point of view of of being referred cases that um may not have been diagnosed um early on and so I see part of what I'm speaking to is things that could have been intervened on earlier had someone known um about relative risk and remind me I I probably knew this at some point is that true of every one of these like Wilson's disease where you accumulate copper and as you mentioned hemocromatosis accum but these are the the risk of disease moves with the risk of paral injury to the liver uh when you say risk of disease so sorry the risk of cancer to be clear the risk of cancer increases with the risk of paranal injury yeah penal injury to a liver doctor that sort of the the card carrying metric that we frame very highly is fibrosis and that's our term for scar tissue and so most of our cancer outcomes are associated with what we call stage four scar tissue or curosis um I'm cautious with the use of staging because patients oftentimes um relate it to cancer um in the sense that a terminal diagnosis um end stage non-reversible um sort of gloom and doom uh curosis is stage four scarring of the liver but the natural history of curosis is widely variable it's not a death sentence nor is it an indication for transplant it's an indication for increased monitoring yes and to be clear you can have fibrosis long before you have therosis which means you don't need to be all the way at quote unquote a terminal stage of ceros to be at increased risk of cancer correct okay I know we will come back to this when we get into naal D Nash sorosis this Continuum but let's I I want to try to stay stay a little bit further on the on the side of um what's what's going on at the basic level so um do you think Julia it makes sense to talk a little bit more about the way that a healthy liver metabolizes nutrients in in a u caloric nutrient appropriate manner to then explain what's happening when excess calories are present or alcohol is present I mean what do you think is the easiest way to explain what is happening in the pathology the pathology to of what well in that two cases I'd want to be I'd want to talk about non-alcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver disease as two examples that are quite ubiquitous um so at least the way I've sort of talked about it with with patients is you know maybe talking a little bit about how the liver normally functions in metabolism and you know how vldl works or triglycerides and and what happens when you start to basically create and more fat denovo and all of a sudden you have it you know you have an inability to export it but but again I kind of want to hear how yeah my guess is you have a much more eloquent way to describe this so I I don't necessarily want to impose my framework no you know when we when I think that the probably we approach patients the same way when you get the luxury of time and being able to get somebody's story it's looking at the liver in context of the development of various aspects of their lives and so why someone drinks excessively is as important as the actual toxin um especially one of the beauties of the liver is its resilience and so shy of you know more dense fibrosis even in curosis largely reversible and Decades of potential time to intervene so the way that I think about it and I think this often gets forgotten um because it's a it's a general kneejerk assumption when someone sees hepatic steatosis so increased fat in the liver um to assume that it falls within what we used to call non-alcoholic fatty liver disease that we now call metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease without sort of doing the detailed work around alcohol why does this matter because you see disregulated metabolism even with alcohol related injury um it is seven calories per gram pure carbohydrate and so when there is an excess nutrient load that the liver sees um the mechanism there's some evidence that the mechanisms early on may be related not exactly the same but um let's let's speak specifically to what's going on in the liver so you see you know you have a liver that about 80% of the liver is hepati and so those are the sort of primary liver cell that where your a and your alt live um ordinarily they live in a sort of cuboidal cell um that's working or hexagonal oftentimes is the way that we describe the whole lobule um that's working hard and those enzymes are are basically aminotransferases that have a host of different activities but until that cell gets stressed and releases those enzymes in a detectable way in the blood frame um we think that the liver is has some degree of resilience and function so when you talk about what is happening in the liver with both of these types of diseases there's altered

[00:29:40] Redux potential and there's free fatty acid handling differences so you mentioned and I think the the glucose aspect of things is incredibly important um and so when we think about a normal functioning liver for someone that has as you described UK caloria and then all of a sudden there's a relative excess caloric imbalance so they're they're what they're taking in um outpaces what they're able to expend and so there's nutrient excess that's happening the liver was never designed to store fat and so we commonly think of um an abnormality I'll speak specifically to mled and its definitions as more than 5% of the hepatocytes containing fat usually subcutaneous fat is our component where processing uh uh of fat storage um but in a dynamic way um is handled but oftentimes when those compartments are overwhelmed they start to deliver more um substrate to the liver and so there's two big ways that the liver manufactures or two big ways um in terms of liver fat metabolism one is denovo lipogenesis we think in most people that that's the secondary mechanis and it's the exogenous input through nutrition that supplies the majority of the lipid so denovo lipogenesis um is um manifested mostly with a triglyceride component you mentioned you know there's gler all there's triglycerides and there um uh phospholipids and then you mentioned lipoproteins which I in my mind link to trafficking and Metabolism of lipid molecules in terms of function um but how the liver and again and the beautiful nature of the way that we study it is oftentimes through close collaboration with patients where any component is deranged and so one of the areas that I think we are starting to see now that we hadn't seen before is the presence and largely this is by virtue of Technology we have means of detecting increased hepatic fat independent of insulin resistance or predating insulin resistance and so the relationship between how the liver accumulates triglyceride and starts to dispose of glucose is one that um I think the endocrinologists um have started to or continue to um dig a little bit deeper because we know that this relationship exists between insulin resistance and um liver storage of fat but the exact mechanism and timing is still undetermined it's called bidirectional in a lot of ways um there's there's some one of the the junior scientist that I work with describes different thresholds um so at some point the insulinization of the liver leads to Fat storage and that a second sort of um threshold is crossed when you start to see decrease totic glucose production let's talk a little bit about what hepatic glucose production actually is um I I referred to it earlier obviously which is that the liver is constantly titrating out but um again worth stating how important this is right because like you and I are not eating at the moment and yet we're we're alive so what something miraculous is actually happening given the glucose thirst of our brains and all of the glucose that is being supplied to our brains right now as we have this discussion for the next hour or so is coming from our liver our liver is the thing that is meeting out that amount of glucose which is kind of remarkable as I said because it knows to not do too little and not do too much so it can make glucose it can store glucose and it can temper this output um um so first of all anything that would get in the way of that strikes me as incredibly problematic especially on the low end right so we see in diabetes presumably we have not just insulin resistance at the level of the cell so you have a harder time disposing of glucose peripherally and that leads to an increase in glucose but we also probably see increase in hepatic glucose output which is where a drug like metformin that suppresses hepatic glucose output becomes uh valuable what what's happening clinically when we see decreased hepatic glucose output what what is what's true in the liver for that to be the case before hepatic glucose production goes up so you're so at this point um what are the clinical observations so and if you look at our guidelines they'll have multiple ways of looking at insulin resistance one that

[00:34:24] I'm quite fond of is the hom IR um so what is going on in the body at this time is a hyperinsulinemic state and whether or not you're seeing increased glucose is sort of this sweet spot that we're starting to see increased um triglyceride deposition within the liver but not yet a compensatory response with circulating hypoglycemia um and so what is going on at the level of the hepatite and um my sort of obsession what's going on with the lipid droplets that are associated with this precursor um are are unknowns yet to be determined when you when you look at somebody clinically and they show up with hepatic steatosis and you want to know where in the spectrum they are um and how to counsel them to avoid the downstream consequences that are potentially avoidable for them you want to look at what is their relative insulin resistance um so you are looking at circulating you know uh isolated insulin values and and calculating either a home

[00:35:27] IR some people do glucose tolerance tests but you want to try to catch people in this window of either either early insulin resistance um or not yet developed insulin resistance let's define for folks how how are you defining steatosis is it being defined as at least 5% of the hepatocytes contain fat okay yes so we're looking at the aggregate 5% greater than her equal to 5% okay and how is that diagnosis made is that typically made just through ultrasound or are there there any is there any other you know are you ever doing that with an MRI um how do we go about making that diagnosis accurately yeah when we when we talk about such a prevalent phenomenon like steatosis um we have to maintain practicality so the vast majority is going to be an Imaging based modality rather than something like a biopsy was originally you know defined based on histologic evidence um the MRI pdff is is costly and not necessarily that Rel available um we have point of care techniques that we use in our clinics that are based on ultrasound technology a a plain old ultrasound that someone gets is generally not detecting steatosis at levels under 30% so an important take home is you know a negative ultrasound does not mean that you don't have hepatic steatosis can you say more about that Julia so um if a regular ultrasound needs a threshold of basically a third of the liver has fat in it that's a big threshold clearly someone who's getting a routine ultrasound for some other reason you know their kidney and the tech you know just goes and puts the Probe on the liver um what is it about the uh either the the technique or the imaging software or Hardware that allows a dedicated scan to detect uh with much greater sensitivity at that 5% threshold for MRIs it's proton related the proton density fat fra fraction is has to do with basic physics and how reverberations occur with different fractions um water versus fat namely for something that we use um called vibration control transient elastography it's point of care it's something that a lot of liver doctors are fond of um we'll talk about it probably later when it comes to sequential testing um but it uses it it applies um a calculator called a controlled attenuation parameter to attenuate some of the echo some of the light signals that the ultrasound is emitting in order to get to a more granular level of fat uh how much uh and and this is you know the the measures of it are in the level of of sound waves so we're talking about Dees so when it comes to Fat accumulation in the liver that results from a nutritional imbalance I.E when a person is over nutrition you basically have some combination of exogenous fat making its way into the liver and even endogenous fat production I.E denovo lipogenesis within the liver but the net result is more fat is entering and staying in the liver than is exiting the liver although amazingly in most cases we also see a remarkable fat Exodus from the liver as evidenced by a very high vld DL and a very high triglyceride burden in other words the liver is trying its darness to get the fat out and we measure this high amount of fat which might be a clue that there's a high amount in in being accumulated correct that's correct and I think the the other thing to say is before the liver even sees that is you're overwhelming your subcutaneous compartments too um they are shuttling preat fatty acids towards the when not because I always think about it in terms of where can we intervene as well um so that liver is seeing um increased fat uh increased nutrients um and trying to handle it I think the important point

[00:39:33] I'd also like to make is because given the complexity of metabolism and the the liver's desire to maintain homeostasis um whenever you see anomalies so outliers um those are very important when you see people that are not you know expressing circulating triglycerides that are higher that don't have some of these metabolic features that's a that's a tip to you as a Clin that maybe this isn't sort of garden variety metabolic dysfunction um fat deposition in the liver and you might need to be thinking about something a little bit more rare but you're talking about something different than the obvious and well-known race-based differences so for example even in situations of fluide type 2 diabetes

[00:40:15] African-Americans will rarely exhibit an elevated triglyceride level the way a Caucasian will and and you'll see you know literally a triglyceride of 400 versus a triglyceride of 90 in two people that are equally insulin resistant you're you're saying something different than that yes I'm speaking much more to some of the um the the rarer causes that get lumped into theosis where there's a trafficking you know there's an export problem um and you lead to uh how does this come up clinically so I put a probe on someone and I see you know their BMI is 22 um they have very little evidence of insulin resistance their cap score something that we use to grade fat is very very high 400 that's going to tip me off that potentially there's a genomic genomic um famal hyper lipidemia there is something that's going on that may be making their liver store fat and an anomalous way that's not yeah reading the room in terms of metabolic risk and the reason I say that is because of the prevalence of the disease becomes important to sort of pick out the folks that may not respond or be best served by some of our current recommendations yeah I I had a friend who had um this is an easy this is a case that you would have you know obviously solved with your eyes shut um but he he did have elevated transaminases I do want to come back and talk about transaminases by the way and um but but clearly didn't fit the bill of anything that you know lean athletic

[00:41:48] Etc um it wasn't until he had an MRI for an unrelated reason that they noticed the amount of iron accumulation in his liver and of course he had hemocromatosis that had somehow been previously undiagnosed and he had accumulated enough iron in his liver that it was actually beginning to show these signs of injury through the elevation of transaminases um so yes uh it's that's one of the drawbacks I suppose of the ubiquity of all of this liver disease besides the obvious which is it sometimes makes it harder to identify the zebras when there's so many horses everywhere if you if you think about um how we pick out the quote unquote extreme phenotypes I think about this a lot when I look at how we can better understand some of the biological targets that are driving the disease and the way that an an easier way to do that is look at some of the extremes so the folks that don't have all of the metabolic risk factors but do have pretty aggressive disease for example lean people that are sort of a a normal body habitus um and then manifest rip roaring uh metabolic dysfunction including St hepatitis plus or minus fibrosis and back to your point of you described some racial differences we talk a lot about ancestry um and when you have ancestry distributions for for example South Asians um same predominance that you'll see with sort of lean diabetes some of the Modi phenomenon that you are aware of you can see very very aggressive forms of not just altered metabolism within the liver but aggressive inflammation and Scar

[00:43:28] Tissue which is usually what is needed to sort of get the attention of a lot of the liver folks um so injury not just the accumulation of fat which is important but it's much more important from a metabolic endocrinologic perspective and then we tend to preparate on the people with a lot of liver injury let's talk a little bit now about how ethanol is poisonous to the liver and um I want to be mindful of the word poison because it's uh it's a it's it's a it's a controversial word people get all bent out of shape um so feel feel free to use whatever word you want

[00:44:05] I mean I sort of think the dose makes the poison everything is technically a poison right Tylenol is clearly a poison whereas a low dose of Tylenol is a wonderful thing if you've got a splitting headache or a fever um but at some point you exceed the capacity of the liver to metabolize it and it goes from being um not harmful to deadly so you know clearly that applies to everything out there including oxygen so let's put the nomenclature aside what is it about the metabolism of ethanol that is problematic for the liver so again let's let's go back to our from the hepy and you have uh ethanol or alcohol that starts to get processed so how do we how how does a normal liver cell process this alcohol dehydrogenase you're going from alcohol to um acetal dhide acetal dhide is then metabolized further and it eventually becomes you know carbon dioxide water ordinary you know uh type of moities right um but where you start to see problems is some of the redo potential when when the capacity and again these are very variable if you look at populations um how alcohol is handled in various populations and even just the dimorphic differences in in sex between men and women um how livers metabolize alcohol um that normal process can be overwhelmed and then all of a sudden you start to have um peroxidation and that's a a feature that we see in the non-alcoholic where the the metabolic dysfunction that's not associated with alcohol rated liver disease um there's you know the the that's about 80% of the alcohol metabolism there's another pathway that's also invoked um but what we're talking about when there's when there is um alteration and injury and toxicity that's when you have the acetal dhide behaving badly and so it's behaving kind of like you're describing as as a toxin it's attracting um uh free radicals it is attracting immune cells it is Attract it is um leading to Fat deposition altered metabolism at the level of the cell and so that's um some of the commonalities different different enzymes are being used um but that's some of the commonalities when we look his logically at somebody who's not using alcohol versus someone who is um there are some features that you cannot distinguish um histologically because the injury pattern is so similar I'm not sure if that's answering your question or not it answers it but of course poses many more so let's unpack that a bit um again I'll just try to translate it a little bit so that I make sure I'm understanding it but when we talk about the metabolism of ethanol um we have this enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase of course we know some some people genetically are lacking in that enzyme or don't have as effective a version of it these people tend to be incredibly sensitive to alcohol they get beat red when they drink it um and in some regards I guess they're largely protected from the toxicity of alcohol because they simply can't tolerate it um but for most people you go ahead and you metabolize it and while the downstream stuff is ultimately the same as the normal carbohydrates basically CO2 and water you get acetyl alahh as a intermediary and um I guess my question for you is why why why is acetyl aldhy toxic as an intermediary does it stick around long enough to cause problems like why isn't it all just being flushed to CO2 and water quickly it's sort of like saying when we metabolize carbohydrates we when we metabolize glucose we stock at pyruvate before we go to acetyl COA and

[00:47:50] CO2 and water um you know you wouldn't think of pyruvate being problematic unless unless it's stuck around for a really long time so yeah help me understand why it is that is it just any minor exposure to it is problematic even if it's very brief it'd be hard to say unless you had a systemwide pretty diverse cohort to be able to say you know where is the system overwhelmed but what we can say that it it it does attract um inflammatory cells so there's something about it at a certain level to be determined um that attracts um I I kind of an analogize it to the lipotoxicity model and and my favorite disease metabolic dysfunction

[00:48:32] Associated disease there's something about that moyy that makes it um pro-inflammatory and how the body hand how an individual and how that liver will handle the inflammation that's a resultant of the acetal dhide attracting um free radicals and um overwhelming the Redux potential of that cell is one um mechanism by which injury is occurring know that you know not every cell is going to behave similarly and so the relative injury of some cells versus others um the compensatory damage and recruitment of um inflammatory handlers you know whether it's monocytes macrophages or lymphocytes um is also going to play a role so we're starting to get at some of the complexities that are extremely hard to tease out um unless you're thinking not just molecularly but at the liver as the liver as a whole you also mentioned that there are besides the obvious genetic difference I gave people with and without alcohol dehydrogenase uh polymorphisms you also mentioned that there are sex differences um I wrote about this somewhat recently uh maybe you could say a little bit more about the differences between men and women in this regard and then within

[00:49:48] Sexes I'm also curious to hear about how much um heterogeneity there is in the both the capacity to metabolize ethanol and of course the suceptibility to its toxicity you know the old studies and this is why you know alcohol has been studied longer than any of the viral hepatitides um a lot of the sex differences were just attributed to the fact that alcohol is a polar compound and so it's less soluble in fat and women uh body composition wise typically have more fat and so the relative um damage that could be done um was based on body composition I don't I don't know that that's necessarily true um but it was it was an easy way to sort of explain some of the early differences at that point um so when it comes to gene expression uh again you're going to have to look specifically at premenopausal women versus post-menopausal women um and not just Androgen components and estrogen components but also the

[00:50:44] Upstream signaling of all these as as far as I know and I'm not an alcohol expert none of those have been teased apart in terms of sex differences specific to the premenopausal woman um handling of um let's you know it's 14 grams you know no matter what the alcohol component is it's approximately 14 grams that we see so how that liver at subcutaneous fat component and hormonal responses to the compound um acetal theide generation or other potential toxic moities um those are all variables to be studied I mean that's sort of what we kind of wrote about which was that look there it's historically been chocked up that the differences between men and women are differences but but I think there are differences in gene expression that play a much greater role than than than size which then leads to this next question which is okay so you've got two people who both weigh 85 kilos right so their size is comparable their body composition uh is is similar enough let's even grant that they're metabolically comparable in health they can have two very different responses and susceptibilities to alcohol um I'm sure there are a lot of people listening who think well I'm one of those people who can drink a lot and it doesn't seem to have an effect on me does that mean that alcohol is less toxic to me I'll

[00:52:07] I'll I'll give you my biases because a lot of people think that toxicity is only occurring at the level of the liver um and we see in our especially post transplant post reformed alcohol use the effects on the brain the effects on the heart the effects on the pancreas um there's a panoply of organs that can be affected by um what's considered normal or moderate less than moderate alcohol intake um and so how someone is considering themselves not affected is also really important um there's of course the psychosocial components as well um and then the big one that that I think a lot of people are failing to talk about I know the World Health

[00:52:46] Organization came out with um sort of consensus statements in 2023 is the oncologic potential DNA disruption um and how to measure that and how to mitigate some those risks so I think if if someone's subjectively saying I don't feel affected from a a central nervous system perspective they don't feel like they're sensorium is altered you know sensorium for us when we when we grade hepatic andyl opathy it could be there's some mood changes that happen um and so the CNS um either depressant effects or um removal of inhibitions um those those some of those effects are also I think socially acceptable CNS related effects but they're they effects and I'm sure you get asked this question all the time at parties um which is the you you know at what point does the dose of ethanol in grams per day or per week start to become problematic so again this is a topic we've we've written about at length um which is that there's you know we we kind of reject the data that says that there's a J curve right so we we have not internally been convinced by the jcurve data which is largely epidemiologic and largely you know suggests that at very low doses I zero alcohol is actually slightly worse than some alcohol and then of course the risk goes up as drinks go up but there's some sweet spot which depending on the study can be actually quite High um for alcohol consumption to produce the lowest all caused mortality um again there are many ways to explain those those those data that I think are a better explanation than alcohol is good for you at some dose I think the mandelian randomizations point to the opposite which is a monotonic change in risk that increases uh consistently from zero and upward but of course this dose is still nonlinear this risk is nonlinear with dose I should say and it begs the question then for for people who want to choose to drink responsibly at what point do you say the risk is probably too great uh if we're not going to be complete abstainers at what point do you tell somebody that's a little too much it's a loaded question because I'm thinking about more than the liver um even though they might be approaching me with um a liver Centric point of view so um if there's evidence of injury um an injury so the way that we liver doctors think about it our markers of necroinflammation as and as

[00:55:26] LT are not functional they're markers of of injury and we think of much more U meaningful things in terms of being functional albumin synthetic function in terms of coagulation and then also glucose handling so if you start to see I have and again with the patients that we see we have many patients that have a degree of hepatic steatosis and their only risk factor is alcohol intake and if they're not having any disregulated metabolism they're not distressed by this abnormality and we're able to monitor them and the net gain to them from all sorts of inputs including social inputs um is that their alcohol level is not causing you know major life events including effects on their family or things that maybe um are harder to talk about then there's sort of a permissivity to that um but it's just like supplement use at some point contaminated supplements are unknown supplements may cause evidence of liver injury so with an openness to can you give this up if it becomes problematic either physiologically to the liver to another organ to relationships Etc so that's sort of how we counsel people point in time we also have all sorts of ways of looking at problematic you know use disorders that the Big Driver for all liver diseases um paral liver diseases um is what is sort of the behavior and the motivation behind engaging some of these things and that's how the relational component with understanding why someone is doing what they're doing can really make a big impact because two or five years down the road when you ask them to give it up because there's a new breast cancer diagnosis the risk of breast cancer is higher than the than the risk of liver disease for most women who are consuming alcohol so if they have a new cancer diagnosis and we're asking them to give it up in that instance or the patient bring themselves brings it up in terms of what disease modifying um changes can

[00:57:27] I make can I Implement in order to improve my lifespan um those are things that we that we need to go back to what was the origin you know what's the desire um in terms of engaging some of these behaviors what I've discovered is most humans are far more likely um to give up something that they don't find beneficial um at least in our in our in my 14 years 13 years of taking care of liver patients let's let's use a specific example so you have an individual that comes to you and says um I I you know I consume alcohol socially um and if you go and talk to my friends family children they would all tell you it's not a problem in my alcohol consumption meaning there's no there's no unintended consequence that is negative right it's all pro-social beneficial um and they you know they have normal liver synthetic function which again you would expect that's a pretty late finding if they don't um their transaminases are normal again we're going to come back to this so I want to put a pin in that for everybody we're going to explain in much more detail what transaminases are and what normal is um you know you mentioned toxicity to other organs in as much as we can assert you know that the normal kidney function normal cardiac function all those other things do you say look the most sensitive indicator I have that you might be drinking too much are your trans examines and as long as those stay below a threshold which you're going to tell me and all of these other factors look okay I'm all right with you drinking two glasses of wine in evening or are you still saying look there are still things I can't measure the you know and and even normal transaminases don't give me a good enough confidence that you are not causing irreversible harm here so I wouldn't use aminot transferases as a good Mark um I think more often we use a bedside

[00:59:29] Imaging technique the vibration controll transient elastography because the sensitivity of picking up on hypox steatosis is higher than something it actually takes quite a bit of derangement and probab drinking to Der your aminot transferases so and when you start to see fat accumulation in the liver early morning sign potential um

[00:59:50] Downstream metabolic consequences potential inflammatory consequences doesn't mean that they have to give it up but I think it really tattoos to the patient in their experience that there there are measurable effects of even moderate you know what's considered social and and what's considered social is very very variable there you know some of these that's why it is good I for the audience members that are clinicians quantifying the use especially now during and post pandemic um there have been just like the Al has been perturbed based on environmental you know changes in our in our population so has sort of the definitions of moderate use um so just going through that with patients can sometimes give you a little bit more in information about um how they're perceiving their risk which is obviously if you're if you're counseling someone about the impact to their life um and whether or not something would be wise to continue or not you have to understand you know how they're perceiving risk how do you ask people specifically about that I we we ask patients you know um on average how many drinks do you have in a given week and what's the variance of that I assume there's a much smarter way to ask this question I'm so glad you're asking um so first of all we Define what alcohol is oftentimes what has happened is one drink might be double the quantity that we're used to seeing and so concentrations so I say one and a half ounces of hard liquor 5 ounces of wine 12 ounces of beer is considered a standard drink so that in and of itself gets get some raised eyebrows from people because they don't know about those quantities um so when we and then

[01:01:32] I say you know ballpark oftentimes people will say I don't have a problem with drinking I don't drink every day um and daily drinking at a certain threshold you know we consider um two drinks per day for men one drink per day for women and these are standard drinks um what's considered the CDC definition of moderate alcohol intake um a lot of younger people don't drink daily um that's a that's a gross assumption but it's much more of a binge type um picture and so quantity over what period of time for those standard drinks is also what we ask um and then I also ask you know what's going on in these situations that you feel is it is it you're with family gathered over the weekend um is it at home um in the pandemic it was a lot of um isolated drinking at home um and so that's where we started to see some of the biochemical changes some of the Imaging based changes and then more importantly some of the social changes that happened with um problematic drinking because the the slope can can vary um without a individual being aware so I think it is important to to quantify it and then the other the other test that we oftentimes do as liver Specialists is we we measure sort of the longer range metabolite something called phos phosp tidal ethanol or a pth um and that measures you know not just it's it's a little bit more like an A1C um than an than a rapid identifier like an ethyl Lup ironide um but it gives us an idea of and it's graded in terms of moderate versus severe and sometimes that gives you an aspect another angle to interview a patient and again there's there's a lot of Shame around alcohol use and what's going on in an individual at times and so when you see really severe heavy alcohol use but a self-report of something far less sever here it's again an opportunity to to figure out what's going on those are clinical observations that we've had a lore how far back does the phosphole ethanol um or pth study go if the A1C looks back about 90 days how far back does this look it's on the order of weeks like it's it's not something that lasts 90 days we usually think of it in one to two week time frames is that a readily available test can you order that through lab core or is that a super specialty test I think it's available and all the quest and lab core for sure very interesting okay let's come back to these uh transaminases so uh everybody listening to this Julia has had a blood test and they've if they certainly if they've listened to this podcast they know to look at that a and that Al you've already alluded to them a little bit but I want to go back and talk about it and they people people have heard me say this they get called liver function tests but they're really not proxies for liver function so what does a do in a Cell what does a do in a Cell under normal uh working physiologic everything is hunky dory circumstances and what happens that leads to their elevation in the serum in the plasma when things go arai so a or um aspartate aminot transferases alt

[01:04:51] Alan aminot transferases are are enzymes and they are usual working enzymes to help process things that go through your liver so normal liver physiology two supplies um blood supplies to the liver one from the portal circulation that's what drains your guts all the nutrients that you take um in that are processed in your intestines they get shown to your liver through that portal system and then the ftic artery um that's another system it's one of the many forms of resilience of the liver so it has two blood supplies the blood percolates In This Very porous milia uh showing all the hepatocytes what they have um by way of nutrients toxins Etc and then those things are filtered um through hepatocytes and there's there's lots of enzymes these are enzymes that we typically measure and so um when we talk and they also exist in muscle so whenever we get some rare cases of elevated aminot transferases we have to make sure that they're coming from where we think they're coming from that's an aside um but uh and and when the definitions of normal have evolved over time um and sometimes different thresholds are set for different diseases I don't want to get too much in the weeds of how the hepatologists think about things um but oftentimes you know the earlier days we we sort of said 19 and 30 were our thresholds um in terms of um women and men what we expected their AA trans races what we would consider abnormal um the lab uh any one of your audience members who's looking at their own lab the labs often times flag them now when they're in the upper 40s or 50s that's a populationbased perturbation that I think you've talked about um a lot and so what is the definition of normal how much does this matter when it is red when it is flagged is abnormal um how much should you get anxious about that in general um again we want to harp harp on the fact that the liver is extremely resilient and so when you get an isolated abnormality what that is telling you is that liver cell that hocy is now under so much stress um that it's a now an what we call necroinflammatory Marker um necro being cell death and inflammation mostly what what is going on around that liver that tells us I'm under stress and I'm now bursting and so when that liver cell bursts it releases these enzymes into the bloodstream and that's what we're checking with blood tests the question is why are those enzymes elevated and is it an isolated phenomenon you had mononucleosis you're over your virus or is it something that's continuing over a period of we Define it as around six months um in terms of chronic liver disease where those elevations have persisted is when we start our workout why is this inflammation and cell death happening in this liver is it due to our top three in adults alcohol viral hepatitis or mled mled being the most common globally um and in the country um and is there something more rare um that we are missing is there some is there a potential that there is something treatable um that there is something reversible at this earliest stage of laboratory detection you've reiterated a point that

[01:08:11] I've tried to make several times uh over the past several years which is that um we never want to confuse a laboratory's standard for what is normal for what might be optimal because the laboratory is simply reporting on a population distribution and if the population's health is deteriorating over a 50-year period of time well that isn't necessarily a reason we should hold ourselves to the standards of unhealthy people today and so as you point out you know I just had my labs done last week so you know I forget I Think Lab Core has a cut off of 40 or 44 for the A and the alt but if you went and looked at what was the cut off and presumably that's the 80th or 90th percenti of the population if you went and did that exercise 50 years ago you'd see a much lower number probably 25 to 30 um so is it that the liver has changed from an evolutionary perspective in 50 years probably not it seems more likely that we've seen more drift towards liver injury but if someone just came to you and said Julia like I don't want to hear about what the population does tell me where you think the right place to have those transaminases be as a as one more piece of the puzzle not the only piece of the puzzle we're going to talk about all the pieces but just if we're looking at this piece of the puzzle where where where do you look and say boy I'm really happy you're not just okay you're optimized so I'd say for the for the vast majority and I'm going to speak across age and across um Grace ancestry and uh biological sex I would say I'm generally I tell a patient that they're um doing well when it's under 30 that's just sort of an under it's a whether or not they are posttransplant or you know have very very early stage disease that's all cers um when do I start to get alarmed it's when it's sort of persistently and what we we think of fold differences in liver disease world so when it's consistently in that one and a half to two times the upper limit of normal so when it's in the 50s and 60s it again tells us there is something potentially going on in the liver and whether it's a cause if it's um a result or a cause of other symptoms in their body other disease processes is when we start to pursue a workout so again I'm just it's very difficult for me to just stick on one value but because you put that in front of me I would say under 30 let's talk a little bit about the differences between the a LT and the a so again I'll just share with you I'm trying to get a free hepatology consult during this podcast by the way um so my a is always significantly higher than my

[01:11:07] Al T so last week on Friday when I had my blood drawn my a LT was 21 but my a was 34 and that's actually quite typical of my blood draws my Al typically hovers between about 20 and 25 and my a typically is above 30 but shy of 40 um I'd love to hear your thoughts on that uh and feel free to you know ask me any questions you want if I can elucidate uh clarifying information of course you know I um I realize that you know your audience is also fully capable of reading our our guidelines and things like that so I do want to say when when I use a Gestalt of around under 30 that's a thumbnail expert sort of um after I've made a diagnosis and and someone's um already part of an intervention I do want to make sure that you know thresholds for sort of workups Etc we still think about being around 40 so this is it's also pertinent to you so the questions I would ask just with that pattern in and of itself is curiously um did you work out within 24 hours of that um laboratory assay and if so what type of resistance work or muscle work did you do yes I did um because that was a I went to my doctor in the afternoon I had already done a two-hour workout in the waight room that morning so that blood draw was probably at noon and I had I was in the weight room from 8 to 10: and I'd say Peter you know have we ever drawn blood on you on a non-workout day on a rest day yes I would still see the same pattern if I drew that blood first thing in the morning but it would still be within 24 hours or a of a workout because I would have lifted or been on my bike or been rcking the day before so I if your question is have I done a blood draw with more than 24 hours of no exercise probably not that that's one thing I would be curious about I would be curious if you had ever had a CK done a greeting kise just to look at there's any evidence of muscle breakdown yes um anytime I get a CK done let's pretend that the threshold of abnormal is 200 I'm typically right about there okay and I'm again looking at you knowing a little bit about you and making some assessments you know just based on body composition and potential you know risks that the line of questioning may be very different with someone else um but I do drink alcohol just so you know I mean so y yep I was about to go there next um so can you also tell me um about not just that one lab draw from last week but um when your labs are done in relationship to alcohol intake and if you're able to quantify that I wish I could say I was more thoughtful about this but I'm I'm one of these guys that never likes to cram for the test so I try to never change behavior before my blood tests like it's not like I don't drink for a week or something so what I think I can safely say is any blood test I've had is probably a reasonable sampling of my typical pattern of alcohol which is I so again I I'm I'm mindful of what we described as the doses right so 5 ounces of wine 12 ounces of beer 1 and2 ounces of liquor based on those metrics I I think I'm probably in the 6 to8 drinks per week category virtually never more than two in a day so I don't know that's a moderate

[01:15:13] Drinker I suppose that that's classifies as sort of moderate alcohol intake and assuming that your Laboratories are assessed in this non- cramming sort of way um you know let's say you had about 30 grams um of alcohol before your within 24 hours before you I would say there's a decent chance that there were 30 gr of ethanol in my system 12 hours prior to that but it's possible that it would have been 36 or 48 because I again

[01:15:44] I wasn't I wasn't trying to game the system sure um and so I think I would also ask um are there is there anything that's bothering you about your blood tests what is your impression of them well I think um the only thing that quote unquote bothers me is I look at many of my patients who have ests and alts in the teens and I think I wish mys and alts were in the teens um but I also realize that in that case most of them are women a very slight build um and so there may be a component that's just muscle mass related by the way I should also point out my um creatinin is always quite high but my catin C is very low renal function is great but I have a if if you look at my egfr by creatinin you would think it's about 70 whereas by catin C it's about 110 um and I know that we see that a lot in patients who exercise so um there may be that component yes and I just wanted to emphasize that the it's the injury component to the muscle not just you know having a big build a mus build is not necessarily injurious in terms of detection of aminot transfer elevations to be clear um the most the most common one that we talk about are like marathon runners with with rabdo Etc um so it is there is it's not just having the component of muscle but also just the workout and the injury component recovery component the other thing I wonder about of course are supplements and medications um I do take one medication that at least in patients we often see an elevation of transaminases and that's a zami so you know I guess I could do the test of just stopping aetam and seeing does that have any um effect um so again not these days with patients taking lots of medications I'm trying to think if there's any supplements that I'm I'm I'm not I'm I'm a little lean on supplement these days and the ones I take tend to be pretty straightforward things like fish oil and magnesium and things like that like I'm not kind of taking too many sort of funky supplements that um that we we've seen in patients where they can really sort of have um uh negative impacts on liver function tests so you're going down you know what what

[01:18:15] I was curious whether or not your team had questions about too which is the the drug induced liver injury and that can include not just pharmacologic agents but also supplements that's where we see a lot of elevations in amuno transferases so whether or not it's um you or an individual who's taking recreational substances that's also something that we use in the differential um for that sort of laboratory assessment the reason I want to know about context is there are some individuals that perseverate if their fat fraction is 7% and they're living an optimized life um and the number itself is problematic to them they think something is potentially abnormal or wrong um so in in your instance rather than withdrawing the aetam I might say let's do Labs i' I'd throw it out to you would you would you consider doing Labs after a series of rest days um plus no alcohol intake to see you know you're doing a controlled experiments I have patients that do this all the time they'll withdraw from alcohol for six weeks to see what is the effect on their fat fraction they're just curious um and the degree to which and most of the time you can't predict what your reaction will be you might think oh my

[01:19:31] ALT will be 20 and I don't care that much I enjoy alcohol too much but there's something um to be said about a measurable effect and how motivating that is that's something I've been humbled by a lot with some of our Imaging based studies so um assuming that those are your influences um the things that I would think about is not just the framing of who you are at this point in time but what has potentially happened in the

[01:20:01] Decades of life before and that's where I would do something like a fibrosis assessment doesn't it could be a quick calculator something like a fib4 etc um to figure out whether or not even with those numbers being as good as they are there's some degree of accumulation um of potential stiffness or injury to the liver um because all those time points between when you measure them there's things that are going on in your liver um and we don't and the rest of your body of course but we don't necessarily need a biological measurement by way of a biochemistry in order to determine what those are how valuable do you think the so again we use lab core for much of our Labs um I think the last time I did a blood test so not the one I just did last week but maybe three months ago I did one where we did the full Lab Core

[01:20:52] Nash score thing again this was sort of just me being me and I don't really think I have fatty liver disease um but I was like let you know we order this test on patients I'm curious as to what it shows I mean and so it came back negative there was no evidence There Was You know the scores were very very low but I I have to be honest with you I've kind of forgotten how the score is generated can you can you explain how that score is generated and I I because

[01:21:14] I suspect it's going to be used more and more frequently now as clinicians are becoming more and more aware of screening for this yeah I think um and again I won't go specific because there's so many there's a whole serum based biomarker Milli and imaging based and each one of them you know some of them were derived based on hepatitis C population and then subsequently validated in metabolic dysfunction so if we're looking at something like um a fibros effect Etc something that that's been studied in Nash you're usually looking at something that's got components of collagen Matrix of um metalloproteinases Etc and so it's looking at measurable ck18 fragments Etc um that are detectable in the blood um that suggest not just fat accumulation in the liver so that's diabetes risk as

[01:22:07] I think as I describe it to patients but then subsequent inflammation cell death and eventual Scar Tissue decades to development and so are you picking up on any I think most of the proprietary serum based tests will give you like a steatosis score like a fat score and also give you a fibrosis score I think those of us that take care of a lot of livers rely a lot less we we use our bread and and butter hepatic function panels which are not functions um necessarily but then we also use a lot of Imaging based tests because they're so much more sensitive um rather than these biomarkers that leave you with a lot of intermediate risk it's really hard to counsel patients with that type of information okay so this very very good to hear so what you're basically saying is look and now let's shift from me to maybe a a an actual example of a patient so we have a patient who's very persistently got transaminases in the 40s so you know they're they're they're just on the threshold of of you know they're not quite there to trigger a full million dooll workup but but there's something not normal right we're we're going to we're going to we're going to be

[01:23:14] Politically Incorrect and say that's not normal and there's something pathologically going on even if it's very very low grade and doesn't pose an immediate threat to them in any way shape or form but hey we're in the business and medicine 3.0 not medicine 2.0 I don't want to wait until there's a problem um if we get one of those Nash scores and it comes back zero you're saying Peter you're not out of the woods yet there's a lot of nonsense that can be going on there um we didn't talk about ggt should we should we mention ggt does that does that at all factor into your Thinking

[01:23:44] Beyond a and ALT I I'll tell you I mean I'm just going to speak very sort of clinically relevant here um ggt alkine phosphatase measurements so so one of the things that we notice is that in kids the development of Nash looks different histologically than in adults there's a lot to be said about what we know and what we don't know and so the pattern of liver injury um if we were to look at your liver tissue under a microscope we usually have all these zones um and the zones when we're doing detective work as to why is Peter or his relatives um liver test abnormal and we're coming at it from a histologic lens where the activity is in the Li sometimes gives us a mini differential and for kids the activity of uh fatty liver disease typically behaves like other chronic liver diseases so it's what we call portal-based um so it's around the portal Triad um which is a a functional unit as a liver the liver in many ways is beautiful and worthy of respect but its architecture is really elegant and so the portal-based diseases autoimmune diseas is there heepsy localizes there but we see a lot of the changes in children around that portal area in adults we see it much more around the central vein um so this drainage vein um around the the middle of that H hexagon that I described before you see fat you see inflammatory cells um there are these things called balloon topa toyes that we and

[01:25:12] Pathologists love to um perseverate over and it's it's a it's a precursor to cell death it's like a hot air balloon it's shaped as a as a stressed out cell that's preapoptotic and and so when we see that type of injury pattern around the central vein um that's more typical what we call adult what we used to call

[01:25:31] Nash but now call mash um so how is this relevant so around the portal diseases we see much more of the ggt alkaline phosphatase things that affect the bile ducts um and so we often times with pediatric fatty liver disease will'll see elevations in the ggt alkaline phosphate not necessarily to the point of having an elevated Billy Rubin or a plumbing problem but those are some of the laboratory again looking at a whole bunch of people over a long period of time just pattern recognition we also see um higher degrees of elevation in aminot transferases a and ALT and kids um and Adolescence um than than would be predicted necessarily from an adult again so many degrees of variation that we can describe clinical observations to you but it doesn't necessarily get at the mechanism or the driver as to what's causing those differences that that it's actually really interesting I I didn't know that um I I did know that there was a slight difference in the pattern between children and adults but I didn't realize that it was anatomically that distinct and that it resulted in a differential pattern of enzyme secretion um so again yet another reason why it's so easy to be fooled um so so let's now go back to the the way in which you want to see an ultrasound done cuz you know frankly even just from the standpoint of our own practice this I want to make sure we are relying on the gold standard um and I want to make sure we are absolutely not missing this whether the injury the inflammation the fibrosis is the result of alcohol or nutrient or something else I I worry that if we're just relying ons and alts and Nash scores and things we're we're we're we're running a bit of a risk here and the framing around how to to to deal with the relative risk and the anxiety provoked or alleviated by negative testing and sort of a modum of humility that a whole bunch of negative testing doesn't necessarily mean that nothing ever bad will happen I do I do a lot with with genomic analyses and depending on how targeted um the testing can be a negative test does not mean nothing is ever nor will be wrong with you um sometimes folks get anxious and it's more um sort of an offramp I don't necessarily think that that's your audience I don't know um but I always like to again understand sort of this the psychology behind uh why people are interested and and how they're going to utilize that information so all that aside um if I were to um see a patient and oftentimes very very often for our early stage disease so non-erotic non-portal hypertensive non-transplant the the very early stage um they are referred because of Imaging abnormality absolutely no blood test abnormality the two most common causes common referrals for hepatologist are abnormal aminotransferases or abnormal Imaging and again these are not the super sick people um and so the abnormal liver

[01:28:36] Imaging may be a reflection of um hepatic cetosis the error we want to prevent anyone who sees something like that is is just a knee-jerk reaction that that is napple and mled um and not to forget about asking about the biggest differential which is alcohol um and then also some when to invoke some of the more rare biochemical involvement that's where just talking to your patient is going to give you a lot of information for my people who do not drink alcohol Who present with an abnormal image or are interested in sort of being proactive about their Liver

[01:29:12] Health um it boils down to the conversation what are their risks do they have metabolic risks do they have habit risks in terms of either recreational uh drug use or um pharmaceutical agents Methotrexate being one that needs monitoring um liver-based monitoring um that if I were to get a snapshot of the liver and their overall health we always start with a basic blood test that's what you have described already including amot transferases um and then um whether or not a liver image is warranted and so when we advise population at the population level for people that are not

[01:29:54] Specialists we advise those um clinical risk factors so what is their metabolic Health um BMI um metabolic syndrome risk factors cardiometabolic risk factors habits um what are their social habits exercise um and engagement around different forms of nutrition um and then also uh in addition to therapetic function panel um calculating something like a FM4 where those functions have been elevated over a period of time or that person maybe male over 50 plus or minus insulin resistant diabetic um those are some of the things that tell us that person needs secondary testing and I never refer um I shouldn't say never hardly ever will refer for an ultrasound because most of the time that has already been done already um threshold for detection as we mentioned was around 30 33% to pick up on hepatic fat um a lot of it will depend on what is available to you around you and so the tools that we that are sort of price

[01:30:56] Performance Based um VCT and then ultrasound elastography um our Radiology colleagues have picked up on some of the different ways that you can attenuate the ultrasound in order to calculate that fractions um and so those can either be in a doctor's office or a radiology type facility um for very sophisticated testing um again MRI pdff um pron density fat fraction that's what we we use in research studies and they're increasingly available clinically um

[01:31:27] MRIs are very good at detecting qu and quantifying the amount of fat but also depending on the protocol amount of iron and um when you add what we call an elastography component so what does that mean that means you're not just shining a light or changing um the Imaging signal intensity to the liver but you're also creating vibrations a normal liver soft like a sponge I'm sure you've operated on many people when it's filled with blood it's a little bit more dense uh a cerotic liver or one that's full of full of scar tissue is much harder like a brick and so all of these um elastography based techniques whether it's Mr elastography or vibration controlled elastography are literally shaking the liver they're sending vibrations across the liver and saying is that vibration as it's coming back being detected more in a sponge like fashion or more in a uh brick like fashion and those scores typically we walk away with two scores a fat score and a scar score um and that scar score matters a lot to us in liver disease world the fat score is the one that's easiest to modify if you give up drinking if you were to lose a modest amount of weight um again if depending on how um you see lipid related risks from a cardiovascular health perspective very often um a Statin or um a lipid lowering compound results in a tiny elevation in an aminot transferase and when we're looking at net net cardiovascular risk we give blessings in the same way that we give blessings to chemotherapy induced liver injury um because we're prioritizing what the overall risk to that human is

[01:33:13] I've gone off on a little bit of a tangent um but that's just sort of how I frame um how to view an individual that's coming to me for overall Liver Health that is not including family history first-degree relatives and cancer potential I think the big thing that we need to talk about that we haven't that we don't necessarily talk a lot about is um metabolic risk um and cancer um and so oncologic risk in addition to met metabolic risk is something that we're seeing more and more of and again not in a causal way um but in a Disease Association especially in the young way okay a lot of things I want to double click on there Julia so let me just ask a few seemingly unrelated questions when you use the term vibration controlled elastography and ultrasound elastography are they being used interchangeably or are those two different tests two different tests um there's many many different types of tests um the the proprietary name the of the ecosense machine is called FiOS scan you'll hear that talked a lot about among liver doctors um that is point of care you get an image generated at the time you see the patient and that's um it uses both ultrasound based technology for the fat score and then the elastography vibration um technology for the stiffness it's a measure of liver stiffness there's errors but it's generally um uh widely studied well validated across different groups including people with a lot of subcutaneous tissue I'd say it's not technically feasible in about 8 to 10% of my patients Shockwave elastography ultrasound elastography are typically done by Radiologists as our Mr elastography um every site every

[01:34:51] Pavilion every place is a little bit different sometimes like for my Center they don't unbundle an MRI from the elastography um so from a price performance availability this is where I when I talk to General um to either internists or endocrinologists becoming familiar with one or two tests and using them will help train that six sense as to am I missing something um is this person best served by this test or is this something that I need to sort of refer for expertise on that the the list of tests are huge um and the elastography component can be either MRI based or ultrasound based unrelated you mentioned twice now recreational drug use can you say a little bit more about which recreational drugs uh might um be the driving feature if you're seeing otherwise unexplained elevations of lfts yeah I think this is um came up a little bit I think when we talked about the viral hepatitis um if your doctor asks you you not just about what you're doing currently but what you may have done in the 70s or 80s um when we talk about recreational drug use that's often times a risk factor injection drug use

[01:36:03] IV drug use or intranasal cocaine um that is shared between different individuals there's a ton of people with undiagnosed hepatitis C um that are picked up on screening exams and the only thing we find is um uh drug use in in the late 80s Etc um back in the day before we screened um uh blood products as well again it's it's really in in sort of the seventh eth decade of life that I still see women um that may have had a hysterctomy um so so contaminated blood products I'm just thinking through all our questions that I have to normalize for our patients um dental work abroad um contaminated types of things are um risk factors for various forms of viral hepatitis um but that's that's where that comes from I see I see so it's I I under yeah got it it's not that current use of

[01:36:54] Pick Your Favorite Drug marijuana is necessarily hepatotoxic you know there are canono receptors and we we come up against this question um infrequently but no it's not in terms of of what you're asking about and then again you mentioned the use of lipid lowering agents uh I would say the most predictable manner in which we see an elevation of transaminases is indeed with the addition of statins especially if combined with uh Zia so I know that the general consensus is that unless the elevation is you know exceeds one and a half maybe 2x the upper limit of normal it's deemed not clinically relevant um I'm not sure that's what I heard you say though what I think I heard you say is the benefits outweigh the risks and I I think those are two different things right I mean in other words if a person takes you know Crestor and Zeta and their trans Amin's pre-therapy are in the 20s and post therapy they're 50 I mean yes there's probably there's I hope there's a reason they're taking

[01:38:13] Crestor and zet and I hope that that um speaks to a risk reduction that's significant with respect to ascvd but we shouldn't conclude from that that their liver is Happy should we no and I think this is where we sort of get into the fold differences if you're looking at a a change from 19 to 25 19 to 30 you know you're still within the range of normal

[01:38:33] I think most people would say risk benefit um favors um continuing on that on that um lipid lowering agent if you're persistently elevated we've gone so far as to like look with biopsies Etc and in very rare circumstances is there actual liver injury that's happening with some of these drugs and I can count on one hand how many times we've seen demonstrable liver injury that we think is associated with um one of these lipid lowering agents the the real summary point is that there's so many

[01:39:07] Alternatives that often times that we that don't induce um or cause elevations um that are well tolerated and have a either more potent um lipid lowering effect or better tolerated by that person so it depends on degree of ele a within the bounds of what we expect is sort of the upper limit of normal or is there some evidence of liver injury going on and is there an alternative yeah I mean we we tend to be very aggressive on this Julia we we don't really tend to like to tolerate elevations of the As and ALT and as you said we obviously today have far more

[01:39:42] Tools in our toolkit to um to get people off those drugs if if that's what's happening um let's let's now talk again about kind of this nomenclature change that has occurred over the past here so I think for people listening to us right now they're going to be very familiar with the term Naf D non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and Nash non-alcoholic steatohepatitis but um you've now alluded to it several times that there's a different term you're using um mled D so um first Define the term uh and secondly and perhaps more importantly explain why the the the people far smarter than me have decided to make this change uh there there's got to be a good reason for it yeah I think a big component is we're listening to patients a lot more and trying to incorporate um their thoughts about how we label their disease so that's that's one um so defining the disease um when we talk about um mled D this gets at some of the problems that we had with naff um so it was defined by what it wasn't so Not only was non-alcoholic fatty liver disease nonalcoholic in the alcohol component but you had to go through a laundry list of things that it wasn't that weren't well explained by the name and so it left patients confused it's a compendious name it's hard to say we didn't really get around that with the new naming and it didn't hint at the underlying physiology which is metabolic dysfunction we spent a lot of time talking about earlier um what prompted the change there are several things but the the terminology alcoholic and it was reflected differently in different

[01:41:20] Global populations some Global populations really liked the non-alcoholic it was clearly not alcohol rated and they felt that alcohol was very stigmatizing um but a lot of the US population and Western population felt just having that term in there was was quite stigmatizing a common common scenario that we have with people who do not drink alcohol at all and are found to have liver disease is that they are labeled Alcoholic by their friends by their families by doctors there's just a natural assumption that if you have liver disease that it must be a result of alcohol so the patient um point of view was a big one the uh not defining a disease by what it e even even with nafal d and

[01:42:03] Nash the terminology alcoholic in and of itself there's also stigmatizing uh feelings um that were named with the term fat or fatty um and so that's some of the rationale behind changing it to the stoic as opposed to there was an interim name of metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease um and again um patients are now involved in a way that we probably should have not we probably we we needed to in the past um and again uh not all Impressions um

[01:42:37] Reign similarly in different parts of the world so one is adherence to what is the actual underlying pathophysiology um and then along with that so now we have an umbrella term called steatotic Stato just means as a Greek for fat stetic Li disease and mled is one group underneath that metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease we now have a category I think one of the issues with renaming is that we're actually taking into account what humans do and they may have metabolic dysfunction but they also may be drinking moderate amounts of alcohol so we call that metabolic alcohol liver disease or met Al um we have a category for alcohol related steatosis we have a category for monogenic um more and more we're discovering um abnormal particular uh you know autosomal recessive conditions um that are associated with increased fat in the liver and then what we our least favorite term cryptogenic um in terms of as yet unknown but has fat deposition in the liver you know one of the things we didn't talk about that we oftentimes have to do with our patients is go through a list of all their medications because some medications are known um to be associated with fat deposition in the liver the mechanisms vary um but that's also something that if you're um if you are patients if you're listeners um and if you're clinicians who are following um that that is all widely available in terms of what is known um and there's resources that we can supply so while it sounds incredibly confusing

[01:44:10] Julia um it is more granular than what we used to have right what we used to have was afold and Naf D so either you're getting all this fat in your liver because you drink too much alcohol and that fat accumulation is leading to fibrosis and if that fibrosis isn't halted it's going to lead to curosis or you're getting too much fat in your liver because of overnutrition and we went through the endogenous and exogenous differences and that's going to that fat itself is inflammatory just as all sources of fat that exist outside of the subcutaneous space are whether they be visceral or peripancreatic or uh you know uh all sorts of things right you know per nefri all of these things are pretty painful um and that kicks off the Cascade and what you're saying now is no no no no come on this was this was a gross oversimplification and there are lots of

[01:45:05] Pathways that get us here and they're not even mutually exclusive right I mean how many people are consuming alcohol and as a result of that or independent of that frankly are also overc consuming calories and so they have excess fat accumulation from a nutritional persp perspective plus the alcohol toxicity and all of these things are are are leading to this um I think the subset I most want to focus on at the moment is um the the side that is more related to nutrition um because in many ways this is um you you've again you've alluded to this already which I think is that in North America we would place the metabolic Associated disease even above hepatitis and alcohol Associated disease is that did I hear you correctly in terms of overall prevalence or risk for transplantation it depends on what end point you're at prevalence yeah in terms of allomer prevalence of disease yes yeah and obviously by large not just the us but globally yeah and it's also the one that disproportionately affects children if you think about the exogenous influences for sure most children you know it varies but most children do not get exposed to medications alcohol or some of the other um aot toxins until their teens I want to Now understand this progression more so we'll kind of narrow our scope a little bit to just talk about the metabolic

[01:46:38] Association um so so let's talk about the pathophysiology right so we've now got a patient who just triggers diagnostic criteria and I assume that the diagnostic criteria are some combination of the right clinical picture so part of that is a diagnosis of exclusion you you know you we don't believe you're consuming too much alcohol we've ruled out hepatitis we've ruled out uh pharmacologic toxicity Etc and you fit the clinical picture of a person with metabolic syndrome but I assume you don't have to have metabolic syndrome I'd like you to clarify that so you're insulin resistant with or without metabolic syndrome and you hit the 5% threshold on your fiber scan or whatever test we've used that has a high enough degree of sensitivity um that qualifies you as having masal D correct yeah so you're you're going through sort of the diagnostic algorithm that we are hoping to do a better job of of educating the population about so it's not just you know exclusion of those things but it's picking up on what our current technology are means for patients to reach out so either a biopsy or Imaging that suggestive of steatosis let's just start there and then you start working through this process you know a lot of um I think I mentioned this earlier a lot of hepatologists um sort of downplay the metabolic components of liver just because of the history of the nature of liver disease and how we've studied it um but the cardiometabolic risk does not require metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome is important to pay attention to um particularly if we're looking at quick clinical grab bag things that should make you think that that person has a risk factor for a Nash for sure metabolic syndrome increases the risk for having the inflammatory fenati the the one that we think progresses again un intervened upon unmitigated um from a um mled D um definitions perspective um how we get at staging of disease and progression um is dependent on multiple risk factors um but the the take-home point to what you're asking in terms of teasing out cardiometabolic risk we have all the parameters that are listed and they vary a little bit by ethnicity we're much more sensitive about definitions of obesity and metabolic risk across different um ethnic backgrounds um that were not sort of well described uh in our previous definitions so any one of those cardom metabolic um features will sort of start to push you into the category of metabolic dysfunction associated setic liver disease or massel it's really interesting uh you know I sort of Envision a world in which we move so far beyond uh um using something like met syndrome as uh the all singing all dancing diagnostic criteria and I say that with all uh great respect and appreciation for the work of Someone

[01:49:35] Like Jerry Ren who even brought this to the attention of people you know 30 years ago or 40 years ago through Syndrome X but when you think about how crass it is to say well you know when your blood pressure finally hits this and your waist circumference finally hits that and your glucose level hits that that's when the trouble begins I mean imagine a world in which once your liver fat hits 2% we're paying attention because even though at 5% you now have this disease that doesn't mean that 2% of your hepatocytes accumulating fat is necessarily a good thing in other words you could really start to take an organ

[01:50:09] Centric view of metabolic Health um and if you could really only look at one organ I think you've got to start with the liver I mean the the you know again I'm a bit of a so that's my bias which obviously you share but um it really is it's the mothership it's where we it's got to be the canary and the coal mine for when things are going wrong and and so to me the idea that you know we should be doing scans on people you know again a fiber scan seems like a totally reasonable idea it's relatively low cost and if it gives us any insight even before you trigger that threshold that strikes me as far more useful than looking at something as anod asog hemoglobin A1c which is so prone to error um so let's now talk about the um the okay so by the way the other point I want to get is a sense of prevalence you said it's the most prevalent but just to put some numbers to it what fraction of the people listening to us today in this podcast assuming they are representative of the population of the United States that's probably not a fair assumption but what percentage of the people listening to this without their knowledge might have ma D or or AFF D wow okay yeah 25 to 35% is usually and those are those are pretty conservative projections and you know we can get a lot of information one of my mentors who did he's a a surgeon who did um a lot in terms of metabolism outside of the liver um said I wish we could get all the C data granted it's not the best Imaging data from airports so that we could really get some estimates of um prevalence because that's a good way to look at everybody that's coming through a population we don't recommend screening um from a from a from a fatty liver disease or stoic liver disease perspective yet but even if your audience is relatively healthy um and one of the reasons that I agreed with your prior Riff on how unsophisticated some of our current ways of thinking about things are understandably given some of the cost associated with it but but how much that unders serves a lot of very proactive patients who can handle a lot of health information and make and

[01:52:28] Implement meaningful change um it really underestimates the the capacity of having a test you know oftentimes people will check it out doctors or advisers will check out and say you know we can't do anything about this therefore there's no relevance in checking um there is a lot of relevance to the majority of our patients in terms of understanding that they're at risk for something um and how to implement changes longitudinal changes not just to themselves but families eat similarly families exercise similarly when we make when we counsel an individual I have many many many patients who do not fit sort of the standard phenotype that's why I like to see um patients in succession because it really does change the way that you frame risk um quantitative and qualitative risk across diverse populations um but to your point um your audience even if they themselves don't have it I'd say 100% of them know someone in their either their family or their close

[01:53:35] Circle who does and I can say this because as soon as I give a talk like this everybody starts to identify themselves as having it but not knowing what to do about it I want to just touch on one thing before we go further down that which is at what point is it important or how does one go about doing some of the other um dotting of eyes and crossing of tees um you know Tom dpring uh a lipidologist that works with us in our practice mentioned some of these liposomal uh acid uh lipase loss of function uh basically stero accumulation disorders that can masquerade very similarly histologically and biochemically but of course it's a totally different disease um you've already alluded to several of these condition um at what point should one be looking at the zebras when they see all the uh hoof prints on the ground given the prevalence of up to a third of the population actually just has you know metabolic disease associated with fatty liver accumulation so if you're Frontline

[01:54:45] General clinician either and this could be anyone that's not in a and when I say specialist I just mean specialist from my tiny so either a gastron neurologist or a hepatologist if you are a primary care an intensivist a endocrinologist cardiologist and you're seeing this this is the point of having colleagues expert referrals and people to to um reach out to when you're starting to think about um rare causes I think the most common reason people reach out is when do we need a biopsy um so they're already you know it's very very obvious that people look at metabolic risk they do their viral hepatitis screens and we don't expect them to do alpha one anits and phenotype testing you know initially when someone is an outlier they're lean they have elevated ALT they've got a stiffness that puts them in moderate range halfway to curosis by the age of 35 um we need to involve a specialist in terms of what's going on because the reason is some of the downstream testing

[01:55:48] Cascade testing for families um whether it's genome SE ing versus genotypes versus you know targeted genomics versus um some of the molecular Diagnostics that we do with histology you're going to want some of the expertise that come sort of free of cost um by by referring to a center where they see some of the zebras so I would not do we do we see people identify zebras out there yes um but most often again when you're this is all you do and it's what you love to do your your six sense is being trained on what are the reasons to think about outliers we're all humbled we all are surprised by people that that surprise us um with Diagnostics but often times we come to it in a in a un indirect sort of way so all that to say U cholesterol esterol storage to L um many of the rare zebras that we pursue genomic testing on if you're identifying through a lipid profile and liver based screening that they're already an outlier that's the reason to to refer that's helpful and and and again again just bringing it back to kind of the standard case which

[01:56:56] I realized to the hepatologist is very common and is not typically the person that's walking in your door right you're not typically seeing somebody with mafl D minus sorosis who doesn't have any other uh diagnosis um unless it progresses and becomes problematic but given that that is just an enormous volume of people I definitely want to spend some time talking about a what what are the most important things to be doing besides the obvious and we'll discuss the obvious are there any treatments on the horizon even as it progresses to Stato hepatitis and before it gets to curosis um are there any you know deficiencies in a person's diet that can play a role in this are there any other predisposing factors that people need to be aware of so we'll start back at the beginning which is the traditional therapy for this is weight loss is weight loss is the most important tool that's going to improve metabolic Health um I mean again I think that's that's maybe at the population level that's true but we should also talk about exercise sleep and things like that but things that improve metabolic Health should improve um should improve mold D would you would you add to that would you put a finer point on that yes um it specifically the compon you know the building blocks of good health you've named them exercise sleep and nutrition but there are the ones that are sort of least studied so the evidence that we have um to talk about histologic changes and again I want to be very clear we're using histology as a surrogate marker for outcomes that are sometimes five to 50 years down the road um and so a lot of the evidence that I'm citing is based on histology where in the Natural History studies are yet yet to be borne out so with a lot of humility towards a cardiovascular endpoints so for the most part the average person you're seeing with mle is much more at risk for cardiovascular related outcomes and malignancy related outcomes from their metabolic Health than they are for liver related risks about 30% of my patients self- refer so they are picking up on a they read their own report and they convince their doctor to to refer to me they're not necessarily super highrisk at all exactly the same types of patients that you were talking about um but they are proactive so I don't want to dismiss the dise the um patient centered lifestyle intervention aspect of things so um micronutrient macronutrients those are things that we usually involve in specific certain certain circumstances so post bypass surgery um for some individuals short gut syndrome that's when we start to think about choline deficiencies and some of the things that your audience might be reading about either in pre-clinical testing or clinical testing when we think about um sort of a

[01:59:46] Precision exercise Precision Nutrition sort of formulation for an individual again context of disease um context of life and so if a person already has relatively you know moderate amounts of low glycemic in um intake food the things that we want to sort of really regulate and why a lot of patients hear fatty liver disease and assume that the confession that I get a lot is I don't eat that much fat when it comes to metabolism this is again what we've played into what we talked about a lot it's it's glucose handling so a lot of it is um exod carbohydrates and trying to to switch into smarter burning sort of the Slow Burn carbohydrates or complex carbohydrates so um we do spend some time talking about that that's a lot of um patients want very very detailed information as they should but a lot of that comes about in you know meetings with either someone who is of the nutrition sciences and part of that is we need to know their day-to-day intake and make it culturally appropriate if we tell you to take something in that's completely outside the bound of what you normally intake that's not really um easily implementable um for everyone's life so spending so I always spend my time doctor time talking about exercise and doing an exercise assessment physical activity assessment and a lot of um this this may sound gendered but a lot of my female patients especially with lean

[02:01:11] Napp are um low in the in the muscle component muscles typically quite hard to build for after the age of 60 so we spend a lot of time talking about increasing resistance work combination activity of a lot of single moms um who are working very hard and don't necessarily have that much time to dedicate to exercise so we talk about combination aerobic and resistance activity um we talk about um increasing this is part of healthy aging um we see a lot of people become more insulin resistant with aging as they become more sarcopenic um again even lean individuals so figuring out what someone's Baseline level of activity is for some people it's a walk prescription they're doing nothing they're quite sedentary it's a walking prescription increasing their aerobic activity and building habits so that's where the behavior motivation aspect of of change really is very very critical um so again nutrition component I Outsource a bit to a registered dietitian um with detailed information um there's a lot to be said about this the one thing that I will bring to your audience if they're unfamiliar um is the impact of coffee I don't know if you've brought this up yet in terms of Liver Health and coffee so coffee and again we haven't isolated there's some metabolomic studies we can point to when it comes to caffeine but coffee and we're talking about black coffee or you know limited um added sugar and added um milk components has been shown to be beneficial for multiple liver diseases and fatty liver disease hepatitis C fibrosis even

[02:02:45] HCC um again there's many reasons people do not drink coffee and we are not recommending it as a prescription um but up to three cups of coffee has been shown in in multiple studies now it's part of the European guidelines and made it into the American ones as well um in terms of antifibrotic effects and and good metabolic effects as well so that's one um very specific nutrition fine point that I can add to what you're saying about um metabolic liver disease uh Julie I've got two follow-up questions on that um with respect to

[02:03:19] Coffee do we have a sense of what component of the coffee it is and if it's you know obviously if it's caffeine that has one set of implications but if it's kind of polyphenols or things like that then it also has a huge implication as far as the form of the coffee so a drip a highly filtered drip coffee versus a French press you're going to have totally different amounts of those polyphenols making their way in so I'm sure everybody myself included who loves coffee is asking the question what do we know about the constitutive compon opponents responsible for that benefit uh and and how should that impact our coffee drinking choices the short answer is not enough um as I hearkened to earlier what we in terms of the granularity of nutrition detail huge opportunity um so we haven't in terms of metabolomics um caffeine is a signal um but that when given caffeine and of itself it does not mimic some of the effects that we observe so that's not it's not one thing like many things that we talk about with nutrition um extracting a nutrient versus taking it in its natural form um are are two different components and so the methodology of coffee extraction um and the caffeine component uh the instances of tea um a lot of cultures drink much more tea than coffee um including green tea these are all areas for first further exploration so I wish I had a more detailed answer for you but we don't have that yet yeah my the the the the the times I've looked into this I've come to the conclusion that the more of the Coffee Bean you're ingesting the better and so when in doubt I opt for a French press because it's the least filtered and I'm kind of getting the most of everything again that there's no rationale to that other than kind of myologic two cents the other nutrition related question I have for you is is the role of fructose specifically and to to be more clear what I really want to understand is at isocaloric levels do we believe that fructose is more injurious than glucose

[02:05:33] I.E two you know very similar molecules that happen to have very different Paths of metabolism um and and there has certainly been a lot of discussion and I myself have have largely subscribed to this that in the case of what we historically call Naf D um we really want to eliminate liquid sources of fructose right so if we're trying to get patients to change their diet Yeah by all means you know keep eating your berries and your fruit um but get rid of the smoothies get rid of any sugar sweetened beverages not just because of their caloric content but because of that huge Bolis of fructose um that is hitting the gut and then as you described heading through the portal circulation to the liver so what do we know about that today so the the evidence around fructose that's been studied in kids and adults and specifically high fructose corn syrup and some of the more processed forms and again taking something in isolation much easier to do in animal models than in humans but I would the first thing I would say is any study that you're looking at most of the mechanism for any type of liver disruption comes through an insulin resistance pathway so you would have to tease apart the presence or absence of overweight and obesity and the presence or absence of insulin resistance as the mediating the Big Driver of whatever you're observing in the liver when

[02:07:02] Studies have been done looking at that and I think there's only one or two um it's it's there's sort of a net no no net difference there's a couple of studies that have been done that look at liver exposure from fructose not parsing out those and again these are population level data um uh type interventions then you do see evidence of liver injury more significant um activity and by that I mean inflammation plus or minus Scar

[02:07:29] Tissue yeah my my reading of this literature is that it has been very difficult to disentangle the relationship between the macronutrient and for example weight loss in other words if you look at studies that have removed all fructose from the diet and have actually demonstrated a remarkable amelioration of what was called na

[02:07:53] D the patients still I say unfortunately I say unfortunately from the scientific standpoint they lost weight and so even though these were meant to be studies that were UK caloric just taking fructose out of a person's diet presumably led to less spontaneous consumption I think there are lots of great mechanisms for why a high fructose diet leads to overeating um and so while that's maybe a great outcome a we don't know if that's really sustainable in the long run uh and B it doesn't answer the mechanistic question which we so badly want to answer and so what I'm hearing you say is you do not specifically counsel people to eliminate fructose from their diet other than that being part of an overall General dietary pattern in other words if you're consuming people if you're advising people to eat less and move to lower glycemic foods that often comes with a pattern that is consistent with what I just described that it's going to be lower in uh all forms of fructose that come from refined sources when we get into specific recommendations it's got to be dialed in for the individual and what they have capacity for at that time you know the range of patients that I see some people can hire a personal chef and a personal trainer vast majority of my patients cannot um so if the effort to eliminate a specific component causes so much distress um to the average person um that's a lot that's a lot of mental work and to isolate one particular component much easier and implementable to say avoid processed foods so if you're buying from a poda versus buying from a grocery store in in

[02:09:30] New York City you know where is your Source um the best way to study this would be in areas where you know the government or some regulatory body has excluded some of the high fructose corn syrup and processed foods there there are communities that do that um so if you want to dial down on population level effects that's probably the best way to study it because humans doing what they do be very very difficult to longitudinally exclude a single component over the Long Haul um just given the nature of of how humans interact with their environment completely doable from a mouse model perspective but what we know about fatty liver disease nazle nav any way that you study it the translation from preclinical to clinical let alone phase one to phase three does not it's not always born out with the biology given the beauty of the liver and it homeostasis so I want to talk a little a little bit about glp1 agonists um at least the two most popular ones that are out there today so semaglutide and tritide um obviously they have a profound impact on weight loss uh they generally tend to have a very favorable impact on insulin sensitivity as well so it would seem to me that one could make the case today that the most effective drug we have for treating Naf D formerly

[02:10:48] Naf D and Nash are indeed these drugs what what is your view of that and what have you seen clinically I'll start with my view so in terms of when to bring in these drugs and what you're actually treating with it you know I I tend to go based on published evidence and what we have data for and what we have approvals for and anything that's not being used in that context that we're specific about why so if you have someone who is a known diabetic it is loow hanging fruit to reach for one of these agents um again when there is weight to be lost a certain percentage of patients can't afford to lose weight especially some of the muscle loss effects that are also associated with these drugs so when I have you know the average person who BMI 28 to 40 um they have stage two estimations from non-invasive tests um they've maximized their lifestyle modifications for their current demands in life um what are we working with endocrinologists most of them have already had the discussion if they have diabetes about bringing in a gp1 receptor Agonist um if they're not um we strongly um move forward that conversation but we don't do it outside of the context of at some point um you will likely have to come off of this medicine we need to talk about how many people regain the weight afterwards and what's the longitudinal benefit um for a long long itudinal disease um if two years down the road you regain the weight and the injury pattern re resumes so we we do take a long lens on it I do um have very overt conversations when patients are in the stage three range or therosis early therosis um about bariatric surgery metabolic and weight loss surgery um and the involvement of some of these weight loss drugs with a clear open discussion about what happens when you come off of the drugs and what's the longitudinal weight regain post bariatric surgery from some of the surgical interventions so when to bring it in comorbid obesity comorbid overweight status comorbid diabetes um and do we use it specific it has clearly in the evidence it's been tested in multiple um

[02:13:16] Phase 2 studies and recently released data in terms of the effects on the liver the effects on the liver are difficult to tease out in terms of how much of it is due to overall weight loss versus a direct liver related effect when we used to talk about naph and Nash I I assume that those were largely biopsy differentiated terms and

[02:13:38] Naf focused on fat accumulation Nash focused on the inflammation that was present uh and then of course therosis was the end stage of fibrosis today you're you're talking about in terms of staging does that allow us to move past biopsies and rely on some of the elastography and ways to look at both fat and fibrosis scores and if so H how do you delineate the staging today most of us are using non-invasive tests those are things that are apart from biopsy any of the ones that we named before for the vast majority of our clinical patient followup the time that we bring in biopsies um usually for anything oftentimes we'll get especially women with a positive Ana smooth muscle antibod some indication that there may be an autoimmune component so treatments are very different between the two so to exclude um a biomarker of interest in a population about 18 to 20% of people of of patients with masel d will have one of those positive biomarkers so we use it to exclude other types of diseases we also use it for clinical trials purposes um and then we use use it oftentimes in diagnostic testing prior to procedure prior to an elective surgery um prior to um an intervention that may or may not result in liver where you need to know about curosis before an abdominal surgery or a cardiothoracic surgery might be done these are the three instances that we see most often because of the explosion of non-invasive tests um and being a recipient of all the confounders we also help use it to delineate when when there needs to be a tiebreaker you get one non-invasive test that suggests very Advanced fibrosis you get an MRI that suggests with elastography that suggests something very different where there's such discordance that you need something to adjudicate the in between area so I'd say there's four instances and so what are the stages what when you talk about stage one two three and four what what makes up those stages today fibrosis scores so the way that we look at the liver and there's different scoring systems that are based on different types of diseases um but the way that we think about a normal liver assuming no genetic influences most humans are born with a normal liver um let me Define some of these disease processes so we defined what steatosis development looked like in mled D and that's more than 5% um fat when you start to move into fat plus inflammation um so inflammatory cells infiltrating the liver um plus what we call hepy ballooning that stressed out hepatite that's the definition of Nash Nash does not necessarily mean that there's Scar

[02:16:25] Tissue often times you will see some Scar Tissue but the fibrosis component is different stage one scarring um is early stage scarring it's usually like I said an adults around the vein we call it chicken wire because that's what it looks like under the microscope and then depending on the distribution and presence of scar tissue um we Stage IT stage one stage two stage three stage four um the way that the liver architecture looks under the microscope around stage three we start to see um connections between that portal-based area um and some of the uh Central vein areas so you'll hear people say um expansion Bridges um and then stage four scarring is what we consider curosis and that's where you have a lot of architectural disruption nodules forming in the liver it looks lumpy bumpy sometimes on an ultrasound sometimes on an MRI are thinking around therosis and reversibility has also changed in the field and a lot of this was learned after um the potent hepatitis C cures we used to teach that any form of curosis we thought was very the scar tissue was very fixed and irreversible um now we've subdivided curosis into different stages and early therosis or stage four scarring of the liver we've started to see evidence that even that is reversal time course between each of these stages for something like mled is 5 to seven years that's largely based on on European ancestry information and that's why it is such a hopeful disease because there's tons of time to intervene before there's progression to the next stage so I mean those are two very uplifting pieces of information right the first is that you've got five to seven years between each of those stages and then the second is that even at least a subset of therosis might be reversible um that again yeah stands in the face of the traditional teaching that we had which was stages 1 2 3 reversible stage four not um talk a little bit about the oncology risk you've alluded to it a couple of times now and you've also if I want to make sure I'm hearing you correctly said that look if you're in the early stages of of mafl D you you know you might say well why should I care and you're saying you should care more based on the risk to your heart and the risk to cancer than you should of your immediate risk to liver disease because if you're in the first St AG of this disease you know you're 15 to 20 years away from liver failure but you could be much closer to cancer or heart disease I want to make sure that that's kind of I'm representing what you said correctly and two I want to particularly focus on how you would quantify The increased risk of cancer there so um let me tackle the first portion um so I think that the general community and a lot of patients self-report this um they pick up their

[02:19:19] Impressions based on on how clinicians de deliver the news and I think there's there's been a a jadedness in terms of tackling diabetes obesity any any type of metabolic diseases um as if the general population will not take that information and act on it and and some of that I guess is Justified in in the diabetes world that said I think we have a lot to do in terms of how we counil patients and whether or not they feel empowered by the information we're giving them and if we're sort of taking it seriously um a lot of hepatologists want to see and we should from a stewardship perspective see the more advanced perspective um but that means that we Garner um understanding and support from our Endocrinology

[02:20:01] Cardiology General folks um in terms of understanding metabolic risk and how to modify that risk long term so for the average person including patients that are included in our stage one stage two stage three clinical trials a main cardiac a main outcome is cardiac uh major adverse cardiac events and so that's a longitudinal risk that we need to think about when I see a patient I am trying to figure out what is the leading risk for their not just mortality but quality of life implication um is it something that is liver based or is it something outside of the liver and this is not necessarily um including malignancy risk but sometimes does for very early stage disease so not even stage one fibrosis we talk a lot about eventual development of diabetes a common thing that I'll say is somebody with an elevated cap score on a fiber scan here's your fat score here's your scar score your scar score is normal um your fat score is exce exceedingly high it's very modifiable six weeks to six months it can be in the normal range unchanged you will most likely develop diabetes in X number of years depending on what their insulin risk profile will be that's not usually received in a scary way that's received in a oh I can actually change my diabetes related risk in a meaningful way and see an outcome in a year or two on a scan so empowering patients with with information and then also um working in partnership with endocrinology and Cardiology in terms of what their cardiovascular risk might look like and how to modify it and how to make it sustainable I think that's the biggest thing that we deal with um when it comes to liver disease and Scar if it is five to seven years you know on average um to develop stages uh to progress that's a lot of sustainability and a lot of the behavior changes that we see are related to circumstances um so how to build resilience not just in terms of their metabolism and their metabolic flexibility but what their coping skills are what they reach for in different instances that's early stage disease from an oncologic risk perspective and I'll speak first about the liver related oncologic risk so our primary liver disease is our liver related cancer is a p cellular carcinoma it's origin is in the liver I'm not speaking about metastatic disease that lands in the liver um we generally think that that occurs with curosis and for most liver diseases around 3 to 5% per year is what we quantify risk highest risk hereditary hemocromatosis next combination hepatitis C and alcohol um this was mostly Quantified before hepatitis C cures existed um then hepatitis C alcohol mled d um ones and again when when you take care of the ones that escape your escape hatch phenomenon alerts always come on

[02:22:58] Hepatitis B and then whether or not this a subject um of a large uh multidisiplinary group that that we were part of is looking at whether or not we were getting case reports basically of people with stage three um scar tissue from fatty liver disease um developing cancers really bad cancers um when liver cancers are slow growing they're quiet they're silent you have to look ahead of time so that is a population people with therosis are a population that we recommend um looking for cancers before anyone is symptomatic so every six months we recommend screening whether or not that needs to be done at an earlier stage in fatty liver disease world but uh mled D world is to be determined but there there's some early evidence um that around the metabolic reprogramming that's going on in the liver the insulin sensitiv ation the insulinization of the liver the oncologic potential is changing and whether or not that person needs to be screened at an earlier stage of disease is a current sort of area of interest in the field down within my group yeah I mean that's the million-dollar question Julia right is if I'm if you quoted that 3 to 5% per year increase in the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma that's once you have stage four was that what you said corre correct yeah um and and obviously once you're at stage four you got a lot of problems I mean your risk of HCC is one of them but you at this point everything is a for alarm fire but given again the prevalence of um a MAF naff

[02:24:31] Nash whatever you want to call it along that progression um yeah it would be really helpful to know is your risk of hepatocellular carcinoma 2x the normal 3x the normal 5x than normal admittedly it's a low Baseline even if you're at stage one or stage two um could be a wild to answer those questions obviously because of the sample sizes needed to that point that's an you know obvious opportunity to have a discussion with a patient about whether or not to involve pharmacologic agents or surgical agents to massively decrease their risk of not just fat but scar tissue in their liver in a in a meaningfully reversible and hopefully sustainable way um to decrease potential cancer risk is a big one and I would say you know a lot of patients come to us and again I have a a bias point of view because of my specialty you know therosis is not a death sentence a lot of times we have new diagnoses of therosis of curosis you know in people in their 30s 40s because this disease starts so young um you can live you know you can have relatively good metabolic health for quite some time before your liver falls off the curve from a dysfunction standpoint so even with therosis you you need to undergo some some appropriate screening um but the the timeline for that is not your going to need a transplant in two years once you involve portal hypertension is a different story um but I I do want to you know some of your listeners a good percentage of your listeners um might have stage three Scar and not know it um and at the age of 40 might be told that they have you know pretty early onset stage four disease but again it's not like stage four cancer um it is something that we there are opportunities um to do a lot of good in that population I want to spend a minute just talking about drugs um either currently used drugs which are obviously drugs that are kind of used to treat other things so we clearly are going to rely heavily on drugs whose primary purpose is treating diabetes which improve at least in the case of

[02:26:33] Metformin very likely improve insulin sensitivity as well um or gp1 Agonist that we've already discussed that both Target insulin sensitivity and and appetite regulation which then feeds back um but are there any other drugs out there today or in uh what I would call kind of late stage three that are specifically targeting uh fat accumulation in the liver due to metabolic consequence or even due to alcohol so your group might be familiar with the res meum um Output New England

[02:27:08] Journal proba 10 days ago phase three um so what we have learned about the liver whenever you have so many biological processes that are being regulated and a lot of exogenous inputs there's a lot of potential for Therapeutics um but that also means a lot of potential for error because of the biology of the disease so that's a thyroid hormone receptor um

[02:27:31] Agonist uh that has been studied and now shows very good promise in terms of um late stage efficacy um late stage by way of phase three um efficacy and safety in a population you know a couple couple of um limitations in terms of the population I think it's 90% European ancestry or self-described white um with the disease prevalence in the United

[02:27:55] States and around the world being very very heavily um diverse um so how that will play out in a different population is is one thing to be watched um but thyroid hormone uh signal again some of the omix based studies that we do sometimes get at the disease agnostically which old reductionist ways of doing science um sort of refractory to but it's a common way to think about what does have biological plausibility um that might have an actionable effect within the liver so when it comes to

[02:28:32] Advanced scar tissue and this one looked that um particular study looked at agents that are stage one stage two stage three um there's different forms tons of clinical trials have been done at various stages including de what we call decompensated that's when somebody with curosis falls off the curve all sudden their liver stops working so those types of Agents have been studied as well but when you when you think about promising agents independent of weight loss um reram is one um there are some that act on multiple types of

[02:29:03] Pathways like fgfs um FXR Agonist um different uh when you look at the pl the plot tropy of expression um of where the injury can occur and keeping front of mind the the liver talks to subcutaneous tissue subcutaneous adapost and muscle um that's where some of the par agonists come from that's where some of um the vitamin E the Piven trial um so so there are different agents that have been studied depending on the stage of disease um but what's messy about this work is that oftentimes things that show biological activity from a histology perspective don't necessarily result in some of our end points that we have as a community develop with the FDA and that's reversal of Nash and um no progression of fibrosis and so whether or not those histologic end points are representative of the disease at large within the liver and then also the cardiovascular and very importantly um glycemic effects are um part of what makes doing these trials so hard um you're looking at multiple variables not just liver related but also endocrine and cardiac so Julie if patients come to you and say you know should I be taking choline supplements vitamin E supplements based on the histologic changes that didn't quite meet clinical end points do you see a downside in doing that um for Coline deficiencies specifically you know those are those are sometimes measurable those are things that we we can do a these um we see them a lot in people post bass surgery um the the malnutrition form of stetic liver disease um so I'm not terribly aware of any down sides um I'm I'm cautious when I say this because every day I see a patient with some sort of new formulation um that has a hyper poent level of what we think they're getting and so you know when it comes to supplementation quantifying what's in it um but from a vitamin E perspective you know there are some downsides all allc comers um the animals you know cardiovascular longitudinal risk um and then prostate cancer just things to think about out in terms of whether or not I would choose to use it or at least have a discussion with a patient um the vitamin E is very sort of low hanging fruit from a from a steatotic perspective but we do think we we have additional discussions in people that have diabetes it's generally okay now there Studies have been done on people with therosis because again there have been some studies that indicate increased in all cause mortality depending on the dose of vitamin E and what it's being used for what's in the pipeline as far as any of the sort of mitochondrial uncoupling agents this was sort of talked about a lot um a few years ago I haven't I I haven't been paying attention so maybe it's still being talked about but is that something that is still uh looking promising so I think a lot of the work that's been done in that area if you look at um early development again if we go back to the denovo lipogenesis pathways um where there's beta oxidation where there's failures in beta oxidation where there's overwhelm um um there's a putative mechanism there

[02:32:22] I see most of potential interventions just like SI RNA um based agents in combination based therapies um and that's because for for approval um you're going to have to get it a component of fibrosis um and the most potent aspect to deal with both steatosis and fibrosis right now are some of the the Blockbuster weight loss drugs um in order to have a liver speciic specific directed therapy for something like a mitochondrial based um ideology and we typically think of micro steatosis and development in that way um rather than the macro steatosis the large flat droplets that we see with metabolic associated stetic liver disease so I see them used potentially and I'm not conflicted in in terms of speaking about this um in in forms of combination therapy there are so many different agents being talked about that are not yet public um from a preclinical perspective so um I could see that I could Envision that as a potential putative agent from a pre from a stoic um based application but in combination well Julia this has been this has been really interesting um we we've we've covered a lot of ground today this is uh

[02:33:38] I've taken a lot of notes you probably can't tell but that speaks to um how much I've been learning and how much I think this is going to kind of sharpen uh my pencil when it comes to uh patient management and our kind of diagnostic Acumen within the practice um you know again I think that the the takeaway here is is many things for me but but the probably the most important takeaways are that um we need to be very thoughtful in how we make the diagnosis here and we need to be very thorough in um evaluating the clinical history and that the overlap could be much more significant than previously realized between metabolic dysfunction and alcohol use and that doesn't take a whole lot of alcohol consumption to impact these uh steatohepatitic Pathways um and indeed many patients are probably walking around with some combination of what was formerly apold and nafal um and and and therefore the so the other thing I've really taken away from this is that um and is that is it really the the near-term cardi metabolic risk and the near-term oncology risk might even outweigh the near-term hepatology risk in the early stages of that disease there's still a great unknown there it sounds like in terms of quantifying some of those risks um but nevertheless uh I I was actually very taken back by the statement you made which was in the stage in the stage one two and three uh clinical trials you're using mace major adverse cardiac event as the clinical outcome um I think that speaks to the proximity of cardiovascular disease as a bad thing as as the thing that you ought to care about if if if clinical trials are looking at mace as an outcome um then that that that tells you how tightly linked um uh these conditions are with cardiovascular disease it's not a primary or secondary out I mean it's not the the primary endpoint you know we're still looking at Li based endpoints um but very cogn when we look at longitudinal clinical outcomes data where um post approval um surveillance will be and um clinically significant outcomes for the FDA for certain cardiovascular outcomes are a huge one got it okay thanks for clarifying that yeah that was a that was an amazing statement if I inter if I had if I was correct that it was a primary outcome but good good to hear that the or maybe more logical to hear that it's not um anyway thank you very much for sharing all this Insight again incredibly insightful and again it's just such a um again you know there are literally hundreds of thousands of people listening to us right now who are afflicted by this some of whom uh know it but I suspect many of whom don't um and the hope is that they can get the proper diagnosis and uh that that diagnosis perhaps by itself serves as the motivation to go after this and uh address it because again the other takeaway here is imminently treatable imminently reversible um and therefore you know there's no reason to not know that this is something going on inside your body couldn't agree more all right well thank you Julia opportun [Music]
