## AI Summary

Here's my structured analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast featuring Patrick Radden Keefe discussing the opioid crisis:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode explores the origins and evolution of the opioid crisis, focusing particularly on Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family's role. The discussion covers how OxyContin was developed, marketed, and ultimately contributed to a massive public health crisis. The conversation also delves into the legal proceedings, settlements, and ongoing impact of the crisis.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- OxyContin was introduced in 1996 as a time-release opioid pain medication [00:47:00]
- The drug's "continuous release" mechanism could be easily defeated by crushing the pills [00:57:21]
- By 2010, sales of 80mg OxyContin fell 25% when abuse-deterrent formulation was introduced, suggesting significant abuse [01:03:35]
- Over half a million people have died from opioid overdoses since the mid-1990s [00:07:00]
- Approximately 2 million Americans currently struggle with opioid use disorder [00:07:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider non-opioid pain management options when possible [01:19:17]
- Use of pre-surgical local anesthetics can reduce post-operative opioid needs [01:21:59]

Risk/Benefit Considerations:
- Even legitimate medical use can lead to dependence [01:08:32]
- Physiological dependence doesn't necessarily equal addiction [01:12:42]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- OxyContin (oxycodone) [throughout]
- Neurontin for neuropathic pain [01:19:17]
- Marcaine (local anesthetic) [01:21:59]
- Vioxx (NSAIDs) [01:19:17]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"The blood of how many people is on the Sackler's hands?" [01:56:20]

"There was no moment that I wasn't high." - Peter Attia discussing his personal experience with OxyContin [01:10:23]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What percentage of legitimate pain patients become addicted to opioids?
2. How effective are current abuse-deterrent formulations?
3. What role should medical education play in preventing future similar crises?

The analysis continues but I've focused on the most crucial aspects given space constraints. Would you like me to expand on any particular section?

## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA hey Patrick thank you so much for making time to sit down I know you've uh done a number of these interviews and uh one of the things I always like to do is try to go places or at least deeper than maybe you've gone before so we'll see if that can be accomplished there's certainly no shortage of material here to uh to dive into but I guess I kind of want to start with a question that I I know you've probably spoken about before which is what what Drew you to this story because the depths that you've gone to to to research your book have been uh you know certainly at the uh the upper desile I would suppose of what an investigative journalist would do um thanks it's great to be with you and and um yeah happy to happy to talk about how I came to this I I've always been interested in drugs uh as a subject um the the way in which drugs kind of fit into our society how we feel about them which drugs are lcit which drugs are illicit um I wrote a big piece a number of years ago about the legalization of cannabis in

[00:01:09] Washington state I was just very interested in this idea that you know you have this existing industry this pot industry that's been around for decades and then with the stroke of a pen you know at midnight it's legalized and what does that look like uh how do you turn it into a a tax and regulated economy um and I had done a lot of writing on

[00:01:29] Mexican drug cartels so I did uh a big piece actually before I was full-time at the New Yorker I did a cover story for the New York Times magazine back in 2012 about the caloa drug cartel um and to give you a sense of context I mean at the time I had to explain to the editors of the New York Times magazine who Chapo Guzman was he was not a household name at all um and the idea there was I wanted to do sort of a like a Harvard Business School case study of a cartel I wanted to look at it as a as a multi-billion dollar transnational Commodities Enterprise and

[00:02:04] I was really interested in how they Diversified and how vertically integrated they were and one of the questions that kind of grew out of that research was you saw at a certain point a surge in heroin so they had different I mean cinoa um delt in cocaine marijuana uh heroin and methamphetamine but after 2010 you start seeing more Mexican heroin huge volumes of it coming across the border in ways that it hadn't been before into the us and that was kind of a riddle that I started with was this this question of you know why this sudden uptick in heroin and the answer was the opioid crisis um and so it was one of these funny things where I I started out with an inquiry that was kind of solidly grounded in the realm of uh the illicit drug trade and found my way into the world of the FDA regulated Le drug trade uh with Oxycontin and puru

[00:03:04] Pharma um and sort of started looking into the origins of the opioid crisis and then discovered that this company Purdue was owned by the Sackler family and that kind of blew my mind the idea that this family that's quite well known for philanthropy had made such a huge fortune on this drug with such a controversial Legacy and so that that was kind of the way in for me you know I kind of Drew on a piece of paper a long time ago when I was trying to get my mind around this how many actors there were and you know the the paper looked something like this right it started on the left and it had producers so the the meaning and this was all I was talking about this not through the elicit chains um so you had sort of the Pharma companies of which Purdue would be sort of the champion of them and then you have the distributors or the intermediaries the McKesson and the

[00:03:54] Cardinals of the world I I actually knew a lot about messen through a previous life so I was intimately familiar with with what companies like McKesson did and how they were able to distribute products from The Producers to the retail the pharmacy the CVS's of the world so that became your third actor your fourth actor then became the the

[00:04:13] FDA um in the approval process of a drug and then the DEA around enforcement you could even put those two in a bucket you then have The Regulators that create or the policy makers rather that create the policies that allow these entities to exist and then you have the providers people that write the prescription destion for these things and ultimately you have the patience so that's maybe a bit of an oversimplification but it gives you a sense of just how complicated this web is now we're going to spend a lot of time talking about one entity within one of those buckets um so why do you think that that is a place for someone who's maybe listening to this podcast to get a pretty good sense of the magnitude of this problem because

[00:04:56] I don't think anybody could with a straight face say there isn't a problem and you'll put some numbers to what that means but it's interesting that perhaps the study of purua and the saers more than any other single entity in that entire chain that I explained could provide a greater context of what we're up against would would you agree with that I mean I'm assuming you have a bias otherwise you wouldn't have studied them so extensively yeah I mean I it's interesting I it's it's great that you lay it out with that much Nuance because that's the kind of nuance that often gets lost um so there's two things I'd say I mean one is a kind of a sort of observation that that I would make as a writer and a journalist and somebody who writes books is um I go where my interests lead me I you know I write stories that I think are are interesting stories interesting to me that I think are important that I think would be interesting to readers um it's very very often the case that I'll spend a lot of time on on something and and the reaction that people have is well why did you pick this why didn't you write about this other thing you know I think that there's this other variable that's very important here um and I you know I kind of um instinctively resist those types of questions right because on some level I feel as though It's my prerogative as a writer to kind of pick the area that interests me and do it and hopefully do it well in a way that has some Integrity um but I make no claim to suggesting like this is the be all and end all so in this case if it's the opioid crisis you know there there would never be any suggestion like this is the only book you need to read on the opioid crisis um and and to segue from that into the particulars here so when we talk about the opioid crisis we're talking about a an incredibly complex Public Health crisis that unfolds over the course of a quarter of a century you know today the numbers are are a little imprecise but you know you have at least a half a million people who've died from opioid overdoses since the mid to late 1990s by some estimates you have two plus million

[00:07:00] Americans today struggling with an opioid use disorder of one sort or another and when we talk about opioids that's actually a kind of pretty capacious category right so it's it's uh you know regulated drugs like Oxycontin but it's also uh fentanyl you know that that that comes in from China or or Mexico um uh it's heroin and in fact when you talk about the the death toll today uh I think the sackers certainly um uh would be quick to say today people are dying in very large numbers from heroin and Fentanyl overdoses not from Oxycontin or indeed you know from from most um prescription painkillers you know this this problem has kind of transitioned into an illicit drug problem so why pick uh oxxy conton why picked the sackers in in my view you know in part because it's an interesting story interested in the fact that this was a family family Dynamics are interesting to me um in part because of the philanthropic Legacy because there's um this kind of Disconnect or there was until recent years between the reputation that the family had and what

[00:08:15] I would argue is the reality of of their business but but most importantly because I think that this was a oxycoton was sort of the in the words of somebody who worked on the drug was the tip of the spear so I think it's you know it this is the kind of nuance that often gets lost right but the the it can be possible to stipulate that today the opioid crisis is a heroin INF fenal crisis and also to keep in your mind the idea that absent Oxycontin we might not be where we are today that that it was the the kind of first mover in terms of changing prescribing habits in the

[00:08:51] United States in a way that had really fundamental consequences and ultimately built up a market for these drugs Market which eventually migrated to illicit sources of Supply so that that would be the reason I'm sure we can talk about it in more detail but I think there's kind of a special role that puru and the sackers played which is not for a second to suggest that there isn't blame with all those different buckets that you mentioned because there absolutely is and I think you know based on what

[00:09:21] I've read of your writing it you also seem very um very well informed about those other buckets so I definitely want to make sure we touch on them but there's no place to to start like where we're going to start so let's start with the three Sackler Brothers um take your take your pick of who you want to begin with Arthur Raymond

[00:09:41] Mortimer um who who were these guys what got them interested in in in Pharmaceuticals um yeah I mean you have to start with Arthur I think you've got these three brothers um who they were the children of immigrants their parents had come over from Europe at the turn of the last century settled in Brooklyn uh they were

[00:10:01] Jewish parents didn't speak English really all that well initially they spoke yish in the home um and they raised their kids to um to believe in a few things I think I think to believe in education to believe in meritocracy you know there's this I think kind of wonderfully American um there are these kind of very American like mythical Contours to the early parts of this story right where there's a family that kind of came with nothing and and had an a hope and an expectation that within the span of one generation they would build an Empire and really kind of make their mark on the country and the world and they were right and so they raised these three brothers Arthur later said that from the age of four he knew he would be a doctor um with a sense that the you know you're all going to grow up you're going to get educated you're going to become

[00:10:58] Physicians and there was a that there was kind of nothing as um prestigious and virtuous as being a doctor um I think there was a real kind of um uh veneration in this family for the role of the physician in society and so the brothers grow up but they also grow up you know against the backdrop of the Great Depression there's a period where their father loses everything and so um there was an expectation that you know you also have to go out there and hustle and make money and have jobs and so all three brothers work multiple jobs and um you know i' say in the book of

[00:11:38] Arthur Sackler it's like he he's a guy it's like he squeezed four or five lifetimes into one lifetime in terms of everything that he did um and um they they end up eventually in the pharmaceutical business but the way they get there is through pharmaceutical advertising and marketing and that actually starts back in high school you know when when Arthur sackler's in high school he he gets jobs on the on the um on the student Publications he's at this huge

[00:12:09] High School arasmus Hall High School it's something like six or seven thousand students uh in Brooklyn in Flatbush still there today and um he gets jobs you know on the student magazine the student newspaper but he becomes the advertising manager and if you think about it you have six or seven thousand students that you can reach that was a real job um and so that's where the the hustle starts with Arthur and all three brothers end up training a psychiatrist uh practicing as psychiatrists but they they pretty quickly pivot into

[00:12:45] Commerce so what were the types of drugs of that era that were really making a difference in their practice um it seems that um you know sedatives were were potentially becoming of interest in that era yeah I mean you know you have this kind of early um amazing moment where Arthur there's this pattern that asserts itself with the brothers where Arthur

[00:13:12] Goes and he does something and then he kind of brings his brothers in with him that starts in high school with him getting you know he's got got more jobs than he can handle so he starts handing them off to the brothers and he ends up at the creedmore psychiatric hospital which is a a huge Asylum vast kind of industrial asylum in Queens New York public State mental hospital with a staggering capacity right it's something like 6,000 beds I me I when I read that

[00:13:39] I thought that can't be possible I don't know what that would look like meaning I I literally can't picture the infrastructure large enough to have 6,000 inpatient beds yeah I mean it was a vast facility uh but I I believe it was a facility designed for 4,000 beds so um I mean part of this is a reflection of the kind of um you know it's interesting because in these years right like this is this is pre- thorazine um it's kind of the the it's like the last um kind of maximalist phase of um of big State Mental Hospitals right of people basically being warehoused for life in these facilities um it's just prior to the deinstitutionalization that happens in in the decades that follow and so the brothers get there and they're shocked by the conditions um and also if you think about it I mean Arthur in particular he was a Freudian he trained as a Freudian right so like not a lot of talk therapy happening at a 6,000 bed hospital um they were looking for were they still doing lobotomies and things like that they were I mean in fact labotomy start up during this time so it's but it's a lot of electroshock treatment and then and then labotomy and

[00:14:52] I should say I mean you know electroshock has its has its Defenders um even today uh it obviously has you know it is very successful for some people in some circumstances but the sac brothers are there and they're administering it thousands of times and I think it just became more and more demoralizing for them because they just felt as though we have to how can we as

[00:15:15] Physicians not have um developed some more humane way of administering to our patients and so they develop even at that point this theory that a lot of the afflictions they're seeing are you know probably have some some basis that is fundamentally chemical and if that's the case then there's probably some chemical solution um and the brothers don't have anything to do with thorine but when it comes along uh they see that right I mean this is in some ways a kind of glimpse of the future that they had that they had envisioned um and uh it it was I think generally speaking an exciting time in the Pharma business right because you have you have

[00:16:03] Penicillin um which huge Game Changer in the second world war and then a lot of these um you know these companies that today we think of as like big Pharma prior to the second world war they didn't really look like they do now um they were producing chemicals but they weren't really producing branded drugs in quite the same way and then you just get this go go period where they're all competing and they're developing new antibiotics and um they're coming out with new products every few weeks and suddenly they need to differentiate themselves and consumers are you know they're no longer uh going to the the pharmacy and having the pharmacist mix whatever it is that their doctor has prescribed they're going in and requesting drugs by their brand name um and so it's it's in that kind of exciting I think quite idealistic Whirlwind climate that the sack Brothers come of age where did PUK

[00:17:07] Pharma come from was it a company that they founded was it something that they bought and later transformed it was the latter it had been um there its Origins stay back to the 19th century uh it was a little patent medicine company um based funnily enough uh on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village which is like the I you know you can go to the building that it once occupied it's just funny that the you know the the what had once been the the the sort of humble Purdue

[00:17:35] Frederick Factory is like today somebody's $18 million townhouse and in 1952 Arthur Sackler had already achieved a great deal of financial success not in the drug business per se but in in pharmaceutical advertising so he kind of he really makes his name um by joining and then taking over a pharmaceutical advertising firm and he's a genius for advertising drugs at this point where all these drug companies need to figure out ways to differentiate their products and reach doctors and persuade them to prescribe and with some of the money he's made

[00:18:18] Arthur purchases this company Purdue Frederick and he basically gives it to his brothers so he remains a um you know he's a stakeholder in the company he owns a third of it um but he's a silent partner basically and the brothers will run the company and that that's in starting in 52 and what happens over the next 30

[00:18:39] Years so they you know it's funny Purdue Frederick was a very successful company I mean the brothers get rich but they're getting rich in a in a in a way that is um I think that even Arthur would probably have sniffed at because Arthur Who again you know he he's he's um he's one of the owners of the company but not involved day-to-day he's really focusing on the marketing of pharmaceuticals and his big success is I mean he had many successes but his biggest success um is that he designs the the marketing and advertising strategy for um the minor tranquilizer

[00:19:22] Librium and then for Valium both of which Ro develops and and Librium becomes the biggest selling drug in the history of the pharmaceutical industry uh and then it's surpassed only by Valium and then for years the two of them are in the top five drugs uh Nationwide and Arthur designed all the advertising and the marketing for that and he he devised this um interesting compensation scheme where basically he said I'm going to get a an escalating series of bonuses depending on how many pills you sell and there's no ceiling so he becomes vastly Wealthy on the basis of these drugs his brothers meanwhile you know what they're doing is less

[00:20:01] Cutting Edge they basically license over-the-counter products and then sell them and they were really smart about it so they had a antiseptic solution Betadine which is still out there um and they you know they got the rights to that just before the Vietnam War it had kind of Battlefield applications in

[00:20:19] Vietnam um they had a uh elative senut very successful these are these kind of cash crop products they're very unglamorous but they're Staples um overthe counter stuff but year in year out they're very very successful the irony by the way of the company that would create the opioid boom having a laxative which is of course there to address one of the most painful short-term consequences of opioid use being constipation well and the crazy thing is that they eventually it gets to a point where the sales reps for Purdue would go out and you know they they they they'd mark Market the one with the other right it's uh they um uh they would Market them together but the um but it's really only in the 80s that the company starts getting more late 70s early 80s the company starts getting aggressive about really investing in R&D um and developing its own um prescription drugs uh and it it's at that point that they move into pain management any inclination from your research why they decided to keep this company private as opposed to take it public like many of the large Pharma companies God you know I can only speculate um but the the saish had a real sense I think for a long time that this was a kind of oldw world Enterprise that it was a family business it was familyowned phys owned they would always say um there was a sense that they controlled it and they thought of the people who worked for them as family um you know it's really only with the Advent of oxy conton in the 90s that the that it becomes this you know multi-billion dollar company up to that point um it was a pretty modest outfit um the sacker brothers themselves did really well they were very wealthy um but it was a kind of manageable family firm and I I think that there was there was something to that um I don't know I don't know what it would have looked like if it went public

[00:22:38] I do know that you kind of put your finger on something there because I think when you when you get into the later stages kind of post the introduction of oxyc conton there's a lot of stuff that happens at the in this story that would never happen in a public company yeah that's sort of my that's the revisionist history in me which is saying like had they a public company how far would this have gone yeah I mean I don't mean to suggest that

[00:23:03] I think in the early going and we we can sort of get into this into the particulars but there are these like hinge moments in this story and so you have um you know you've got all the stuff that happens prior to the introduction of oxyc conton and then you you start seeing things go wrong and then they go more wrong and it's like well how do you handle it when you see how do you handle it when you start getting calls saying that the product that you sell is killing people and and I think that probably would have been a different response in a public company um and then the really crazy thing is eventually we're getting ahead of ourselves here but eventually you get a a guilty plea in in a federal criminal case in 2007 and I think at a public company if you had that um I just think heads would have rolled you'd have a total change of personnel you know big shakeup on the board um and at a at a private held family company what happened was like nobody fired yeah yeah so talk a little bit about mson as the precursor to oxy conton and maybe the pharmaco kinetics of it but more importantly what that transition was about so you know in the in the 1980s um you saw the beginning I mean actually dating back to the 70s a kind of revision of school of physics Ians who felt in in the UK and in the US and other parts of the world who felt that um the medical establishment had been um not taking pain seriously enough as a problem that um doctors weren't treating pain aggressively they were treating it just just merely as a symptom not as a problem in and of itself um that there wasn't enough medical education uh for physicians in terms of identifying pain and responding to it um and kind of going along with this was was a sense that that many Physicians had that um there was a resistance to uh prescribing opioids out of a fear of addiction that that that that doctors had been too stingy in prescribing opioids for pain um because of concerns about abuse and addiction and it's in this context that mson this drug has developed and it's a cancer drug it's a drug for cancer pain um and it's basically just morphine uh but the the real Innovation was the conton parts so conton short for continuous and it's it's essentially this the coating on the pill and the idea is that this will regulate the flow of the drug into the bloodstream over course of hours um and so emsc was developed uh in the UK and then rolled out in the US and it was it was you know it was kind of a ground breaking drug in its way very successful for the company you know is I don't remember exactly what it was generating in terms of

[00:26:04] Revenue at its height but three or $400 million a year um which was a lot for Purdue and at the time and um it was a big success and and I think the the family was was proud of it and there was a sense that um you know they were doing a good thing uh relieving terrible pain for people people uh suffering from cancer um and uh and doing very well financially and and they and so they were kind of in this world of of um doctors who were thinking about pain and wanting to kind of re-evaluate the way in which pain is treated they were Heroes and you had this kind of interesting and I don't think necessarily altogether cynical Confluence of interests right in which Purdue starts sponsoring academic conferences on the treatment of pain and medical conferences and seminars and they're sort of out there with an obvious commercial interest but also um I I think a sense that you know we're part of a revolution here we're going to revolutionize the way in which pain is treated so whose idea is oxy content I mean in some sense it's an obvious leap because if Ms content is simply morphine sulfate formulated in a continuous fashion there are other um narcotics out there per cassette already existed it was simply hydrocodone with acetaminophen hydrocodone existed by itself in a non-time relased format so was there great Innovation basically saying we're just going to make a Time relase version of hydrocodone just as it had been done with morphine was that effectively the aha moment yeah I mean what happens is that

[00:27:53] Ms content is um something I mean I should say and this will be this will be not a surprise to you but but to me coming from the outside I I was really startled um I knew as a kind of objective analytical matter that uh that the life cycle of a patent is very important to a drug company I don't think I fully appreciated the degree to which it is the sun and the stars and you know it's everything and um there were so many points in the course of my reporting for this story where there' be some some sort of mystery about motivation there'd be some weird thing that they did and I couldn't figure out why and I would puzzle over it and puzzle over it and puzzle over it and then it always turned out to be something having to do with a patent you know that the um for example the the the

[00:28:40] Pediatric indication the Pediatric indication very good example right so the um where they they uh applied to get the uh at a point where Oxycontin was hugely controversial already and causing all kinds of problems they they applied to uh for the the Pediatric indication for the the drug and I I sort of couldn't figure out why and and they had all these explanations that turned out to not be true and then it turned out it was because they thought they would get an additional six months of patent exclusivity uh if they got it but the um there's a bunch of cases like that and in in in the case of Ms conton the patent is running out at a certain point and they realize that um it's going to decimate their profits and so they just start talking about hey what else could we put with you know the content system um and some of the the family Dynamics here are are a little humorous but there's according to Cathy Sackler who's one of the second generation sackers

[00:29:38] Who's involved in the company and is a medical doctor um she has dinner with Richard Sackler her cousin um and kind of rival within the company uh at a certain point and she suggests what about oxycodone and according to her Richard didn't know what oxycodone was and she had to explain and oxycodone is stronger than both hydrocodone and morphine it is and the and well I mean part of what's interesting about about oxycodone is that the um there's this amazing thing that happens basically where they they make their decision okay we're going to use oxycodone so we'll we'll develop

[00:30:15] Oxycontin and there are these conversations that happen and they happen over email and I have the emails where these senior Executives at the company um and Richard Sackler are talking about the market and um the idea that Ms conton was a drug for cancer pain and the stigma associated with morphine this this notion that you know if you're a if you're a regular person not a doctor and your doctor tells you that your mother's going on morphine that means your mother is gonna die um and what they realize is that uh oxycodone didn't have those same associations even though it's stronger than morphine they did focus groups and you have Oxycodone in in uh in peret and in Percodan and that was the the primary way in which Physicians were encountering those drugs and you know that's right I I misspoke earlier I said it hydroc it's actually oxycodone that's right it's oxycodone and when they're cut with aspirin or aceta minen it's you know it's a relatively small dose there's only so much you can take um um so what they noticed in these focus groups is that Physicians had a sort of a sense of of Oxycodone as more benign you know less threatening there was less stigma but also they they saw it as weaker and there are these incredible emails where they say well listen there's only so many people who have cancer pain you know we did great with our cancer drug but there's a much bigger Market out there of people suffering not just from severe pain but moderate pain uh chronic pain back pain sports injury there's a funny there's a funny cartoon you could Envision here which is another revisionist which is imagine if instead they just decided to figure out a way to make more cancer patients how what could we do to increase the number of people dying of cancer to expand our market and then someone goes no no that's too hard that's too hard I got a better idea let's just figure out a way to make everybody who doesn't have cancer takes this drug right and in fact to kind of to to sort of create the need which is you know a big part of what the marketing ended up being yeah I mean the ology that that I come back to you know the first third of the book is devoted to Arthur Sackler in those earlier years and and that was a a a very deliberate

[00:32:37] Choice even though Arthur Sackler dies in ' 87 before the introduction of oxyc conton because I think there are all of these um I think there are all of these um uh things that happen earlier that that are kind of the seeds for what comes later so the analogy I always think of is is thorine which the the original s brothers see you know thorine is a um is a major tranquilizer for people who are psychotic and um it was very successful you know emptied out the the uh asylums pretty quickly I mean there were other things that did as well but it was a real GameChanger but there's only so many people who are actually you know require that kind of heavy duty solution and then Arthur Sackler makes his fortune on the minor tranquilizers where you know who Among Us doesn't feel a little stressed at the end of the day um you know who couldn't benefit from something to make them relax a little bit uh and that was what turned Librium and valum into these huge Blockbusters it's kind of a similar thing here where um there's this sense that you know Ms conton is a drug for this subset of people who are in experiencing terrible cancer pain there's a much bigger community of people um who have uh moderate pain but the weirdness of it is that they then take a drug that is strong

[00:33:58] ER not weaker and Market it that way and you see these emails in which these Executives say in our focus groups doctors erroneously think that oxycodone is weaker than morphine let's not do anything to make them realize that they're wrong about the product that we're selling them because if we did it could constrain our market so they developed this new drug what's unusual about the process by which it receives its FDA approval uh a handful of things um so they we can insert Curtis right at any point here by the way yeah exactly so there's a guy named Curtis

[00:34:45] Wright who was the medical examiner at FDA uh who was kind of the you know the grand Inquisitor he was the one they had to satisfy um in order to get the drug approved but also in order to get the marketing claim maybe explain to folks why those two things are very important why is it that if you and I went into business tomorrow to create a drug the FDA would have to approve it for you know from a safety and efficacy standpoint but then they'd also have to basically put guard rails around what we could actually say it's for I don't think people fully understand that dual role there well I mean it's it's um you know it's a strangest thing

[00:35:31] Richard Sackler this second generation Sackler was probably the most intimately acquainted with or involved with with Oxycontin um there's a point where he talks about how the package insert in in a you know bottle of pills is our most potent selling instrument and it's a strange thing right because I I think for the average consumer you know you see that the sort of dense wording on that and it feels it feels like the fine print it feels like something the doctors read you know you may read it as well but it it doesn't feel like a marketing document right but if you're the drug company uh it's all about the indications it's all about the claims that you can make for um you know for for what kinds of ailments this medication might alleviate um and then also in terms of the kind of competitive positioning so in the case of oxy conton um I mean I'll give you I'll give you a a very extreme example there there's they didn't do any tests on the addictiveness of the drug they didn't do any tests on the abuse liability of the drug but there was a kind of hypothesis that they had it Purdue which was because of the conton system you wouldn't have the kind of Peaks and troughs uh of you know a sort of wave of euphoria when a big dose of the drug hits your bloodstream followed by a kind of diminution um and withdrawal and instead it's this steady regulated

[00:37:00] Continuous Flow and their hypothesis was that because of that it wouldn't be addictive and it wouldn't be subject to abuse and that that was a competitive Advantage Visa other opioid products that were out there on the market and um you have this kind of crazy stretch where they start working very closely with Curtis Wright on the approval process um some strange stuff happens I mean the you know the company say I don't even think this is in the book but the company sends Curtis Wright this is in the 1990s this is 95 the company sends him a webcam this is like a very early webcam where he can talk directly with folks in Stamford Curtis Wright uh starts requesting that they send things not to his FDA office but to his house and at a certain point A Team of people from

[00:37:59] Purdue travel to Maryland and get a hotel room and they spend three days with Curtis Wright helping him write the his reviews of their studies let's just pause there for a second it's it's almost impossible to imagine that happening right I'm not saying it didn't because you've got the email proof that it happened I'm just saying from a matter of process that statement is so difficult to comprehend so how how do we put that in perspective what did other people at the

[00:38:36] FDA know at this point in time what what do we think emboldened the Sackler leadership to do that without fear of Curtis Wright turning to them and saying are you freaking crazy yeah yeah I mean h how does this unfold so it's really hard hard to say and I've tried to to kind of puzzle through this and I should say I mean you know Curtis Wright uh wouldn't talk to I got him on the phone and he he very quickly hung up um he didn't want to talk to me about any of this um I you know I filed a Freedom of Information

[00:39:12] Act request with the FDA which they they draged their feet in the way that that Federal bureaucracies always do so I actually sued them in federal court to compel them to turn over documents and I got a a New York federal judge to order them to do document production to me thousands and thousands of pages of documents and my first request was for all the emails of

[00:39:38] Curtis Wright and um the FDA came back and told me that uh all of his corresponden and emails have either been lost or destroyed yeah which again you couldn't make that level of of of malens up like you can't you know it just it's it's so ridic like how do they even say that with a straight face I know I know well particularly given that the you know I could understand if it was a sort of a a document retention thing where after a certain number of years they eliminate stuff in his case though this is a guy who had been you know he was investigated by Department of Justice investigators uh really starting in like 2002 2003 um I mean this was somebody who was red flagged early by other other federal agencies the notion that um that they would today say uh you know it's the equivalent of saying like there was a very small warehouse fire it's just that box I'm afraid that you know we didn't retain is pretty shocking to me but the but so so I I've tried to sort of puzzle this out there there's an interesting um email chain so some of this email has come out not through the FDA but through

[00:40:50] Federal investigations of Purdue there's an interesting moment where one of the Purdue officials says that he happened to bump into Curtis right at a conference this is as all of this approval stuff is happening and they they talked in a kind of a sidebar way it was not formal and I you know my sense is that the generally speaking the

[00:41:10] FDA process at least in theory is one that is it's pretty formalized right because you don't want uh too much of an opportunity for improper influence to happen and there's this interesting memo that the Purdue guy sends back to headquarters where he says you know I got talking with Curtis R it was great we talked about the whole oxycon he indicated that he would be open to other such informal exchanges in the future or something to that effect so I don't know I don't know how to how to make sense wouldn't the aams razor response be the following given that a year after leaving the FDA Curtis Wright is now employed by Purdue

[00:41:47] Pharma isn't the only obvious explanation here that there was a quid pro quo a very clear and direct quid pro quo made between Pur do and Curtis right so it's interesting the the the former Federal prosecutor longtime Federal prosecutor from the Western District of Virginia who um prepared really the you know the biggest case against Purdue um and spent years pouring over millions of pages of documents and looked really hard at Curtis Wright he told me on the record this is a guy's pretty careful about what he says and he told me on the record uh I think a deal was made he said I I can't prove it just my opinion but I think a deal was made when you look at the totality of the evidence uh it seems hard for me to believe any other I mean saying exactly what you are you know any other explanation I I don't know that I need to go that far and and here's why um I don't think Purdue even needed to say hey make this work for us and there might be a job for you on the other side

[00:42:52] I I think that and this is where from a policy point of view this gets really hard to to regulate right is that the FDA is full of overeducated really smart people who are making government salaries and uh you know they they have the unglamorous task of working on these approvals and on the other side of the table is this huge multi-billion dollar industry where uh you know you can make a lot of money and where there's a great deal of interest in former FDA officials you know both in having them come and work at the firm because it's at the pharmaceutical firm because it's that's useful in a whole bunch of ways but also I would argue I think there's probably a great deal of interest in in having the FDA officials that you're talking to know that someday there might be a job for them um and that's this hard thing because it's not corruption in a in an explicit quid pro quo sense it's not corruption in a way that's actually all that easy police because if you're the FDA what do you do I mean do you do you say okay we're going to have a cooling off period you know once you leave the agency how how long a year three years you know at what point do you start losing talent because people don't want to be locked up after they leave I

[00:44:14] I think these are I don't mean to suggest for a second that these are are easy questions but I also think there's what I would call a kind of soft corruption that pervades this whole process and I don't think it's Unique to Curtis Wright he's a very extreme example but what you get is in his case as you said he goes a year after oxycoton is approved he goes and works works at Purdue for three times his government salary um but you to to your you know your point about the the marketing claims there's a line in the original package insert for oxy conton that says the conton seal is believed to reduce the abuse liability of the drug and that's a weird thing to have a package insert in general I think I mean it's it's a it's a great marketing claim but it's like is believed doesn't seem very scientific necessarily what was the basis of that belief the scientific basis was there a study that was cited was there an experiment that was done I mean it wouldn't be hard to have studied these things there wasn't one no in this case what it was was it was this conjecture that because of the content system you're not getting the high highs and the low lows and therefore it would it would make it uh you know less prone to abuse than other drugs and the real measure of of you know how compromised this line was is that to this day nobody will admit writing that line so Curtis

[00:45:51] Wright has been asked about this and he said oh yeah it was it wasn't the FDA it was Purdue Pharma the Purdue Pharma officials were there say it wasn't us it was Curtis right but I mean to me as a as a consumer right the idea that the FDA is working so closely with a drug company that literally you don't know where one ends and the other begins and there's a line that ends up in the package insert claiming that this drug is safer than other

[00:46:17] Alternatives and nobody can tell you who wrote it so what is it 96 when Ms when um when oxyon hits the hits the retail early 996 yeah so how long does it take before the unintended consequences uh because there's really two unintended consequences here um I guess the first is people who probably would be better served with another form of pain control or instead using this drug that would be one unintended consequence that's one that Purdue would not be against because that's simply more market share and then there's the unintended consequence that everyone including

[00:47:00] Purdue would presumably not want which is you start to kill your customers uh you know sort of the Tobacco Company problem right like to have an addictive product with no termination of use is wonderful if you just could figure out a way to keep the customer alive so what are the what are the canaries in the coal mine with respect to these problems and and and how are they handled so I mean I think in some ways it's probably useful to start with what the official story was um which is that the drugs released in early 96 and according to sworn testimony by several senior Executives at the company and by Richard

[00:47:50] Sackler uh they had no inkling that there was any kind of a major problem for four years there were four blissful years where they got lots of letters from Pain patients saying you know you've given me my life back um and there was no real sense at all that there was any kind of a problem and it's only in in early 2000 when the United

[00:48:12] States Attorney for the state of Maine writes a letter to thousands of Physicians saying this drug Oxycontin is is really dangerous actually it's killing people people are overdosing we got we got a real problem here and there's a crime problem associated with it and a little bit after this time the chief medical officer Paul goldenheim the chief medical officer of Purdue

[00:48:32] Pharma is brought in front of Congress right and he's asked questions about this what does he say same thing he says we had no inkling that there was any kind of big problem until this hinge point which is when this us attorney writes this letter in uh in 2000 um so and interestingly the other thing they say is that they say oh we read about it in the Press they say we we we read we read about these problems in the press and for me as a journalist this was funny because the um you know I've written about a lot of companies doing bad things and and uh and you know reporters like to take credit where they can where they can get it but generally speaking of a company is doing a bad thing you know they don't find out about it because they read about it in your article um you know they usually know a long time before or the rest of the world does so there was something about their explanation that always seemed um just on its face seemed a little fishy to me uh when I dug into it and got a bunch of um documentation what I learned is that it was a it was a lie I mean they you know they knew really early on um how bold face AE was that let's use uh goldenheim as a specific example so in 2000 he's he's giving sworn testimony that we no clue this was going on what do his emails from the late 1990s suggest that they did I mean it's not just you know you name it there's there's all kinds of back and forth about um these drugs there's another sort of associated lie that they told which is that there had never been a problem with Ms conton um which also is a lie a lie that was told under oath uh when in fact there's all kinds of back and forth about that but you've got very very senior people including goldenheim emailing about the fact that um there's an abuse problem pharmacies are getting robbed uh you know um there's the kind of people talking about the street value of the drug there was a um a a kind of media advisory group that was brought in to do interviews with these senior officials there are literally emails in which some of these senior officials who who later claimed that you know nothing was said will be emailing about it and then they'll say do should we have all this chat on email you know it's maybe not a good idea for us to be having these conversations on email so you have a very clear awareness that there's a problem and if you back up for a second part of the reason oxy conton did what it did part of the reason I would argue it it changed the way in which these drugs are prescribed as a as a category of drugs is that they had one of the biggest marketing forces ever and they sent out hundreds of something like 700 sales reps to Fan out across the country um meeting with thousands and thousands of

[00:51:33] Physicians and that was how they kind of got the message of oxyc conton out there but but those are the canaries and the coal mine right like those are the the sales rep who goes into a local community there's a story I tell in the in the book about um a guy named Steve may who was a Purdue sales rep in

[00:51:52] Virginia uh and West Virginia and he had a um it's 99 9 so this is like before according to goldenheim like they didn't know anything at this point it's 99 um Steve may had this one doctor the really big prescribers they would call them whales um you know to use the vernacular of a Vegas casino for a big Gambler um because if you had a big prescriber that was great for your for your bonus if you were a sales rep so Steve may had this whale and uh he went to call on her which he would do from time to time and she's upset when he showed up and he asked her what the problem was and she said she had a young relative uh a young girl who just died of an oxycontin overdose so there you literally have an oxycontin sales rep going out and meeting with a Doctor Who's a big prescriber and finding out that her relative has died from an oxycontin overdose and all those reps are writing these encounters up in notes and sending them back to headquarters so I think what I was able to substantiate in the book at some length is that um it's clear really early on there's a problem

[00:52:59] I think you know from as as early as 97 so that's just a year after the drug is released and um we're just coming back into the company and those discussions are not just happening at low levels they're happening at high levels I think what happens in 2000 is it just becomes impossible for them to deny it anymore right it's like at that point the sort of head in the sand won't work as a strategy so then you need to Pivot you need to say okay there is a problem here's our spin on it and spin of course became these are really bad people like you know we've created a miracle breakthrough product that helps millions of people but there are these dereli who abuse this product and are jeopardizing it for everybody else we really need to ramp up the enforcement of those people or we need to somehow just decide that they're back I mean what was proposed as the um the remediation for the problem it was a bunch of things all of which were very much along the lines of what you're talking about so the the suggestion was you know there's nothing intrinsically dangerous about the drug um I should say the level of denial here is pretty impressive but I mean the sackers even today argue that um that instances of of iatrogenic addiction to Oxycontin where it's prescribed to you by a doctor for a legitimate condition and you take it as as instructed by The Physician are vanishingly rare they that's that's like a a block that they have where they they they can't really acknowledge even today now do we know what that true number is so if we if we if we say there are and

[00:54:42] I'm being a bit perhaps overly simpl overly simplistic but but and so feel free to make this more realistic but if we say there are three buckets in which a patient a patient came across Oxycontin bucket one would be uh and this excludes the cancer patient so I want to take the endof life cancer patient out of the equation for a moment so if you talk about patients who are not terminally ill who who are um on who have become exposed to and or addicted to oxycon um entry path number one is the individual who is recovering from surgery they are by their by their actual Doctor Who is a legitimate doctor given a prescription for a reasonable quantity of Oxycontin that should get them through the perioper period okay path number two is the person who and by the way you can get to path number two from path number one so these are not independent paths but path number two is the Sham doctor right the you know the dock in the Box who's prescribing this stuff from one state when you're in another state doing it online uh or running basically the you know the revolving door Clinic where you just come in you ask for what you want you get a prescription you go out the door provided you fill it at a pharmacy a couple hundred miles away so you know they're a doctor only in legal terms but they're certainly not a physician in any reasonable sense of the word and then path number three is the illicit acquisition of oxycoton through a stolen channel so in much in the same way you would buy any illegal drug

[00:56:16] You're simply buying oxycon do we have a sense of the relative distribution of paths 1 two and three no and I mean think it's it's it's very hard and in fact impossible to parse it out and I also think it's it's something that's that's fluctuated a lot over time but you do get these these little data points that I think are

[00:56:37] Illuminating and these are these are honestly like two of the more shocking things I I discovered in in in my research but but it's hard because it's it's a little complex and so sometimes I think the um from the from the cheap seats it's it's like hard to hard to appreciate the gravity of this so produce cells oxycoton they release it '96 right away people realize that that that conton seal you can override that just by crushing the pills so you can chew them you can grind the pill um you can dissolve it in water after you've grinded and and chewed it if you want intravenously um there's actually a warning on the models telling you not to crush the pills because if you do you could get a potentially toxic dose of

[00:57:21] Oxycodone so so in a weird way that functions as a kind of inadvertent how-to I think that's significant for um at least you know maybe for all three of the buckets you're talking about because you get people who um are just kind of opportunistic drug users looking to get high uh you know I I certainly have interviewed a lot of people who say that heroin was scary you bought it on the street you shoot it with a needle that you know they were looking to get high it was like a party drug in high school oxycoton was but that they there was something reassuring about the fact that it had been approved by the FDA that it is you know that even if you bought it from a dealer uh at some point this entered the stream of Commerce you know there was a doctor writing a a prescription um you also have people who who you know uh are prescribed the drug by a doctor and it doesn't work for as long as they think it will or they find theirselves just themselves just kind of in its grip they want more and some of those people actually convert to the immediate release thing what they find is they they don't want to wait and so they'll end up chewing the the pills um because it relieves their pain faster you know is is what they'll say um so you get different ways of getting there but um the pill can be crushed that's 96 in 2010 Purdue rolls out this reformulated version of Oxycontin that they've worked on for years it's basically you can't crush it it's sort of it's like a Gummy

[00:58:54] Bear you know if you if you try and break it up it just kind of goes chewy and gummy on you um there's an interesting backstory there questions about why it took so long to roll that out there's an interesting aspect of the timing which is that the original patents on oxycontin were about to run out so it kind of just in the nick of time they have this um line extension basically in the form of the reformulated drug but well it goes one better than that doesn't it Patrick because at the time they even basically declare that their old formulation is probably un safe which is really a great dig at the competition which is as we're about to roll this thing off its patent life we want to make sure that nobody else uses it either as we reignite a new patent on a new drug which is infinitely safer in the presence of our old

[00:59:41] Dangerous Drug I mean again that would be the skeptical view of things oh I mean and I think in this case the skeptical view is is uh is right on and in fact there are emails going back years and years and years talking about how if they came up with a with a a kind of abuse proof tamper proof formulation that would function as a line extension that that was the reason they were doing it primarily was to extend the patent life um but yeah the the kind of um uh the surpassing cynicism of the idea that having for at that point 14 years said oh it's perfectly safe it's perfectly safe it's perfectly safe the original formulation they develop their new formulation and then they turn around and say but we wouldn't want to see any generic versions of the original formulation because in fact it's not so safe after all um is amazing and it worked and the FDA obliged but so here's the statistic that really blows my mind 2010 the reformulated version is rolled out and the old pills uh are you know they kind of disappear from the shelves and the new ones take their place and what I discovered was a study an internal study that found then 2010 when this happened for the 80 milligram pills which is the biggest and most profitable pills on the market also the most popular on the black market sales Nationwide fell 25% so I can't tell you you know proportionately who's in what bucket what I can tell you is that up to 2010 I think it's safe to Intuit it 25% of the sales of 80 milligram Oxycontin were going to people who were abusing those pills in you know in one way or another um which is astonishing to me because I mean that's that's a that's like a a non-trivial part of the company's profits so on the one hand it's you know they don't want their patients their their their customers to die um on the other hand there is a sense in which even as they were decrying the black market like the black market was helping to pay the bills at the company yeah and the thing that the thing that I really wish we could have an insight into is even if you take the most charitable view of things which is that every person's first interaction with

[01:01:57] Oxycontin was through path one that is to say you were legitimately prescribed this for non-cancer Pain by a legitimate caring understanding physician but then you know a subset of the people left bucket one for bucket two or bucket three as their appetite for the drug grew in the absence of an indication right that's versus how many people Den noo show up in bucket two and bucket 3 drug seeking um you know the fact that we don't know that is it makes this very difficult and creates this moral ambiguity around it which um you know frankly is a bit of a distraction from the real you know the culpability here oh that's interesting I mean I I think it's it's a very um I think the fact that we don't know it and that it's impossible to know combined with the fact that when you look at you know this is a favorite of

[01:02:54] Purdue and the sackers but like when you look at the um toxicity reports on people who die people who overdose it's often not just Oxycontin in the bloodstream right it's often mixed with other things um there's this whole kind of um exercise of parsing like moral and legal parsing that they do um which you know I I have to say for me just as a as someone who's trying to live a righteous life life it it's always amazing to me because I always just think I can't imagine how do you get there like how do you how do you get there at a certain point so many people have died from your product um it's this kind of incredible Symphony of rationalization that happens but but on your on your on your point about you know everybody the idea that you know ideally you'd have a situation which everybody sort of enters through bucket one um let me give you the other statistic which is that we'll get to this but puru Pharma is now in bankruptcy and in the context of the bankruptcy there are many many many creditors who have a claim that they'd like to exert against what's left of the company and one of them is United

[01:04:13] Health and United Health had this fascinating filing um where they were they were you know talking about the idea that they should have a piece of the pie such as it is and we'll leave aside for a second whether a big insurer should uh um you know should uh be there in line along with all these people whose lives have been ruined by the drug what was interesting is that they said they ran a study and I I don't remember how many years it was but it was it was over the course of something like seven or eight years they looked at people who had uh

[01:04:50] United Health Plans um and who uh uh were prescribed Oxycontin or another Purdue opioid um and subsequently diagnosed with an opioid use disorder so I think that would actually be a kind of a smaller subset because you you literally have a diagnosis uh of an UD and they said that so for for that subset prescription from a doctor subsequent diagnosis just United Health over seven or eight years they said the number was in the hundreds of thousands and did they say what I mean sure it would be in the study but what percentage of that what percentage of people was that who were initially given a prescription was that 10% 20% 50% oh that I don't know that's interesting I don't know um it probably was in the in the study but it's not it hasn't been you know it was not revealed in in the filing to the bankruptcy court that would be interesting because that would that would actually shed great light on this issue it would I mean I I think to me the thing that's interesting is that it remains a talking point uh certainly for the and their legal council that it's it's virtually impossible if you you know if you're a pain patient and you prescribed the drug by a doctor and you and you take it as directed to become addicted um to to to to put that side by side with this hundreds of thousands number um is extraordinary even if you build in a discount where you say okay well some of those people probably did you know some of those were were fraudulent docs or fraudulent patients or what have you um you still end up with a a really huge number of people who who have become hooked on the drug uh in the in an iatrogenic context yeah so so you know I have a real personal history with this which

[01:06:38] I'm sure you'll appreciate um I wasn't sure I was going to tell you this story but I think it's it's appropriate here so in some ways I feel very lucky to be sitting here having a discussion right now as opposed to being dead um a little over 20 years ago when I was in my last year of medical school I had a really bad back in injury um kind of you know sort of hurt it kind of acutely and for 2 and a half weeks just ignored it the pain but the pain grew more and more debilitating I remember I was doing a rotation you know one of my rotations and I I couldn't even sleep I had to get you know the residents to inject Tor doll into my thighs just to allow me to have enough you know of an inkling to be able to sleep for a while so finally at some point I just agreed to go get an

[01:07:23] MRI and look and sure enough um there was a really bad herniation in my lower back and a about a 5 cm fragment of disc had broken off on the left side and it floated down the canal and it was sitting on the S1 nerve route which is what was causing this almost comical amount of pain I say comical now because it's hard to even describe there's nothing funny about it so I underwent surgery the next day um but surgery didn't go well for a number of reasons um but the surgeon operated on the wrong side so I woke up from the surgery in terrible pain but also with a new complication on the other side um this resulted in a number of follow-up procedures initially aimed at correcting the first problem but before

[01:08:12] I knew it you know even once this the structural problem had been fixed the pain was so bad that I finally relented and agreed to take pain medicine I had been horribly petrified of taking anything Beyond nids so what was the first drug this is the year 2000 so what's the first prescription I get it's for 20 migs of

[01:08:32] Oxycontin to be taken I believe twice a day I think you take 20 in the morning and 20 in the afternoon or evening or something like that but you can can you can probably imagine where this story is going Patrick how much Oxycontin do you think I was taking within four months tell me almost 400 milligrams a day unreal so again maybe for the listeners who doesn't know what that means in context that would be enough to kill an entire family of drug naive people right that you know 400 milligrams would kill Mom Dad suie Bobby

[01:09:07] Sally they' just stop breathing so it didn't take long for me to go from 40 milligrams a day to 400 milligrams a day and there are a couple things about this that are interesting the first is that was all prescribed by a legitimate doctor mhm who was not at all an expert in pain management this was a a surgeon who had already demonstrated gross incompetence in not operating on the right side um no one was monitoring how much of this drug I needed the dose just kept going up and up and up um I was very fortunate at the time to be dating an anesthesiology resident so she was about three or four years older than me actually probably in her last year of anesthesia um and she herself was actually interested in pain management so she would go on to do a fellowship in pain management and you know she was a bit troubled by how much of this drug that I was on and that sort of got me thinking like how the hell did I get here because it happened so quick right it was you know one minute you're like I never ever ever want to take one of these drugs and then the next minute you're basically in a DA you're in a constant Haze you you know there was no moment that I wasn't

[01:10:23] High the turning point for for me came when I realized that I couldn't differentiate between the pain relief and the high in other words I realized I was probably taking the drug to avoid the psychological pain which at the time I was pretty convinced I'd never walk again this was a one-year recovery process but the first three months I couldn't walk so that basically shattered all of my dreams I was no longer going to be bble to be a surgeon I believed uh let alone be an active healthy person that I'd been all my life and so I was actually taking this drug just as much to blunt that grief as I was taking it to blunt the pain and finally in in in the fall of that year I just decided this is not I don't want to do this anymore I this is

[01:11:19] I never imagined I would overdose that's the other thing by the way it never even crossed my mind that I could get to a point where I would stop breathing um but I just thought no I can't do this anymore so I said to my girlfriend I said I'm going to stop this cold turkey and she said you absolutely can't do that the withdrawal from this will kill you just as much as this drug will kill you you need to be on nortryptiline morphine I mean she rattled off all the drugs I would need to take to tape her off but I was a stubborn kid and I just stopped cold turkey and the next three weeks of my life would be about the most miserable three weeks of my existence I certainly hope I don't have another three weeks somewhere down my life that will be that bad um but here's the thing that is interesting I'm not telling this story to for a moment suggest any superiority like look at me

[01:12:17] I was able to come off this drug I what my point is that what I've learned about addiction since then would suggest that I'm simply biologically Lucky in other words I truly believe that that the neurotransmitters in my brain are not wired the way that someone who in that exact situation would have become a lifelong addict so that's that's why I say I'm very lucky I'm not lucky because

[01:12:42] I have willpower I'm lucky because that chemical didn't put a hook in me the way it would in others so in other words I had become physiologically dependent on it and that's why I went through withdrawal just as anybody would but I'm really lucky that I was man I managed to escape this drug and it's it's interesting I was still deathly afraid of the drug after the fact and only seven years later when I had a really really bad Dental issue would I ever touch another Percocet in my life which of course is a fraction of the drug right and I remember being really worried like what's going to happen is this going to escalate into massive use and fortunately it didn't you know I needed Percocet for like a week until I had a tooth extracted and then I I just stopped it and that was fine but you know it paradoxically gave me more empathy than self-righteousness over the people who became addicted I don't know why that's not obvious why that would be the case but I I think I just sort of believed that there are some of us who don't get addicted to these things even when it exposed but there are enough people who do and I don't know what that number is right and to your point I don't know that we can ever know that number but I agree with you that that doesn't remove the moral obligation of the people that were involved in exposing people like me and people much less fortunate than me yeah I mean I I I would imagine that part of the reason that you that it gave you a kind of um you know a sense of compassion for those who experience has um you know turned out much worse is that the it does sound as though you encountered the I I've talked to so many people who who who've whose lives have been upended by this drug and other opioids and the um you know it's often like there's a kind of undertoe right there's just this sense that that that you you're suddenly in the grip of something and and you know you managed to get out of the grip but it sounds like even you were in terms of the physiological dependence and the idea that you were titrating up so fast that that upward speed was unbelievable Patrick I mean unbelievable how quickly tolerance developed and by the way it's total [ __ ] to say you don't get high from a Time relase drug I mean maybe I don't know what it's like to take heroin so

[01:15:11] I'm sure compared to heroin it's it's it's blunt but there is an absolute blastoff high that came from those Mega doses of that drug yeah what's so intriguing to me though about about your story is is actually the doctor right the idea that you have a surgeon who writes you the prescription and um you know part of what's so fascinating is that the the drug companies Purdue and the other companies argued from the beginning that the doctors don't know enough about pain management they haven't gotten the training and there was some truth to that but the weirdness of it is they then rush into the vacuum and they say We'll provide that training we'll do that educ and the the catchphrase for oxy conton early on was that it's it's the drug to start with and to stay with and so the you know the first part of that right is it's like this isn't some nuclear solution you keep on the top shelf where you would try other courses of therapy and only when those fail do you resort to it it's the first thing you should administer and then it's the one to stay with meaning you can just keep taking it you know for chronic pain conditions you're in you're out even if you have to keep titrating up and it was a a core belief at the company Richard Sackler felt very strongly about this that there was no you know what was what he described as no sealing effect with

[01:16:33] Oxycontin that in fact um you could just keep taking greater and greater doses which you would need to as your system AC accompanies itself to it and then you have the the pharmaceutical reps who are meeting with doctors like your surgeon and are heavily incentivized to get those docks to titrate up that's always the message because uh you know the the the the profits and in fact even the bonuses for the farmer reps were all based on on the volume of uh the drug that's that's sold and and prescribed so it's just funny because I you know hearing your anecdote from from your side what I see on the other side is this sort of Perfect Storm of scenarios where um you know when you're thinking about like do I go cold turkey do I taper off should I be taking more you're having those conversations with your girlfriend because the guy who prescribed you the drug probably doesn't know how to explain to people how to get them off I mean you have this kind of crazy situation in which you have a generation of doctors who learn how to how to like onramp their patients with these drugs and never learn how to off-ramp them and actually kind of don't necessarily have any interest or inclination and if you talk to people who've had these experiences they'll say I went back to the surg who who wrote me the original script and

[01:17:58] I said Hey listen you know I'm I'm having problems here and they say whoa whoa whoa I'm not an addiction specialist um so when you when you look at all those circumstances um and you kind of extrapolate from that story you just told it's not surprising to me to think that there are many many many people who um you know who who had a similar situation and ended up in very

[01:18:22] Dire Straits yeah and I think you you you you made me think of something else which I should have mentioned earlier which is there another reason I was very very fortunate was um to have a girlfriend at the time who is not just an anesthesiologist but someone who's a year away from doing a pain Fellowship she actually got me in to see a pain expert at Stanford who I think really is the guy that saved me because remember it's one thing to sort of quit this drug cold turkey but I still had pain you know it didn't it's not like you know getting off the drug was one problem but addressing the pain was another and I think only because of this other guy um whose name was Shawn Mackey I don't even know if he's still at Stanford but you know he was able to treat me I think appropriately right so that meant doing a lot of injections to begin and sort of cool things off that had flared up using a drug called

[01:19:17] Neurontin which is not addictive incredibly benign it is sedating so that's a drawback to deal with the neuropathic pain and then using very strong IDs so at the time Vio was a drug that basically saved me and you know that allowed me to break the cycle of pain and do enough PT such that a year from when that whole thing began I was actually in my surgical residency and free of all pain medication meaning free of the Neurontin and free of the Vio so you know that part of the story also speaks to the incredible fortune that I had that many people don't have and maybe had I not had it there still would be a different ending right it still might have been that well after 3 months of going cold turkey I had to go back because there was no alternative and it's funny I'll I'll tell about when I was in my residency I was still amazed at how ignorant we were as surgical residents of pain management I mean completely ignorant there was absolutely no teaching of this subject matter something that I learned that was very simple was studies had demonstrated that before you do an incision on a patient if you inject marane which is a longacting uh sodium channel blocker like a you know like the type of you know like a novacaine type thing that the dentist would put in your teeth so you have lidocaine which is short acting marcan which is long acting if you inject the incision site with marcan before you cut you wait a moment you then make the incision and then immediately following surgery you put the patient on a pretty aggressive dose of nids many patients can actually avoid narcotics postoperatively for the incisional pain which is the dominant source of pain and I remember thinking why aren't we doing this with every patient and I I got into an argument with one of the attendings because I was about to do an operation and you know I was I went to do this and he said come on come on come on that's going to take five minutes you've got to you know put that in and then we have to sit here and wait 5 minutes with our dicks in our hands while it sets in before you cut no no we don't have the time for that and I remember thinking really we don't have five minutes you know it was shocking yeah yeah but but listen I mean I I think in a weird way and I say I'm not a doctor right I say this I say this coming from the outside but but having done a little bit of a a kind of anthropological uh bushwack through this world over last few years you go back to what we were talking about earlier where you have the

[01:21:59] Sackler Brothers in the 1940s and 50s saying um wouldn't it be beautiful if someday there was just a pill you could take for everything and and particularly Arthur Sackler kind of trying to sort of intermingle medicine and Commerce in in ways that I think ended up being more profound than than than anybody could have probably recognized at the time from the outside I I think that one of the ingredients that gives you the opioid crisis is actually uh that idea of like we want to waste five minutes you know we need to get we need to get our patients in and out um time is money and there was a um you know I've interviewed I've interviewed doctors who talk about the how they felt duped how when the when when the produced sales reps started fogging

[01:22:58] Oxycontin you know if you're a doctor you encounter patients who are in pain you want to releve that pain you know it's often it's it's it's kind of in some ways inherent to why you chose to do this in your life right is you want to you want to bring relief to people who are suffering um and suddenly there's this medical Innovation which you're told uh is is like a a Panacea it can relieve that pain uh and has virtually no side effects and people can take it forever and there's no dosage sealing um and so you know I've talked to people whove said just earnestly that was a siren song I was all too ready to listen to because um it it it filled a need in my you know in my kind of therapeutic Arsenal um and of course it ended up being more complicated but I also think that when you think about the way in which

[01:23:51] American medicine is structured um the idea that you have a patient who's in pain and you say I'm going to WR your prescription for 20 milligrams of oxycotton be on your way um I never have to see you again I'm not really going to give any thought to how this is working out for you two weeks from now or two months from now or two years from now um

[01:24:14] I think that the uh that notion that you know that five minutes is money right five minutes is is is you know that 5 minutes is 5 minutes you're not spending with the next patient um it's a longer line in the waiting room I think those kinds of structural considerations were were part of what allowed um Purdue and other opioid makers to kind of snow the medical establishment as effectively as they did where if you look at at at the the prescribing levels for these drugs with the introduction of Oxycontin they just suddenly start climbing in this really dramatic way and you would think that there would have been more skepticism that it would have been slower growth but I do think there was a sense in which it sort of it filled a number of needs right and that was what allowed it to take off the way it did well it also seemed to become very politically correct in the sense that they somehow managed to infiltrate the AMA I mean one of the other memories I have from you know the early days of residency was how all of a sudden a new Vital sign emerged so vital signs are by definition objective so they are things that can be measured for which there is no ambiguity temperature pulse respiratory rate blood pressure but then a fifth Vital sign got introduced which was pain a subjective measurement on a scale of 1 to 10 and there were laminated posters on every corner of the hospital don't forget the fifth Vital sign don't forget the fifth

[01:25:45] Vital sign what is the fifth Vital sign what is your patient's pain I mean it was you know and this really came from the medical Community this this was some this was a form of self- policing so how involved was Purdue in driving that agenda I mean I I want to be careful about how I put this very would be the short answer um but I think you have this tricky thing it's a little bit like when I when I was talking about Curtis Wright and and the

[01:26:21] FDA and how there's a kind of soft corruption that happen happens which is which is you know it's not as glaring as the kind of caricature is corruption uh that that you would think of I think there's a similar thing here where you have the American Medical Association you have um all kinds of uh groups uh you know groups of doctors groups representing patients patients rights um you know kind of pain advocacy groups and um and then you have industry uh underwriting a lot of this stuff and there you know there's just a quite a good piece in um Mother Jones just recently about the AMA and and um you know the uh Richard Sackler was on one of these boards and you have um a lot of money going to sponsor education yeah well that that that's I just read that Mother Jones piece and I couldn't believe that the AMA both as an organization and its foundation separately are receiving money from the sackers yeah yeah and and then and then often what happens right is that you get these things where it's there's like an educational pamphlet that they end up

[01:27:31] Distributing there's a kind of Laing that happens a sort of institutional laundering right where um where industry comes up with these educational brochures or they sponsor research or what have you I mean the example that I love from from that story The the Mother Jones story was that there was one kind of Handy guide to pain in the fifth

[01:27:50] Vital sign and the idea of how do you talk to a child about the pain they're feeling and and there was there was a kind of a an admonition to the doctors that you remember you know you got to tell the child that no pain is not an acceptable answer you know there's a Continuum but but the end of the Continuum where there's no pain you know that's that's that's not not uh not an option um the uh yeah I Think It's tricky because I I I just think that a lot of the time it's not necessarily that um I think it's more a coincidence of interests in which you have people who earnestly believe these things and then are under written by industry and that kind of turbocharges the arguments they're making um more than it is a situation of docs being paid off to tell what they know to be lies right and I think there was a kind of like when you when you talk about the idea of the fifth Vital sign even just that phrase on the one hand I think that there was some truth to the critique that that there hadn't been enough education and pain management and enough consideration given to how you relase patients pain um I think as a critique that had some truth to it on the other hand when you say the fifth Vital sign like to me that sounds more than anything like a great marketing slogan I don't know who dream that up um but it it sounds like something that an

[01:29:11] Advertiser would come up with right it's catchy it's kind of pithy um and of course it's totally subjective um there was a study I couldn't give you the citation but I remember reading this reading about this great study um where it was like the scale of 1 to 10 thing right and they found that it's not just that it varies that you you may have you know what what might be a a seven for you could be a a nine for me um but that it actually varies regionally where they you know they found that like people in northern

[01:29:43] Europe um you you you'd exert some sort of standard amount of pain and they would say uh you know oh that's a four and then people in southern Europe you'd exert the same same amount of pain and they would say it's a 10 it's a 10 um but you know that you actually get these kind of cultural Regional differences in terms of uh people's pain threshold so the um it's hard because I do think it's it's a it's a legitimate thing that that people should be looking at and inquiring about but at the same time it's totally subjective and and I think that again and again you see just the money pollute everything you know you mentioned earlier that Curtis Wright effectively um um whe whether you know in a in a direct quidd proquo or more of just a

[01:30:30] Confluence of of interests not only basically approves this drug single-handedly for the FDA but then ultimately winds up working for this entity but you know the other story in this one that really blew my mind was that of Lynden Barber at the DEA a guy who on on the one hand is seems by all accounts to be one of the most uh credible voices within the

[01:30:58] DEA to standing up to the you know unmanaged distribution of these drugs and then kind of doesn't about face and becomes one of the most powerful lobbying entities for the very companies I believe Cardinal was one of his largest clients Cardinal McKesson being two of the largest Distributors um kind of hard to believe but at the same time I guess you you know going through the what you said earlier it's like look how long can you work for nothing as a government employee right and at some point he has a choice which is he's going to go make a living harnessing his existing skills but it just doesn't feel right you know I I don't know I don't know how else to put it it just doesn't it just doesn't sit well with me yeah you know I I um it's funny I it's it's very uh you know I don't want to sound like a scold or preachy um or somebody who's holier than thou or like a Boy Scout because because I'm not um by any stretch but the but it has been one of the more dispiriting things working on this project where um you know a lot of the time in the past I've written about crime a fair amount and and you it's just kind of baked in that you're writing about a bad person doing a bad thing and they kind of know they're bad usually um and there's a sort of moral Clarity there uh what was so fascinating to me about this story is that you know I think the sackers are are are kind of are Bad actors I think they they did really bad things um and they're the focus of the story but then around them are all of these facilitators and it's it's former prosecutors who go and work as private defense attorneys for the family or for the company it's former

[01:33:05] DEA officials who go and work as lobbyists for the industry it's former FDA officials who go and work at the company um it's you know Folks at McKenzie it's this whole kind of amazing entrenched machine of people who I think in many instances don't think of themselves as the bad guys um and in some cases Society doesn't think of them as the bad guys right you know um one of the characters in my in my book is Mary

[01:33:35] Joe White this you know former US attorney for the southern district of New York uh former she was Obama's head of the SEC she's a a hero to lawyers many you know all over the place a woman who kind of broke the glass ceiling um and she has represented Purdue and the sackers for years and is totally handmaid into them so I it's a thing that I've kind of wrestled with personally I'm a lawyer by training and

[01:33:59] I know that um there is a sort of it's it's very fundamental to the ethos of the profession that you know you're the lawyer isn't the client and that we shouldn't necessarily um kind of transpose the the moral stink of the client onto the lawyer but it's hard for me when you know you tell the lynon barber story there's a hundred people like that in the book um who who play that kind of role and again and again and again you get these people who are supposed to be the cops basically they're supposed to be Law and Order and they get co-opted by the money and it's um it's really discouraging and sometimes I don't get it because the money isn't even that much I when you look at Chris Dodd and

[01:34:40] Marsha Blackburn and Tom Marino and Orin hatch I mean it's just hard for me to look at these people and think of them as reasonable or respectable truthfully you know when I look at their involvement in the bills they sponsored and the positions that they took in all of this and when you look at the dollars that they received from the they're bought so cheaply yeah that's exactly the point Patrick you know I expected that it would have taken tens of millions to have bought those people they were bought for hundreds of thousands of dollars US senators for sale for hundreds of thousands of dollars I I don't understand it I think yeah I mean I think so so I think the thing is it's some of it is the is the money um donations and what have you but

[01:35:31] I think there's this other thing that is more about the revolving door and the kind of this Insidious thing where the it's the lobbyist and the lobbyists are often people they know right and it's a kind of um uh you know you see this with the way in which Purdue and the soccers would use lawyers like Mary Joe White is a good example or they hired Rudy

[01:35:52] Giuliani for for years was kind of their hatchet man and it's like if you were a federal prosecutor and you're investigating me um the real move is to not to sort of fight it out with you on the merits in court the way most people would it's for me to go to your boss but not for me personally to go to your boss for me to find somebody who your boss knows and respects and and that's the person I buy off and I send them to go and kind of make the over and so I think when you look at these people it's not just that they're again it's the sort of soft corruption thing where some of it is the it's it's not like campaign contributions it's that you're you know it's like the it's the you know it's that scene in The Godfather where the um where the guy's supposed to testify in in court and they s they get the old guy from Sicily to come and just sit in the courtroom and it happens to be his uncle or whatever and he sees the guy in the courtroom and he he suddenly sort of loses all his moral convic and decides he's not going to testify it's sort of that um it's it's like being really smart and strategic about who's the right messenger um who would we send to make the case to Chris

[01:37:05] Dodd um you know about why he shouldn't come after us uh or or why he should um you know help us in this or that and man they're really good really really good at that and it's interesting at how if if I want to use the word you might not use the word but if I want to use the word correct corruption how bipartisan the corruption was totally um what was the bill HR 4709 the this is the sleeper bill right it's like this three-page nothing burger that basically opened the pipelines to move these drugs and put the daa's hands behind its back I mean again it's a little detail but my God it's amazing how unopposed that bill went yeah but I mean this is absolutely but but but some of that I think is the fact that nobody's really reading the bill the bill was carefully designed to look like it was sort of doing the opposite of what it was doing right it's like we're gonna fight the opioid crisis um you know Obama signed it and who knows how closely he looked at it um I I think that there's a there's enough business that goes on in

[01:38:19] Washington and I think particularly when it comes to lawmaking you know you have these members of the house and Senators who are they spend all their time raising money um they if you can make what you're doing look like business as usual you can pull it off um it's uh it's super dispiriting but but again I mean I listen you know the painkiller the opioid painkiller industry spends I think the statistic is like seven or eight times what the gun lobby spends on lobbying in Washington right so so just imagine um the kind of impact that you can have on the on the legislative picture and then you see this with you know with a with a company like Purdue you have this long period of time where all these states are trying to respond at a state level to the opioid crisis and they're they're you know they're trying to introduce new legislation to shut down pill Mills or um you know go after bad docks and what have you and you have these legislative initiatives that state level that gets set up and Purdue finds the right State lobbyists to go to the state capital uh and help neuter those bills uh as best as best they can and we're very successful at doing that I mean it is a um when you have a drug that's generated $35 billion in

[01:39:43] Revenue the amount of influence you can buy is just awesome so what what happened what was the first sort of shot across the bow 2007 it's a little bit of a slap on the wrist what what led to that you had a uh a couple of investigators at a at a small Federal prosecutor's office in the Western District of Virginia who their Community had been upended uh by oxycoton specifically they just they started realizing you know we're getting all these Pharmacy thefts and crime is going up and you get people oding um and they started investigating and and to them it was this kind of weird thing where they felt like they felt like a hurricane had just like hit their town and they wondered where it came from and came from Connecticut um so they started investigating and they they did this really amazing investigation they spent five years investigating

[01:40:43] Purdue they subpoenaed millions of documents they did you know huge amounts of grand jury testimony um and uh wanted to charge three senior Executives at the company with felonies the idea being that these guys were you know were not going to go to jail um faced with jail time they would flip on the sackers um one of those Federal prosecutors has said this on the record uh and there's another one who's confirmed for me um that the plan was actually to Target the sackers if they could flip these guys and what ended up happening was that the um the company sent Rudy Giuliani and

[01:41:30] Mary Joe White to kind of go over the heads of those Federal prosecutors to the George W bush justice department in Washington and say you can't go after these guys for felonies we need to take felonies off the table take jail time off the table and uh so they got overruled by their own bosses this was Alice Fischer and

[01:41:49] Paul mcnalty yeah exactly yeah um and which is funny too because it's again there's it's a little bit like that line in the in the package insert where in 2021 I talked to Alice Fischer and Paul mcel and said who made that decision to tell these prosecutors in the Western District of Virginia and they're each pointing at each other they're pointing at each other nobody would own it um you would think you know uh all these years on um it's pretty consequential decision you would think that somebody might take responsibility for it but um but what that meant is that because they couldn't charge these guys with felonies the guys weren't going to flip they just they Char they pled to misdemeanors so they couldn't go after the sackers the company paid a $600 million fine and pled guilty to felony charges of misbranding um and then it was it was pretty much business as usual I mean they didn't um they did not slow down their marketing a jot so what changed in the last couple of years what What's led to the bankruptcy and perhaps more importantly where do we stand on this what is it called this non-consensual uh third party release third party release yes this this seems to be a very important granting on the part of a uh one white ples um bankruptcy judge yeah Robert dra so um so 2007 the company pleads guilty and the official line after after that was oh you know we we kind of cleaned up our act we had a few bad apples but everything's okay now um but they didn't really change a whole lot um and really all the senior folks you know but there were the three guys who pled guilty to misdemeanors had to leave they couldn't keep working at the company but other than that all the senior folks who were involved in this stuff stayed on heads did not roll um and uh Purdue kind of kept doing what it was doing um in 2020 the company pled guilty to a new set of federal criminal charges and and the the conduct that it pled to dated back 10 years so if if you imagine right like the you have a company that pleads guilty in 2007 and then in theory there's like a couple of years of good behavior but then starting in about 2010 they were back to committing crimes and kept at it through 2020 when they pleed guilty again um and in between those two guilty pleas what happens is that you get all these lawsuits so some of these are private you know class action lawsuits lawsuits brought by hospitals school districts um cities states eventually every state in the Union pretty much is suing Purdue over its role in the opioid crisis um and what's happening in parallel to that which we didn't know about until fairly recently is that the sackers starting in 2007 after that guilty plea they start quietly taking money out of the company so they're just sort of siphoning money out 100 million here 100 million there over the course of about a decade they take more than 10 billion dollar out of the company and then in in uh 2018 2019 um I gu 2019 you have thousands of lawsuits against the company company's kind of on the Rope and the family kicks the company into bankruptcy they say the company doesn't have any money anymore um which is only the case because they took 10 billion out of it but they say the company's bankrupt now so all those lawsuits against the company have to be suspended and they end up in this bankruptcy court in White Plains New

[01:45:42] York because this is the way bankruptcy law Works they got to pick their judge they they you can decide where you want to declare bankruptcy corporate bankruptcy so they picked this judge who they thought would be sympath um and where it gets really interesting is that by this point roughly half of the states were were not just suing the company they were suing individual members of the family who had sat on the company's board and there's a move by the company and the family to say okay so you've suspended all these lawsuits against the company because it's in bankruptcy but we want you to spend the lawsuits against the family too even though they have haven't declared bankruptcy and the judge did that temporarily um which is pretty controversial there are states in which you're you're not able to do that you're not able to say to like the Attorneys

[01:46:35] General of half of the states no you cannot bring your your lawsuit you know a federal bankruptcy judge in New York says to the state AG of Idaho like no you cannot bring your state based claim um it's pretty exotic but uh he did and where we are now is we're sort of in the end game where the sackers have made this bid which is they want him to make that Grant permanent where he would permanently immunize them from any litigation so that the the phrase for this and it's a it's a mouthful is non-consensual third- party releases um and this is happening in real time like as you and I are talking there's a there's a bankruptcy trial going on with testimony uh but I think everybody knows how it's going to end why why are we so pessimistic why do we why are we pretty convinced that it's gonna that the um that the ruling is going to hold up because the judge has has kind of telegraphed where he's he's going with it um and because uh there are some states that continue to fight but they effectively don't have the votes so basically what you have is a situation in which the sackers have made a proposal to in one fell swoop deal with all this litigation kind of once and for all and they're doing it in the context of this bankruptcy proceeding where they say we will pay $4.5 billion of our money to remediate the opioid crisis we'll pay it out over nine years and we'll make no admission of wrongdoing we'll give up our interest in

[01:48:14] Purdue and will be granted one of these non-consensual third party releases where basically this judge gets to kind of wave his w and say nobody can ever sue you again no State prosecutor no private plaintiff nobody can sue you ever again over anything having to do with Oxycontin or the opioid crisis and I think there are a lot of states that are desperate and fighting you know dealing with the kind of the trillions of dollars in in in public costs that that this crisis has generated they they're reeling they see $4.5 billion and they think I could use 150th of that you know um so they're inclined to take the deal even if they don't like it you know it's an interesting one because I think I think a lot of people look at it and they feel like this wouldn't be

[01:49:07] Justice um to put that $4.5 billion number in in perspective the sacers still have an 11 billion fortune and they're going to pay it out pay out the 4.5 over nine years so and it's actually not linearly weighted the majority of that payment comes at the end of time so in theory they're technically going to come out ahead if they reasonably invest well yeah I mean I you know I did some I I had some conversations with people who who advise High net worth families um and and invest their fortunes and the and the you know I think conservatively between interests and and and and a very conservative portfolio uh they can probably expect you know a 5% return on that 11 billion fortune and if that's the case they never have to touch their principle yeah

[01:49:57] I mean this will not um uh again in absolute terms it's a lot of money um but it's it's I don't think commentate to the damage and I think ultimately it'll be a pretty good deal for the sackers but I think that's that's how it's going to shake out now do you think that this accomplishes anything else so um no amount of money is going to bring back a loved one you know I have um I have several patients whose lives have been directly impacted by this whose whose children have overdosed um so so kids that became addicted to prescription pain pills and um you know in one situation um one of the one of the kids was clean for a number of months if not a year was at a party someone suggested he try a pill it turned out to be laced with fenyl and you know how that story ends tragically so no amount of money is going to fix that and so whether the sackers have to give four and a half billion or forfeit every dollar they've ever made and will make in perpetuity that never brings back a life so really it's about two things isn't it it's sort of about how much can be fixed today with money because maybe some things can be fixed with money some things can't I guess three things is Justice being served and the third thing would be is this creating a deterrent for another entity in the future to be a little more careful with what they do so let's talk about the ladder do you think that this will create a sufficient enough deterrent and not just this I mean if you look at what was that other company in insis or something like that in yeah yeah well in insus was different because insus people went to jail yeah so so so when you look at the totality of these things do you think that at least for the foreseeable future the legal illicit drug Market is uh you know kind of on on on notice I do and I don't I mean I think that the um look in some ways this this kind of this fits into a larger Trend that we've seen happening over the last uh 10 or 15 years um sort of since the days of Enron and Worldcom which is that there's a there's a pronounced disinclination say across political parties to uh bring criminal charges and and and and jail time into the equation when it comes to corporate Executives acting within their role even if the conduct is

[01:52:43] Criminal so you have this kind of bizarre thing with Purdue Pharma where when the company pled guilty for a second time in 2020 there were no individual executives is even named so I say in the book it's like it's like it's a driverless car I mean how is it that the company could commit federal crimes if there's no individuals who can be identified as having committed crimes it doesn't make any sense but I think it's it's sort of expressive of a reflective of um the general posture of of the justice department and and um and our whole sort of system of justice broadly speaking which is we don't really um it's really the exception when a corporate executive ends up doing jail time as we saw in incus and the insus case is kind of particularly extreme

[01:53:33] Inus is like you know everything you see in the produced story but just like dialed up 21 I think there are a bunch of reasons why you saw jail time in the Inus case and you don't in the in the CEO Kumar wasn't that his last name something I'm blanking on his name but yes um I mean in was just such a such a scam and there you have like kind of strippers working as sales reps and you know um real kind of Fairly sort of bald bribery schemes not the soft corruption I've been talking about but like the hardest of hard corruption um and uh so there you saw jail time in my view jail time is the only thing that really that really is a deterrent I think otherwise I don't know I mean people are rational particularly when it comes about money when it comes comes to money and they think about you know they think about risk right they evaluate risk and if you um you know you look at the sackers right it's like you you take 10 billion do out of a company during a period of time when it's committing crimes you're gonna have to give back 4.5 billion do you do it you know do you do you you look at that fact pattern you take you you got a company company commits crimes you own the company you're on the board of the company uh you're never going to go to jail you're never going to get charged with any crimes you will have to give back 4.5 billion but you can do it over nine years do you do it I mean I could probably go out on the street and find you some people who would say hell yeah sign me up um for the saers I think you know the real costs are going to be reputational and it's hard to measure that yeah that's that that that's the thing that I mean You' have to argue that are they any different from OJ

[01:55:40] Simpson you mean in terms of the the notion that everybody knows yeah like I mean OJ Simpson commits this completely heinous graphic premeditate ated violent act in front of the world and if not for a technicality effectively you know and a racist cop gets off right right but I don't think the world's ever really forgiven him right I mean I my guess is he probably is being basically socially punished uh for the rest of his life and rightfully so um is

[01:56:20] Justice served no presumably not he should be in jail but nevertheless so the blood of two people is on OJ Simpson's hands the blood of how many people is on the sackler's hands conservatively what would be the most conservative estimate right I mean it's so hard to say right because the thing is you can you can you know do you look just at people who've OD on oxyc conton and of course they would say again with that parsing they would say ah yes but you know there were other drugs in their systems um my point is of the half a million people who have died in the last two decades I'm willing to acknowledge that some some subset maybe a small subset of those people the blood is on the hands of this family and work like yours has really brought that to light um and it just I just wonder what the rest of their lives look like and will this be basically forgotten about and will the next generation of sackers carry no shame for this or will this be something that forever makes people in polite company a bit embarrassed to be around them uh it's it's funny I mean I think I think both of the last two things you said are are going to be the case I think the um I think people will forever be embarrassed to be around them

[01:57:42] I think the name is toxic and it's you know it's it's coming down off of Institutions I think it'll come down off of more institutions I think that the family uh uh isn't happy about that um but I also don't know that any of them feel any shame I mean there's this kind of one of the things that's been so revealing to me is um it's funny there's an analogy that I

[01:58:11] I don't draw in the book in any explicit way deliberately but it was one that I thought about a lot is you know I was writing this book in the last years of the Trump presidency and um you know one sense in which the saer situation I think was a little bit similar to Trump's um and it's a sense in which I'm almost sympathetic in both cases is if you're a billionaire you're surrounded by advisors and lawyers and PR people and all these people whose livelihood depends on keeping you happy and I feel as though there is a kind of um heightened danger of delusion of you just getting out of touch with reality and it probably starts in small ways right that you you tell a joke and everybody in the room laughs um but then you can you know so initially you're just like kind of a millimeter or two off track in terms of the the Fidelity of your perceptions of the world um but then the the longer you go the further off course you get and what you saw with

[01:59:24] Trump which you also see with the sackers is that there are people in the mix I mean I've talked to people who a decade ago said to the family what if you took some of this philanthropic money that you give to art museums and started a foundation dedicated to uh the study of addiction um you know redressing the opioid crisis uh people who were making you know frankly a cynical argument but saying just purely in terms of the optic here um you should make some gesture uh recognizing that there's a problem and that people think that you're responsible for it and those people were always sidelined and fired right and the people who end up in the kind of inner circle are the ones who say you are just terribly misunderstood all these people don't understand you you know the the press the public the people making jokes on

[02:00:17] The Late Show uh the Attorneys General of every single state you know all these members of Congress who keep condemning you all these studies that are done about oxycon and its Legacy it's all just a big misunderstanding you never did anything wrong and what's been astonishing to me is they they they tend to pretty uniformly feel that way the family members yeah that's one of the things that surprised me about your book is you had to do all of this without actually talking to anyone in that family and when you think about how many children the three Sackler Brothers had and how many children they had and how many spouses they have like that's a pretty good list of people who could have come forth and said something to you even off the Record or on background and yet I don't I don't think that happened did it no I mean I I listen my assumption from the beginning had been that there must be some apostate you know there must be some third generation

[02:01:18] Sackler who who was who who looks around and you know never mind my writing right it's like they read the New York Times they read the LA Times They read Sam kon's book Dreamland and they say gez you know yeah this is blood Money my trust fund un BL money right let me let me you know I don't need this I'm going to turn my turn my back on it couldn't find one and one of the more revealing documents I got my hands on was this um it's a WhatsApp log it's like a chat log from the The Heirs of Mortimer Sackler this came out in the context of the bankruptcy proceeding where they all talk over the course of a couple of years um all these different family members siblings cousins and they're talking about you know their problems and how do you deal with it and the litigation and the bad

[02:02:12] PR and and what's the right strategy and um it's this private channel uh and there's no nobody nobody who at any point says you know gez maybe our critics have a point or like maybe we should ask some tough questions um instead it's this pretty lockstep feeling of persecution and in fact I mean sometimes when you read their private correspondence the way they talk amongst themselves at times it feel as feels as though in their minds like the real victims of the opioid crisis are the Sackler family that's amazing that's more amazing to me than the indignant response that is seen publicly mhm it's that even privately there's no awareness no not a shred of introspection none and a profound sense of grievance you know a sense that this has been that they've been kind of persecuted I mean there's this amazing email um that I quote in the book where jacqulyn Sackler married to Mortimer Jr a second generation member who was who was um on the board of the company she's talking about how you know with all this press coverage and the sort of stigma for the family um she's worried about her children applying to elite private schools in

[02:03:35] Manhattan in the fall and their chances and and in the context of griping about this she says children's lives are being destroyed and um not to Pivot from the you know the comic to the tragic but like I get emails every week from people who who've lost children uh to opioids you know I mean when you hear from as many bereaved parents as I do it's just amazing to read an email like that and and kind of consider the level of disconnection that it betrays I know you've spoken about how you also hear from basically two groups of people right so you hear a lot from exactly what you've just said the the the the family members or friends of of of people who themselves have become addicted or who more tragically have lost those but you also seem to hear from people saying you know your work is potentially threatening to the supply of pain medication to people like me who genuinely and legitimately need it which of course is is not your intention um but you seem to be sensitive to that and you seem to understand that there's a fine line here and an overreaction uh or an over direction that would limit the supply of or access of patients who do need pain medication to it would be um an unintended consequence of this work so do you get a sense that that is actually happening yes I mean I think that the um uh there is a definite sense in which the pendulum has swung back um um and in which a lot of doctors are um less likely to prescribe these drugs in the first place more likely to prescribe you know shorter courses at lower doses I I think a lot of that is is a good thing ultimately um there are many uh chronic pain patients who are very fearful and are you know I I certainly get emails from people talking about how they're they're just fearful that they're um that they're their supply uh of this drug you know these drugs I'm not just talking about

[02:05:56] Oxycontin here but but prescription opioid painkillers broadly um that they count on in order to function in life um is is really jeopardized by these kind of changing currents in terms of the way in which um people perceive uh these drugs and it it's it's it's an incredibly difficult thing I mean I I um

[02:06:21] I very sympathetic to this I I I certainly don't want to see people who use these drugs stigmatized whether they use them legally or illegally I tend to be to be pretty sympathetic with people I'm also not a a prohibitionist you know I don't um given all my work on on illegal drugs I tend not to think that that drug prohibition is the way to go people certainly make arguments that if you cut off pain patients um uh and force you know do kind of Rapid Force taper and what have you that that might actually drive people onto the black market and become you know more unsafe that that might be part of what's driving the opioid crisis um where I bck at at at that kind of uh note and this sort of goes back to the thing I said to you at the outset is um the suggestion that I shouldn't write about the sackers and their culpability because there might be some sort of second or third order consequence of of that um or or that my my kind of focus is in the wrong place and and there I'm not going to um you know I'm I'm going to write the books that I want to write and the articles that I want to write um I I find it's very often the case that people who are sort of telling me that I shouldn't be doing these things generally speaking haven't read the book um you know haven't really engaged with the particulars all that much but um but yeah look I I do hear from from um pain patients quite often and I think this has been a sort of an agonizing period for them because um from where I sit the problem was not that a drug like

[02:08:02] Oxycontin shouldn't have been produced or made available to pain patients it was all in the decision to do two things one was dramatically expand the universe of people who should be taking it and the other was uh I think pretty systematically play down the risks so that there's a kind of dis honesty with the consumer and with with Physicians uh about what the dangers are um you know I don't go from that to any sense that these drugs should not be available at all there are some some who do some doctors who do um but I don't I sort of don't feel the need to to to go there myself I'm I'm pretty squarely focused on the origins of the crisis and um and some some pretty unambiguous wrongs uh perpetrated by Purdue and the sackers so if the saers represent a cancer right that cancer has largely been excised right the sackers themselves are no longer going to be a part of this dilemma but unfortunately the cancer metastasized for before it was excised so as you point out we still have an opioid crisis and in fact it doesn't seem to be showing any signs of abatement in fact last year we saw more people die of opioid overdose than any other cause of accidental death which is actually a staggering statistic when you consider how many people die in car accidents how many people die of uh gunshot wounds so in that sense your work has been a success and the work of all the people you've written about who have finally brought a modum of Justice to at least the initial perpetrators of this but what does the path forward look like like what will it take to actually address this crisis yeah I mean you know this will sound like a cop out but but in some ways I I'm so overwhelmed by that question I think anybody would be um you know the way in which I've grappled with that is to kind of take this this small piece of it that I can focus on and understand and for me in in some ways it's kind of you know looking at the origin story of the crisis really more than where we are now um the numbers are staggering uh as you say they're getting worse um the sense in which I I feel as though the sacers are not absolved by the fact that this is today a heroin and Fenty crisis is the sense in which there are many many people who I think would never have taken heroin or fentanyl in the first in instance that that that started on prescription opioids like

[02:10:47] Oxycontin um but of course you know from the vage today like I'd rather people be abusing Oxycontin than abusing fenyl right or heroin that's laced with who knows what um the um it is a very very scary situation I feel as though um we need far more resources than we have I mean I I I think it's a problem that needs to be resourced I think treatment is very often not available to people I think there's still a huge amount of um of stigma associated with uh with the abuse of an addiction when it comes to these types of drugs um and anything we can do to diminish that stigma I think you know medically assisted treatment which I I think there are still some for whom that's a kind of a scary concept and I I think it's a it's it's one that um should be uh should be adopted and embraced and and and not cause the um the consternation that it does for some um but I think it's a huge National crisis and in a strange way I feel as though were it not for

[02:12:00] Co it's not that the problem would have been solved but I feel as though the um just prior to co there was a sense in which I you know It's tricky because it was the Trump Administration but the um but I think there was sort of a recognition that we need a major national strategy to deal with this it is out of control um and killing people in vast numbers and we need to uh to kind of you know have all ideas on the table and be strategic and and and resource the solution um and then Co came along and um there just wasn't really the the bandwidth right or the oxygen in the room to have that conversation but but when we neglect the problem as we have during covid for for you know just purely in terms of the triage of the last 18 months you see what happen s are you optimistic that 10 years from now things will be

[02:13:03] different I mean I have to be just because I'm I'm believe it or not after this after this Grim conversation I'm I'm fundamentally an optimist uh about a lot of things I I I have to believe we will learn and we'll sort of find a way out of this um but it's hard and I think the hardest thing in a way is you know I've I've

[02:13:23] I've had many of these conversations it sound like sounds like you have two you mentioned you know the patient who who had a family member who um who actually managed to stop using and seemed as though they'd moved on and then went to a party um and relapse is such an issue with these drugs right that the um when you when you talk to people who' who've sort of achieved you know they they've found their way out of the woods often the thing that's so striking to me is that there's a kind of um there's a sort of fragility to it you know um they're always talking in the in the in the present tense there's this sense that kind of every day is a battle um and that's what worries me I think about about the idea of us kind of 10 years from now right is that um on a kind of very micro level for the individual who is struggling with addiction um there's that sense in which it's like each tentative step you just never know when you're going to get pulled back in um and so on a kind of macro level nationally uh I I worry that there may be a similar danger yeah I I worry about the the the sort of impact of what it takes to escape the gravitational pull of an environment that facilitated the use um I did my residency at Hopkins which is in inner city Baltimore and um even 20 years ago was was probably a leading indicator for how bad uh heroin use could get um and I remember you know we would take care of a lot of patients who had um abesses and all sorts of you know infections and cellulitis and things like that from IV drug use and sometimes these infections themselves were life-threatening so it wasn't just the overdose on the drug it was the repeated use of a dirty needle or a needle that gets broken inside the arm and gets infected and you know so you would take care of these patients and you always wish them the best when they left but you were you were really in the back of your mind you knew you were going to see them again because even though for the five days that they were in the hospital they were not using any drug and they with the total Clarity of the thought that they had realized how lucky they were to get this second chance they were still going back into the same environment that brought them into the hospital in the first place and we used to sort of say to ourselves like you know the only way this person's not coming back is if they get a whole new group of friends like in fact the best thing you could do for this person is get them out of inner city

[02:16:25] Baltimore like they can't go back to the row home they came from now that might sound like a very extreme example right well come on inner city Baltimore I mean you're talking about a crack house D D D D D but is it really any different for a college kid who's trying to desperately get off you know the the transition from you know Oxycodone to Fentanyl and this is being done in a dorm room or a party or something like that and it's their friends and they decide you know they they manage to you know again pull out of the grip of that but they find themselves at another party in three months I mean it's really difficult that's the part that that concerns me is if is it's hard to do this one person at a time yeah yeah and um and it's uh again I mean I I think I it's it's funny I I kind of come back to the you know that idea of undertoe and and even you telling your own story about um about your experience with Oxycontin I I um I think the big thing that comes home to me is just that the you know these things are these substances are are they have an awesome power and um and and that's um compounded by all of the kind of atmospheric social sort of situational things you're talking about um but just having talked to a lot of families over the years who who've dealt with this and they you know they they thought they were out of the woods and then they weren't um I I think you're right like in in any one individual life and even somebody who actually has a really supportive you know they've got a whole support system there and and in some instances you know in many instances there are people who who um they don't have the resources uh for the appropriate treatment but in many instances there instances there are people who do right who who throw resources at the problem um and it's not enough it's not adequate uh so I I think that the um I just think we should all be sort of humble and and and mindful in the face of the tremendous kind of potency and power uh that that that's on the other side of this problem yeah well Patrick thank you very much for um first and foremost for your for your book and your investigation which I think has brought to light a lot of things that that probably could have easily gotten ignored or swept away I mean it's it's true that J know during these proceedings a lot of documents are brought into the public light but that's that's only half the battle that's the easy half the hard part is actually going through them and extracting what the story is and and you've you've done a better job of that with respect to this important part of the story than anybody else but also thank you for making time I know this is uh of course
