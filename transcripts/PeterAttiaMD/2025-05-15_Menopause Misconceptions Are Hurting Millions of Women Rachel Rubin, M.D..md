## AI Summary

I'll help structure a comprehensive analysis of this episode focusing on menopause and hormone therapy. Based on the provided transcript excerpt:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Rachel Rubin discussing menopause, its widespread misconceptions, and treatment options. The conversation primarily focuses on the systemic effects of menopause and the importance of hormone therapy, particularly focusing on the genital urinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Dr. Rubin emphasizes that menopause affects the entire body through hormone receptors and argues that current medical understanding and treatment approaches are inadequately addressing these issues.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Hormone receptors are present throughout the body, making menopause a whole-body experience [00:00:47]
- Hot flashes are linked to increased cardiovascular risk [00:01:25]
- Brain contains estrogen receptors; recent Nature publication shows receptor density increases with age [00:04:22]
- Vaginal estrogen can reduce UTI risk by more than 50% (New England Journal of Medicine findings from 1990s) [00:09:44]
- Medicare could save $6-22 billion annually if patients used vaginal estrogen [00:10:52]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider vaginal estrogen for UTI prevention [00:10:30]
- Address menopause symptoms early rather than dismissing them [00:03:25]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Local vaginal estrogen therapy is safe for most people, including those with history of blood clots or breast cancer [00:10:52]

**4. Supplements & Medications**:
Medications mentioned:
- Vaginal estrogen ($13 per tube) [00:10:52]
- Estriol (available in Europe but not FDA-approved in US) [00:09:44]

**5. Notable Quotes**:
"Menopause has the worst PR campaign in the history of the universe" [00:00:00]

"If a penis shriveled up at age 52, we'd probably have a vaccine sponsored by Pfizer" [00:07:40]

**Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific protocols for vaginal estrogen administration?
2. How does the timing of hormone therapy initiation affect outcomes?
3. What are the latest developments in brain estrogen receptor research?
4. How do different forms of estrogen (E1, E2, E3) compare in effectiveness?

Would you like me to expand on any of these sections or continue analyzing other aspects of the transcript?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] So, anything else you want to say about systemic therapy before we go and talk about local therapy in the context of genital urinary symptoms of menopause? Yeah, I think we haven't spent a lot of time really talking about the symptoms of menopause, right? What are we treating? Why do people have why do people need systemic therapy? And I think, you know, I'm often saying that menopause has the worst PR campaign in the history of the universe. Why? because we think it's for old people and we think it's just hot flashes and we think hot flashes go away. There's actually not enough education. Like we can argue about E1, E2, and E3, but the reality is doctors don't even know the symptoms of menopause. Patients don't even know the symptoms of menopause, right? The person who was doing my makeup this morning, she's like, I just feel awful. I feel like an old person.

[00:00:47] I'm not sleeping. I'm not fun anymore. I can't drink. I can't, you know, my joints are achy. And I said, "Welcome to you need hormone therapy." Right? Like I'm always teaching no matter who I'm whether it's a cab driver, a hair stylist, I'm always teaching. But this idea of of of you have hormone receptors throughout your whole body. It is a whole body experience. So yes, there's hot flashes and night sweats. And by the way, hot flashes are not just a nuisance. That is a neurologic vasculogenic probably event, right? The the worse your hot flashes, the worse your risk of cardiovascular issues and things like that. Um, joint pain is a huge one. I never thought as a urologist

[00:01:25] I would treat so much joint pain. Uh, never in a million years did I think I cared about joint pain. And yet patients come in all the time and say, "Oh my god, I don't get out of bed feeling old. I don't feel creaky. Um, my joints recover again after I exercise." And again, empty gas tank inflammation. When you uh I think hormones are um nature's uh joint fluid, if you will. So, so almost like brake fluid, right? Go back to the car analogy. We are going to milk the heck out of this. I love it. So, so it's really cool. So, your eyes need lubrication. Your ears need wax. Your vagina needs lubrication. Your joints actually need lubrication. And so, think of horny teenager. You've got oils, oily skin. So, so hormones create these oils, vaginal lubrication, oil for your skin.

[00:02:11] There are androgen receptors in your eyeballs, right? In these myobian glands. So, so I think of hormones like fluid. So as you lose the hormones or the hormones go too high or too low, it dries everything out and so you get joint pain, you get frozen shoulder, you get planter fasciitis and now it was recently published on by our my colleague Vonda Wright, the muscularkeeletal syndrome of menopause.

[00:02:35] Right? This idea that so many women in their 40s and 50s everything starts to break down. It's because the gas tank is empty and that inflammation increases. It's such a simple an it's such a simple analogy. So what are the symptoms? You've get muscularkeeletal symptoms, sleep issues, mood issues, um uh bleeding changes, um obviously low libido, orgasm problems, arousal problems, pain with sex increases like crazy. Um I sent you a list here. What am I missing? You've got a you've got a list there. Uh irritability, very common one. Um I think that the one that I was going to ask you about is brain fog and depression. Um, this is one where I think this is a I think this is a very unique one because it's one that gets easily dismissed as something unrelated.

[00:03:25] Say say more about those. It's it's one of the most common symptoms and all women start going to doctors in their 40s like like doctors you're I know you're listening and you get so many people and every day you say, "Oh, it's probably hormonal." But you're not giving them the solution. You're just telling them it's not cancer. So the neurologists are seeing all these patients to rule out um you know a cognitive decline or all these other issues, but really it's that brain fog because your brain is filled with estrogen receptors. This is crazy research. Okay, I don't know if you've had Lisa Mossone on, but here's this researcher from Cornell, neuroscience researcher who says, "Hey, I want to study Alzheimer's. I want to do this.

[00:04:04] This is just in the last couple years." And she goes to her lab manager and says, "Okay, what's the assay for estradi in the brain? I need to look at estradile receptors in the brain. And the people at Cornell was like, "That doesn't exist." She's like, "What do you mean that doesn't exist?" She's like, "How can we not look at estrogen receptors in the brain?" So, she gets um

[00:04:22] Maria Shrivever to give her a giant amount of money who gives her a huge amount of money. So, she now develops this assay. This is only within the last couple of years. She just published in Nature very early findings that what would you expect, right? Your body is efficient. It's not going to do things it doesn't need to do. So the hypothesis was that as menopause gets later and later, the estrogen receptors in your brain are going to downregulate. Why have receptors around when there's no estrogen to feed the brain? What did she find? The exact opposite, right? That actually even up to 65, she stopped looking past 65 because she's like, there's no way that's going to matter.

[00:04:57] The increase in receptor density the older you get and it correlates to brain fog and irritability, you know, sort of correlates to all these symptoms. My reading of that was estrogen is so important in the brain that it has to upregulate the receptors as the estrogen level goes down and down and down. In other words, it's a lot like the way the brain is treated for glucose. The body will if you if you are fasting, the muscles will within days become completely insulin resistant. It's their way of saying every molecule of glucose that that liver spits out better not go into the muscle. It better go to the brain. And so you look like you have diabetes in an effort to save glucose for the brain. And I think that's what's happening with estrogen. And could you argue that weight gain in menopause is evolutionary so that you make more estrone or whatever, right? That then goes to the the brain because it wants every morsel that it can get, right? So this idea of hormones matter for the brain deeply, right? This is very important. So it's fascinating research, but you're going to see a lot of again, think of a receptor as pmenopause is happening. The receptors are full, now they're empty, then they're full, now they're empty, now they're half full, now they're empty. It is, this is why we see ADHD pop up in permenopause. All these women are saying, "I have now new diagnosed ADHD." It's real. Why? because your brain is is having a panic attack because it's just trying to figure out some stability here. Which is why actually in empty gas tanks, so in menopause when you are totally empty, the brain fog gets better, right?

[00:06:33] Because there's still the volatility of hormone volatile anymore. But if we just all I'm saying is just add some estrogen, right, to just keep the receptors happy. The other one that we didn't talk about was the urinary symptoms. So both urinary incontinents and then the higher prevalence of UTI. You've alluded to it a little bit but just maybe finish the swing on that.

[00:06:53] Okay. So this is my favorite topic in the history of topics. Uh because we used to call this problem initially it was called scenile vagina. That was the initial uh yes there was a papers written on the scenile vagina. Then it got updated I don't even understand what that means. An old vagina I suppose. the the then it got changed to vulvo vaginal atrophy or atrophic vaginitis. That was the terminology that was used up until 24. Before that it was scenile vagina totally missed that check the history books. Very fascinating. So vulvo vaginal atrophy was sort of the common name of this of okay as you get older the vagina atrophies. It shrivels up. It shrinks up. You know again if a penis shriveled up at age 52 we'd probably have a vaccine sponsored by Fizer, right? This is this is they created

[00:07:40] Viagra. They would create this this vaccine. No one even tells. I love that analogy. So you're saying if by the time a man became 50, his penis became a shriveled up useless organ. You you you you're saying that the medical system would have probably done something about this. What do you think? Right. Like tell me what you think.

[00:08:00] You might be on to something, Rachel. I I I I know what I'm talking about. So this is Right. So, so, so this is the thing. We just told we just called it Volvo vaginal atrophy and we said, "Well, if you have pain with sex or a little vaginal dryness, here's some moisturizers. Here's some lubricants. Here you go. If you're really bothered, really bothered, you got to be really bothered." Then there's this thing called vaginal estrogen that we could give you. Now, here's the crazy part of this is it's not just a little vaginal dryness. The vagina and the bladder need hormones, right? Babies don't have hormones and that's why you see it's red, it's irritated, they're these small little labia manora. Diaper cream was invented, right, to because it looks so painful. Then hormones, they pee their diapers all the time. The genitals morph and change with hormones, right? Puberty happens and you have a change of the genital and urinary system. And um and so what happens is as you lose hormones, it goes in reverse. And so it changes the microbiome. uh the the hormones keep the tissue acidic. It grows the healthy lactobacilli. It is uh the vagina is supposed to be acidic. It's supposed to be able to fight infection. And without proper hormones, you lose that ability to fight infection. So you see urinary frequency, urinary urgency, vaginal dryness, increase in leakage, increase in urgent continents and recurrent urinary tract infections which can and do kill people. Okay, we've known this since the '9s in the New England Journal of Medicine. Actually, this was on estriol. They looked you could reduce the risk of urinary tract infections by well over 50%. We have known this all along and yet and that was with topical estriol. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. I was not aware of that. And yet there is no

[00:09:44] FDA approved estriol formulation despite that fact. Yeah. Correct. I think it's available in Europe. Um so we so the name got changed in 2014. Okay. 2014, a bunch of people got in a room and they said, "You know what? This bulb vaginal atrophy thing, that's kind of a bad name because it doesn't describe what's really happening to people." So, they changed the name to Genital urinary syndrome of menopause, GSM. Now, there was one urologist, my mentor, was in the room, and they almost didn't put the word urinary in it. And he fought and he yelled and he screamed, "This is the power of one person to be able to change the whole world." And they said, "Okay, we'll listen to you. We'll put the word urinary in it." And I'm so glad they did because the urinary problems are the things that kill people, right? People are dying of urinary tract infection. In fact, a large amount of money goes to

[00:10:30] Medicare expenditures when it comes to urinary tract infections. And we published last year that if Medicare patients used vaginal estrogen, which is safe for everybody, and $13 a tube, we would save Medicare between 6 and 22 billion dollar a year. Billions. Just say that again please because I know there are people that are in the

[00:10:52] Medicare system who are going to be interested to understand that. Okay. So when you when you do a lowd dose local vaginal estrogen or DHEA product you can reduce your risk of urinary tract infections by more than half. They are safe to use if you've had a history of blood clots, breast cancer, whatever medical problem you can come at me. I can tell you that it's safe. Okay? It will not only help with lubrication, help with pain with sex, uh uh help with urinary frequency, urgency, leakage, but it will reduce your risk of urinary tract infections by more than half. It's also inexpensive and covered by your insurance. If everybody in Medicare eligibility used vaginal estrogen, we would save Medicare between 6 and 22 billion dollar a year. And in my opinion, that is a conservative estimate because of how many patients are getting urinary tract infections. They're going to their doctor for cultures. They're in the ICU with sepsis. Um, this is a huge economic morbid and mortality problem that we are dealing with and no one cares. I mean, again, I always try to come up with the steel man and say, is it that they don't care or is it that they're unaware or is it that they feel that it just needs to fall on the shoulders of somebody other than themselves? So, I think we have a marketing problem. I I truly believe this is a marketing problem because let me tell you, but how Okay, let me push back. Not because I don't agree with you, but I'm just going to put put my my hat on that says the opposite, right? So maybe I am too attuned to this, but I feel like there is nothing more talked about right now. I mean, look at what

[00:12:37] Halib Berry is doing. Look what Oprah is doing. Look what Gwennneth is doing. I mean, there are so many very powerful, very influential women that are talking about this. Why is is this not in the zeitgeist right now? It's getting better, but again, they don't know how to write the prescriptions. Okay. So, let me tell you, you're saying there's not enough physicians talking about this. Then if it really comes down to prescript if you can't get the it's not over the counter. If you can't get the prescription or if you don't go to your doctor saying that you need it. Uh we had an Instagram reel just yesterday that the patient said I sent my my friend went to her doctor said she was having pain with sex asked for vaginal estrogen and her gynecologist said and I quote you need to think of other ways uh to to change your relationship from now on. It's not in the cards for you. What does that mean? Meaning you can't have sex anymore, right? And the fact is it's not about sex. It's about urinary tract infections. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is impossible for me to fathom. A woman went to her gynecologist and said, "I'm having pain with intercourse." Yeah. This woman, any idea how old this woman is? In her 60s. Okay.

[00:13:44] And the gynecologist said didn't didn't you think this gynecologist doesn't know about estrogen? Honestly, I don't know anymore. It's incredible. Right. So So, okay. So, we could argue Viagra 1998, Viagra comes out. Viagra changed the world. Billions of dollars. What is Viagra? It is a PD5 inhibitor. It relaxes smooth muscles of the penis, increased blood flow, gives you a rigid erection. So, it helps with arousal for men. Okay? If you take it micro dose, low doses, it can also help with BPH or urinary problems. Right? We love Viagra.

[00:14:17] We love Seialis. Wish it was in the water. We should study it in women. Um, this is the problem though because I did in medical school. Oh, I'm going to talk about that. But, but I will argue we have had Viagra for women long before we've had Viagra for men. And we've known about it since the 1970s. And

[00:14:36] Viagra for women is vaginal hormones. What do vaginal hormones do? They relax the tissue. They increase arousal. They increase lubrication. They increase orgasm. They help with urinary symptoms. So, they do everything Viagra does. And they prevent urinary tract infections. Viagra doesn't do that. So, you're talking about better than Viagra. It's inexpensive. Now, it didn't used to be.

[00:14:56] So, when I got out of my training, a tube of estrace was $500. now because of people like Mark Cuban and Good RX and I' I've talked to Mark Cuban on my DMs and Twitter and he knows more about vaginal estrogen than 90% of doctors. But this idea of of it's not expensive. A tube of estrogen is $13, right? And you're saying that the reason that this price has come down is I I know Mark is a very hardliner against the PBMs. Did

[00:15:20] Did Mark basically take a sledgehammer to that? Yeah. Yeah. They changed they changed the game. And so it's incredible. Oh my gosh. It's incredible. And he understands this. He he literally understands the nuances of why vaginal estrogen is so important. I I can't get doctors to do that. I think he's he's incredible. And so so so we have a marketing problem. We have a product that is better than Viagra for women.

[00:15:41] It's been around longer than Viagra. It's inexpensive. It's inexpensive. What are we missing? What? It's marketing. We're not telling the patients. We're not telling the doctors. And we have a box labeling that says this product causes stroke, heart attacks, blood clots, probable dementia, breast cancer, and needs to be taken with progesterone.

[00:16:01] Not one of those statements is true. Not one. Okay. So, we went to the FDA and says, "You got to remove the box. This is not you're you're killing people." And the FDA said, "Nah, we're going to leave the box on. This is a nightmare." I'm Peter Atia.
