This clip is from episode #357 ‒ A new era of longevity science: models of aging, human trials of rapamycin, biological clocks, promising compounds, and lifestyle interventions | Brian Kennedy, Ph.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Chronological vs. Biological Age – Peter explores whether biological clocks can outperform chronological age in predicting lifespan and health
- Development of Clinical Chemistry Clocks – New “second-generation” biological clocks are being built from standard clinical data
- Superior Mortality Prediction – The second-gen clinical chemistry clocks predict mortality better than ASCVD risk scores and some epigenetic clocks
- Hospitals Are Taking Interest – Hospitals prefer these models because they're based on tests they already understand and use regularly
- Actionable Health Insights – Doctors can act on this data—like treating LDL or hypertension—potentially reducing biological age and mortality risk

## AI Summary

Based on this transcript segment, I'll provide a partial analysis focusing on the discussed content:

**Executive Summary**:
The episode features a discussion with Dr. Brian Kennedy about alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) and its potential role in aging intervention. The conversation focuses on research findings regarding AKG supplementation and its effects on lifespan and healthspan, particularly highlighting the importance of time-released formulations.

**Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- AKG is a central metabolite involved in hundreds of reactions, similar to NAD, and is part of the TCA/Krebs cycle [00:01:11]
- AKG levels decrease with aging in organisms [00:01:11]
- Mouse studies showed:
  * 5-10% increase in lifespan with AKG supplementation [00:01:42]
  * Dramatic improvement in frailty measures [00:01:42]
  * Synergistic effects with vitamin A in male mice [00:00:28]
  * Combined effects with vitamin D in both sexes [00:00:28]

**Supplements & Medications**:
- Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG):
  * Time-released version is crucial (regular AKG dissipates in 5 minutes) [00:00:28]
  * Product mentioned: "Rejuvenant" by PDL Health [00:00:28]
  * Combined with vitamins A and D in commercial product [00:00:28]

**Notable Quotes**:
"If you did not extend lifespan by a day but you just improved healthspan, that's a home run." [00:02:01]

**Research Context**:
- Studies have shown AKG may reverse aging by a few years based on methylation clocks [00:02:21]
- Ongoing controlled placebo double-blinded clinical trial testing time-release AKG without vitamins [00:02:21]

**Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific mechanisms through which AKG improves healthspan?
2. What are the optimal dosing protocols for AKG supplementation in humans?
3. Are there any contraindications or potential side effects of long-term AKG supplementation?
4. How do the effects of time-released vs. regular AKG compare in human studies?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] So let's talk a little bit about alpha ketoglutarate. Walk us through the rationale for how that came to be something that you would put through this type of rigorous program. Yeah. So uh company full disclosure that I'm involved with uh PDL health uh they have a product rejuvenant. Now they came to us many years ago at the buck and working with Gordon Lithkco and I and they were like let's screen natural products uh that would have an impact on aging because you know their the mindset of um the CEO of this what became the

[00:00:28] CEO of this company was that I I I can't get drugs approved for aging at any time in the near future. Let's work with natural products and also so things that the FDA just calls grass out of the gate. So we screened a lot of things in worms and AKG came out as one of the best things in worms. And then in the mouse studies we found that for male mice there was a combined effect with uh vitamin A. And uh vitamins are an interesting discussion too. Uh and there was also a combined effect with both sexes with vitamin D. And so that led to this product rejuvenant which is AKG timereleas AKG very important because otherwise it's like in it goes away in 5 minutes if you don't have a time release version.

[00:01:11] Tell tell folks what alpha ketoglutarate is it show it's a part of the is it part of the KB cycle? It's yeah it is it's a the TCA cycle or KB cycle central metabolite involved in hundreds of reactions. It's a lot like NAD. Y they're doing different things but they're both central metabolites. They're both going down with aging in organisms. Y and the idea is supplementing them back up would be beneficial. Um and so when we did that with AKG in mice, we see about a 5 to 10% increase in lifespan but a dramatic increase in frailty.

[00:01:42] So when we increase I know what you mean. Yeah. So that mice I would argue that you're extending squaring the longevity curve as we talk about it. Y yeah. So um you know if we could if that translated to humans it would be a big impact and so that's what led to the human product. By the way, I think that if you did not extend lifespan by a day,

[00:02:01] Yeah. but you just improved health span. Yeah, that's a home run. Yeah, I agree. For most people, that is all they actually want. Yeah, I I agree. I think if they get that, they'll want the other two, but that's But yeah, I I But never the reverse. No, nobody wants more lifespan. That's what we're doing now.

[00:02:21] I know. I know. I That's That's called medicine 2.0. Um but yeah, I I completely agree with that. So, you know, we're still excited about this product. There's been about AKG and especially the time release version. And there's been um you know, some some studies that have been published, one of which we helped analyze the data for using rudimentary methylation clocks showing that they reverse that that it reverses aging by a few years. Again, it's that oscillation thing we were talking about earlier, I think. Um, and that's why we wanted to do a controlled placebo double-blinded clinical trial at the university. In that case, we're just testing the time release AKG. We didn't include the vitamins because we're trying to get some mechanistic information. We don't want confounders in there. Um, but I'm I think as the data is still pretty pretty good on AKG that it's going to have an impact in people.

[00:03:16] Did you guys do a study on urthan as well? We haven't published it yet, but I am happy to talk a little bit about it. I'm Peter Aia.
