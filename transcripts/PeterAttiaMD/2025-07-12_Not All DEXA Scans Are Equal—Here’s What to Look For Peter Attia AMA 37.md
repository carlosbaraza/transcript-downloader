This clip is from episode Navigating bone health: early life influences and advanced strategies for improvement and injury prevention (#214 rebroadcast)

In this clip, they discuss:

- How a DEXA Scan Works – DEXA uses low-dose X-rays to assess fat, lean mass, and bone density, offering a clear breakdown of body composition and bone health
- Not All DEXA Scans Are Equal – Some scans only report total body BMD; Peter explains why segmental analysis (hip, spine) is essential for meaningful insights
- How to Interpret Your Z & T Scores – Learn how bone mineral density is ranked using Z and T scores and why these statistical measures matter more than raw numbers
- Understanding the Bell Curve – Peter explains Z-scores through standard deviations and why being above or below average carries clinical significance
- Why Age & Gender Matter – Bone loss is common in aging, but menopause causes a sharp drop for women. Sex and age both factor heavily into BMD risk

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this episode about DEXA scans:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on DEXA scanning, particularly for bone mineral density (BMD) measurement. Dr. Attia emphasizes that not all DEXA scanners provide the same level of analysis and discusses the importance of getting segmental bone analysis. He explains the significance of T-scores and Z-scores in interpreting BMD results and challenges conventional wisdom about when to start BMD screening.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- DEXA uses two very low-dose X-rays absorbed differently by bones and soft tissues [00:00:20]
- Segmental analysis includes left hip, right hip, and lumbar spine measurements [00:00:54]
- BMD measurements are reported in grams per centimeter squared due to planar measurement limitations [00:08:49]
- Racial differences exist in BMD, with non-Hispanic blacks having higher BMD than other groups [00:10:16]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Get full segmental bone analysis when doing DEXA scans [00:00:54]
- Ensure DEXA provides appendicular lean mass index and fat-free mass index calculations [00:02:39]

Context-specific Recommendations:
- Women should consider earlier screening than conventional guidelines suggest [00:13:28]
- Higher concern for pre-menopausal women with low Z-scores [00:07:26]

4. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- DEXA scan costs range from $125-400 depending on analysis depth [00:02:11]
- Key metrics to request:
  * Segmental bone analysis
  * Full segmental lean tissue analysis
  * Appendicular lean mass index
  * Fat-free mass index
  * Visceral fat measurement [00:02:39]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"Never in the history of civilization has a 90-year-old person ever been heard uttering, 'I wish I was less strong, I wish I had less muscle, I wish my bone density wasn't so high.'" [00:07:26]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What specific lifestyle interventions can improve BMD scores?
- How does weight-bearing exercise specifically impact BMD?
- What is the optimal frequency for DEXA scans in different age groups?

7. **Standard Guidelines vs. Attia's Recommendations**:
Standard Guidelines [00:11:55]:
- Women: Start at age 65
- Men: Start at age 70
- High-risk individuals: Start at 50
- Follow-up scans every 2 years

Attia's Approach:
- Recommends earlier screening, especially for women in their 30s
- Considers low Z-scores concerning even at age 35 [00:13:57]

## Transcript

[00:00:00] And Peter, you mentioned DEXA there a little bit ago and anyone who's listening to this podcast will be familiar with the DEXA scan because we talk about it a lot in looking at, you know, fat and like the benefits that you can get from that. Is that the best way for listeners to figure out what their

[00:00:20] BMD is? Is that how you're doing it in patients? Yes. Um, so DEXA is a super super low radiation scan, nothing like a CT scan. Um, it, you know, takes 10 minutes. You lay on a table, a little scanner moves over your body, and it's using two very lowd dose X-rays that are absorbed differentially by bones and soft tissues. And so it's able to differentiate between atapost tissue, bone, and lean tissue or nonatapost tissue. Um, I will say this, not all

[00:00:54] DEXA scanners are created equal. So, if you want to know your bone health, make sure before you go and get the DEXA scan. You confirm with the entity doing this that they are giving you segmental bone analysis for left hip, right hip, lumbar, spine. A lot of DEXA places can only give you whole body BMD. So they'll just spit out the zcore for that one uh for that one metric, but they won't give it to you segmentally.

[00:01:26] So um and that's sometimes okay like if a person's BMD is very high, you don't need the segmental analysis. But if you're doing this to screen for BMD, uh you have to make sure of course that the that the DEXA is capable of doing that. Yeah. And just a reminder for people, um, we talked about this in another episode, but we were always surprised at how easy it is to get a DEXA scan, right? You don't need a doctor to do it.

[00:01:51] So, if you just Google the city you're in and then DEXA, you should be able to find different providers that do it for relatively cheap. I think in most cities, it's around $1, $150. So, it has a lot of benefits. And just maybe remind people again if they are calling different places, what are the three things they want to look for?

[00:02:11] Yeah, you want to make sure when you're doing a DEXA again, if you care about knowing the full BMD and you're going to pay more for that segmental analysis. So, when you talk about those scans that are like in the 100, 125, even up to 150, a lot of times they aren't showing everything. They're just giving you body composition. Um, and usually visceral fat. Now, um, you'll say up to $400 typically if you want to see everything. But again, it's all like you're gonna pay more in

[00:02:39] New York and San Francisco than you're going to pay in Austin, Texas, for example. Um I I probably pay like 125 for mine, but I'm not getting the full uh BMD analysis because I've already had it done and my BMD is high, so I don't need to screen that frequently at not at the rate that I screen everything. The other things you want to look at, you obviously want to make sure you're getting full segmental lean tissue analysis. So you can look at appendicular lean mass index that you can calculate for yourself. Obviously, fat free mass index you can calculate for yourself. Fat mass index you can calculate. You need them to be able to give you that. Um, and so those are those are kind of the things I want to see along with BMD.

[00:03:16] And let's say you have like you and a friend are going and getting your BMD done through a DEXA scan. Is there going to be variability that exists in bone density between different people? Like let's say even if someone didn't have osteopenia or osteoporosis, can there just be natural variability between different types of people? Yeah. And and it's also important to understand the number you're going to get. So they don't, at least to my knowledge, I don't recall seeing them typically report in grams per centime cubed your BMD because what would you do with that information?

[00:03:52] Like it's not that helpful. What you really need to know is statistically where do you rank? And this is done via a t-core and a zcore. And this is done to compare you to a young healthy adult and to an adult that is your age. So if you go back to statistics 101, I think many people might recall the idea of a normal distribution, which is a bell curve function.

[00:04:23] And a zcore is basically telling you where you lie on that distribution. So a zscore of zero means you are right in the middle of the distribution. And if you're in the middle of that distribution, it means you are you have a higher bone mineral density than 50% of people and a lower bone density than 50% of people.

[00:04:49] If your zcore is plus one, it means you are one standard deviation above the mean, which means you are you have a higher bone density than 82.5% of the population and a lower bone density than 17 1.5% of the population. If your zcore is plus.2, two, it means you are two standard deviations above the mean, which means you're at 97.5% you're you're higher than 97.5% of the population. Of course, this works in reverse. A zcore of minus2 means you have a lower bone density than 97.5% of the population.

[00:05:40] So that's what zcores do. They're I'm sorry, I may have misspoke. The zcore is comparing you to your age. When I say the population, the T-core is comparing you to the young healthy individual. So in other words, for someone who's older, the zcore is always going to be more favorable than the t-core. Does that make sense?

[00:06:00] Yeah. Yeah. Because you're comparing to a 30-y If you're 60, you want to compare yourself to not only a 30-year-old, but also other 60 year olds. That's correct. And is it when you look at for yourself and even with your patients their scores, is it kind of like how you do V2 max where you always want to be in the elite of the elite categories for like you know V2 max you want to be elite and a decade younger for like BMD. Do you if someone is at that zero that 50th percentile does that worry you or is it a little different in how you look at this?

[00:06:38] Other things factor into this, Nick. I mean, family history factors into it. History of smoking factors into this. Current lifestyle. I hate the word lifestyle, but I think you know what I mean. You know, sort of how active is that person? How much weightbearing activity are they doing? So, being male versus female also factors into it a lot. So if I see a woman prior to menopause, so let's say I'm talking about, you know, I got a 42year-old female patient who's, you know, I might guess 3 to 5 years out from menopause and she already has a low Zcore. That worries me a lot because of what we'll talk about shortly, uh, visav the effect of estrogen here and why women are disproportionately affected by estrogen estrogen withdrawal.

[00:07:26] But you know, you've heard me make this my glib stupid joke, right? Never in the history of civilization as a 90-year-old person ever been heard uttering, I wish I was less strong. I wish I had less muscle. I wish my bone density wasn't so high. Right. Impossible. Yeah. You know how Tim Ferrris always asks people on the podcast, you know, what uh what would they put on a billboard? I think we've we've come to the conclusion of what you would 100% put on your billboard.

[00:08:01] That's right. The Peteria billboard would just say, "Find me one example in the history of our species where a 90-year-old said, "I wish I had less strength. I wish I had less muscle. I wish I had weaker bones." Love it. Love it. All right, Nick. So, pull up figure five. All right, got figure five pulled up.

[00:08:23] Okay, so you can see on this graph we're looking at uh males versus females top to bottom and then we're looking at Mexican-American, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black. So three races, two sexes, uh six lines. Um but I just want to make one thing to the listener a little bit clear, which is on the y-axis here, you're seeing units of grams per centime squared. Earlier I said grams per centime cubed. Why the difference?

[00:08:49] Well, the difference is even though density in real life is measured in grams per centime cubed because you need mass per unit volume, with bone density, it's actually done as grams per centime squared because it's a planer measurement. So, the DEXA scan is compressing everything to 2D. Does that make sense? Because the scanner is kind of looking at the area of the bone and imputing the density by what electron beam doesn't go through it. So, I've always found this a bit confusing personally and I've always thought I've always wondered why they just can't do this in grams per centimeter cubed. But

[00:09:24] I I'll just point that out for for the astute observer. Okay, I think there are two observations that one would pretty quickly take away from this. The first is that up until, you know, the 20s, men and women are kind of similar, right? you go through a profound increase in BMD from the time you're eight years old until you're about 20 years old.

[00:09:50] Difference one is that uh while women maintain a reasonable plateau, they tend to fall quite precipitously in midlife and that's obviously due to menopause. We'll talk about why in a moment. I think the second thing that jumps out here is the racial difference. So non-Hispanic black has a higher BMD for both men and women than non-Hispanic white which has a higher BMD than

[00:10:16] Mexican or Hispanic in this case Mexican-American. So again slight differences in race. Truthfully I don't know why that is. Um but it is what it is. So uh to your earlier question are there differences? Yeah there are differences on average. Um, I've never, to be honest with you, factored this into my risk assessment except for the male female one. Um, so in other words, if I look at a patient who's black versus white versus versus Hispanic, I kind of have never assumed one is at more or less risk. I've just said, let's do the kitchen sink on everybody. U, but

[00:10:55] I think in females, I'm more worried for the reasons that we are obviously talking about. Yeah. And in looking at this too and one of the questions we received is you know when when should people do their first bone mineral density scan you know when do you want to know that baseline because what's interesting when you look at this and you talked about it is you know from 8 to about 20 22 you see that huge jump and then it kind of levels off. So what would your recommendation be for when people should get their first one done? gonna get into a lot of hot water here, Nick.

[00:11:32] So, but I'm I'm used to it, right? I've got very um unusual recommendations for a lot of things, and this is no different. So, I think in the spirit of fairness, I'm going to communicate the standard recommendations first. So when you look at the American Association of Family Physicians, the American College of OB obstitricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Preventative

[00:11:55] Medicine, the International Society of Clinical Densiometry, the National Osteoporosis Foundation and more. The typical recommendation um is for high-risk people to be 50 um but typically 65 is sort of when they want to start screening people. Um and that's for women and for men it's typically 70. That's a lot of credentials you just laid out there. Are you sure you want to get in hot water with all of those different people? No, I I I'm just simply stating what they're recommending. And if I've misrepresented that, feel free to correct us. But um you know, it's typically recommended, as

[00:12:38] I said, women at 65, men at 70, follow-up scans no more than every 2 years. Um now, for someone who is at serious risk of osteoporosis, which includes men and women over the age of 50, um you know, they can we can adjust those and and come down a little bit. Um, now the WHO I think is a little bit more aggressive and recommends screening women by the age of 40 if I'm not mistaken. Um, as you can guess, I tend to be closer uh in my thinking uh to the WHO. And I certainly believe women in their 30s where we're doing DEXA scans for many reasons, I'm just as interested in their bone mineral density. In fact, when I'm reporting the DEXA results to patients, we have a template that we've made that

[00:13:28] I really like that lays all of the DEXA information out, right? So, segmental BMD, you know, VAT, um, FFMI, ALMI, FMI, all of these things, body fat, for what it's worth, I always tell them out of the gate, like the one number you care about is your body fat. That's the one I care least about. Um, and yeah, so when we, you know, when we're looking at a 35year-old patient and their zcore is already minus1,

[00:13:57] I mean, that's just as concerning to me as if their O GTT shows, you know, very elevated postprandial glucose and insulin levels. Um, and I'm really happy that I'm seeing that at the age of 35 and not 65. I'm Peter AIA.
