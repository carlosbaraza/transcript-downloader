## Description

Original release date: 10/19/2018

In this five-part series, Thomas Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA, a world-renowned expert in lipidology, and one of Peter’s most important clinical mentors, shares his wealth of knowledge on the subject of lipids. In Part V, Peter and Tom talk about inflammation, endothelial health, and oxidative stress as they pertain to cardiovascular disease, and our attempts to monitor them using biomarkers. They also discuss a couple of very important risk factors that too few people (and doctors) know about. Tom closes the five-part series with a tragic story about his good friend that is likely all-too-common for many practicing physicians, that both haunts and motivates Dr. Dayspring to learn as much as he can about the number one killer in the United States.

We discuss:

-Lp(a) [2:30];
-Inflammation [17:15];
-Oxidative stress markers: Lp-PLA2 and oxLDL [20:45];
-Endothelial health markers: ADMA and SDMA [34:30];
-Remnants [43:45];
-Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) and apoC-III [55:30];
-Red blood cells and cholesterol transport [1:07:45];
-Tom’s friend Earl [1:10:00];
-Peter’s friend JP [1:18:15]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dr. Tom Dayspring:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This is the fifth and final episode in a series with Dr. Tom Dayspring focusing on advanced lipidology. The discussion covers LP(a), inflammation, oxidized LDL, remnants, and various biomarkers. The episode provides deep insights into the complexities of lipid metabolism and cardiovascular disease prevention, with particular emphasis on emerging therapeutic approaches and biomarker interpretation.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- LP(a) particles are not effectively lowered by statins but can be reduced by PCSK9 inhibitors [02:25]
- Red blood cells carry more cholesterol molecules than lipoproteins but don't cause atherosclerosis due to inability to penetrate arterial walls [1:09:04]
- APO C3 is a significant predictor of longevity and cardiovascular outcomes [54:15]
- DHA appears more effective than EPA at lowering APO C3 levels [55:52]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider measuring red blood cell omega-3 levels rather than plasma levels [57:37]
- Focus on particle numbers rather than just cholesterol content [05:50]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- EPA/DHA supplements discussed:
  - Carlson's and Nordic Naturals mentioned as quality brands [1:00:39]
  - Different forms (esterified vs. free fatty acids) affect bioavailability [1:03:40]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- LP(a) particle number is more informative than LP(a) mass [04:04]
- Red blood cell omega-3 index recommended over plasma measurements [57:37]
- ADMA/SDMA as markers of endothelial function [43:12]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"The field is infinitely more complex than you ever imagined" [1:26:48]

7. **References & Resources**:
- Dr. Bill Harris mentioned as omega-3 expert [59:25]
- Upcoming EPA outcomes trial results expected November (at time of recording) [1:03:40]

8. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal ratio of EPA to DHA for cardiovascular protection?
2. How does APO C3 inhibition affect other metabolic parameters?
3. What is the relationship between LP(a) and inflammation?

This analysis captures the main points but there's significantly more detail in the full transcript. Would you like me to expand on any particular aspect?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com

[00:00:40] hi everybody welcome to the fifth and final episode in the week of Tom this is the tour de force magnum opus course on lipid ology as we round this out we talk about a number of things we talk about LP little a inflammation oxidized LDL remnants red blood cells and cholesterol a biomarker called LP PLA 2 that you've often probably heard about another biomarker that you may have not heard of called a DMA or asymmetric dimethyl arginine an SDM a symmetric dimethyl arginine and then we kind of bring it back to what is one of the more tragic stories in Tom's life which is a friend of his who unfortunately probably had FH wasn't treated and in many ways is sort of one of those patients that still kind of haunts Tom and I think you know we open this back in part one by talking about Tom's passion for two other things firefighting and hockey and how that passion is what really got him into or basically allowed him to apply himself to this new field once he became obsessed but also I think most physicians listening to this will have a similar story where there are certain patients or there are certain personal relationships where a loss of life stays with you for a very long period of time and in many ways it colors what you do over time so I hope you enjoy this fifth and final installment of the lipid ology

[00:02:07] Advanced Course and the next week we'll be back to our regular scheduled programming where we're just doing you know one podcast a week so I hope you've enjoyed this and I hope you find these show notes very helpful I can't express how much work has got into it so without further delay here is the final episode with dr.

[00:02:25] Tom days this will be a nice way to dovetail niacin statins and pcsk9 inhibitors what lipoprotein have we not discussed today that would tie in a discussion of those three well the astute listener realizes it's our good friend LP little-a all right why do I bring this up so LP little a there are some people who still argue hey niacin makes sense because it lowers

[00:02:52] LP little a I'm gonna save everybody on this podcast the brain damage of listening to us discuss that for the next 20 minutes and just bypass us to the more interesting question which is why don't statins lower LP little-a well first of all we need a better understanding of LP little a clearance personally of the belief that it is the LDL receptor there is a plasminogen receptor that could clear some things and there are macrophage receptors that depending what else is going on might internalize some LP little-a and get rid of it that way but it's the LDL receptor that clears it yeah so let's pause for one second because I realize even though we've already done an entire podcast on what is LP little-a there's someone listening to this who hasn't heard it you'll go back and listen to it I'm sure I'm gonna do future podcasts where I interview the world's expert on the topic but Tom can you give in two minutes a description of what LP little-a is yeah it's an LDL like particle two which is it here and another April protein that shouldn't be there and it's called April protein little-a and you must pronounce it as little a that means small case rather than capital a lipoprotein capital a is

[00:04:04] April protein a one that's the main April protein on an HDL particle so if you tell me you've got lipoprotein a how do I know what are you talking about you got HL particles are you talking about little a which clearly identifies to me this potentially pathogenic atherogenic LDL particle so use the correct terminology with everything and Peter's got that nice podcasts on it our metrics of is that prison in you or not is most labs will run an LP little a mass which is the way in a deciliter of plasma of the weight of your into all your LDL particles everything that's in them their triglycerides their cholesterol ester their phospholipid protein that is carrying an a po lipo little the LDL density it's so but you're weighing everything you're not weigh April little a you're not measuring April little a per se yes that has a molecular weight but the molecular weight of a PO B is higher than the molecular weight of April little a but you're measuring that too when you do an

[00:05:11] LP little a mass but the molecular weight of a PO B is known because it's pretty much the same whereas the molecular weight of April little a is very very variable so that's another reason LP little a mass becomes a useless metric and how do I know how many cholesterol triglyceride phospholipid 10,000 other lipid moieties other proteins are on that particle I don't and you have heterogeneous mixtures of particles that would have variable amounts of all of those constituents so you can see there's gonna be a weakness to measuring LP little a mass now if it's really high you probably got too many LP little a particles but since there's almost no more debate that the best metric for our

[00:05:50] LDL particles is low-density lipoprotein particle number there's node to be among those who will truly understand that HDL particle number is your best match available metric on quantifying the number and that is a better metric than guessing that using HDL cholesterol or LDL cholesterol when you rather have a really nice finite count if LP little a particles are dangerous wouldn't you like to have a excellent accurate concentration in them well the only way you can do that nowadays

[00:06:21] NMR provides those other HDL and NMR cannot sa LP little a particles because NMR essays lipid content of particles not protein content so the only way I can give you an LP little a particle count is I have to separate all lipoproteins electro phoretic li na aw you'll see little bumps on the electrophoretogram vldls congregate here LDLs congregate here HCL's congregate there and what's that little bump that is in this person but it's not in that person oh that's helping little a because that's due to its surface charge where it migrates between the cathode and the anode and the gel let you separate them on so if I then take that LP little a hump and I immunostaining it with a antibody that binds to April B you've just have just counted the number of particles that are in the LP little a distribution range I theoretically should not call that an LP little a particle count I should call it

[00:07:20] LP little a a Probie that's too much of a mouthful it doesn't fit on a request form so of course it's abbreviated LP little a - P and to me the downside of that is most people think it's an NMR measurement which it absolutely is not basically if you want that metric and we've already announced I do work for true health diagnostics I was working with a different lab before that the lab that actually did the development of the

[00:07:47] LP little a april-b assay which true health absorbed and got proprietary rights - when he did it so that's it and believe it or not there are people who are gonna have this Gordon's would LP little a mass the weight of the whole kit and kaboodle versus the number of LDL particle counts in generally Carly but if you really want to know and also

[00:08:10] I find it useful those at least those of you who are doing LD LP by NMR you have your total LDL particle count but what does that really include it includes LDL that don't have a PO little a attached and it includes LDLs that do have a PO a attached now I throw a statin at you and we started to talk about this that statin is not gonna budge your LP little a particle count at all but the statins going to dramatically lower your LDL so don't have a PO little a attached to it so your LDL total particle will get down a little bit but part of that is your LP little a particle count but this shows you you are getting benefit when you give a statin to somebody with high yo gr you have to go after residual risk you know one of the best examples I saw of this was an unusual case where a guy had an

[00:09:04] LDL particle of 1600 ish Nana mole per liter but he had an LDL P little a of 600 and animal per liter so even though it's an apples and oranges assay directionally speaking he's got 600 LP little a particles an animal is an animal particles per liter and a thousand non-lp little a's but when you give him that statin you're really only targeting the thousand correct and so you'll be surprised at the lack of response you might see because you're not getting to target those things you'll still get your 30 40 but your total LDL P may still be hired and you wish it to be and unfortunately that is

[00:09:47] LP little a particles then you can get into the theoretical discussion right now that if I could get rid of them and basically the only way you can do that now is see maybe try niacin which is a weak lowering of the 20% or pcsk9 inhibitor which it would be an individual response range so if somebody could at least afford that drug you can't get it covered by a third party because they don't have that indication to help you manage LP little a patients so and that'll never come because could

[00:10:22] I ever prove to anybody that the pcsk9 inhibitor because it's lowering LP little a is reducing events no because they're going to turn around and say all its event reduction is there just getting rid of the remnants and the LDL particles has nothing to do with lowering and how would you argue against that we need a drug that only lowers april little a or LP little a and there's nothing to LDL particles and that drug is under investigation right now it's an April a synthesis inhibitor where your liver is going to stop making the vast quantities of April wait at these people who genetically inherit their propensity is courtesy Isis yeah so what infused with hold our breath button so until then are there people in the lipid ology world who would say Tom until then I'm gonna continue to use niacin because lowering it has to work I've been around too long this thing singing lowers this and lowers that and they don't work so I cook is nice and gonna have the same tux to see it I think it has an other people in LP little I don't know but if you want to use that because you want to make a patient happy cuz you're improving some metric be my yes I would not I know many lipid ologists who would not but there are ones and look Samsa

[00:11:32] Mekas is probably the world authority under Sam uses niacin in his practice too and I hope Peter has him on one they would have podcast he would tell you until we did our data on these other drugs I'll try and lower it a little bit if nothing else um he'll hash tea and I'm lowering April be a little bit too and I'm if I don't know if it matters but I'm raising whatever HDL metric but way although fibrates are probably our best available drug now to raise HDL particle count niacin which blows away fibrates on raising HDL cholesterol that's nothing to HDL particle counts I didn't mention that before cuz nice and makes this is about to say that could actually suggest it's worsening LDL HDL function yeah you're right so but the nice and people will convince you that the big hdls or protective it's laughable and the small age gels are harmful where's the VA has the opposite because the lipid poor

[00:12:29] HCL's are the ones ones they shoot so you know you're never gonna have definitive answers on any of that but yeah there's a lot of BS around so what's the best explanation for why a statin which causes the liver to up regulate LDL receptors does not lower LP little a whereas a pcsk9 inhibitor which also net results in more or a longer transiency of LDL receptors seems too low or LP little a even though that's not its primary objective and by the way the data shortly tells us now that the main determine of LP little a master LP little a particle concentrations a PO a production in the liver not clearance so until we can really inhibit production of a PO a who knows what you're doing but until then let's in here so how do

[00:13:15] LDL receptors clear these particles well earlier I think I mentioned that LDL receptor is looking for a bowi or a section of the a PO B that it can latch on to there's a very specific area on the a PO B protein on any of the april-b particles that because of surface charges will bind to a specific part of the LDL receptor that area on a pole B is called the LDL receptor binding domain so if here comes an LDL particle and that domain is sticking right out it'll stick right to any expressed LDL receptor but what if there's something camouflaging that a PO a are that LDL receptor binding domain on a probe a such as an interloper like Apryl protein little a I could see where that would slow the clearance of an LP little a particle because it's not gonna bind as rapidly and as vividly to an LDL receptor so most of these people have to wait too many LDL particles we express whatever LDL particles we want we try and express more with the stat and what are they gonna grab first the LDL particles that don't have April little a attached and only then would they maybe then start even grabbing April little a particles or so and do we all really have enough LDL receptors most of this variety reasons do not utter things the clearance to you know with the April c3 I talked about other proteins that may be affecting clearance to so they're just other factors at play but right now my guess is a po is affecting totally efficacious binding to an LP little egg particle its camouflaging the LDL receptor binding domain on April B and therefore I better learn how to inhibit synthesis of it so

[00:15:07] Sam will obviously hopefully we do get Sam on the show and we'll talk about this but that the this antisense oligonucleotide is basically going after the jugular issue which is you inhibits the synthesis of april little a yeah and hopefully you do that you know the million-dollar question has always been why do we even have april little a to begin with it never served some physiologic function or is it important in any other aspect of human life I guess we'll know it if we eliminate it and there's some bad outcomes in that trial and obviously it absolutely will be looked at for every safety aspect anybody can ever think of right now is there developing that drug so right now I don't think there's anything they're worried about say I'm what no more than I but yeah so if we can reduce statin I don't know that we can shut it down completely but he can dress of a lower April little a in LP little a-levels too so you know everybody thinks either habit you don't there's a lot of people who have what's considered a physiologic or a non-adversarial concentration of LP little a in your system so you don't have to make it go to zero you know where risk is concerned in fact the only people are ever going to study this drug is in people like you just meant you have an LP little a mass or particle count open at 600 range or something you're not gonna take people with borderline LP little a's and risk a clinical trial on them just like the first statin trials were done in sort of fh type people or so yeah they're enrolling for Phase three on that trial aren't they mm-hmm and is it secondary prevention or primary prevention I'm pretty sure it's secondary prevention yeah and remember there is some data in the apheresis world that if you pull out

[00:16:47] LP little high particles there is event they're not randomised binded trials because how did you do that with apheresis that a phoresis for the non for it's a dialysis where you're clearing your blood of you take the blood out you get rid of the LDL particles and you give the residual blood back so and for at least so a week or two they have less but there's so many other things you're clearing the regular LDLs all sorts of really jackal things all sorts of other hyperosmotic proteins and things that who knows what the why a phoresis really works yeah you know I don't want to get us too far off our main theme of lipid ology but because they're both quite recent let's just really really briefly talk about two other interesting drug trials which look at Lee different component of the a thorough Scott ik mechanism pathway which is it's the inflammatory pathway so there was an agonist to il-1 I believe or maybe was I it was it I want around yeah and then there was also a trial that looked at using low dose of methotrexate you still ongoing there was a some preliminary words that of that this is looking good but it's not been definitively but there is the theory to say reduce inflammation and you will certainly help vascular health in capacities maybe even I have nothing to do with lipids or so and so what's a great anti-inflammatory drug well we've been using low dose methotrexate in people with inflammatory disorders without a lot of toxicity for a long time rheumatoid arthritis etc etc colchicine very powerful anti-inflammatory gal come trial and they're going with that and I believe within the next year we're gonna have data on both of those trials so in the problem that this il-1 inhibitor that

[00:18:33] Peter talks Bell which has already published nice outcome data by inhibiting that but it's a thirty thousand dollar drug and there was downside to it because by seriously inhibiting the inflammatory system there was a slight increase in cancers and some people your immunological system has uses in the body so you better be careful how much you knock it out because of course and because of that downside it will never get an indication to for me and you to use it again if you are some multi billionaire it's already have been approved for certain type of conditions you could use it yeah no I think the bigger issue is really as more and more of these drugs become available hopefully it leads to a more and more personalized type of intervention where look if you got somebody who's walking around with a low C reactive protein and a low fibrinogen and their issue is elevated you know LDL P I don't see why you'd want to use an il one agonist on that or antagonist murder on that patient so yeah it comes down to basically stratification of what's the driver what again this comes back to this idea of necessary but not sufficient sufficient but not necessary neither necessary nor sufficient inflammation is necessary but not sufficient you do need an inflammatory response but you can have an inflammatory response and that by itself doesn't necessarily certain degree of inflammation is critical for you - yeah rid of certain pathologies or so so you you never want to stop the immunological system yeah look I believe like Peter does these are multifactorial diseases we've spent a lot of time on April ble about the other many other contributors that go into this so I believe the better we can evaluate using biomarkers the better we can identify many of the known existing pathologies I'm sure as many we don't fully understand yet and then perhaps we can better individualize our therapeutic suggestions to these people and know what we have to do both nutritionally and pharmacologically if that's necessary to normalize whatever you're trying to normalize yeah it's a complex world out there and you got to look at a lot of things so we've already discussed many biomarkers on the lipid front and we've alluded to some of the biomarkers on the inflammatory side c-reactive protein fibrinogen but what are some other biomarkers that you find helpful as far as understanding even more diffusely endothelial dysfunction or other markers of oxidized states that can give us more of an indication and say look you might have two people with the same degree of dis lipedema but one has a greater burden of oxidation going on than the other which would be presumably worse presumably yes and the problem is going to be when you even start expanding and I can throw some markers at you that you might want to measure that would tell you there's a pro oxidative state going on if your mission is to reduce effort from about events trials that show yeah if we improve this oxidative marker at oxidative matter people do better they've never ever been adjusted for april-b or LDL particle count so even though you may show some nice data on them if you really just normalize april-b and LDL particle counts would it even matter I mean and don't tell me what common sense suggests and look I'm all for it I use oxidative markers now mostly to try and convince people to do certain nutritional therapies rather than I got a wonderful drug you to reduce inflammation because right now I really don't I know if I lower

[00:22:04] April B I reduce inflammation so that's one perhaps that's your first therapeutic initiative lowering April B by nutrition or if the risk category is high enough a drug fine but if I could I measure something it tells me you have a pro oxidative state yeah and people do ox LDL levels in the blood but they have no idea what they're measuring remember an LDL part out truly oxidized LDL particle which is the only type that a macrophage in your arterial wall can internalize is oxidizing the wall of the artery and what is oxidized it's the phospholipids on their surface or maybe some free star rolls beatify toaster or cholesterol that oxidized surface lipids is what the scavenger receptor on a macrophage is gonna pull that particle into it and then you you start accumulating cholesterol and you have a sterile Laden Feltham cell bingo you got the disease so but can I measure oxidized LDL in the plasma no LDLs don't get oxidized into plasma there's too many natural antioxidants in plasma where they don't occur so what you can measure in plasma is what's called minimally oxidized alright there's a little bit of oxidation occurrence but it's not the phospholipids it's some of the structure of proteins on the april-b segments are being changed into aldehydes which is what the monoclonal antibody picks up it picks up aldehydes on April P but those out the Hyde's wouldn'ta formed if there wasn't a little bit of a pro oxidative state so when you're measuring ox LDL it's it's really April be a measure of LD April be oxidation but where is April be it's on remnants and on LDL particles so just understand what you're measuring but of all the LDL particles that are floating around if you get an abnormal ox you're looking at maybe 5% of the total particles now the you might make the case that when they do enter the artery wall forced them by the particle murder they're gonna be even further enhance so maybe they got a whole leg up on an onyx and I still do particle okay so I got would use that as a measure of a pro oxidative state and I try and give you whatever nutritional things I believe my fight oxidative states are so

[00:24:30] I'm not known that I got a drug including a supplement that insures me it can do that or not other than I would if I had to reach for supplement might be an omega-3 fatty acid but it's another story so that's what you're measuring with the oxy LDL I think you're better markers of Pro oxidative states and look a lot of oxidation is the granulocytes oxidizing a variety of tissues so myeloperoxidase is a granule eyes secretive Pro oxidative enzyme we can measure that easily in the blood that would be a signal of a pro oxidative state and I think the best of all is as fatty acids get oxidized derivatives form their shorter chain fatty accident and they're put in a big group called ISO prostates and you can easily assay something called f2 ISO prostates which have clearly been linked to Pro oxidative States now it's a urine test it's not a serum test but it's a small urine samples are non 24-hour urine so I like to do f2 ISO prostates so whatever you like to do be it oxy LDL be it Milo peroxidase or be it the f2

[00:25:42] ISO prostates I can use that as useful information and maybe even convince you that nutrition is important here and that is the best way to try and change them around or so so those are some of the pro oxidative mark what I would not use is that Pro oxidative biomarker that way too many people are is lipoprotein phospholipase a2 first of all the data is pretty poor most people don't even know the only thing the FDA has given that approval for is as a screening test in primary prevention never ever for anybody on a lipid modulating drug or on who has known coronary atherosclerosis for the simple reason at Mendelian randomization schon of the year level of LPP la2 activity or mass has nothing to do with how comes sort of like the HDL cholesterol story and even more important there have been two mega trials where pharmaceutical industry has developed LPP le2 inhibitors gave them to patients shut down LP PLA - activity drastically reduce LP PLA - mass levels plummeted no outcome reduction whatsoever and LP ple - is an enzyme made by the endothelium no it's made by macrophages it's a macro silo proxy the

[00:27:03] MPO data are equally unimpressive aren't they if you want to come down to depends what you're using it for a few I stopped using MPO like two years ago myself I do - yeah look oxy LDL I do it it's easy to do it yeah it's there and it's more linked to the process that I can see MPO I don't you could set some other vasculitis going on yeah my take on NPO is I found it to be unhelpful and I agree with you that LP PLA - it's one of those things you only really need to check once where I find it actually somewhat helpful in again I could be just deluding myself is you take the patient with an elevated LP little a who has an elevated LP PLA - and not only do you have a tongue twister but you also have a patient that might be a little higher risk and I wonder if I whispered that into Peter year over the users I would tend to agree with them so here's why

[00:27:55] LP PLA - which is an enzyme it does oxidize those phospholipids on an LDL when after that LDL enters the arterial wall is exposed to reactive oxygen species and some of the fatty acids on the phospholipids start oxidizing then LP PLA - activity kicks in and it Dias terrifies the fatty acids from the phospholipids so now you got oxidized phospholipids floating around and a byproduct called lie so lecithin lecithin which is a pretty Pro a thorough genic molecule so LP PLA - is involved with the production of them in the arterial wall that's not where we're measuring LP PLA - but hey if it's on the particle when it goes in the artery wall whose will whose arteries wall in today's nutritional environment doesn't have reactive oxygen species sitting there waiting to attack something so boy what particles enter your artery wall are gonna have the most LP pili to mass on it when that's where you're gonna turn on LP PLA to activity and by the way the new assays available everywhere they no longer measure the mass they measure the activity we were the last company who finally ran out of reagents so we're going through activity now so across the board the studies show either L PP le to mass or activity are identical in predicting risk if that's what you're using it for but believe it or not the activity I say is so much easier technically to do less costly that's what all labs are doing nowadays the activity so back to LDL PP le 2 jumps on LD open here's a little bit on HDL particles but most of it is on HDL particles but HCOS are a heterogeneous species of normal size big and small LDL particles you'll find way way more copies of LP PLA to on the smaller LDL and perhaps one of the reasons if people believe small LDLs are more athletic than larger sizes

[00:29:54] I don't know once they're in the artery wall which is driven pretty much by particle number but everybody with smaller leo's has probably got too many LDL particles so they're very prone to oxidation when they do go in the artery wall not that a big LDL can't be oxidized it could be but it would have less LP pla to on it but if i really wanted to know the number of copies of that ensign LP pla to where would I find it in the blood on LP little a particles that's where it's all carried so I think

[00:30:24] Peter hinted on it in his LP appeal a to podcasts that there's another attribute to LP little a other than quantifying it or weighing its mass and that's we do know there are people with high LP little-a who do not get it and they may be a minority but they're out there just like not everybody with FH is gonna have a heart attack some go through a life without it most get some events but many do not and these clearly are people without help hey who get heart attacks for other reasons so if you came to me with a very high LP little-a whatever do I just say life's over get your will in order I got no drugs that are can really help me with this and you can't afford a pcsk9 in every second experiment there may be the ones who are at most risk part of the functionality part of the atherogenic potential of an LP little a particle is one of the functions perhaps of April little a is it's a garbage truck that scavengers oxidize lipid moieties phospholipids sterols and it brings them back to wherever maybe its macrophages that clear them and detoxify them so it's a some sort of a little rescue truck garbage truck of clearing it but what happens if you got way too many LP little a particles too many LDL particles so some of them are going in your artery wall now you have an LP little a particle that's not only got a potentially pro atherogenic april little a protein on it but that from badhak if it is a prothrombotic protein there's plenty of evidence suggesting it is by the way with arterial not so much venous thrombosis many people have dismissed LP little a is being linked to venous thrombosis I don't know the source but if you talk to Shimon and he will tell you oh it's interesting I stand corrected because I think I was probably quoting some old data when I said that the VTE hazard ratio is about two yeah but it's just weak sort of data so when you talked to Sam talked to more about that so maybe it is maybe it is and part of the pathology maybe it's just trafficking these oxidized lipid moieties into your particle which is going to just stimulate this whole inflammatory mess that's going on your arterial wall and maybe it's a prothrombotic mess if that's a prothrombotic protein to the double whammy going in with it so and I think

[00:32:52] Peter covered it nicely in his discussion air there are these segments on April little a call kringles and there are a couple of kringles that have a arge essence of lysine an amino acid that is like flypaper for oxidized lipid moieties so they really bind to these lysine rich segments on April little a so if we could start measuring oxidized phenomenon and tying it into has written about this in his page and Sam has published a data showing that's who you worry about what LP little a if they have oxidized april-b phospholipids elevated Sam's got an acid and heap Sam will tell you that yes we're measuring it on April B particles but the April B particles that carry the vast majority of these oxidize are LP little a particles yeah it could be a remnant or

[00:33:46] Tori oddball LDL particle but mostly it's your help so that is again a double whammy so I think maybe in the future we're gonna be screening with whatever you want LP little a mass LP little a particle count I hopefully never LP little a cholesterol it's some like all cholesterol metric should be any only way you can assay there's a poor assay nowadays anyway is alright you do have excess LP little a whatever in your system let me now do this follow-up tests and if that's also up let's discuss everything we can possibly do until that miracle drug hopefully miracle drug comes along and we got a cure for you and maybe it'll be covered in those people because that'll be strong because like all these new anti sense drugs it's gonna come with a price yeah before we leave biomarkers anything you want to say about a symmetric or symmetric dimethyl arginine it's a very interesting biomarker rule so where we talked about endothelial function perhaps even some of the antioxidant function is this miracle molecule every endothelial cell makes extremely transiently makes an it's gone it's nitric oxide nitric oxide is a powerful regulatory molecule that regulates vascular reactivity but oxidation the thrombotic potential of an endothelial surface initiating a thrombus is highly dependent on nitric oxide so and when endothelial cells making like nitric which is by far the most important molecule they make and where does that come from arginine the amino acid arginine so arginine gets converted into nitric oxide so last thing I want is things that are gonna screw up arginine pools which is needed to make nitric oxide in to proteolytic molecules we know byproducts of basically catabolism of nuclear proteins is Sutton Quan is called symmetric and the other one is called asymmetric dimethyl arginine their isoforms of one another so if you you know they're mirror images of one another but there are actually different molecules one directly the other indirectly inhibits the synthesis of arginine so if I measured a DMA a synthesis of nitric oxide you me right yes yeah well ultimately synthase arginine which results in the synthesis of nitric oxide Oh see I always thought that s DMA inhibited the synthesis of arginine but a DMA inhibited nos directly I should correct what I said one inhibits the synthesis and the other enhances the catabolism of arginine so the end of the day you're gonna have less and less nitric oxide and they're both markers that we can easily measure so and if we measure them in their high you might presume hey maybe that's a blood test that actually tells us something about endothelial function I don't think we have another that has anything close to it a nice thing about the ad mas DMA is it it creates a a biologically plausible mechanistic explanation for why we see an association between high homocysteine and greater disease because homocysteine really inhibits the clearance of a DM NS team and that's very clear when you correct it which would therefore screw up nitric oxide production yes so it brings even oxidation into the process would disturb that process - so if Pro oxidative state if hyper homocysteine emia is adversarial to the vasculature that's one of the pathways in which it is so what can we do well we can measure it so who would I measure so if you came to me and you're on your third bypass or forced then I think it's pretty safe assumption you have screwed up into the allele function so I don't question is what do we do about it so one thing is look if they have impaired renal function hypertension you know those are things that you go after the homocysteine especially in the MTHFR mutation patients you give methylated B vitamins which is still controversial in sort of mainstream circles because even though it lowers homocysteine some will point to that and say well you have no outcome data on lowering homelesses that you have plenty of data that in people with hyper homocystinuria lowering homocysteine drastically improves their vascular outcome so it's plausible at a certain threshold that homocysteine that there's probably makes sense and if you really understood the pathway of catabolism imma firin and you'd understand is better and remember in that pathway is gonna be the production of a lot of neurotransmitters - so there's a lot going on if you have the genotype that's gonna screw up methylation or the enzyme is involved with that that's another story but perhaps the best use of a DMAs DMA is in the primary prevention setting where you got a little borderline april-b leop you're not gonna do lifestyle do I really want to throw you on a drug or something if those markers are up that tells me whatever is going on in you you have endothelial dysfunction so you're down the road towards the vascular pathology so it might be a marker to kick you in the rear to at least be super aggressive nutritionally even hey I'm sorry of whatever nutrition we tried you still have abnormal endothelial function it's time for us to hear I would rather improve these markers that will take a drug to get them to where I want them to be so maybe we can use it in that setting if you also want to tell it to me time you say hey if you've been through a bypass or a stent or something why do it but what if I have such a patient who I've maxed out on a statin ezetimibe I've done everything I else - homocysteine or insulin resistance and they're still up should I lower April be even further with a piece yes cuz home I mean you use it for what you want to use it phurba as a marker of endothelial function and very interesting of the two you get both and you also get an arginine level in the same assay an SDM a is cleared by your kidneys a DMA is catabolized in the cells so if kidney function as nothing to do with a DMA but SDM a one of the things that elevated is a renal disease and when SDM a goes unto serum it can back flux right into the cell and decrease in nitric oxide production probably part of the pathology and people really feel he's just about to say the thing I like about the ADM SDM a stuff even though we don't have all this great long-term data is it's one biochemical pathway that provides very clear evidence for two observations that are undeniable elevated homocysteine and renal function the SMA I'll not the ADM a but but you get both out of the but it's not like you're ordering selectively you order you get them all three and they're addressing both sides of that equation so it's a very interesting little biomarker there and hey who doesn't want another renal function test most are using creatinine that's kind of a poor you should be using so statin seizure an

[00:40:51] SDM a will be further enforcement that and mild degrees of renal impairment go ignored in this country and if you're even in the early Stevens stage to but certainly by stage three which could be a clearance of seventy or something or sixty people that gets ignored even though EGFR is being reported to people and that's a major-league risk factor that you ought to say you your vascular path you're at risk for vascular disease

[00:41:17] I gotta see what I can do to you therapeutically to lower your risk but it gets ignored and tell accrediting clearances 32 and you needs dialysis or something you know yeah this is one of those things I do talk about with a subset of my patients especially these young patients in their forties fifties who buy cysts on C and Korea and maybe even a touch of microbe you man you know their GFR is eighty and I say if you're forty and your GFR is eighty there's a problem if you want to live to be a hundred cuz I don't know where you're gonna be at 80 yeah and look if you got albumin you you're and you got serious vascular Pithom place maybe it's just your gum area listen you gotta you know kidney disease but you probably have some other vascular disease - so albumin is just a saying some analysis about something as big as a proteins escape or and you've got some membrane problems that are lining some either go merula sorrel blood vessels someplace the other ones are and it's interesting cuz Peter in his little world sees a lot of these people who are well trained athletes take care of themselves and some of them in Peter probably encouraged them to build up muscle mass and which can influence creatinine it makes it far less usable as a mark of renal so statin C's and has not influenced by muscle mass so that's where it picks up some of the imperfections the weight is just oh yeah and if you do both which is by the way if you read the American Kidney guidelines they've actually developed a nice equation where your clearance and we provide this at PhD and I don't know any other lab that does we give you a clearance based on creatinine we give you a clearance based on cystatin C and we give you the best clearance of all based on both of those parameters you segregate by is very different in african-americans so there's a lot more to those EGFR as if you haven't studied it lately there might be going on and if

[00:43:12] I'm gonna do a biomarker if there's no other restrictions and what that might be a third-party payer or somebody else I'd rather do the most informative biomarker and that would be the dual EGFR and maybe some ad and they are s DNA thrown in as a renal marker anyway and that SDM a ADM marker I really wish we could take you to just be five or six

[00:43:37] PowerPoint slides and you'd see these pathways and maybe I'll tweet them in the next week or so individually just attach them to the science and you'll really it's not a high highly mekinese stare you right in the face how they work and what they're doing now we touched on something earlier that i know you wanted to come back to you and I we were deliberately short on it but I'm trying to kind of think about how to land this plane here we you want to go back and talk a little bit about what a remnant is it gets so confusion about remnants there talked about like their one homogeneous and there is a first of all every known lipoprotein class including LP little a has remnants all a remnant is is a smaller part of its sister particle that's in the same density class so viola else come in multiple sizes you got the big ones which are only found in people with triglyceride abnormalities if you don't have a triglyceride disturbance you will never have a big vo the L particle you'll have medium-sized and very often just small LDLs but if you look at your LDLs there's a normal sized particle there's a big e LDLs and your small LDLs everybody has a heterogeneous mixture there's no human on the planet who has 100% exact diameter of every single sub fraction of a lipo per HDL is very widely in their density in their size and their diameters even ideals there's a certain diameter range or density range where here's the upper limits of what you would call an ideal and here's the lower limits of when do you not call it an ideal it's an LDL or when does a small

[00:45:11] VLDL I can't call it a small be LDL anymore it's called an ideal but wait a minute wouldn't an ideal be a remnant of a VLDL if that LDL has a vo the L or idea large in isn't an LDL a remnant of a ideal or maybe a vo DL chylomicrons as they lose their triglycerides and phospholipids they become smaller column microns chylomicron remnants which are for the most part if you're lucky cleared by April we reset there somewhere but there's chylomicron remnants floating around so what is the only particle I really care about a part and april-b particle i can wind up in your artery wall get oxidized and deliver the sterols and you can oxidize them and then you got plaque so what forces them in its particle number now I've also explained all right if that's it April B particle number LDL P is your first biomarker April B is simply an LDL P biomarker it's not counting V LDL particles because there are so few of them you're certainly not counting chylomicrons because they're even fewer of those so april b is identifying to you way too many LDL part in this person but there is absolutely no doubt even though you have way way more LDL particles than you do have VLDL particles because VLDL particles are two or three times bigger than LDL the volume of the spear is the third power of the radius they do carry more cholesterol molecules per particle than an individual LDL particle but of course you have so many more LDL particles and even VLDL or whatever you think of

[00:46:48] Veolia remnant is most of the cholesterol getting into your artery wall is still LDL delivered but I am not denying that v LDL particles cannot deliver cholesterol and get oxidized when they are into the artery wall they can so what has been the classic definition of a VLDL remnant well they've always said well do that conversion factor we talked divided triglycerides by five if that's high the

[00:47:13] V LDL cholesterol is high those are they have too many VLDL remnants and no doubt if we really had a VLDL remnant test that's true but it would not be true in other people so here aren't support means perhaps in a scimitar bread try to clarify what you're saying right and what because i think it's a bit confusing to the listener you can estimate v LDL cholesterol in two ways you can take triglyceride and divide by five and the higher the triglyceride level the less accurate that becomes you can take non HDL cholesterol and subtract LDL cholesterol from it and you'll get that you'll get an estimate as well those two don't often agree by the way but nevertheless you have two estimates but that still doesn't answer the question right which of those go on to become pathologic remnants so all you're identifying there is you have increased cholesterol content in VLDL particles and because the ones we fear the most are remnants we're just presuming oh boy there's got to be remnants here so whatever therapy you're thinking of doing in this person you better get rid of probably some remnant repeat oh well all of the fda-approved drugs that lower April beta but it's statin ezetimibe fibrates which are proof to lower LDL cholesterol even though they don't really do it that much peace okay nine clear all april-b particles including remnants so your ultimate solution now your first solution might be nutritional if it's not somebody coming off their bypass who is in the nightmare risk range classification where I think you need a lifestyle and pharmacology day one you just don't have too many decades have passed you shouldn't be putzing around on in real short time you know the nutritional therapy if I think you have remnants is gonna be I'm gonna address insulin resistance in you and so I'm being an advocate of some degree of carbohydrate restriction and certainly a clear advocate for a lot of reasons apart from even a PO Bay would be the fasting as part of your your dining and to so great if you want to use your V LDL cholesterol and it makes you think there's remnants or you're gonna suggest the therapy I would tell you if your total drug guided I out of a drug then that's the person you give a fiber 82 with your statin because that's where what the fibroids really do well but I can show you that as Edomite the statin clears as many remnants as that combination to but I think fibrates bring other things to the table that perhaps that II a dozen in people with triglyceride rich lipoproteins and why don't happen to kind of be so it's how I really think we're gonna have to identify remnants so just even ten there's a laboratory that produces they separate

[00:49:53] Veolia particles by ultra Senna fication the NMR people used to report total VLDL P but they would also give you large real do P plus medium VLDL people small VLDL P and we used to say well the small VLDL P those are the remnants that's the mark well they don't do that anymore they only give you the large VLDL - P anymore those anymore generating labs that have the proprietary ability to release vo the L particle data and that's not all in them said as a lipo science lab core there's no more lipo scientist lab course so you will get a large VLDL p and it has one reason and one reason alone it's a lipoprotein marker of an insulin resistance state that's it it's not a goal of therapy it's nothing there's no data at of what you do to vo the LP effects comes although I'd make the case that maybe it does but it's just an IR marker

[00:50:49] I can measure small dense LDL cholesterol HDL - cholesterol just small LDL particle concentration I can do an insulin level and ten other tests that tell me your insulin resistance oh I don't need any vol Markman they we're using that as part of their IR if you don't have that and they used a factor in VLDL size they're because the big triglyceride rich vldls or marker mints or resistance but if you're measuring insulin levels and other insulin biomarkers they're no better than that I don't know they're any better than just measuring small LDL particle concentration at least in a drug naive person so fine it is a mark of insulin resistance but this other lab the center fusion they tell you look at our smaller

[00:51:35] V LDL cholesterol those are remnants how do they know all they know is that person has extra cholesterol in your small V LDL particles but vldls depending on two things it's a pony content and it's a possi three content is going to be virtually instantly cleared so if your V small V LDL particles are being rapidly cleared by your a Poli April be 100 receptors in other words if you took a bunch of small

[00:52:05] V LDLs and some of them have lots of a Bowie and very little a possi three those aren't remnants they're not pathological or Knights vldls that's what they are but are they disease-causing VOD le ah look some of them probably getting button vers le o particle number so and also read and very few relative to a small VLDL that would be high in a potato see the main down there's a lot of downsides tape oc3 it's a pro-inflammatory protein it really enhances VLDL production in the liver but it just retards their clearance and it probably interferes with the hydrolysis induced by lipoprotein lipase so you're increasing half-life's of all triglyceride rich lipoproteins which let's see ETP exchange occur longer and what is CTP exchange doing bringing more cholesterol - your V LDL particles enhancing cholesterol enrichment they're those V alleles or losing triglycerides of up the other in cholesterol so these are all the pathologies that might go on if you have delayed clearance and c3 is going to delay to clearance through multiple reasons of these particles so I want a blood test that tells me the a possi thrown three content of your April B's

[00:53:21] LDLs that have April C 3 cannot be clear in one of the early provoked old trials the pravastatin trials the care trial they went back in a who would high triglycerides gets coronary events and this is Frank Sachs up in Boston and they've been able to measure this and sophisticated lipid labs for a long while if your LDL had seep a possi 3 on it pravastatin was a useless drug didn't reduce any events so it still reduced a

[00:53:49] PO B but it didn't reduce it it would clear some LDL particles it didn't reduce events and people at high triglycerides so so the APO c3 it's not measuring triglycerides that matters it's a Poe c3 and a lot of people with a tree might only have a triglyceride of 110-120 wait which trial was this a care trial of cholesterol and the cute there was a second secondary prevention trial

[00:54:15] Simba statin 4s was first and it was Swedes with super high LDL cholesterol and heart attacks this was done in Boston at the Brigham where they enrolled people with unremarkable at the time LDL cholesterol 130 or lower who had heart attacks and he gave him privacy and got this pretty much the same event reduction as they got in the 4s trial but the ones that had height rigs didn't have the reduction so they went back in a post hoc analysis and those who had height rigs private coal lowers triglycerides does it matter that's one of the benefits of trial pravastatin well well the only people that got event reduction where pravastatin lower triglycerides was those who had a possi 3 enriched LDL particles so sam's company also working on yep the in production is an anti sense molecule it's gonna stop a possi three production cuz you're Peter I believe you also know that you Mendelian think there is gain a function loss of function of a possi three is tied into longevity also actually I think this is of all the major longevity genes I do not believe and I could stand corrected but I'm in the process of writing for the book now I don't think there is a longevity gene on cardiovascular disease that is a stronger predictor of longevity than hypo functioning a possi 3 yeah so in very Incheon we just got tweeted about it I'm sure within the last week a very interesting trial that if you're going to use an omega-3 fatty acid when they compared DHA versus EPA

[00:55:52] DHA is the one that lowers April C 3 not EPA so all of these mega advocates of EPA I don't know if a possi trees involved there maybe you buy used to see myself as more of an EPA guy and then my focus on DHA I think became more something I saw in the mild cognitive impairment literature which was the importance of DHA in the brain but I didn't realize this a this DHA c3 so there look from my mind for years it's been omega-3s are not lipid drugs ignore them don't use them to putz around with lipids because you don't know what they're doing that's changed now clearly high dose prescription-strength epa can be a helpful adjunct of therapy to lower

[00:56:40] April B and whether it's what remnants or whatever it's doing it's lowering April be an additional 8 10 % great and it's a pretty innocuous therapy I always worried about those who might not be able to convert EPA to what I believe is necessary DHA also especially in the brain so uh but I can measure that in the plasma you know I've been thinking about I'd like to have Bill Harris on the show as well to have a discussion about this because at least at the time of our recording today I would say that the mainstream view of EPA and DHA is that they're useless right that's the press yeah the mainstream view is abandon all of these dumb sort of supplements but as is often the case when the mainstream says something in a declarative fashion they're usually in a nutri ya know where they're looking about what you're eating not taking pharmacologically where you might have a real India they're confused by supplements versus normal collage most of the trials that they would quote is

[00:57:37] Omegas being useless they're using some miniscule not a pharmacologic dose of these things and they're not measuring even who's deficient in omegas and if you're not deficient in it why would I even give you an omega-3 from here so and measuring fatty acids in the blood I would encourage you to measure red blood cell omega-3s that are like a glycohemoglobin have a 13 or a 60 90 day half-life rather than a plasma free fatty acid or may which might be what did you eat for lunch and also there's other intricacies involved but nonetheless they're just all things to think about there so in this DHA would a post c3 is kind of interesting now look some people if you're just gonna drown them in EPA do convert it to DHA so it's not an issue you but we can measure that and I think we'd know oh boy and you you got to have some of that either eaten or supplemented you know are you pushing patients towards closer to 10 percent red blood cell epa DHA level these days or are you well i don't see patients anymore but if you want to ask me yeah that would probably you know there's no you know Bill Harris would tell you when i make a 14% but we don't have any data that would show hey that's harmful but we don't have any data show and you can even make it that high yourself not even epistaxis and things like that easy so far anything that they've never turned anything from an omega-3 into coagulation disturbance compose had a bloody nose one day on and what else they're eating epa and DHA all day long so i don't know that would have to be tested trial i just have to take issue with that as a canadian I think we refer to them as Inuit now

[00:59:25] [Music] you're right I know I talked about but I really do need to get bill on the show because he's always Bill's one of these guys who is and again may the listeners won't know who Bill Harris is but I hope to change that just this is a guy who is as devoted to understanding the entire body of literature and science of omega fatty acids especially omegas learn to lipid way more than me and he was a colleague I worked for three or four years with I love the guy we lunch long time ago al we so he has taught me so much and he is the guy who developed the red blood cell phospholipid fatty acid assay so he knows what he's talking about and it's gets so intriguing because even for those of you listening who may be taken in omega-3 or prescribing an omega-3 be it a supplement or be it a prescription product what vehicle is that oh it's just is it are you prescribing a free omega-3 fatty acid you're not there is an fda-approved product that the company development is not brought to market yeah so you're either prescribing esterified omega-3 fatty acids or it's a

[01:00:39] Storify to something else or it's esterified to glycerol as a phospholipid or it's a star fight to a glycerol backbone where it has three fatty acids they're only one of those in omega-3 or are you buying a super enriched that all three fatty acids are starfighter omega-3 you wouldn't need very small and so what is the vehicle in your favorite supplement that's carrying do you know all of that comes into the pharmacodynamics realize like I don't actually know the egg because there's only two supplements over the counter that I fancy one is Carlson's the other is Nordic Naturals just based on some of the toxicology stuff but I don't know the answer to the question is does he get that information unless your brother works there and is privileged that I think the companies wouldn't even tell you what they esterified and look you hear about these krill products they're phospholipids and that means there's one fatty acid on them so you got to prescribe a lot of krill pills to achieve a certain omega-3 way less than you would if you had a Dyess terrified or God and luckily enough a triose terrified triglyceride my vehicle

[01:01:46] I'm honest I'm always happiest evaluations just eat enough Sam yeah so listen at the end of the day that's all cold it's good to know but at the end of the day whatever way they're somehow getting omega threes into your body if you're normalizing the omega-3 index does that even matter all that other stuff so it all depends but I would implore you to follow up please yeah I I want to dig into this a little bit because it never occurred I gotta be honest with you I'm ashamed to admit this because I hate being the guy who makes dumb assumptions and is too lazy to follow up I've always assumed that the high-quality epa DHA supplements were try a solace right almost none of them are there mostly mono glycerols but it's glycerol with two other fatty acids plus one omega-3 fatty acid and what are those other fatty acids if nothing else their calories that you may or may not need or their a harmful fatty acid and there's no pharma grade DHA do you know okay but here's what there is and it's already FDA approved but the company that developed the product is not brought to market but I think they're going to because this November at the

[01:02:58] American Heart Association you are gonna get the people at risk who are on statins and half of them are getting statins plus EPA and the other half are getting statins plus EPA placebo no EPA and we're gonna get outcome windows of EPA its Hyde it's three four four years it's the prescription strength so are we gonna see cardiovascular all indications and we're all optimist are it's gonna be a positive trial they haven't stopped it at least for futility they certainly haven't stopped it for toxicity the trial is over they're generating the data now wouldn't they have just stopped the fertility and gone away if it didn't work so we're all expecting that it's

[01:03:40] EPA attitude a sentence gonna work why wouldn't it it's a it's an EPA it probably has other physiologic attributes can reduce certain inflammatory markers hey and it's a nice April bead additional lower now the company that has developed free omega-3 fatty acids so they're not as terrified to anything that means they're very bioavailable you just swallow it remember any time you swallow in ass terrified omega-3 fatty acid you have to secrete pancreatic enzymes that the esterified because it can't be absorbed without that even phospholipids krill oil has to be dias terrified by a life specific alight pace coming free fatty acid is a fatty acids you should come right in but we don't eat oh you know you might in certain foods but even most of the food you eat its triglycerides that are don't free fatty acids taste horrible maybe that's why they're not there or I think most of the time they're stored as energy and is not free fatty acids and sort of got to be d aster fighting it but anyway this company that has them why didn't they cuz this is a company that manufactures a statin and what they were hoping was they thought that people making EPA the

[01:05:00] FDA was going to give them an indication based solely on additional LDL cholesterol Lauren or April be lowering that will let you come on the market pending your outcome data because non HDL is better whatever the FDA didn't FDA even told me couldn't do it the company which is a mer and actually took the FDA to court in the Supreme Court says no even though you don't have an approval for you can at least go share dust with doctors and that Ameren EPA product the CEPA has skyrocketed in sales cuz doctors believe this hey additional data with the vicita so the company that and so you would add the

[01:05:42] CEPA to your favorite statin of choice Indonesia they make they don't make a stand they make EPA so they want you to add the seat but to whatever statin you oh I thought they also made a stat no they don't so you can pick your favorite statin but now you have a like a Zetas body right a twist and you can now add vicita if if your edited space you're gonna find

[01:06:03] I'm gonna wait I'm gonna wait till November oh I would kill ya and not that I wouldn't be using EPA DHA for perhaps other reasons or a cognitive or whatever just cell membrane health but the other company that makes a statin called Razoo the statin the pretty and that would be called AstraZeneca is the one that owns this so what they were clearly hoping ahead Ameren got an indication tattooist and they would have released a combo product called Razoo the statin their EP a product or so and you would have in one pill your statin plus your proper dose of omega threes and they would be free omega-3 fatty acids which would zoom right into your body I got a feeling if and by the way they are completing their own big outcome trial with reserve a statin plus the non-esterified free fatty acids so they'll wait for their trial to but if this first trial works why would there's not even work better cuz it's combining it with the most potent statin so all these people who've been bad-mouthing if Omega 3 is with no trial that it may have to change at least some of that talk come November at the American Heart Association it's the biggest trial gonna come out of a tha this year listen lipid world so pay strict attention will a month or so before normally they don't leak out that data because that somehow prohibits publication and prestigious journals but some companies do cuz it just means so much financially to them that it'll get published somewhere so I don't know one way or another we're gonna have it in

[01:07:44] November now we've danced around this idea of red blood cells for a while they keep coming up so let me redirect us to another topic which is you've already said red blood cells per molecule carry many many more molecules of cholesterol than any lipoprotein does why don't red blood cells cause atherosclerosis because they're not invading your arterial wall and not subject to oxidative forces where macrophage is going to ingest the red blood cell do they not invade the artery wall because they can't penetrate the sub endothelial Janek now listen can a red blood cell get into plaque yeah through the Vaes of a Sorum so could there be something there that her to the face of us or meaning from the other side remember artery walls get the arterial supply they need oxygen even plaque has little capillaries and stuff so are there red blood cells in expanding plaques sure so not to say they are not a tiny little part but that's not your primary delivery of oxidized phospholipids and sterols into the artery wall red blood cells are not being entering the artery wall and being oxidized you know like the VA PO be particles are yeah so this kind of gets back to sort of the causality issue of low-density although also red blood cells carry way more cholesterol molecules you have gazillions more april-b particles than you have red blood cells also so yes quantity wise they're carrying a lot of cholesterol but not red blood cell number one is for sale deal so the size of the LDL particle obviously is what enables it to easily get into and number in size but as you know I've told you this a long time ago any V LDL or under 70 nanometers can work its way into an endothelial gap or an arterial wall through a scavenger receptor whatever so not to say remnants aren't a third yet they can't get in because remnants are way bigger than an

[01:09:41] L do know they could but there's just more the LDL particle so if this is a diffusion gradient for City and then there's a hell of a lot more LDL troublemakers than there are remnant rubble makers not to say some big tough guy is in a big troublemaker by himself he is but he's which would you rather have a thousand guys coming at your one guy I take my odds that I could beat one guy rather than a thousand guys you know yeah yeah you know I figure it's hard to believe we've been going at this for almost seven hours and I feel like there's at least another hour or two we could go but at the same time I want to be sensitive for the listener normally I say I want to be sensitive to the guest but I know you and I'm talking about this and we're gonna go have dinner at Jamie

[01:10:28] Underberg tonight and just continue this discussion I wish I had a microphone for dinner because I have a feeling that's gonna be equally interesting one of the things you talked about at the very outset was a really close friend of yours who got you into hockey took you to your first game at Madison Square

[01:10:43] Garden got you hooked you were both obsessed with being firefighters he went on to become a firefighter you went on to become a lipid educator yeah so let me just pick up that my absolute you know if you look back in life who are some of your absolute best friends your high school buddies who you really spend all that enjoyable the type of enjoyment you can have at that age that you never can have at another age and you can do things and especially when we grew up and we were in high school 59 or 63 you could get away with a lot of junk and I would say he's worth today we were expelled real quickly or so with some of the shenanigans we do so and look hey I joked with Peter when I was telling the story I think he really wanted to be my best friend cause my father was a fire chief in the town of Paterson New Jersey where we went to high school but even if that was true I loved firefighting what do I care if he loved firefighters we used to get on our bikes and write the fires all the time together and I'll watch fires and stuff or drive the fire houses so we were really tight for a million reasons and we just got a long personality was but he is the guy who invited me to my first ice hockey guy which was certainly impacted my life and my son's life in mega ways my son's a very successful guy and we thought you would never be half as successful had he not played ice hockey and developed the teamwork in the camaraderie speaking of a fire engine perfect timing a fire truck going down but I'm gonna just keep talking about this fire truck is not high lipid science so my buddy there he went and became and I knew him all my life and I went and became a doctor but right now in that same city or in a suburb of that city so it's not like he didn't know where to find me but at a certain point earlier life I knew my buddy a ER doctor no I got the this cholesterol problem they tell me my cholesterol is up in the blood in you know I was probably at the point where we were really taking cholesterol serious and we could do something about it there all you got to come and see me come on you know and I was probably even in the days before I was just so lead walling on lipoprotein ology and lipid ology but I was very aggressive with understanding cholesterol knowing look who I evolve Din to so it would have probably been a smart choice for him to come up it's not like I was gonna charge him and he couldn't afford me he's a fireman in a big city he had the good of health insurances you could ever get so it's not like it would have cost them ten cents a lot of firemen did pick me as their doctor because of who my father was and they knew he was a guy who likes fire engines we used to see him as a kid in the firehouse I want him to be my doctor he knows what I do Earl just as one of these people who thought the father I stay away from doctors the better I don't want to hear what they got to tell me I don't want to be on a medicine I don't want to do anything and

[01:13:37] Earl got buried in his mid 50s with a sudden acute myocardial infarction sitting at home watching TV he could have been climbing a ladder out of fire by the way if he did die to fire his name would be on the memorial monument up in that city but he died at home the next day so not that I want his name honor I really wish it was because he's just such a that but there is such a needless death and I think across

[01:14:04] America all the time there are many young age needless deaths occurring with a very preventable treatable disease that's being ignored totally because they don't go and get a check or they're getting bad advice based on the wrong metrics so my buddy there is the perfect example but what a tragedy cuz had he made the right I like this guy he's my best buddy he's not gonna screw me or do anything wrong let me go to him he didn't every time I saw I did remind him come up come up please come up yeah yeah

[01:14:40] Tom never did well in many ways that's a reasonable and sad way to kind of end this discussion but it also brings it kind of back to why we why do we get so animated about this well I think as you said we think of this as you know one of the big three diseases that kills most people in the civilized world once they get out of childhood and by civilized I really mean develop that people know what I mean but of the big three diseases this is the one where I think we know the most about it and therefore by extension it's probably the one that's most delay Abell never want to say preventable right we use that term but in reality what does that mean it means delay and and so if

[01:15:17] Earl died in his early 50s maybe with the right care he could have died in his late 60s you know again if a guy's dying in his 50s of heart disease he's probably got really bad disease a therapy in a real yeah but he could have hung around for a while and he's got grandkids and children and stuff who really wish he was still here - fart upon me was a beloved farm and they all wish he was still intact he'd be retired by now but he's just one of these people like God sends to earth that do nothing but good while they've been here through their whole life he had Saints as parents and he was so tragic that he left us it's at such a young age and got driven to the graveyard on the back of a firetruck with a flag on a Vietnam veteran and so but just so so sad and listen I want to wrap this up myself and

[01:16:08] I used to wrap up a lot of lectures I did with this and yeah you know cuz ie my lectures were all high science no matter what group I was speaking to so I always warned that so you ought to come out of this lecture that I gave him maybe with all the things if you really sat through everything we talked about today to say guy's an idiot or he's on to something and I thought I understood this topic but maybe I need to understand it at a higher level so everything is a study study study I didn't learn this stuff overnight my life has been in this field yeah well

[01:16:45] I'll say I'll say a couple things I'll say a couple things on that so first of all I obviously want to thank you for the influence you've had in me and and I I don't know I just feel really lucky I think that I got plugged into you and Alan and Ron just out of the gate who have met the three of you so early and my interest in this

[01:17:03] EPIK saved me so much time because it's one thing I mean no one can substitute the amount of time you have to spend obsessing over this topic and learning it but boy when you can have that curriculum curated for you you shortcut it by you know 3x I'm sure it's a gift and I'll just extrapolate on that cause

[01:17:21] Peter named three guys he can get in contact with pretty quickly and get answers as I evolved in this world I had 20 guys around the world who liked me a lot because of water the way I explained things what I could illustrate for them so I'd been blessed by I've mentioned a few today it would take me another 15 minutes to list them all but so many of the that I call them the lipid gods out there the people who have spent their real life in research laboratories and clinical trials and taking care of people in the worst will innit call up at clinics see and they still are available to me but that's who I use I don't go on the internet and read son or make stuff up I try and ask experts about a lot of things not that you'll ever get consensus on anything but those of us who do have those avenues open which many do not but they're not afraid to still pontificate about something that's kind of sad yeah and I can't remember if I made this this will be my final point on the topic and I came over if I made this point on a previous podcast or not and if I did to the listener I apologize you know I started out in mathematics and engineering and really love those things I excelled at those things took great pleasure in being a first principles thinker so one silly story at the end of my freshman course in sort of dynamics kinematics like sort of

[01:18:45] Newtonian physics you take a final exam and you are allowed one piece of eight-by-ten paper that you can write on both sides as much as you want whatever formula you want because you know there were just so many equations you would have to know to go in and an ace one of these exams now I was cocky be on words and I was really lucky as a freshman I used to study in this dark part of the stacks where I met a real upperclassmen guy his first name was JP I don't remember his last name but I'll never forget him he was the only guy I'd ever met who decided to take two engineering disciplines and finish them both in four years so he did electrical and mechanical engineering in four years the price he had to pay for that was he studied every minute of every day but he also told me he didn't have the opportunity to learn everything because you couldn't if he wanted to take all of electrical and mechanical in four years you had to accept that there were certain things you couldn't know so he all of his study focused around first principles inference and he taught me this early and so he saw me studying for one of my exams and I was writing out something called the Coriolis equation which basically explains centrifugal forces under the condition of a changing radius and he said you don't need to memorize that formula you know how to derive it and I was like why were you talking about he goes write out the formula for angular position and take the derivatives of it you know you know calculus so I did and sure enough I was getting the same formulas to make a long story short I go I I've become so delete otally inundated by JP's reasoning I go into my final exam and oh you have to turn in your cheat sheet at the end of the exam and I this is again just I'm not saying is to brag about how cocky I was but so I just have to stay but the point is I wanted to show the professor how well I understood this material the only thing I wrote on my cheat sheet in big block letters was the sum of the forces equals mass times acceleration because I was like if you know the simplest of Newton's laws you can actually derive everything at this level of physics we're not talking quantum physics at this point and and he and I were JP said look on every question write it out show them how you can go from one to the other because if you make a mistake at least they'll see what you're doing I ended up acing the exam and that lesson sort of stuck with me and it served me very well through the rest of engineering and mathematics including when it got really really complicated that in the end if you truly wanted to understand something at first principles you could derive so much okay fast forward a few years now I find myself in medical school now I was not a pre-med so I'm in medical school not as a pre-med but as a former and near math guy who barely squeaked in to medical school meaning I took the MCAT having not even taken a course in biology yet I had to take my bio class after and I'll tell you that first semester of med school was brutal for me because I learned the hard way that you couldn't first principles your way through biology at least not at the level at least not until you gained a certain amount of familiarity with the basics I couldn't walk into my histology class look under the microscope and on first principles know the difference between the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum you just have to know that stuff I couldn't go into anatomy and physiology and pathology and just first principles my way into stuff eventually you can but you have to have an enormous basis so I sort of forgot all about that pain you know you get through medical school and by the end it became you know was very enjoyable but it wasn't until I got to the lab to NIH where my mentor told me a great story now he's probably one of the most brilliant scientists have ever known and did a PhD in biophysics specifically for the purpose of wanting to make sure he was never in his words intimidated by a differential equation despite the fact that he was an immunologist and he told me a story which I need to get the details of it cuz I don't remember the physicist he's referring to but he told me the story of a physicist turned biologist who lamented once that the moment he switched from physics to biology he could never again take a bath in peace because as a physicist he could sit in the bath and wax philosophically and think about lots of things on first principles and be very theoretical in his understanding but as a biologist sitting in the bath he always realized there was a one more fact he needed to remember before he could draw a conclusion and so he had to keep getting out of the bathtub to go and look up a certain fact and that obviously disrupted the beauty of taking the bath and I think that long rambling story is a way of saying the following

[01:23:27] I find this subject matter to be as complicated as any I have ever tried to learn and unfortunately every time I have a brilliant idea just based on first principles I still have to go and check if it's grounded in the foundation of science and time's it is but many times it is not I come up with an idea and I'm like this has got to be right but rule oh they're physiologically impossible and there's even an experiment that one day suggested this or it's you know I made an assumption but I can clearly see that it was not the case so I understand your frustration and I share it and I think unfortunately that is the nature of biology yep and I remain an eternal optimist I continue to teach lipids I think clinicians know a bit more than we knew in 1995 when I started this journey teaching and so that's all if I have to do one at a time with people I try and teach them what I know and hopefully you'll do your continuing education and that's one of the nice things about medicine yeah but you got to do it none of this comes easy yeah it does and there's a lot of complexities in medicine nowadays we're talking because it's a highly pathologic state a leading cause of trouble but there's so many other things to boy take to the much higher level nowadays you know well Tom people I think will certainly by the end of this know where to find you but on

[01:24:53] Twitter which is where you spend the most your time you're at doctor lipid corrects me yeah and this'll I mean we're generally in our brief existence as a podcast already known for probably producing the most thorough show notes ever I'm suspecting that this this episode which will probably break into several parts will have the most robust show notes that we've done and I love by the way that there's another fire truck going down it's appropriate but also if there's anything else that you think of let's just talk about it we're you know offline even we can just get to it where there other resources you think people ought to go to again I will steer people away from your 2002-2004 writings but I think there's gonna be a number of people who listen to this who say you know what look I might have missed half of what those guys talked about but there's something there I want to make sure I understand better because in the end yeah every doctor wants to do the best by their patient I mean that's just

[01:25:48] I believe that wholeheartedly I I get very frustrated when I hear people say that doctors are in the pockets of pharma companies and they are just in it for them I mean that's sure there's going to be some of those people but I haven't met those guys you know the doctors that I meet the men and women I meet who take care of patients they all want to do the best by their patients and I think that those are people who are gonna want to invest a little bit of their time in understanding this problem a little better no I can't say it anymore nadan as you listen to seven and a half hours even hopefully piecemeal marker clearly for who depending on the list there's gonna be things over your head even if you are a super skilled lip pathologist there's gonna be some things you said what let me you read about that or so but it's just trying to open your mind and understand there's a lot going on here the field is infinitely more complex than you ever imagined it took me a long and I'ma as Mike Davison calls me Tom's a self-taught lipid ologist mean I didn't spend two years down at the National Heart Lung and Blood

[01:26:48] Institute even though the director of that NHLBI Allen or Molly and I just authored a seventy page chapter in the teach book of molecular and clinical biochemistry all about lipids and Apryl proteins so I think to be an invited author with a preprint of that that's a remark I mean it's an expensive book I don't expect you if you're not a lipid ologists or somebody seriously into this clinician that's what you go out and buy but there is a lot of information out there though so it and just be careful on what you that's ridiculous or my cockamamie theory based in no clinical trials or Sciences what I believe fine believe it you know this is America here

[01:27:34] I can't lock you up I'm not the lipid police Tom thank you very much it's hard to believe this has been seven hours of discussion today but it's been worth every minute to me and I've learned a lot in this discussion so that's to me that's always a I mean for selfish reasons that's sort of my my primary objective is to learn as much as I can and then along the way if others can learn too that's a bonus and without a year of my intermittent fasting in program from Peter Kay I could have never had the energy to see even to use my tongue for brain so thank you again Peter yeah my pleasure Tom
