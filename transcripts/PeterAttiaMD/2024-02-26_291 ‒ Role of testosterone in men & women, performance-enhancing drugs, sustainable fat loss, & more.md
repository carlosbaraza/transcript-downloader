## Transcript

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter [Music] AA Derek good to see you again thanks for having me again Peter I appreciate it yeah so last time we spoke we covered a lot of ground and yet somehow at the end of it we felt like there was still a lot to talk about so uh hence we're back um and I'm going to do something unusual which is I'm just going to tell you hey what do you want to talk about as opposed to um driving down my agenda I have a bunch of things that I want to talk about but curious as to where you think we should pick things up um yeah I think that a lot of stuff we covered at a surface level and maybe there might be some unanswered questions or ambiguity on some specifics when it comes to you know am I a good candidate for hormone replacement how would I assess that you know should I be worried before I get on it what kind of thing should I look for um I feel like kind of getting clear on that might be worthwhile cuz a lot of people are kind of in that boat where they don't know who to trust they don't know who to listen to and I know even yourself you're kind of like teetering on the thought of maybe exploring it so

[00:01:09] I feel like even seeing what your thought process is going into evaluating is it viable for you would be super valuable yeah so um let's maybe back up a little bit and give folks a quick primer on the topic right so um let's just start by just talking about testosterone um I don't know if it's just that I'm more attentive to it or there's truly been an increase in marketing efforts but it really seems like the last decade um and and presumably it's also just the explosion of social media and more channels through which this information comes at you um but but clearly there's been a lot more attention uh brought brought forth to this idea um and it's very interesting because there's historically been kind of a a negative connotation associated with testosterone natural hormone we can talk all about that um but of course its role in drugs uh as a drug of abuse in in sports um has has sort of tarnished it in a way that we don't see on the female side right so when we talk about hormone replacement for women with estrogen and progesterone that doesn't come with the same performance enhancing benefits which is odd how like it's viewed as such a taboo thing even though at the end of the day it is just a natural hormone that produce right and so it's interesting of course that estrogen and progesterone are not scheduled uh drugs they're not they're not they're hormones that are you know you prescribe them without any limitation they're unscheduled by the

[00:02:40] FDA the DEA um conversely testosterone is scheduled and much more highly regulated and again the suggestion here is that there's potential for abuse that we presumably don't see with estrogen and progesterone and and you know that's neither here nor there it just is what it is um so so maybe let's just talk really briefly about testosterone

[00:03:02] Androgen receptors how they work the role of DHT and what what this does for muscle protein synthesis maybe just a kind of quick background on that yeah so in general most people are aware of testosterone as the primary masculine hormone but in reality it's produced in significant quantities in both genders just proportionally more so in men to the magnitude of 10x that of females I believe um and also both men and women produce estrad and DHT as well they just have differing proportions and binding proteins and whatnot but at the end of the day the action in the body is the exact same it still binds to the

[00:03:42] Androgen receptor and uh induces gene expression and causes muscle protein synthesis and other anabolic actions in bone psychoactive effects in the brain um Etc and just the magnitude to which it happens differs between texes and it also is what essentially determines how you sexually mature and differentiate as you enter adolescence so you could realistically manually manipulate it too and you see this in sport you know doping scenarios bodybuilding males versus female like you see it all the time so ultimately this is the primary

[00:04:18] Androgen that dictates muscle growth and anabolic activity in tissues and the metabolites of It kind of regulate a bunch of other things in the body which we could get into too but to keep it like high level simple it is the main primary Androgen that men and women alike rely on just that differing amounts and I think we talked I can't remember if you and I talked about it on our previous podcast I know it's been discussed on the podcast so I won't we we'll link to it in the show notes where

[00:04:46] I go into great detail mechanistically about what happens when testosterone binds to the Androgen receptor and how that gets into the nucleus and how that impacts um Gene translation or transcription into translation for protein um what's interesting of course is that you did mention DHT DHT has a significantly higher affinity for the endogen receptor um anything else you want to say about the role of DHT versus testosterone in then we can just talk about it in one gender we don't have to necessarily break it down sure yeah so the spectrum of just what I I said

[00:05:22] Androgen I didn't really elaborate what that even means it's kind of like as far as I know the definition is to essentially to be male or to make male or something related to masculine characteristics ultimately is kind of what you derive from andrens and the further on this spectrum of androgenicity it goes the more masculine and viralized potentially in women it could be so DHT is that hormone essentially that drives this Pathway to the extreme and is what is responsible alongside testosterone for like maximal sexual differentiation maturation in adolescence like I mentioned but you know you see mutations in the gene that encodes for five Alpha reductase which is the enzyme that makes DHT and you'll note that certain um pseudo hermaphrodites who don't have DHT will end up you know lesser developed in the masculine Spectrum than a normal functioning human with full DHT production so this is just kind of like an example of the spectrum of on one side you have males producing 10x testosterone and more DHT subsequent to that and then females much more estrogen proportionally to males well somewhat depending on you know where they're at in their cycle and whatnot and then 10x lower the testosterone and also much less DHT and this ratio of androgens to estrogen essentially is what dictates are you going to you know have male characteristics or female characteristics and how much are those characteristics going to get exaggerated cuz even if you're a full grown female if you exposed yourself manually to these hormones you could very much push yourself in that direction so DHT a lot of people know people know about it for its responsibility and like what it does for hair loss and some like the common side effects associated with it but it is an important hormone that does regulate how masculine you become as you grow up so I think that's the best way to put it yeah and and there's a critical window of exposure too so embryologically obviously exposure to testosterone and DHT have an enormous impact on sexual differentiation um later in life I mean I give you an example I I um have a patient female patient who's on testosterone and um she accidentally for a period of about a month just didn't read the directions uh correctly and was taking 10x the dose and that's not that hard to mess up when very easy to do yeah this is not like U this is this is something you have to be very careful with um because the doses are so so small there's no FDA approved women's testosterone as well right you could have it compounded in theory at a lower concentration but regardless she she for about a month ended up taking 10x the dose which means she was taking a male physiologic dose of testosterone what was her total test you know we didn't even B the symptoms immediately said there's something going wrong here um but you know the symptom the first symptom interesting that she noted um you know I would have expected hair growth to be the biggest issue uh but it was clitoral enlargement within just a period of a month yeah um the good news is completely reversible once the dose was restored to the tenth that it should have been um but do I I don't know anything about really I don't really follow bodybuilding closely enough but I assume that female bodybuilders are routinely using doses of that nature yeah they are depending on their guidance somewhat or very aware of the masculinizing potential of what they're using and some will avoid testosterone entirely because of that because it is essentially equal anabolic as it is androgenic so it begs the question why would you be using testosterone as a female if you're trying to achieve super physiologic muscle growth you kind of know in order to push it to that extent you're probably going to end up in male characteristic territory um so often times they will defer to compounds like oxandrolone which is anavar they'll use things like primobolan sometimes um matalone and so meaning much more anabolic much less androgenic yeah so these are synthetic compounds that have been manipulated to be more tissue selective as in more anabolic activity relative to the male viralize component unfortunately you can't segregate the two entirely but they do what they can and the best thing they can do is keep an eye on the side effects as they manifest in very very real time keeping a close eye on it I know some women who even have a uh like a deciel voice recorder and they will monitor if their like tone is getting lower or not in real time cuz in is that potentially an irreversible um change if voice is changing yeah so you have to be super careful especially even in trt if you were going to do trt as a female a lot of the clinics nowadays will advertise and Market testosterone in a way that is highlighting how great it is for libido quality of life you know uh I don't know glucose management muscle growth like there's a lot of things that sound attractive about it that are an easy cell to a female who you know May be asexual in like per menopause or something and I've seen standards being promoted as cookie cutter everyone should have a 200 nanogram per test lader total test wow which is crazy very high yeah so my mom and the actually got on hormone replacement a few years back and I at the time wasn't overseeing you know didn't really check what she was doing exactly I just kind of trusted that the guy who was prescribing he was was very experienced and credential and seemed like somebody who I would go to myself to ask for a verification is this like a protocol that makes sense and within just a couple of weeks pick up the phone and I almost don't even recognize her I'm like what wow Mom it's like almost it's skewing in the direction of mail blatantly but she couldn't really tell because what dose was she on I don't remember exactly what the dose was cuz it was like a a cream and the comp pounding creams can vary like you said so but whatever it was it was the one of the practitioners that promotes 200 to 300 total test in females which is like insane well it might be we're talking about that for a second I mean we'll go back and talk more about trt but while we're on the topic um as you alluded to earlier there is no FDA approval for testosterone in the use of women so there is for men of course um and there's obviously an FDA approval for estrogen and progesterone in the use of women the thinking with testosterone is that when a woman enters per menopause not only does she experience the predictable drop in estrogen and progesterone but with it so too goes testosterone um and of course the rationale is that testosterone is still a very important hormone in women uh I've pointed this out many times before but the units that are used to represent estrogen and testosterone are very misleading because they're not the same yeah so if you convert them to the same units you will see that even in a woman her testosterone is significantly higher than her progesterone and estrogen so uh if you took sort of a mid folicular estrogen level an estradiol level and took it out of picr per deciliter and revert you know put everything in nanograms per deciliter the her testosterone as a premenopausal woman would be 10 at least 10 and at times even 50 times higher so the idea is well clearly losing a hormone that's that abundant must have ramifications there are you've alluded to all the side effects and so the thinking is well we should replace it and you know the question is to what now I've never heard a compelling case for why it should be replaced to a level that exceeds her physiologic limit in her 30s for example yeah and I've never seen a woman in her 30s with a total testosterone between 2 and 300 milligram ANS per deciliter in other words those levels exceed even her peak physiologic level so it doesn't surprise me that that would be androgenized women do you understand or do you have a sense from the folks doing this what their rationale is for going so high yeah I think their idea is simply that this is where we achieve like blatant symptom relief in everyone and a feeling of optimization above and beyond like this is what it should feel like when you take hormone replacement and I think it's just creating a state of you know like ultimately androgens feel pretty good if you were just crashed or you know very low and then all of a sudden you're essentially on you know the male proportional equivalent of like a bodybuilder cycle or something so yeah it's uh you know I couldn't say why they do it exactly but all I know is it's too high and it's very uh common to have some of these like viralized outcomes and if you're not keeping a close eye on them they can really really snowball cuz when you're seeing yourself in the mirror every day and you're listening to yourself you don't really notice these little minute changes as much as somebody else then you might meet up with a friend a month later and they're like what the hell you don't even sound the same yeah I mean the other thing that amazes me is there's another symptom that is so common even at physiologic doses for women who are sensitive enough because a lot of times you're treating a woman um and let's say she's 45 and she comes to you and she has almost unmeasurable levels of testosterone so she's sort of in the 10 to 20 nanogram per deciliter level now you didn't know her when she was 30 so you don't actually know what she was when she was 30 and you don't know you know people weren't measuring her testosterone 15 years earlier but you say look we're going to set a target of 80 to 100 nanograms per deciliter which is sort of in the ballpark of what would you know what would be kind of 70th to 80th percentile for women that age but then it turns out that she probably was lower than that because once you get her there her acne is out of control yeah right and so that you you would surmise from that that well she must have lived at a lower level and for her 80 is super physiologic and it's for that reason that I just can't imagine that they're pushing women to 200 and 300 who are not developing horrible cystic acne and you know facial hair and all like how much they feel so much and now I'm having sex multiple times a day even with my husband who I didn't even want to touch you know a couple months ago so it's a pretty big shift and if they like what they're getting out of it sometimes compromises will be made in order to continue with what they think they need to be taking to achieve that feeling and in addition to that too like you said with the not knowing where you were at further confounding that is how many people have been on combin aoll contraceptives for like decades AB yeah just totally skews everything yeah like I've dated girls who I've seen like 80% suppression of their hormone levels like testosterone free testosterone especially proportionally more so too because of the rise ofg goes through the yeah it's ruthless so they're like operating in a state of Androgen deficiency perpetually and relying on this synthetic progestin to drive all like testosterone like

[00:17:20] Behavior essentially and then if they get off they don't even know what their natural is like they've never experienced it cuz they've been prescribed it since you know 15 years old or 16 years old or something yeah so it's tough cuz it's like you don't even know what your ideal Target is even if you were getting blood work often times it's totally skewed and that's something

[00:17:39] I definitely want to talk about on my podcast too is some of the testosterone suppression in different formats of birth control because it's pretty pretty nebulous some of it like I'm very aware of the combined ear Contra contraceptive data but even like the localized progestins and stuff there's like very minimal Literature shockingly Like if

[00:18:00] I'm trying to find out how much the marina affects my girlfriend yeah I don't even know I don't know what her Baseline probably was so yeah have you been following at all the the nesto uh product yeah yeah it uh looks good if you're willing to tolerate it yeah for folks who don't know nesto is a intranasal administration of testosterone and um I believe the dose is like 7 milligram and it's used P so three times a day which tells you that obviously the bioavailability is quite low if you're taking 21 mg uh daily so that's you know slightly more than you would probably take if you were just doing it intramuscularly um but nevertheless um the the idea with it is it's quicker acting um and that's why you have to take it sort of three times a day because it's not sticking around like in a fat Depot the way an injectable uh

[00:18:56] Source would be but um the interesting question is does this help address some of the female use case so for example if one of the symptoms that a female is turning to testosterone for his libido does she really need to be on Mega doses of systemic testosterone Around the Clock versus you know in the same way a man would use Calis for an OnDemand Ed issue could a woman be using intranasal testosterone for an ond demand libido issue I would hope that'd be the case in practical application I don't know if it plays out that way where you could just acutely use it once a week or something on the day you're you know wanting to get busy I've candidly had some experimentation with it and doesn't seem to make at least that big of a difference with you or with a female no with a female with like a low testosterone I see I see so in other words you're saying if if a female would look cuz I was going to say in a male I wouldn't expect it to have that effect it would make no difference to me yeah yeah but you're saying in a female with low testosterone taking a couple of shots of nesto didn't in the subsequent hours have much of an impact on libido no but that's obviously n of one and I haven't actually seen the data in literature myself and I don't even know if it exists right now I I'm not I'm not aware but I believe there is a clinical trial ongoing and I I'm I think it might be happening at Baylor but I'm not sure and one thing I can say is as much as it sounds great the typically women don't like using it that much so it's like trying just because it's messy and yeah it's like dripping down the back or their throat it's like this you know very not it's like invasive in a way that's not very clean you just feel kind of gross you're like a drug addict almost like snorting some [ __ ] before you go have sex every time like it's yeah it like but obviously the the not having sex and not having a libido probably a worse outcome for for many of them so if it works in the short term on like a use by use basis um I'm sure it's individual case dependent and

[00:21:07] I'm sure you could double up the dose and maybe get you know more of a you know bang for your buck effect but um I'm just like skeptical that anyone's going to use it more for novelty once in a while and then I don't know interesting yeah um I've never actually seen the product I don't know what the viscosity is it of it is I don't I don't know I don't know what the what the user experien is like so um is it is it is it particularly viscous or is it kind of like a like a nasal spray that you would use for you know an antihistamine or something you know maybe it's so the one

[00:21:40] I had experience with was a compounded like replica of that so maybe the nesto formula itself is actually more tolerable so I probably should have prefaced with that but the you know compounded variant that I tried that was replicating that product was not that Pleasant and it was like almost like creamy not a spray yeah see I I yeah I I think I would I would want to see what the real deal product was like yeah um let's talk for a moment about DHEA so that's the other thing that seems to be all the Rave today um a lot of my female patients are asking to be put on

[00:22:18] DHEA and um I'm not sure where this came from because DHEA has been around forever um it's one of the few hormones that's avail aable over the counter uh that's a relatively unique situation to the United States very few Canada though don't bring it back to Canada or else we get it that's my point yeah so even even across the border with our you know neighbors that we're otherwise pretty similar to DH is yeah it's like schedule one yeah it's if you have that you're doing something more illegal than having anabolic steroids wow I did not know it was schedule one and yet here is go on

[00:22:59] Amazon and you can fill your boots with it yeah um which makes no sense no it makes no sense I mean until you understand the uh the regul like you understand there's there's a political there's a dirty political story as to why that's the case there's some really backwards compound selections though that are banned like for example you can buy a federan in GNC in Canada it's like why it's literally used to make meth and then here it's a lot harder to get a federan but then you can get yohimbine here which is a fat burner we'll talk about later and in Canada it's banned it's like what who's selecting what gets banned a lot of women for some reason have recently like in the past few months been sort of saying I want to be on DHA I want to be on dhaa and you know they're somehow being led to believe this is the elixir of life and I'm sort of trying to scratch my head and understand why they're saying that presumably they're saying if my dhaa Lev

[00:23:56] RS are low it could explain my low testosterone and this is a quote unquote more natural way to increase my testosterone I haven't seen any compelling data that DHEA does much of anything um what what did the data say I haven't looked in a decade by the way so a decade ago when I was really be beginning to get interested in hormone tinkering MH I came to the conclusion

[00:24:16] DHA didn't do much yeah if you look in males you will find nothing of I don't know no utility it has no effect on testosterone at best you get a spike in estrogen and no testosterone seemingly through you know whatever back door and yet it's a it's a usada wada band drug it's treated just as testosterone would be or any other yeah which is wild but in females it actually is useful and can increase testosterone to the degree that if you had and this is a pretty wild study that I haven't really seen anyone talk about I'm sure somebody has but a few years ago I was looking into for the very reason of my girlfriend at the time was shut down to nothingness on a combined oral contraceptive and I'm like what can you do in this situation and I found some papers that showed using DHEA supplementation exogenously how how much 25 a day 50 50 a day okay and a full restoration of total and free test levels while still using your combined

[00:25:19] Ral contraceptive so like to me that's pretty damn impressive for something that's not um like a cream you have to apply spray you have to put up your nose and this thing reliably depending on because again combined or all contraceptives there's many different variants you could get so depending on the brand you might have a progestin that's you know more androgenic or one that's less ethanol estradi is or isn't included that will all vary but in general in like the traditional most sold and prescribed combined oral contraceptives it was restoring total test levels to that of Baseline while staying on what is otherwise is like a brutally suppressive compound and give a sense of like what the increase was from what to what was total t on that regimen oh it was like going from your natural 60 down to like 15 back up to 60 okay so 4X bump in total T and um this was only in women on an

[00:26:19] OC yeah yeah there's probably data on just not on anything but I don't recall off the top of my head interesting so why do you think women would be more sensitive to this probably because a significant amount of their Androgen synthesis derives from adrenal hormone production as opposed to men it's like if you castrate a guy you can still squeak out like 30 to 40 nanograms per deser from his adrenals yeah and in females it seems to be similar depending on the woman you know proportionally it could be 30 to 40 out of her adrenals could be three4 of her total testosterone exactly so for men it's like you know a drop in the bucket but for girls it's like maybe three quers of the bucket I'm I'm going to check that paper out but that that's that'll be that might be a nice thing to have in your hip pocket if you live in the

[00:27:09] United States one thing I can say though is DHEA in women who have natural levels that look pretty good like let's just say you're on you're on hormone replacement as is and then you think you need DHA for some subjective feeling of well-being there's no real biomarkers to reinforce that your efficient your DHE e looks normal your testosterone looks okay and there's not really like a clear reason you just kind of think you need it almost certainly the risk to reward is a little bit worse because acne on ddaa is very common in women to a degree where it's like the proportional upside you get out of it you're not going to get as much you know anabolic activity out of it relative to seemingly the androgenicity impact act systemically or at least in skin from what I've seen and remind me we we don't measure DHE levels we measure dhaa sulfate levels correct yeah that's the only proxy in like traditional blood work metrics that I'm aware of to test for it and remind do do you know why I don't I used to know why we couldn't measure DHEA directly in blood I think the majority of it is sulfated so getting a direct measurement is not as indicative of I don't know the total body pool or what yeah like yeah I

[00:28:30] I wish I had a good explanation but I just know that's the proxy it's kind of like why do we check igf1 for GH it's probably something similar what about the role of progesterone what what do you think the role of progesterone is in uh both men and women for um you know outside of reproduction right so putting reproduction aside um you know one of the things that we're doing a lot more with our patients um we used to be pretty quick to abandon progesterone systemically if women were having you know any mood symptoms associated with a full dose of it and we would just very quickly adopt a marinaa you know progesterone coated IUD to give the endometrial uh counterbalance to the estradi to prevent the hyperplasia and obviously reduce the risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogen um but you know we're really seeing a lot of women in the Middle Ground who maybe can't tolerate a full 200 dose uh 200 milligram dose of progesterone which would be kind of the the full dose um but feel great at 50 to 100 and so you know in many ways what we're trying to do is just find every woman's dose and like what's the amount of that you can tolerate and if it's sufficient great if it's insufficient we'll back stop it with a marina um why do you think that is why do you think progesterone is so important for women I would side of reproductive like standard utility I think that it's more like if you look at a steroid Genesis Cascade which is like in layman's terms I guess if you took cholesterol and then all of the different things it could turn into when you cleave it and through enzymatic

[00:30:11] Pathways turn it into you know uh um glucocorticoids or like Downstream to adrenal steroids and downstream to testosterone and DHT and estradi and estrone and all that stuff like that is called steroid Genesis the synthesis of all these steroid hormones in your body and some of you guys might have seen this chart before and I'm sure you've showed it on the podcast it's like this big messy thing that has like 7,000 different Pathways and it looks overwhelming but up near the top where you start to have like uh you know cortisol production you have some of this stuff Upstream for um like glucocorticoids as well as where pregnanolone branches from like to actual androgens and upward to like adrenal hormones at the top you have this uh Downstream Cascade from progesterone that leads to an array of metabolite hormones that are like pro- analytic as in they will be like anti- anxiety kind of balance out the sympathetic drive that you might get from andrens and also help you get to sleep so that's why progesterone is so useful at night and it's kind of why it's placed at that time for dosing as well and taking it orally also is like impactful on the way it's metabolized out to get some of these proportional metabolites too because if you had it in a cream or an injection not only maybe is it harder to get the dose you want out of it but the metabolite content that you get is totally different when you have a first pass metabolism versus you skip it so with progesterone in particular it produces an array of different things including but not limited to one is called Alo pregnanolone which is seeming only implicated to some extent in postfastr syndrome but also very much in postpartum depression and they've even created like a synthetic analog of it now that they use to treat postpartum depression which is interesting but all of those different metabolites cumulatively if you are deficient in you know some amount of them depending on the individual's biochemistry and genetic predispositions could result in like a you know more anxious Human Than otherwise so dose required to balance out you know the uh androgenic signaling relative to all this other stuff going on I you know it's I would expect it would vary quite significantly female to female and especially when you are backfilling hormones from a shut down state like it's not endogenously regulated the same way when you have feedback mechanism so you're kind of just manually shooting stuff at your liver and hoping it's going to spit out the right amount of stuff and you can only really do that through some sort of titration SL experimentation and what dosages seem to produce you know repeatable outcomes in the literature we have available so I would imagine a lot of women would you know have a dose that is far less to achieve the outcome they want or much higher or perhaps don't respond at all because it's not what they need depends but I I think that would be my my educated guess is there a role for progesterone use by men yeah so

[00:33:27] I said this last time and you seem baffled and it definitely does not have like an approved use in men there's no like literature that points to it as this is something you should use in men or replace but I do believe and see it play out where it could be useful to balance out some of that sympathetic drive and whatnot and it kind of you know you could look at blood work and kind of see okay in my like minimal negligible amount should I be pushing that to the top of the negligible amount that is my threshold or and what what doses do you see people using here the same doses like 50 to 200 that high yeah yeah and what are the side effects of that so if you are not on exogenous hormones it is it does have negative feedback so similarly to most people are very familiar with how estrogen has negative feedback to the hypothalamus pituitary to secular axis and testosterone through Androgen receptors but what often goes overlooked is some of the other hormones like progesterone so progesterone isn't as potent of a negative feedback regulator that I've seen but it definitely is and it seems to maybe even have anti-androgenic activity as well and if it does that through you know competitive inhibition or like I don't really know off the top of my head I don't recall how it does it but it does seem to produce anti-androgen like effects and some of it may be mediated through the negative feedback and some of it may be inh through actual like transcriptional activity But ultimately it's something that will lower your ability to have like you know Androgen like effects in the body to some extent but if you're on trt yeah it doesn't doesn't matter because you're already shut down correct so what would be the benefits when you're on trt um what is it helping you balance out clinically I think very common we will see disproportionately High free Androgen levels in men especially when you look at a lot of guys will look at their total testosterone their free testosterone their shbg but what often goes overlooked is shbg binds DHT with I believe it's a five times higher

[00:35:43] Affinity than testosterone might be 10 I think it's five though whatever it is it's much higher and that ratio of DHT to testosterone to estrogen that's freely circulating like you're regulating mechanism in the body the primary one cuz shbg is like the main thing that determines how male you are essentially that is well besides the actual production of the hormones but

[00:36:08] DHT binds gets bound up with five times higher Affinity than Tess which is like 20 times higher than estrogen so if you have that regulatory framework kind of like d driven down through either a dose of testosterone that is higher than you need or like a I don't know super infrequent dosing pattern that results in like a disproportionate drop on certain days or an array of different things you could end up in this like free Androgen dominant environment where your sympathetic drive is kind of like keyed up perpetually and because you have a long Ester compound in your system you don't have the luxury of endogenous manipulation of your hormones going up when you need them and down when you need them like the pulsatile framework of your natural production is non-existent you're just like getting a big spike whenever you inject and then it's slowly going to diminish out of your system until you want to inject again and a lot of guys even when they're doing you know twice a week or something you're still getting like some level of Spike and then dips and then

[00:37:10] Spike and dips where if you were a natural with normal natural testosterone production it would be like very pulsatile with a dial rhythm with natural dips and valleys and Peaks and it would not fluctuate where it's like Bam Bam and if you look at a steroid plotter you can kind of see how this looks and you want to compare a steroid plotter to like your actual Rhythm naturally it's like not really the same so that's kind of where you get into you know more frequent dosing might be better but at the end of the day a lot of people are overlooking how dominant the free

[00:37:45] Androgen profile could be in a guy on trt because you'll see your total testosterone and it might be 700 when you measure it but you're measuring it 3 days after your injection you're looking only at free testosterone your DHT has not been evaluated your free DHT surely hasn't been evaluated I don't necessarily think everyone has to spend hundreds of dollars to check those by the way but just be aware that if your shbg is lower than it was before you started trt like there is a disproportionate regulating mechanism in play here now that you have to perhaps account for if you're in like a state of anxiety like that might be a factor or if you have trouble getting to sleep like there's certain cues I would look to as to am I you know a little bit too redlined right now G given that free testosterone is typically estimated I guess we can talk a little bit about testosterone measurements you were mentioning earlier that there's a direct way to measure free testosterone I was unaware of that um do you look at free Androgen index where you're just taking the ratio of testosterone to shbg so you're taking the ratio of two things that are directly measured is that a better proxy for what's happening physiologically than this indirect uh calculation of free testosterone which I mean again if my memory serves me correctly free testosterone is a calculation based on testosterone shbg and albumin is there anything else that factors into it yeah

[00:39:10] I'm pretty sure the free direct measurement via Lab Corp is just based on those binding proteins I don't think there's anything more to it but with the equilibrium dialysis it is separating it and measuring it directly and does Lab Core do an equilibrium dialysis yeah it's just more cost prohibitive so the good news is a lot of these tests when they evaluate them against it as a gold standard track pretty closely with it so you can use them as proxies that are relatively accurate it does get skewed when you get into trying to measure like hypogonadal men that might have you need to be a bit more I don't know uh lower concentrations and you want to make sure you get it right it's not just tracking

[00:39:55] Trends as much or indiv idual who are using synthetic androgens it will for sure cross detect if you're using a amuno assay or a calculation um because it's going to be based on the cross detection of the total testosterone presumably as well if you use that so yeah in general if you wanted to use the gold standard it would be equilibrium dialysis I don't know if it's always necessary however at a baseline measurement for people who are trying to get as ideal and accurate of blood work as possible I would typically always go with the highest sensitivity and that's like even with your blood work it's not like it was wildly different on some of the metrics but like it was significant enough that it makes you yeah let's talk about that so I wrote my values down so for my last blood test I did it I had labc core run them both I had them run the um imuno assay which is not the gold standard that's the cheaper test for both testosterone and estradiol and then the lcms which is the gold standard and so here's the difference so the enzyme based amuno assay for testosterone was 502 but the lcms was 381 so for people who want to know how to tell if the test is that one it says rash ecl a right beside it yeah so Roos is the company that provides the the the uh the assay for them but that's like the only thing

[00:41:21] I think it says underneath it to identify yeah yeah so that's a pretty big difference right me that's a 25% difference uh yeah like I I think it's significant enough to justify getting the accurate one yeah yeah this is and that's the only one we do but I just wanted to see what the what the difference was so the the the accurate test read 381 to the inaccurate 502 here's what's more telling was the estral so the estra dial on the accurate test the lcms was 18.3 and on the um enzyme base test it was 41.3 so that's more than a 2X difference yeah the enzyme based testing will cross detect estrone synthetic estrogens as estrad and it's uh annoying why do you I mean that still seems really high right given that my estrone my estriol they should be very low I'm obviously not taking any synthetic estrogens why do you think it's off by more than 2X and by the way I see this in other patients as well um yeah I that would be tough for me to speculate without seeing the full I I think it's picking up something in my supplements like I think there's probably else that's being detected now they say that probably yeah I'm assuming you didn't take any Biotin for certain I don't think ever taken biotin yet okay you don't have any methylated B vitamins bro I do have methylated b vitamins but biotin is not in your B complex um I don't think it is maybe it is in tiny amounts I'm not taking a dedicated biotin put it that way that would still mess with it I yeah maybe so maybe there's something in my my my uh my methylated B complex as far as by the way for like stuff you should not take before your test last time we spoke you said we were both aware of Biotin and then you said I'm not sure if there's other stuff that could affect it I checked with mer Health which is my team and they don't know of anything either so I think biotin is the main thing and

[00:43:22] I think it skews if I recall correctly thyroid values pretty dramatically as well so if you're taking a Biotin supplement it's worth noting you should discontinue you should stop it periodically before you take a blood test for you know I would say at least a few days if not a week probably before your test just in case got it yeah okay so let's now kind of shift over to to sort of the the testosterone replacement decision making in in in in a male um so it seems to me that younger and younger men are seeking out testosterone replacement therapy um is there any data on that or is that just sort of our perception no you were right like as far as marketing efforts and exposure if you look at just Google

[00:44:06] Trends and you type in trt it's like the graph of how many searches are on Google is like skyrocketed over the past decade where do most men get their trt how much of it is done kind of um from an endocrinologist for example like someone who presumably you know spent a lot of time understanding the system how much of it is done from you know clinics that only do testosterone as an as the other extreme example right yeah yeah it's tough because countries will differ in their scrutiny on this stuff to such a varying degree that if I speak I could speak to the US and give some sort of Ballpark and I I feel that's probably the most useful um and again this is not based on some sort of survey or anything this is just my speculation as to what I would imagine is happening from Trends I've seen

[00:45:01] Underground Market is still the most easily accessible with the cheapest barrier to entry and with the you know Advent of Internet e-commerce stores it's not that difficult to find a website that sells testosterone or other anabolics and get some Bitcoin and buy it so there's a lot of people that will get it from their gim Bros or online it's very accessible now and the cost aside from the prescription barriers of finding a doctor who you actually think will give you the prescription and not necessarily knowing when you go into that consultation or whatever that they're going to be you know the flexible doctor that you need it's just easier for a lot of guys to get it you know black market so there's a significant amount of guys at least in the fitness industry that are suppressed from their hormone use that will be on trt underground so I would say that probably the majority of them are on not scripted trt even like lenient far like tele Med Clinics I don't think most I would say a majority are still using underground and they I mean I presumably crypto is what enables that because otherwise the DEA would shut these things down or is it is it too much of a game of wacka or there's too many of these around wacka yeah so there's a lot that sell an amount of volume presumably that is not significant enough to focus on or or it's just like it's so hard to track cuz even if you shut one down another one pops up it's based in some country that's not even the US supposedly and they drop ship it and they use crypto so it's harder to attract the currency It's like got it yeah and what kind of testosterone are these guys getting are they actually getting branded Depot testosterone or they getting some knockoff from China often it's underground but there are resellers or pharmaceutical grade too and sometimes these guys will have connections with people you know Europe in certain countries where you can just walk into a pharmacy and buy you know whatever you want for on10th of the price and then they will mark it up and then sell it to you in the US and yeah so there's an array of different options but typically it is a you know a underground lab that is producing it and making you know what they're advertising as a accurately dosed sterile product that is branded under their like you know Underground brand essentially got it um okay so for folks that want to do this kind of in a little bit more of a responsible way and go and see a doctor um you know there are a lot of these kind of uh dock in the boox operations where they're basically just T dos um I don't know how they're operating I assume that a lot of this is tele medicine I don't know how much longer that will be in existence um I do believe that a lot of that stuff's going to be shut down um but for the time being um you want to just talk maybe a little bit I know we talked a bit about this but anything else you want to say on the uh Clomid Eid

[00:48:13] HCG tradeoffs yeah that is um I think when you are trying to restore fertility in the short term and you're averse to injections and you there's a lot of factors that could lead me to say Clomid might be viable but in general if you're looking at something longterm I would say typically Clomid or encline which is you know a more Progressive version of the drug all but not FDA approved um neither of those I think are viable longterm at least from a risk perspective you are essentially putting yourself in a position of long-term estrogen receptor antagonism in certain tissues meaning you're going to be missing out on estrogen receptor activity in certain areas of your body that down the line could manifest an array of issues like if you look at the side effects of serms you'll see weird stuff depending on the compound sometimes it's ocular issues or what what do we know about the long-term use of Clomid because that's we've got more data for Clomid than we do encline which is as you said just a very very close derivative of it but they both work the same way they both block estrad the estrad receptor of the hypothalamus correct yeah and then the zuuk chopine component of Clomid which is has two drugs essentially in it because they will have differing effects that component of it is more anti- gonadotropic I believe so it's like something that will um like the en chopine component is far more specific to the serm activity you are seeking in the hypothalamus the zuken is longer halflife less efficacious doesn't even really represent the target therapy of the drug so in general even if if you're looking at cloma that's the only one that has approval so you would potentially have the data but I off the top of my head don't know of any studies that are going decades long to evaluate something like that I don't know if it exists I would be kind of doubtful it exists to be honest but I would think in the from what I've seen at least anecdotally take from that what you will is is typically no one ends up with a stable mood long term or an ability to like it's it's not a sustainable therapy longterm in my opinion for the Vitality component you seek from replacement therapy to begin with so perhaps on paper your testosterone looks good but it's more of a a metric that you're using to justify the drug because you are achieving the target which is look my testosterone's better now but at the expense of literally tricking your brain through inhibiting very very necessary mechanisms so it's not like you are stimulating production through a means that is directly targeted it is more like you are trading off the health of one part of your body to get an outcome that is potentially uh Roi justifying in another aspect of your body so at the expense of estrogen receptors working everywhere in the body you're getting more testosterone and is it blocking estrogen receptors everywhere or just centrally yeah it is selective hence serm but it's not perfect as we talked about last time you were going to get um like we could just Google Clomid side effects and you'll see an array of different things

[00:51:41] I believe including but not limited to skewing of lipid parameters you were the one who taught me about yeah like that's sketchy and like I wouldn't want to have that long term um there's stuff you'd have to track that are very unknown variables at least we kind of know what to expect when you have natural testosterone increasing like what happens at a you know lipid perspective or a negative feedback perspective or you're not dealing with some I don't know nebulous activity in different tissues and having to account for it so like actual brain inhibition you know is uh sketchy to me and from what I've seen people end up uh

[00:52:21] I don't know not in a good State of Mind long term on it but I suppose it's possible you could what doses are you seeing people use in the wild um like 50 milligrams daily 50 milligrams three times a week 25 around 50 yeah it obviously in the bodybuilding world I told you about the Absurd PCT regimens post-cycle therapy where guys are using 100 per day for you know shorter time frames but it's uh you know super high doses now I I think we're going to see a big increase in the use of Clomid and e-id even beyond what we're seeing now just based on the regulatory environment which is to say that you know there will be no use of tele medicine for the prescription of any scheduled compounds so that means that testosterone and HCG which we'll talk about again in a second um can only be prescribed in person at least if you're adhering to the law whereas via tele medicine you could still use Clomid or potentially uh ecomed so you know that just sort of suggest that we're going to see you know

[00:53:28] HCG kind of plummet and uh Clomid go up um so I I think the implications of understanding this are actually pretty significant and I'd really like to see this studied better yeah um because everything about chomet is easier to use right you're going to have this you're going to get over the regulatory issue um it's oral it's a pill you don't have to inject it you know HCG as we've talked about is a bit more difficult to use because it needs to be refrigerated it's a very fragile peptide and it's probably more expensive than both testosterone and Clomid put together right oh yeah for sure um anything you want to just say about HCG that we didn't cover last time um I think that if you were looking to restore natural production and assess or assess your testicular response in general before you decide to go down the trt pathway could be a worthwhile thing to do so if you're considering trt you have a total t Cerone of 300 or and your symptomatic 381 yeah and let's just say you're symptomatic you're you know you haven't don't even remember the last time you had morning wood um you know your energy levels are much lower it's much more difficult to retain muscle etc etc actually looking at your blood work to assess what is the release from my pituitary down to my goonan to actually produce the testosterone what is that signal and is it deficient so do I have a in range high normal like what does it look like on my blood work of my lutenizing hormone LH and

[00:55:04] FSH and if it looks to be adequate or even high would be even more indicating if something's wrong you could determine from there why are my testy not responding to it and then from there that there's a way to delineate down to yeah so but here Clomid and and um I mean Clomid gives you two pieces of information right it tells you the pituitary response and the gatal response HCG will only give you the gatal response right you're not you're not getting any pituitary information out of it other than the shutdown but that's not real that's obvious correct but I was just saying as far as interpreting the blood orc to understand what lutenizing hormone even does in general you would be looking to your response at this teses to this signal from your brain and if you're going to use an HCG you can mimic that which is

[00:55:52] HCG essentially it's not identical but it looks very similar to LH and it behaves in a very similar way on the luteinizing hormone chonic genotropin receptor which initiates the LI ex Cel stimulation and intratesticular testosterone production that you would want to actually produce natural testosterone and when you use an

[00:56:16] HCG it's the only way you can directly do that if you had an inadequate signal but the only viable way that would be something you could stick to and have as a monotherapy as in it's the only thing you're using for your HRT is if your testes are healthy enough to respond to it to make the testosterone so when people are trying to determine if they should take literal synthetic testosterone I feel it's worth fleshing out what is my actual health of my testes first but let's say you learn this okay so let's say um with my testosterone of 381 I I take

[00:56:54] HCG and my testosterone goes to 1,200,000 1200 like it goes to Upper end of the range so we've learned that hey my hypogonadism is Central it's not peripheral right somehow my pituitary isn't making enough signal because clearly my testes can make enough testosterone with armed with that information what what is the best course of action is it to stay the course and just say well hey keep taking HCG because at least your testies are responding to it or you know is there some obvious problem solving and and I'm thinking about this even in my case right because you know like when I think of all the things that would normally impair pituitary function the first thing that comes to my mind is sleep disruption yeah and you know knock on wood that's one thing I've pretty much got down in the toolkit my sleep is is great um maybe stress you know probably hypercortisolemia maybe not so great um training overtraining under trining like you know what what are the what are the things you would look at to to brainstorm if that scenario were the case I don't know if that's the case by the way but that's an experiment that is probably worth doing to see hey where why is my t low is it low because my brain isn't saying the right thing or is it low because my body can't do it yeah

[00:58:16] I think there is multi multiple factors here that could be fleshed out before you ended up on a HCG to even figure out you know what's my response at the test Seas level figuring out if you can top out the natural signal I feel is the first thing to do pending your blood work looks like you know gadat tropin are low to mid-range and I'm still not you know why am I only getting a 381 response out of that it would be to look to many of the things you just said which obviously you're pretty dialed on and then above and beyond that it would be assessing the basics like micronutrient intake macros are you eating enough to recover relative to training stimulus um I'm not going to say a lot of people overtrain too much maybe they're just under recovering and their sleep is bad that's probably a more realistic outcome but in general there is not in your case but in many other individuals micronutrient deficiencies across the board zinc intakes not be adequate amounts magnesium intake super low and that's impactful as well um an array of things vitamin D being low also very impactful and these things can all move the needle like 100 plus nanograms per de potenti depending how deficient you are so some of these low hanging fruits with the

[00:59:29] Sleep micronutrients minerals actual macro intake some people are eating Ultra garbage processed foods no micronutrient density they're undereating maybe they're on semaglutide and they're you know super calorie deprived and they have very low protein or something that's also impactful all of these assessments do I have an adequate energy intake and of that energy intake high quality nutrient value in that energy relative to my demands and my training hard enough to actually maximize testosterone 2o cuz that's also a factor as your resistance training regimen and the sleep all these things in concordance will ultimately dictate what is your output and then let's just say you've had that all dialed in at that point if it's still either suboptimal signaling so you know low low normal whatever it is or even normal gatot tropen output and then you're still getting an inadequate response you could then potentially discern partly that you're not going to be able to get the signal you need out of your pituitary to optimize or you actually have some degradation of response at the receptor level in the Tessy themselves which is an age deteriorated thing as well unfortunately like I would love to just say everyone's testes are going to retain perfect function forever it's not the case so similar to the signal there's also the health of the actual organ so if those things are all optimized like you've kind of done your due diligence it's just making sure you actually know what the due diligence is and you didn't if those things are optimized and you're at 381 and you take

[01:01:03] HCG and your T goes up yeah what what what what does that imply that there's some other factor that we're unaware of that's impairing yeah IAL yeah I would be like what's your G&R output then not that I know how you could even measure that but presumably that may be low or the receptor response to the G&R is suboptimal too yeah interesting so it's like a whole upam yeah that's interesting that's the that's the problem with these is there anything that you could use a G&R Agonist and even test out what your pituitary output is from there but that's like good luck finding a doctor who understands the

[01:01:38] Nuance of not castrating you with that yeah although what you could do is then you could use Clomid sure right so then you could say okay if the response to HCG is favorable then you know directly stimulating the L EG cell produces testosterone assuming you had enough testosterone to aromatize to estrad that was a meaningful impact from inhibiting its negative feedback to begin with so it's like at least with a G&R Agonist I know I'm maximally stimulating pituitary output to whatever capacity it is with

[01:02:07] Clomid I'm just inhibiting negative feedback to whatever suboptimal capacity my ER is agonized yep although you'd want to think if you gave a high enough dose yeah you're right in my case maybe that wouldn't work cuz my estral is so low to begin with you're not inhibiting that much that's a very interesting point so you're um if estral is really low Clomid could fail just on the basis of that like if you really wanted to test pit pituitary output potential you would use a uh G&R Agonist and see what happens and if you could push is there is there one out there there's a ganellin is often used and I think misrepresented as a HRT therapy but it does it is a genh Agonist there's other ones that are used for other indications but like yeah they exist but you know again interesting in that the question is what's the so what right like so this is a super interesting line of inquiry um and let's say you learned oh you respond favorably to HCG you do not respond to the G&R oh well then the problem is something is wrong with the pituitary the pituitary is missing the signal yeah but maybe I've seen people diagnose adenomas by actually digging into that stuff so I think it's worthwhile to understand cuz maybe you have again it depends how long you've been monitoring your hormones like have you always been a healthy person or is well this is where maybe the endocrinologist can really do the heavy lifting here right like if if you go and see a physician who day and night is you know thinking through all of the intricate Pathways here yeah that that you know maybe there is a micro adoma I mean one of the things we like to do in people when we can't solve this problem before we send them to an endocrinologist is you know measure prolactin act a few of the other pituitary hormones get a sense if anything else is out of whack yeah sometimes you'll have like a prolactin secreting adenoma too and it's problematic as well there's a lot of weird stuff that it's tough because it's

[01:04:06] I would love to say you should understand this before you take hormones for the rest of your life but it's hard to expect everyone to understand this axis to the degree where even we're going back and forth like what about this so it's like how would I ever expect you know like you you just have to find as good of a uh medical provider as possible possible I suppose that's yeah I mean I I do hope that people take from this discussion the following right which is um HRT is serious business and um I I think I do think a lot of people are doing it incorrectly um and I think there are a lot of really irresponsible people out there who are uh you know frankly just practicing dangerous medicine if not veterinary medicine outright um and I again I don't see a lot of this in my practice there there usually people aren't coming to see me who have been you know terribly decimated by someone doing awful HRT in them but you know you sort of I I I I can see people on

[01:05:09] YouTube where I'm shaking my head going oh my God what's that guy talking about what's that guy doing um so you know there there is clearly a use case to understand this stuff before you go down the rabbit hole and hopefully this this type of content helps um anything else you want to say on trt before we kind of pivot to something else um yeah I guess just to you know put a bow tie on the whole natural stimulation thing um I do think if you are mindful of fertility it's worth consideration of HCG concurrently with your whatever you're going to be using like if you're on trt and you're going to shut yourself down don't make the mistake that thousands of bodybuilders have where they got on hormones ended up with atrophy testicles and then when they were 10 years later wanting to have a child realized the arduous recovery process was like pretty significant are there guys that can recover after 10 years of trt so I dug into that because you asked me about a fiveyear last time I was here the longest I could find was four and it seemed to be pretty reliably restored but there are some that just doesn't seemingly in in general and these guys to go to if you're on so you're saying someone is on uninterrupted testosterone replacement therapy for 4 years these were abusers okay so they're on very high doses but it's not like a controlled trial to where it's like you're going to take super physiologic

[01:06:37] Trend it was like you guys abused some amounts of synthetic drugs and have been shut down and to to rescue these guys they were using recombinant FSH and HCG in mega does no they were just doing whatever PCT they deemed worthwhile in general some of them no PCT so it's it was wasn't a trial where they all got oh

[01:06:57] I see it wasn't a standardized recovery yeah but what I've seen at least from these um studies which you know admittedly and it's not like I'm behind them or anything so it doesn't really matter but it's they're not the most highquality controlled things but it's very difficult to control for illegally used drugs at abusive dosages in random bodybuilding population so what we see though in general is once the hormones have left your system and there's no more residual negative feedback there is a recovery period that could be as short as you know weeks to months but in general most people will recover within one to two years even if abusing yeah but it's not 100% when we last spoke we talked about a whole bunch of peptides MH and so just recently meaning after we spoke but before this discussion yeah FDA came out and took a list of about 30 peptides and put them on a list called Category 2 now this included six of the peptides we discussed including bpc 157 and um what is it CJC CJC 1295 that's right so a bunch of the things we talked about that's right are now on this Category 2 list and I've been doing my best to understand what that means my interpretation of what it means to be Category 2 is the these can't be sold compounding pharmacies cannot make them and any interstate commerce of these things is a felony um that said I've noticed that there are still sites selling these peptides and they seem to be suggesting that they're selling them for research purposes which is clearly [ __ ] um is what's your understanding of this FDA ruling I think that the ruling has basically put them on a like a super highrisk list essentially whereby they're not outright banned but you will invite heavy scrutiny and perhaps legal action should you decide to make them because you will essentially have to I don't think it's too maybe it's not comparable but in the dietary supplement World they have a advisory list and they will pick certain things they think are high risk and add them to this list and then if you continue to make or sell these you may receive a warning letter at which point you have to either discontinue immediately or they will take you to court and you have to prove why it's dis sh a compliant and legal to sell and you could have a court appearance where you could try and make your case but you will lose essentially so I don't know if this is going to be the exact same outcome because it's you know Pharma stuff too so it's probably you know heavier scrutiny but from the people

[01:09:51] I've talked to in the compounding world people who even are in the business of selling peptides they seem to think it's I don't know the commonality that I'm seeing is it is very risky it was already risky to begin with but it's very risky and you are inviting scrutiny but it's not necessarily actually illegal I see so they could easily prove it probably if they wanted to and took you to court but I don't know that all of them are going to get you know whacka molded I feel like it might be uh sort of a scenario like that when you look at these research chemical sites they're no different than they were months ago like these are the same sites that have been operating with their pseudo research chemical use only you know fake umbrella the whole time like those companies exist to try and sell whatever with no prescription no compounding pharmaceutical standards like at least in compounding there is some level of oversight where you you know have to be plus minus some amount of potency you should be submitting it for microbial testing and stuff and in this world it's you know you buy it from Alibaba private label it and then you sell it online that's what these research chemical sites are so maybe some of them are doing hlc testing but that's like you know the the really responsible ones if you want to call it that like relative to the rest of them that are just straight up buying it repackaging it and selling it and yet I think do people buy there with a credit card or they're not having to use crypto to buy through these sites are they I think it depends on how big the company is cuz sometimes you could get away with credit card processing up to a certain amount until you know stripe or whatever your processor determines you're doing something high-risk that's not a part of their you know compliant activities and up until that point often times they're accepting credit cards so the bigger companies will do Bitcoin only or other you know more loophole ways of paying money gram Western Union stuff like that typically crypto but um yeah some companies do credit card too yeah so the rationale for putting these 30 peptides on this

[01:12:05] Category 2 list that provided by the FDI is is it's a safety question right so the question was um we don't have you know sufficient data on the safety of these things so we're going to we're going to sort of schedule them in a way um was there anything else to it I mean is is is is there any reason to believe that these things were were harmful or you know I guess I just don't really understand um what the what the rationale was and by the way I'm not saying I necessarily disagree with it I just I'm trying to understand what what's being communicated in this ruling with respect to these peptides I think publicly what they're saying is it's a safety concern and there's no actual FDA approval to justify the uh production of these and prescription of them which is not the most unreasonable conclusion I suppose given that a lot of these are res chemicals at the end of the day like it's not like melanotan 2 has a you know application right now for somebody who's too white you know so it's some of this stuff is very you know fudged at the end of the day anyways with compounds that got abandoned in the middle of a pipeline but people had a demand for it so the research chemical companies have never stopped selling it and then compounding pharmacies the ones that are willing to risk it for the biscuit will you know make certain amounts and in quantities that they deem is uh you know enough to satisfy the perceived demand but not enough to get whacka molded potentially so yeah it's it's really weird because you would think it'd be black and white you don't make it or you make it illegally and that's kind of it and I think a lot of people do believe that it's gray area enough that it is still legal to make and there are small compound compounding pharmacies that are going to do business as usual I think um some of them are looking to other abandoned you know pipeline products to replace the existing ones cuz those aren't on the list even know they similar mechanism of action or whatnot um and you could find like you know a catalog of Frankenstein compounds that a

[01:14:05] Pharma company didn't want and get it from China and then do the whole process over again because you know there's endless amounts of those why do you think there there there's such an epidemic of interest in this stuff I I I'm constantly amazed at the frequency with which people forward me you know links to these bizarre molecules that you know they've heard some influencer talking about on social media and they're they're they're asking me like you know should they be on it and and I

[01:14:39] I I got to tell you it my patience for it is so so low it's so thin yeah when it's like you know if you would spend I don't know take half the amount of time you scroll social media looking for obscure molecules that idiotic influencers think you should be taking and maybe put it into working out yeah like call me then yeah but but is this just a symptom of our Quick Fix

[01:15:05] Obsession I think some of it for sure is and one thing I do want to preface to is I probably should have also mentioned some of those compounds I do think are useful yeah well we talked about them yeah some of them have utility and I think are a shame that they're banned or harder to prescribe now or get or what have you some of them I feel like had no use being sold to begin with and then some were you know things I'm sad to see talk about CJC 1296 last time yeah we did and what was the upshot of it it is uh a good ghrh analog so it works quite well in conjunction with you know uh growth hormone releasing pep or GH secretagogue that will essentially enhance the output of growth hormone concurrently so it's not it's not bad it just never made it through its pipeline I think Tessa Morin is superior for that purpose but and

[01:16:00] Tessa Morin is still okay it's an for lipo distrophy and presumably it's still going to be prescribed and sold I don't know if they're going to clamp down on the compounded version you can only you know somehow get a Pharma version if I I don't think I've ever seen I think it's called agria is the actual Pharma version I don't think I've ever seen it probably way too cost prohibitive to even see the light of day so but that will continue to be Pres described and bpc 157 was kind of a VF analog yeah that one is uh interesting cuz it's like pro-angiogenic so they're going to be you know pushing the whole you know it's going to cause cancer angle or it might so we can't really get behind it which understandable if it didn't make it through its trial so I get it at the same time it sucks though because it's like we've all used it or know someone who's used it who's had benefit from it with perceptively like no downside at least that we can see aute so that's a tough one to see go for sure but yeah I think a lot of it is hype you know sexy new thing um oh this mechanism that's never been targeted like you know uh it inhibits myen or it does this or it does that and uh you know there's an array of different compounds that do different things that don't have FDA approval so you want to be the first to be in a performance enhancing Advantage position relative to other people too even if you're not a professional athlete everyone wants the Competitive Edge or better focus better muscle growth better better body composition understandably so so but it's not clear that these things really do that much in terms of performance enhancement I mean like it you know when you consider testosterone for example which has enormous performance enhancement um do any of these other peptides even come close I would say in terms of like hard lean body mass and strength uh outcomes no definitely not yeah I mean I mean again it's it's it's a that's part of the thing that sort of fascinates me is all of these things are so marginal in their benefits and what would be interesting if there were infinite resources would be to do clinical trials for specific use cases so you know I I would actually be very interested in seeing a clinical trial of bpc um for specific type of injury recovery where there's a really clear use case we're going to do an 8 to 12 week trial in post-operative Orthopedic patients where boy if there's one time when you want to see more VF that's probably it and let's compare that to a placebo and actually see are we getting quicker recovery and if so maybe that becomes a use case for it I mean maybe in part that's the that's the challenge here and and um again I don't I don't know if I don't know what the right balance is for the for for something like the FDA to strike but yeah they've clearly had enough of kind of the Wild

[01:18:52] West yeah I I do wonder what really brought it to their attention if there was some like you must have been our podcast yeah it was uh but but you know there's something presumably that brought to their attention this is being I don't know Mass marketed misused these aren't even approved compounds what's going on and let's go down the laundry list of which ones have FDA approval okay that's pretty easy to exclude those and the rest of them are gone kind of thing so like there's definitely been an uptick in like just Pap azard promotion of them cuz it sucks cuz some of these do even though they don't have impactful outcomes on muscle growth necessarily and like ergogenic outcomes that are you know in sport performance enhancing blatantly from a rehabilitation standpoint or potentially even a longevity standpoint not saying any of them do definitively but like you know some of them have promise and had like really interesting outcomes in rodents that would have been nice to see what happened in the humans play out now granted if they got halted in Trials probably wouldn't have ever happened anyway so it's just random people taking it yeah you mentioned myat in a second ago which of course reminds me of uh something that's been going around social media lately which is uh this interesting discussion about a gene therapy for fist Statin um so for folks listening to us who haven't been following this um I guess there's a there's a gene therapy out there where um you you introduce a vector to somebody and you I don't think you fully silence but you you clearly attenuate actually no I'm sorry you activate the gene for fist Statin that makes more of the follistatin protein which inhibits uh the expression of the myostatin gene or maybe inhibits the protein myostatin one or the other and this of course is theoretically interesting because of what we know about the actions of myostatin um

[01:20:55] I when I think back to images that stand out from my first year of medical school clearly on the top 10 list you haven't even said it I already know what you're talking about yeah you know what I'm talking about right this is still like 2 more than 25 years ago I still remember sitting in class when they showed the myostatin knockout mice and cattle and do you want to just tell people what a myostatin knockout looks like yeah so it produces a double muscle phenotype is what they call it and if you look at these catalysts like you would think it's photosho by how absurd it looks this is like the Mr Olympia of cattle essentially like it would be no chance anyone would come close in you know cattle sport whatever um and in the mice same deal they have uh like a literally they call it double muscle essentially because it's you literally have double the muscle fibers as uh you know the wild typ yeah the reference so and I remember like the chickens the mice the cattle I mean it was truly remarkable there's this dog too super Jack dog forget forget what type it is but uh the same so so so my roommate and I spent the rest of medical school just talking about we've got to figure out a way to inhibit our myostatin yeah yeah okay so apparently now someone's working on this and they're claiming that for just I don't know $25,000 for your first shot and maybe 25,000 for every subsequent shot you can get a gene therapy that will activate and produce more of a protein called ftin that inhibits myostatin and so that should be good right yeah yeah it seems like at least in the literature in animals you see this uh you know the myostatin Knockouts and you see this you know double muscle phenotype you would you know assume and you there is actual rodent data too where you see festat Administration does enhance muscle like it does happen um and I guess as a result of that there was a lot of these research chemical companies were very quick to come out with you know uh free as dried like lify fall satin product that had 1 milligram per per vial and you would buy it for you know hundreds of dollars and then you would basically like shoot a vial a day or something of that nature and spend thousands over the course of a cycle which was based on you know no data at all now this was this this was made how did this peptide get created is this an FDA approved drug or is this one of those no it was like we know what the chemical structure is let's go get a

[01:23:35] Alibaba chemist to make it and technically I'm trying to think yeah okay so got it so you've got you've got this kind of gray Market fist Statin product out there yeah and this one is not gene therapy to be clear too it's literally just yeah no you're actually injecting the protein yeah yeah so You' literally get bacterio static water shoot it in swish it around until it's mixed and then injected in yourself and the halflife is like I don't know a couple hours so you'd have to inject them multiple times a day to have it be stable and your in your blood to actually get the effect presumably and essentially the outcome that we saw in the bodybuilding world because this has been around for like a decade Plus at this point if not decades um was not really anything you know there' be the random outlier who's like I gain 20 lbs in 2 days and it's like okay bro and everyone else got nothing essentially and then you couldn't help but think that guy was probably selling or something so anyway not that impressive and we just assumed it didn't work and then we come to find out that there's these you know viral Vector studies going on behind the scenes in rodents and there was one in humans I believe too and then more recently there's this bacterial Vector version of it which is being created and you know a lot of big names are getting it and stuff that

[01:24:49] Brian Johnson biohacker dude got it and um I have yet to see any actual metrics of before and after muscle growth or anything of that nature he's kind of just produced apparently his fallest ston increased so presumably it's actually doing something it's just is that outcome of more F stattin actually binding enough myostatin to have an effect that is worthwhile and that is kind of where we get into by the way how is Fon measured is there a is there a um a certified assay for measuring fist tattin I don't think so I think they're using their own like internal measurement as far as I know so they have like their own assay that they've developed so I don't really know so we don't actually know if there's there's there might not be a validated assay for measuring this hormone this protein rather yeah I I couldn't say for certain that it's actually measuring it correctly so assuming that it is it is increasing it and then is that actually doing anything um you know the picture that you got sent was uh you know obviously looked pretty impressive and objectively to me it kind of looks like it has some of the

[01:25:52] Hallmarks of you know fit industry angles and like lighting manipulations and stuff yeah what are some of the so so yeah just to back up for a moment this discussion came out of um uh a patient sent to me something off Twitter which was like kind of a before after of someone who had done this gene therapy um but you know just for folks who aren't in the space including me um although I feel like I kind of can see the [ __ ] when I look at it but walk through the How do you take a pre and post photo and create the most difference cuz you've actually sent me pictures before of pre and post on the exact same day yeah and they look totally different so clearly there's no biologic difference but there's a huge aesthetic difference so what are the tricks that people use to manipulate photos shy of just straight up Photoshop

[01:26:44] I'm sure similar to anybody watching has probably had a cheat day when I say cheat day I mean just a day you go off the rails and eat whatever junk you want where you had horrendous distension of your stomach to the point where it almost looked like you're you know holding an alien baby or something like that is not uncommon for us to have all dealt with at some point some really bad digestive problems and a lot of times these before and afters are not actually shot and I'm not saying this is the case with this you know before and after by the way I'm just saying in the fitness industry pretty typical especially years ago when they could get away with more egregious examples of this and it's gotten a little bit better now but now there's Photoshop and all that [ __ ] but anyway you could and what is typical people would take the aftershot and they would get their pump you know they would make sure that they have heavy down lighting they'd be like oiled up potentially um they would be uh in the perfect circumstance essentially for even temperature Vaso dilation changes just in temperature veryy massively I could go and you're so you want a higher temperature presumably yeah so if we went in your gym and we cranked the Heat and I did you know five sets of curls five sets of something I could get my arm vascularity to look unrecognizable compared to what it is now and then I could walk outside and you would see me just like disintegrate in front of you essentially as it all

[01:28:08] Vaso constricts from the cold so that is something that is very abused in the before and after kind of um transformation shots where they will achieve a transient look that is not representative of them walking around and it is certainly not representative of the complete opposite circumstance that they do the before shot in so they will you know do everything perfect um and take their aftershot which is you know as good as they can possibly look with all circumstances accounted for which is actually shockingly as much as you say you're aware of it and you know how what goes into it and you can call obvious [ __ ] you'd be shocked how many people in the fitness industry still can't do that they be like how'd you gain 30 lbs of muscle in like 3 weeks it's like dude you should know this you watch these videos all the time come on so anyway and then you would take the before shot and depending how egregious you want to make it you you know go in much worse lighting after you have successfully downed you know four to 5,000 calories of processed garbage food and um so you actually are swelling you're so you're you're you're so you're so inflamed yeah think of everything you could do to look as horrendous as possible even down to the facial expression of looking disappointed on camera with how you know abysmal your physique is right yeah so you and of course you deliberately stick your gut out to exaggerate it yeah and it's not hard because you're so distended too it's just like you know exaggerated plus you're distending it plus you're looking disappointed you're fleing yeah you're rolling your shoulders forward instead of rolling them back you're not you know you have no pump you just walked outside you've been hanging out eating shitty all day there's a lot of things that it sounds like these factors are not significant enough to make this big of a difference until you see them all stacked yeah and if you haven't gotten to 10% body fat or less I can't highlight enough how dramatic it can really get like sometimes you will see a guy who's 150 lbs who's shredded in the perfect lighting circumstances the guy could look like a

[01:30:12] Mr Olympia competitor through angles lighting Etc and then you see him in real life with a t-shirt on you're like dude do you even work out like that's how dramatic it gets um so I don't know why people don't well I think I know why I think a lot of people have never got there to know what the difference is but when you're leing it's a pretty dramatic how much you can fudge things and it is abused to high Hell by people who want to sell things so anyway in this circumstance I'm not saying that's what happened like there was a pretty impressive before and after for what is supposedly I don't know if he used you know drugs alongside it that wasn't really at least clearly disclosed that the glance I took at the caption maybe it was but there was no change in nutrition and exercise supposedly and he looks quite a bit better but it also you know had a little bit of the you know the sniff test was a little bit like you're kind of like sticking your gut out a bit you know are you trying to look worse so I don't know like the guy uh it's I don't he seems like a nice guy the guy who's kind of like at the Forefront of um speaking about its utility and all the uh you know viability it may have in regenerative medicine and there's no viral izing outcomes either because it's not acting through AR it's like an independent mechanism so like it sounds cool in theory but the outcomes we see at least clinically have not been impressive enough for me to be you know floored by it so I'm not sure if the you know the Transformations we see online are typical or if they're you know a little bit exaggerated or what but um I think there's some level of you know potential exaggeration that comes with this stuff yeah and how much muscle mass are they because they did a sort of open label trial didn't they oh the phase one yeah yeah so they um I don't know if it's published now or if it I think he said it will be I think they're submitting it I don't know if it's been accepted anywhere yeah so it looked like the lean body mass gain was statistically significant but not that impressive from what I recall it was like 2 lb yeah so like and then what do they have like inflammation markers which were kind of like stayed the same yeah there was no the only P values to my recollection that were uh statistically significant was an increase in lean body mass to you said about to the tune of about two lounds [Music] um I think there was something else I don't remember what it was maybe a slight change a slight reduction in body fat oh intrinsic biological age so I don't know if you you want to speak to the validity of those tests cuz I think you're there is none okay so I there's none those are those are meaningless um I think there was about a 1% decrease in body fat that was statistically significant if my memory serves me correctly yeah I don't know if they can it didn't seem like they controlled for exercise or anything so I don't really know how like what the takeaway is yeah yeah I I I was surprised at how little the effect was if this mechanism matters um and it might not matter right in other words it might be the case that while you know knocking out the myostatin Gene at Birth produces a profound muscular phenotype attenuating the gene later in life might not do much um I did I did ask one of my analysts to look this up today um and um she she found an experiment where they took mature mice so you know call it like a two-year old mouse and they did a near complete um um block of the myostat gene so not 100% knocked out but like more than 99% of the um mRNA was deleted and it did increase muscle mass in the mice by about 25% but you know again 25% increase in muscle mass is significant but that's at basically completely knocking out myostatin where whereas if you do that at Birth as you said you're going to more than double muscle mass so that also suggests that you know best case scenario if you did this in a developed individual you're you know you're going to get big results but it's not game-changing and of course you know doubling or you know tripling fallatin levels which kind of indirectly work on this pathway it it's possible this would have no effect I mean you'd have to sort of see this studied more rigorously potentially with people who don't have a conflict of interest um which is also something you have to be careful of when you look at this type of literature um but I don't know I guess I wouldn't bet on it would be my two cents yeah yeah like I'm uh apparently there's a phase 2 trial that is happening either in Canada or Japan and then there's six month results that are more impressive that they're um highlighting so and these phase two studies are specifically for sarcopenia so I'm assuming they're recruiting people over 60 who you know look if you could add five or 10 pounds of muscle to somebody over 60 that would be really impressive um do we have any insight into how much training stimulus is required to produce these effects yeah I don't know what their phase two trial is going to Encompass or the inclusion criteria or anything but um I don't even know if they're using training in the phase two as a so it's tough for me to I just learned to me an interesting study would be a placebo yeah um a placebo group that trains yeah a treatment gr group that does not train and a treatment group that trains that would be a very interesting comparison yeah no for sure because I'd love to see you know Placebo who train to no stimulus treatment and then so you get two very elegant comparisons with those three groups yeah no that would be great and like this stuff has definitely been hyped for years so if there is a way to actually get the finally like does Fall thatat and work in humans and produce an outcome that is you know something you could uh you know avoid anabolics entirely for the Androgen sensitive that might otherwise need anti-catabolic action in later life or in a burn scenario or whatever like that seems like pretty useful to flesh out cuz sarms definitely didn't pan out the way you know Pharma had hoped so if this was useful that'd be good to know um now what's interesting though is wasn't there a trend towards didn't everything move in the wrong direction I don't know if it reached statistical significance on lipids and metabolic markers oh yeah I don't really get it it's like a glucose resting glucose was elevated insulin went up hdlc went down yeah trigs went up ldlc went up so all of those things kind of moved in the direction you would not expect If This Were beneficial one thing that is weird is this follicle or sorry fist Statin when I was looking it up I kept seeing the FSH inhibition statements and I was like is this some sort of like precursor and I'm misinterpreting the acronym because surely it's not intertwined with f stimulating hormon but it turns out it actually used to be called like uh follicle stimulating in inhibitor hormone or something and it's like primary mechanism that was known was how it would inhibit the production of FSH at the pituitary which is really weird um that that is something that uh apparently the isoform used in this

[01:37:56] Vector is one that is less specific for that um component of what fatan typically does endogenously but that is I don't know if there's some off Target mechanism that is resulting in the the glucose aberration or whatnot but like I have no idea what would be causing it well it'll be interesting to see the phase two as you said and hopefully they they um they study it with a large enough sample size that you can sort of make sense of it yeah anecdotally there are some like big names that are using it and I don't know if it's Placebo or what or if some of them are getting good results and it's just like outliers or I don't know I don't really know yeah I got to tell you my um my interest in hearing about what celebrities are achieving using you know any sort of treatment is zero right and I'll tell you just for people to understand this nonsense you know it doesn't matter what celebrity X achieves using drug why if you have no idea how their diet has changed how their exercise has changed how many steroids they're taking alongside of it whether they're being paid to talk about it like all of these things so dramatically impact what message gets filtered down to people that um you know I I just don't think we could work hard enough to increase the scientific literacy of people to help them make sense of this yeah and uh just notable by the way for anyone watching who's not a member of the drive like this is why I pay for your membership is like the trust factor I have your stuff is like above and beyond any piece of content I consume essentially like there's no bias there's no Financial incentive even to the degree of you don't push companies you're an investor in like it is just legit facts totally unbiased here is Peter's opinion with no incentive inherently manipulating my opinion whatsoever like so I just want to say I really appreciate what you do and anyone who's not a member you should go be a member right now thanks very much I really appreciate that um okay I want to Pivot a little bit to talk about something you made a video a while ago I thought it was a great video um I don't know how long ago you made it though it was all about kind of appetite suppression tricks that bodybuilders use that I and I think the purpose of the video is hey for those of you most of you who are not bodybuilders watching this who still want to shed a few lbs these are some kind of tricks that that that can be used dietary tricks so do do you remember some of that list yeah and

[01:40:25] I do want to preface when I say this that when bodybuilders are trying to get very lean it gets to a point where you're pulling out all the stops to an extent whereby it's not necessarily reflective of what is the optimal healthy diet sometimes it's to the extent of short of any attempt at micronutrient density how do I hit my protein and satiate myself to the maximum extent and fuel my training with enough carbs and have fat that I don't have hormone suppression and that's like those those are the metrics once you get to the end of a dieting phase now that's not necessarily indicative of what everyone's going to do because most people just want to see you know a a hint of abs for the first time so you know you don't need to take this to the extreme yeah I mean I I didn't I interpreted your video as this is the full Suite of things you have you wouldn't do all of them simultaneously you kind of pick and choose from this list with what works but correct um yeah

[01:41:23] I I guess I just definitely want to make sure because people watching your stuff know what high quality food is and I do not necessarily advocate for these in all circumstances but like diet soda quite useful for calorie restriction in my opinion for maintaining some you know satisfied uh Sweet Tooth um I think lay has published a really good video recently highlighting that even compared to water it I'm not suggesting replace it with water but in a state of calorie deficiency if you have a craving you're probably better off drinking a diet soda than you are eating some you know calorie Rich fat Laden sugar bomb dessert like even some of the keto treats that you see that are marketed as you know healthy and you know diet conducive often times like look at the nutrition facts you'll note the calorie component is horrendous so just because the sugar content might be low the fat content proportionately to make it taste good is like far more destructive to your actual body composition goals so that is something of note as well um some of the first things I do typically that are low hanging fruit or try to maintain the same volume of food on my plate but just replaced with more calorie light options so as much as I love the micronutrient density of red meat and it is one of my go-tos I will consider swapping some of it to chicken breast for example not necessarily saying to do that long term but it is certainly an easy way to maintain if I'm having a 6 oun portion of meat in a meal to hit my protein needs having a you know lean chicken breast as opposed to my you know ground beef that I had at the grocery store the difference in calorie to protein content is pretty significant so that's one of the first loow hanging fruit things I do is see how can I replace what to me perceivably is the same amount of food but just with lighter options so that will be going from you know a fat filled Greek yogurt to maybe a more fat-free Greek yogurt and it doesn't taste exactly the same as you remember it but it's pretty damn close and the calories are perhaps you know a fraction as much and you're still getting proportionally the protein you need um swapping some red meats to whites um eggs going from some eggs with egg yolks If you sprinkle in some egg whites with it as opposed to just all whole eggs you can still get yolks in get your micronutrients but it almost tastes IND discernably different when you have just maybe like one or two of them replaced with egg whites as opposed to the whole egg like there are little things that are just noticeable but not enough for you to consider it oh my God I'm in a deep deficit right now and it's like I'm starving you almost don't notice and that in itself just even three things I mentioned you probably could have chopped off 500 600 calories from that much yeah an egg is 80 calories per large egg I believe could be even higher depending on how large it is and then an egg white for the proportional amount of protein I think is like 30 off the top of my head could be wrong on that but something like that um you know chicken breast I think it's like 30 calories per cooked ounce depending on you know this is why I like uh Wild game because you're still getting red meat but it's super lean yeah this this is one thing I was going to ask you on our uh podcast for my channel too is like you pound these venison sticks that are so leant and great like how would you as a budget friendly person go about getting your protein with the most lean uh Cuts CU it's not always the most like you know it's pretty cost prohibitive to get the really good bison venison stuff like that yeah I mean it's I one option is if you want red meat and you want to be to do I think you just you you go hunting right like if you think about it like if you if you shoot one one large deer one you know elk that's going to feed your family for more than a year see this is unconventional advice but that is like actually practically applicable advice for what is budget friendly yeah and by the way like if you you know people would say oh my God like how do you shoot an elk I mean you know it's impossible to get elk tags to shoot big elk well guess what it can be a cow elk like a cow elk a female elk like those tags are over the counter anybody can get them these are not you know you're not hunting so nobody like there's no you go states regulate how much you can hunt um you get incredible meat from the cow um I would argue that's the healthiest thing you could eat frankly is is is Wild game because these animals are completely unstressed um so anyway I think I think there's I think those are those are options if you're sort of doing it on a budget because um you know the amount of meat you would get out of a cow would more than feed you and your family for a year H what would you think

[01:46:23] I don't even know if this is the right question to ask but because I've never hunted so I don't know what this looks like as far as you know the cost to get your uh what you need to hunt with um whatever licensing you need yeah how many states this is viable in and then also skill level like does it take a long time to even get to a point where you could successfully achieve it depends if the big divide is if you wanted to bow hunt versus rifle hunt um it's much much quicker to get there with a rifle than a bow okay but also I I truly believe rifle hunting is more

[01:46:55] Humane um a person who's a really good shot and believe me it doesn't take that long to become a really good shot with a rifle um you know you would be able to to shoot an animal within um you know inside 300 yards or 400 yards and the animal would die immediately so there's no suffering involved um I that would not be a terribly expensive proposition um now maybe the first year it is but remember you amortize the cost of your learning and you know a gun and things like that out over the cost but I I mean

[01:47:26] I'd have to sit down and do the calculation but I think that would be less expensive than if you were you know spending that much money on meat for sure because you're going to get thousands of dollars worth of of meat um from from that huh definitely sounds better than what I used to do which was buy really shitty frozen chicken in boxes at Superstore so yeah I I think

[01:47:47] I've said I'm sure I said this before on podcast but the you know the more I've you know eaten you know and migrated my diet more and more towards Wild game the the less I can really tolerate I mean I can't eat anything that's farmed like I the the even chicken chicken is just so nauseating to me in general um but anyway you know that's just everyone's palette is somewhat different yeah that's one of the problems with getting exposed to better food too is you develop this refined palette where the stuff you used to get away with that was super budget friendly and you lived on you thought was fine now tastes like horrendous but anyway side um yeah some of the things like I think the meat um discussion is definitely useful like I I hadn't even thought of that so that's worthwh to note and and how much of a I mean like what's your advice to somebody who's trying to lose weight um but in a sustainable way so not like in some ways when bodybuilders are doing it it's not really sustainable because they're really starving themselves down to a competition and the way that they're eating during that period of time is you know it's it's so catabolic um that that they're destroying their endocrine system along the way but it's short-lived and they're going to refeed when they're done and and so while we can talk about all of the different things that they they might stack and do all simultaneously um you know what's your view on the sustainable way to lose 10 pounds and keep it off in terms of deficit I think your perception of what bodybuilders do as far as aggression towards their diet is on hinged on their final outcome and how steep it is to get there cumulatively but the way they arrive there no one is more mindful of preserving tissue than bodybuilders so in other words they're not they're not creating huge deficits at any one point in time eventually they are at the point that they absolutely need to but they're more careful than any human I know oh yeah I would believe that so if you were to try and take away from a bodybuilder how would I apply this when stepping on stage at literally dice to the socks 5% body fat it's not that you're getting there it's that you're stopping at like the eight week out from competition Mark of a bodybuilder maybe not eight maybe like 10 or 12 but the process they took to get even there was very staggered calculated they would not reduce and by the way 10 to 12 weeks out what's their body fat relative to that five they're going to step on stage like it depends at what level and how on track they are but yeah some of them are starting at like you know 12% body fat so perhaps that's not you know everyone has different goals of what they consider good so maybe this is like my skewed

[01:50:31] Fitness perception saying 10 we out bodybilder is what you should shoot for but just in general the process they take to get from their Peak body fat percentage to Stage lean no one is more mindful of titrating accordingly the macronutrient and micronutrient input to sustain training volume too because they need to actually make sure their training doesn't deteriorate cuz if it does they're going to lose tissue so yeah taking from that you see them at least hitting one gram per pound body weight in protein like without fail and they will hold that until the stage unless there is some like maybe on the week of they're already at their target body fat and then at that point they're trying to do tactics to make their stomach as you know not full of anything as possible so what they do on the last week doesn't really count up up until a week until the week out they would still be taking one gram of protein per pound of body weight typically and to your point at this point you can't be doing that with steaks because there's way too caloric so you are on the chicken breast protein powders depending on the person though and I guess it depends on again the quality of your meat because it's like I've seen the macros on your

[01:51:41] Venison and it's basically protein yeah so um basically the staggered approach you want to take is that you don't really want to lose more than I think typically it's like 1% of your body weight per week is a general rule of thumb which is I guess could be depending how obese you are could be a little bit aggressive but even let's just say a pound a week maybe is like maybe a more reasonable Target but in general if you are and this is kind of a perhaps a more applicable cookie cutter recommendation one gram per pound of body weight which I think everyone would essentially agree with in a deficit to sustain um tissue lean tissue muscle mass then from there you want to be whatever your maintenance calories is which is you know it might take a little bit of finagling to figure out what this is when you've never done it before but there are calculators online that roughly ballpark give you what will be plus minus 300 calories or something of what it takes to stably hold your body weight for um like if you ate that diet it wouldn't go up or down what I do typically is I take that number and I say use your exact diet for a week with this calorie amount like this is your diet model and this is your totally calorie goal for the day eat exactly this every day and then see what the average is at the end of the week cuz just going by daily fluctuations could be wildly different you might jump up or down based on water based on food volume based on if you took a dump or Not by the way when did bodybuilders come off creatine they don't they'll take creatine to the stage yeah they used to think you should come off because it's bloating but and I'm sure Lane would tell you the same but most of the water weight is in the muscle yeah like it it is helpful for cosmetic appearance and for sustaining training uh performance got it okay so it's anti-catabolic interestingly enough it's one of the only natural compounds that may inhibit myostatin too so it has that upside um and it's like all the things it does from a neurological standpoint perhaps fertility it's even used for depression now in women at like 10 plus grams or something which is crazy so a lot of use cases are coming out but overall we all know it works for muscle um for performance in the gym as well as volumizing the muscle would you would you say creatine is hands down the best over-the-counter supplement for performance for sure yeah can't think of anything off the top of my head that would be superior depending on your sport though cuz if you're yes if weight is everything if you're a cyclist or a runner you Pro you the negative the downside of the extra 5 lbs of lean masses perhaps yeah but um so yeah um making sure you're getting your you know you have some sort of number you're going to adhere to and you know how to measure every day which basically is just reading every nutritional label you have and becoming intimately aware of what you're ingesting if you put something in your mouth you count it regardless if it's a sauce regardless if it's a drink regardless if it's a lick like you you count that [ __ ] and do do most bodybuilders use like an app to do this or can they just keep track in their head after a while after a while they are so in tune with it you can look at a piece of meat know how much it's going to shrink after cooking know how much how many ounces it is how much that equates to in protein uh calories like everyone at a high level eventually you become it becomes so ingrained that you don't even need to track it because you can literally look at it maybe you'll keep the calorie count and the protein count but you know what you're looking at and it can just write it down quick you don't have to go look up and cross reference you know on my fitness pal what is a chicken breast 1 o cooked equal so you're can at least look forward to even though it's cumbersome and arduous at the start eventually it becomes so habitual you'll just know it so you have a Target calorie amount and you eat that every day for a week and you see if your weight goes up or down and if it goes up you know you're eating a bit too much if it goes down you know you're in a deficit and you decide from there is the weight loss too fast if you lost three pounds in a week perhaps it's too fast and you want to kind of like tight trate it back up a little bit but ultimately you can kind of shoot for once you know your maintenance some amount of calories where you're dropping you know 300 I feel like is a good deficit to start at because ideally and this is kind of the whole General approach without getting way too boring for everyone is you want to keep your protein where it needs to be which is a gram per pound you want to have enough carbs to fuel performance which depending on what sport you're doing can vary but without getting too complicated a good split a lot of people follow is 40% protein 40% carbs 20% fat and this is kind of like a ratio that allows you to sustain uh hormone production and have some amount of fat that supports it um carbs for some level of gym performance and then protein for hopefully hitting your goals and it'll depend on the person and modulate accordingly but that's just a general framework people can start with and you can so that's a pretty lowfat diet is yeah you would the fat and the protein would typically stay around neutral and you would typically lower the carbs accordingly depending on how intensive your exercise regimen in sport is but in general I feel like that's like a minimum amount of fat that would be like no lower than that is kind of what I'm saying so yeah and and what are some of the concessions a person has to make to get that low in fat like I don't I think

[01:57:15] I'm probably literally the last time I tracked my macros I was almost exactly one/ thir 1/3 1/3 between the three h um in general when I didn't and I didn't feel like I was like eating a ton of fat right it was just typically when you are eating meat you will achieve the majority of that through the fat content of your meats and it will depend how lean of the cuts you were getting how many eggs you were eating at the time but I'm just thinking like you know the the olive oil and the salad and stuff like that yeah but I guess that's like you know they're they're just cutting that out yeah like olive oil and a salad is uh one of the first things I would be looking at as you probably just added what 200 to 300 calories to a big salad for sure if not more yeah so unless you're Brian Johnson are willing to get like 25% of your calories from oil um probably not a bodybuilding conducive uh macro allotment cuz it's like it's not even though fat is satiating it's nine calories per gram so where where do bodybuilders get the majority of their fiber typically it will be through veggies if they're having them and those are going to be proportionately lower calories I suppose but often times fiber is not um I don't know some of them use like supplements too like celium husk but I'm not to say that I don't want to get to like a fiber debate necessarily

[01:58:39] CU I don't even know like what the actual answer is there but in general bodybuilders aren't really paying right they're not optimizing for health if we believe fiber is healthy they're optimizing I'm not saying neglect it like I think that it is important but I don't think that I I'm certainly not saying remove your fiber in order to achieve your deficit I'm I'm just saying that you can proportionally get to your goals almost certainly by modulating carbon take essentially exclusively typically and that's going to be in the form of starchy carbs then yeah and like you can modulate the type of foods you're eating too to accommodate the satiety is ultimately the takeaway like from me cuz when it comes to actually describing the nutritional lure I hate it as much as you dude it's not like something I like to talk about oh how much fiber should you keep in like I I don't know man like a decent amount like some but enough that you can go to the washroom properly and it's you know some healthy amount but ultimately what I've seen in the bodybuilding space is modulating carbs up and down accordingly based on needs in the gym and protein stays at an amount that is anti-catabolic or conducive to muscle protein synthesis and a surplus fat is some amount that at least supports steroid hormone production ction as much as you can tolerate and then carbs is like the most performance-enhancing macro in terms of actually driving your performance outcomes in the gym volumizing the muscle having glycogen topped out Etc and from there I I would typically recommend a 300 deficit and literally milk that as many and up in that week prior to show how many calories is a bodybuilder typically down to if they're stage ready and they're natural and like sub 200 lb like they might be down to you know below 2,000 calories potentially if they're a top ifbb professional Mr Olympia competitor who weighs 260 you know they could be at 2500 2600 it kind of depends on the person which is interesting for many people listening that sounds like a lot of calories still but you're saying given how big they are and that they're still training pretty hard that's a that's a pretty big deficit it also depends how much they're willing to lean into cardio cuz some guys will actually prefer to just diet thems into the body fat and not do any cardio because they just don't like it wouldn't recommend that though because one thing I have learned over the years is from a nutrient partitioning standpoint actually moving when you're eating is going to produce a better body composition typically than trying to just diet the whole deficit so what we see even in like the ifbb with these top bodybuilders who are trying to not get fat as they eat exorbitant amounts of food and they're on insulin and HGH and huge amounts of anabolics they are doing things like going for walks after they eat their meal which is more potent than metformin at controlling blood glucose like they're actually making sure they are moving around and actually shuttling nutrients as much as they can even outside of the gym some are lazy and don't do that but the ones that are trying to make the most use of maximizing the calories I see so the the mo ization doesn't require that you you know you're clearly not going to oxidize everything you ate like if they just ate 800 calories they're not going to burn 800 calories on a walk of any duration but just getting out there and walking you're saying leads to better fuel partitioning seemingly yeah interesting and I think that is and you can correct me if I'm wrong I mean I've certainly anecdotally noticed the Improvement in blood sugar yeah yeah like it's uh even for stabilization of like energy levels too like making sure you're not hanging out on a couch with your Spike blood glucose seems to be pretty impactful not just for mental performance but also for uh you know partitioning and actually optimizing body composition too so and that's an enhanced ranks at guys eating exorbitant amounts but anyways back to the layman in general you're in a 300 deficit you kind of milk that for all you can and by that I mean the biggest problem and I guess one of the biggest takeaways from this whole discussion could be that the people who aggressively cut way too fast will end up losing more weight off the bat but they will end up in a state of adaption faster whereby you are basically going to not only expend less calories at rest via the depression of like non-exercise activity thermogenesis which is like fidgets and moving with just like your everyday activities you will actually start to subconsciously do that Less in addition you are pushing yourself to a state of nutrient deprivation much sooner than was necessary to achieve a fat loss outcome so rather than trying to lose you know six lb in two weeks why don't I go with you know like one to two lbs at most and actually milk what I can out of that little tiny calorie increment before I decide okay do I need to then add some more cardio to my regimen or do I want to decrease food by another 100 calories or do I want to add you know metabolic enhancing pharmacology you can actually make the call at that point because you've exhausted the actual increment and you know you're not unnecessarily depressing hormone production and also putting yourself into a hole of what is essentially a malnourished State because if you push too hard and you go from let's just say you're eating 2800 calories a day and you instantly drop to 1,00 you will lose a ton of weight off the rip and it you'll think oh this is great and then very soon you will get to a point where it's like holy hell I am starving this is not sustainable what am

[02:04:29] I doing what do I do next I plateaued now and where do I go from here it becomes easy to dig yourself into a hole if you're not careful about this like titration down essentially so I typically recommend trying to milk what you can until weight loss has averaged out at neutral for at minimum a few days but typically a week and then from there cuz as a natural you are very susceptible to Major aberration and hormone suppression if you are going to deprive the hell out of nutrients and especially if you're doing huge amounts of cardio concurrently because you think that's what you need to be doing also don't put yourself in a hole on the energy expenditure side like try and do what you can in a titrating manner based on you know I sometimes wonder if my low testosterone is in response to how much fasting I used to do because I used to always do a a check of testosterone pre I I would do full blood work before and after a fast so if I was doing a 7 to 10 day water only fast which I was doing once a quarter MH um the the change in hormone levels after 7 to 10 days of nothing was profound so if my testosterone started out at 5 to 600 it would probably end at 1 to 200 total T if my TSH was you know two it would go to four if my maybe even higher maybe even six but free T3 and reverse

[02:05:59] T3 if free T3 was you know 2 and a half to three and reverse T3 was 12 so the you know the the higher the free T3 and the lower the reverse T3 the better thyroid function you have post fast that free T3 would go maybe from three down to 1 and a half and the reverse T3 would go from 12 to 32 damn yeah not surprising yeah um and so I just wonder if you know repeating that cycle over and over and over again um has has has maybe impacted um endogenous production although interesting my my thyroid function looks Stone Cold normal um but it's just that you know my tea is very low yeah I would be interested to see like what your gadat tropin did when you went back to normal dieting at that point and then how you responded from there cuz if you could see like a trend in your testicular response to and how your brain yeah was shooting things out that would be that'd be interesting but you know what about things like carnitine caffeine what what role do these play in in uh weight cutting not nearly as much as good diet choices so I would love to get into the fat loss pharmacology momentarily but one thing there's a lot of diet hacks that you know we could take all day talking about so I don't want to bore the audience but one thing I do want to mention that is super impactful is protein ice cream I don't know if you've ever had this stuff but there's this thing called a ninja creamy and it's basically a mixing device ninja is like the like the blender sure yeah but this one in particular is very popular lately because of the consistency of ice cream that it creates what's it called ninja creamy like c r e a m i so it's not the blender it's a device that's different from their blender correct okay so this thing mixes what is already blended into an ice cream so you would put it in the freezer Blended and then you put it into this thing and it would turn it into an ice cream consistency got it and what do you put in it how do you make it um well it depends what you want to put in it cuz you could make this as healthy as you want which is essentially just like whey I slit plus some non-c calorie filled like sweetener that you deem you know if you if you want to risk it um maybe some uh sugarfree pudding mixture in there too like a chocolate or something and from there you could have something that is like you know 300 calories if even and is as good tasting as horrible ice cream but hits you know like a 60 G protein hit with super high quality stuff minimal sugar content is like 80% as good as something you would buy in a store almost like the consistently makes all consistency makes all the difference here cuz it's like typically and this was this was how it worked when I was younger and I first tried all this stuff is perhaps there was a similar device but at the time I was using a standard I think it was a I forget which blender it was from Costco but I I've tried a ninja a different one before another one I used to put in like huge amounts of ice um fruit you could do fruit too obviously and make it but basically the consistency I got out of it was not that attractive so it was not like you could tell it wasn't ice cream you're kind of eating like this sludgy healthy thing but this it's like you could make it near not identical but pretty damn close to a point that I would like I'm actually derailing our conversation to come back to it like that's how significant it is so so for people who are wanting that sweet tooth but if I make a protein shake what I'm going to use is real simple I'm going to use um almond milk or cashew milk so as my wife calls him nut juice um like a whey protein and I mix I'll typically mix the unflavored um what's it called oh God promix yeah do you know that brand no prom mix I think it's maybe I'm getting it wrong anyway it's unflavored way high quality way but I like it because it doesn't does and I'll go 25 grams of that with 25 gram of one of the other flavored ones but that way it just cuts I still get 50 gram but half the flavor CU I find them so sweet and then frozen berries and that's it yeah yeah you can make imagine that not drinking it but actually eating it and it takes you know 10 to 20 minutes to eat but the consistency is that of actual ice cream so I would BL blend that in the blender and then put it in this ninja creamy thing and stick that in the freezer you would put it in the blender and blend it yep and it would be in this thing that you would freeze overnight and ideally you would have your wife or somebody mass mass blend multiple so you can just stick it in the thing um but anyway once you have these Frozen ones you stick it in the creamy and then it mixes up a serving of ice cream for you and from there you would have the same macros but it's infinitely more satiating right cuz it's going to take me a lot cuz liquid doesn't satiate me very much and it's not it's not even just the speed of ingestion though too that's part of it for sure but there's just some psychological component of eating something and one of the things I can say too as lwh hanging fruit for dieting and chopping many hundreds of calories off is immediately anything you drink unless it's water if you can switch it to some sort of solidified format you will be infinitely more satiated maybe not infinitely but like a significantly more satiated so no juices no nothing like see if you can make that into a a slush of sorts or something that you would I'm instead of that tequila I like to have I'm going to make like tequila sticks like I want to freeze but alcohol doesn't freeze this is the problem I can't make little tequila popsicles I know some people who do like protein popsicles pre-workout popsicles they do the ice cream they do like protein brownies like so much stuff that can be done when you get creative it's just you need to have a significant other Who's down to do it it's the only problem why why you need your significant other if you like cooking and you like spending time on that stuff then perhaps that's fine for you but like at least for me and for a lot of dudes out there it's like I don't know SP what I'm missing something here this isn't like that time consuming right you're just you're blending this stuff up and you put it in the freezer I'm I'm more talking about some of the more creative stuff like the brownies and stuff like that I see yeah but even even for me maybe I'm you know people might just call me lazy or far too optimizing like I will not do anything kitchen related if I could oh man I love cooking yeah that's a you know blessing for you then cuz that's you can get real creative and actually enjoy the process for me I'm like I really hope I can throw it in a microwave and cook it and it's still high quality food yeah okay so let's talk about some of the the the fatloss pharmacopia uh the fat loss pharmacopia so um I have friends that swear up and down by carnitine El carnitine I think they inject it is that so tell me about that so the L carnitine is um present in red meat and depending on your diet you may or may not be deficient in it and it is something that can help uh um incorporate free fatty acids into the mitochondria and help you produce energy and it also is implicated in certain indirect processes like AR content in the muscle which is some of the more Fringe literature but it seems to in the presence of sufficient anabolic stimul ation actually increase the expression of what you can get out of your testosterone input so this is the main reason why people I know use it and presumably why a lot of people use it that you know too is it's often advertised as get more out of less

[02:13:37] Androgen essentially but does this work if you are getting sufficient carnitine in your diet do you need super super physiologic doses well in general if you're injecting 500 Mig for example like you will be Supra so it's not something similar to creatine you can make the argument that endogenously or through your diet you maybe get enough to satisfy um like maybe you're not going to saturate muscle stores but I mean it is it's not analogous to creatine but it seems to be at least in supplemental form and this is something you inject subq daily depending on the volume CU it is depending where you get it could be 200 milligram a milliliter 500 a mill and you can only put so much oil subq or water sorry it's waterbased subq before you have lumps so even though it's more easily absorbed it's still not something you want to be injecting milliliters of like typically subq shots you want so are we back in the same problem of like where are people getting this stuff typically compounding pharmacies or online or they're making it themselves cuz it is just an amino acid that you could just buy anyways so home brew sometimes but the reason reason they're injecting it typically is because home brew how are they sterilizing the water and I'm not I'm not a chemist who's going to explain really how you would do it but it's the same process by which you would make your underground steroids presumably so it's I mean and other words this is a bad idea yeah yeah maybe this is an awful idea unless you know what you're doing cuz some of them are like pretty I don't know intelligent but

[02:15:14] I still wouldn't risk it even if I had the instruction manual personally yeah so in general though there is pharmaceutical not grade but like compounded versions that are made in an environment that's been at least fact checked depending on the rigor of the pharmacy in question of course because you've done many uh deep dives into compounding yeah which I recommend people check out yeah we did it I think we did an AMA where we covered the the the ins and outs of compounding and even with compounding pharmacies there have been enormous breaches of um of good manufacturing processes and that results in contaminations of legitimate FDA approved molecules like cortical steroids that have led to literally thousands of deaths so you know it's one thing when people are compounding things without good manufacturing process that you'll take orally because the gut is a lot more forgiving yeah um but the moment you start talking about things that are injectable and now you are injecting something in yourself that's dirty you know that could be a huge compromise so yeah anyway I I I uh I I hope there ways for people to vet that stuff yeah um how effective is caffeine both in terms of its effect on appetite and potentially its effect on fat oxidation by the way I did I want to touch on cartine quickly the reason people inject it is typically because the oral format is only about 10 to 15% bioavailable so you have to take literally 10x the dose to achieve the same yield outcome and then in addition to that when you ingest things like cartine and Coline there is a potentially unfounded but still potentially concerning scenario where there is tmao conversion so when you ingest a lot of carnitine like four plus grams to get your yield that is enough to actually have some sort of effect that has shown to have some hopeful AR content upregulation which is still like a fringe thing you're seeking that may not be ultimately founded you are using an amount that is going to have some level of conversion that you could avoid by injecting yeah so you are averting the need to use as high of a dose and in addition to that you are potentially avoiding some level of risk from gut related circumstance some people use Allison with it to kind of like circumvent and try and prevent tmao conversion what's Allison it's from garlic and it seems to attenuate tmao conversion in the gut but it's also like a fringe application with like a hopeful outcome that I guess you can measure in serum your tmao before and after Allison versus not and see if there's a difference but are there any clinical trials that demonstrate any efficacy of injectable or oral El carnitine with carnitine the results are mixed some of it looks promising and then some of it doesn't so this is one of those things where you largely go by anecdotes and with it being a natural amino acid a lot of people that use it it depends on their Baseline circumstance too the deficient will obviously get more exactly like you could sort of see a see a scenario where somebody's like a vegan and a huge benefit obviously then you might see well maybe the risk is worth the payoff but if you're an omnivore who happens to eat red meat I don't know maybe maybe it's less so I'm sure if you saw the data you would not be convinced that it's worth trying so I'll just put that out there for people who watch your stuff I don't think that they would blindly want to inject this so this is a the reason people find it very attractive is because it works through a different vector people anecdotally have seen muscle growth outcomes on the same dose of anabolics or lesser so and a grow leaner when they use it so it's not like there's literature to show when you're on testosterone plus carnitine you get better results than just test but that's what people claim and seems to be at least somewhat reproduced anecdotally but you know that's uh speculative I would not hang my head on that and be like I recommend for sure you take this so just putting that out there um I don't think it's a potent fat burner by any means which is like the subsection we're kind of talking about as far as caffeine super reliable one of the best things you could do you know where the data lies for upper tolerability and safety I think the FDA even has like a threshold amount that they say you're good to take it's like 400 which is pretty significant um and yeah you can get some level of increased energy expenditure from that but largely the benefit from the stimulant category I would say comes from the increase energy you have even as you go deeper into a deficit as well so as you enter into nutrient deprivation territory it becomes a lot harder to even move subconsciously let alone actually fuel your everyday activity so I'm not to say you should become a caffeine addict to support your deficit that's not necessarily sustainable but it's if you were going to use something to help attenuate an energy deficit or you know one day where you need a bump like caffeine is certainly a reliable way to

[02:20:20] DOA that increases metabolic output but also reliably increases performance in the gym and has appetite suppressing qualities and has safety data simultaneously so I would you know pretty blindly recommend caffeine for most people short of like special circumstances you mentioned yimin earlier let's say more about that so that is a alpha 2 adrenergic antagonist and when it comes to some of these like adrenergic type type receptors it gets kind of confusing cuz some of them will have like even though it's an antagonist of the Alpha 2 receptors it will have stimulatory effects but contradictory to what you'd expect from a stimulant that's not vasoconstrictive the same way you might get from a amphetamine or like essentially any other stimulant that works well so this stuff raises adrenaline signaling very significantly and there was thought that it could liberate free fatty acids via adrenic signaling that you could then you know like take advantage of during exercise now is the energy expending component of it worth hanging your hat on I would say no but the adrenaline inducing component is substantial enough that some people really really enjoy the use of it in their training and get a uptick and energy that is markedly different than through a adenosine receptor antagonism which is caffa yeah so like it feels much more racy and aggressive than caffeine and it's almost like a sub how does it compare to like ephedrin ephedrin I believe is a beta 2 receptor

[02:22:04] Agonist off the top of my head could be wrong on that but it is less euphoric I would say and more like adrenaline spiking so you feel more like it's almost borderline anxious to a degree where you have a sense ofy does it last um yohimbine halflife can't recall off the top of my head but it's relatively short the type of thing that people take for the workout when they're in calorie deficit typically you would take it before cardio or before training is the typical application but interestingly enough it's also used as an afrc and can enhance erections which is weird because you wouldn't expect that from say and also like that doesn't seem like the right mix of things to be super anxious and you know irritable sure yeah but it has the that's one of the things where it's like is this a drug for you cuz if you happen to get an uptick in performance in exercise performance and then also you get some sort of uptick in libido and or enhanced bedroom performance later in the day could be attractive it is not something that is uh I would typically reserve it for a deficit whereby you have tried all standard low hanging fruit options and you're kind of okay now I need to actually boost my energy and some way that is not like I'm at my wits end for

[02:23:32] I can't lower cardio do more cardio or reduce my intake of calories anymore without it being overwhelming or I'm just in like a very deprived energetic state or I got low sleep and I need to acutely modulate it so I don't use it I wouldn't use it as much as caffeine caffeine I would like very easily recommend daily use in a diet I think this is something that's more use case specific and not as reliable one of the clinical scenarios that I I see a lot of that I think plays a significant role in um the state of overnutrition right so you know again I've talked about this when I look at somebody I want to know these three things really quickly right are you overnourished or undernourished or adequately nourished are you adequately muscled or under muscled uh are you metabolically healthy or not um and depending on where you fall in that

[02:24:21] Matrix like you have to decide whether calories need to stay the same up or go down now one of the scenarios that is I think most clinically vexing is the person who is uh overnourished typically metabolically unhealthy typically underused so that's a pretty common phenotype right you're a little too fat you don't have enough muscle and you're not metabolically healthy um and a big part of the driver is the uh uh basically the hypercortisolemia that accompanies sympathetic overdrive so an individual that is under so much stress chronic stress um that you basically can't stop the glucocorticoids from chronically being catabolic to lean tissue and anabolic to fat tissue um and you know when you think about all the other endocrine scenarios like we have ways to kind of manipulate them this one we don't really right so you know you there are certain things we can do you can use ashwagandha you can use phosphole Serene um they certainly help with sleep in that setting but what what I mean do you know anything or do you have any insights into ways to kind of manipulate that person's physiology in addition to pulling the important the big three important levers around nutrition sleep and um and obviously exercise yeah and by the way the Alpha 2 receptor antagonist yine and Alpha yine which is a bit better of a drug in my opinion are definitely not the drugs you want to take if you're in the hyper curtisia right and that's what made me think of it is when you brought them up

[02:26:08] I'm like well that's actually producing a phenotype that a lot of people are in chronically yeah some people the use case again it's not like it's indicated or anything but some people get a significant L better appetite suppression effect out of those particular drugs too than something else that might be where you would look but anyway that aside as far as actual anti-catabolic action the most potent thing I'm aware of is actually anabolics there are certain ones that are more potent at antagonizing the glucocorticoid receptor and actually compete with glucocorticoids for binding and that's where they get their anti-catabolic action in a deficit so something like oxandrolone not that you can get it now which we can talk about but that in like burn victims it is literally indicated for antagonizing the heightened cortisol you know glucocorticoid response that you get from being in that state so it is one of the most potent anti-catabolic drugs yeah so what what what happened there

[02:27:04] Alexander loone was also was Alexander alone scheduled Des it just baned Al together what's the status of it so my understanding and I may be not entirely correct but it was FDA approved for many indications and then basically the FDA determined based on and this seemed like kind of a nonsense thing but uh a meeting in the 80s where they determined that anabolics in particular anavar by extension had no efficacy anymore essentially and for whatever reason they determined that that decision back then if you go far back enough you can find studies where they're like anabolic steroids aren't performance-enhancing and it's like obviously nonsense but at that time that was what the literature available showed and it almost seems like they're leaning they're you know they're leaning on some of that in order to justify pulling it we don't think it is useful for all of these approvals anymore and then there's pressure from that for all of these companies that have generic approved versions of it to subsequently pull it as well what motivated that sorry so the FDA pulls anavar which is the Branded version of aland yeah anavar is made by a pharmaceutical company and I'm referring to oxandrolone the chemical not anavar that's understood but they're speaking to the molecule not not the Branded drug yeah my apologies sometimes it's easy to conflate what the Layman like you know speak for these anabolics is to exist but I'm just saying like then it doesn't really matter who makes it isn't this a ruling directed towards not just the company that makes anavar but even a compounding pharmacy they would make

[02:28:46] Alandra yeah so they are saying that there's now no approved use for oxandrolone in totality so if you are a Pharma company who has a generic version of it or you're compounding pharmacy that makes it like there is no approved use for it so you presumably can't justify the prescription of it as a doctor unless you're you know can somehow lean on a I guess it's not even off label because there's no well that's what I was about to say so is the implication that if there's a patient in a burn unit and a physician there says we've been using alxander loone for years and it's got great results can they override that uh for for a exemption I you would be able to tell me hopefully I'm not sure man like I I would think yes I would just imagine there's higher risk to actually prove that it was a necessity than it used to be so and then where do you get that filled some Pharmacy that is you know a bit of a cowboy Pharmacy that's making it I'm not really sure so what I do know is compounding pharmacies are making it as of now still and the Pharma companies that had generic versions of it have pulled voluntarily their own approvals essentially so these companies that had like oxandrin which was what I know to be what used to be anavar which was sold like multiple times and alexanderon is taken uh SL it's taken under the tongue right if you get a trochi from a compounding pharmacy you could get a sublingual format of it but it's typically a pressed tablet that you just pop and you would take it twice a day

[02:30:24] Orly yeah what and what about isn't that kind of apatot toxic if you if you take a little bit but it's one of the least hpat hepatotoxic 17 Alpha alkal anabolics there is so if you look at the pharmacology of it it is metabolized by the kidneys proportionally more than any oral agent and that creates a superior uh hepatotoxic outcome where it's not nothing but it's lesser than oxy methylone anadol or like you know

[02:30:55] Winstrol or some of these other ones or St you know stanazol is injected right or is that also oral that's typically taken orally but it's also injected in water base but that's almost no one does that bodybuilders do but it leads to infections very often so they often don't do it now yeah to me listening to this all roads point back to like nothing seems to matter more than what you eat when it comes to body composition what you eat and how you exercise right oh for sure like I could like all this other stuff is like a rounding I mean it's like it's 90% um exercise diet and testosterone and then it's 10% all of the other stuff yeah and I think a good note to make because the last time we spoke we had talked about you know the development of pharmacology and what is leading to the change in physiques as of recent and I said in order it was like drugs and then uh diet and then training

[02:31:59] I don't even remember what the order was of the last two but that you know it almost doesn't matter when drugs are like that important for achieving the outcome on a Mr Olympia stage Al but and this is the caveat that I definitely want to make clear here if I wasn't in the first one just in case what you just said that 90% of it is this like you do not achieve even the outcomes from anabolic without the support of a like great infrastructure of diet and training and sleep so as much as it can be a bandaid for shitty all those things you will achieve a fraction of the results even on anabolics if those are not in check like I've seen I've even done it myself as much as I don't want to admit but I've talked about this publicly when I was younger I thought you know what would it look like if I just did uh like I've seen hyperr bodybuilders do fluff workouts and get crazy results and being the guy who wants to experiment with everything like maybe I'm just working too hard maybe

[02:32:54] I'll try like the fluff Phil Heath workout I saw or something on YouTube turns out it doesn't work for me at all and I basically wasted you know a full cycle of exposure to these compounds to get almost nothing out of it because my training was kind of half-ass so having that Baseline regardless if you're natural or enhanced it is the fuel to actually support the recovery that may be at an enhanced level with anabolics but like it still doesn't exist without these things so yeah 100 has someone done the study of testosterone replacement therapy in an in a non-active individual who doesn't change any behavior and how minimal the changes are yeah so the

[02:33:41] Boston study which is like the standard graded dose response study that everyone's familiar with um that one had from um he had two different studies that were using 600 milligrams of testosterone one of them was graded dose response 600 a week or every two weeks a week holy cow so kind of 6X physiologic dose essentially yeah and the other study that I think was done in the 90s was doing 600 milligrams of testosterone versus placebo in a non-training training and then also on the testosterone non-training training individual by two yeah and what they found was that the obviously the 600 group who trained got the best outcome but the group that didn't train and took 600 test still had better lean body mass outcomes than the training placebo group yeah which kind of spits in the face of what I just said a little bit although that's 600 milligrams is yeah so as much as you almost need to see that on 100 because and you also have to draw it out over the span of a training career like you're not going to sustain Perpetual muscle growth and some of that is ultimately when you take steroids for the first time there is a temporary increase in lean body mass metrics that are essentially and you could probably speak this better than me like unquantifiable by you know like standard metrics of measurement to body composition CU ultimately the way these work is not just through the production of you know uh muscle protein syn synthesis and contract St tissue it's also like the increased intracellular water that you would not hold otherwise and the increased blood volume and increased this these are things that although they're not contractile they are still making up your muscle which is largely water so even though they do try to account for like total body water that is not you know like muscle based you are still some confounding level of you know the drugs actually facilitate this as the desired outcome so you know there's going to be some of that in the outcome regardless but I think you know it's it's unquestionable that anabolics you know even if you're not training will produce a level of muscle that is higher than if you had no hormones like that's definitely an outcome yeah to wrap up any any um influencers online you're particularly excited about as far as like just the amount of buffoonery that's going on any anyone that uh particularly has you excited I mean one of the things you're known for is kind of debunking uh the charlatans you've done a you've done some legendary work in this which we'll we'll link to some of your best videos on this but but is there is there anybody you're looking at now just sort of shaking your head at like how is this person fooling so many people yeah um I guess we've talked about him briefly Gary Brea seems like he has he has a lot of good information don't get me wrong I don't want to turn this into a [ __ ] on him you know parade necessarily but the guy very heavily emphasizes the importance of getting Gene testing for like a limited amount of snips that are ultimately very common to find in general population and then making wild extrapolated claims from that that assert all of your ailments and problems could be attributed to this and then he has good information that's General about lifestyle training sleep hygiene but then he'll sprinkle in these like aggressive claims about methylation if you have you know your homozygous or c677t MTHFR which I am and a lot of people are almost everybody is yeah then you need to be taking this exact blend of methylated B vitamins and this and he speaks very articulately eloquently confidently concisely and it very much gives the impression that this guy knows something you don't know and you should be following his advice because he ultimately is the one who transformed

[02:37:58] Dana White's physique too and Dana White speaks very highly of him and I don't know man like some of the products he sells it's like he has a $140,000 red light bed he has like um does does that improve methylation I don't know I I have no idea to be honest I I would assume probably doesn't do a lot of anything but I haven't even looked into it to see cuz it just never even occurred to me as something worth looking into but it seems a bit expensive you know objectively it's you know borderline you're in like low-end exotic car territory essentially for a [ __ ] bed that emits light on my face so I'm a bit skeptical and then you know he has other stuff but in particular his Gene testing

[02:38:46] I don't know man like it's just like it feels how much how much does it test thing cost I think it's like 600 bucks so $600 for a genan test yeah so it's like assessing for example if I got a 23 and me and I had my data I could submit it to Ronda Patrick or somebody who has one of these like automated reports and get something as comprehensive or more so with you know no suggestions to buy stuff after that either just like straight up here's the interpretation based on everything we know about these

[02:39:16] Snips and it would tell me if I had methylation impairments and I mean we basically we do all of those tests as part of a standard blood panel and it's basically free yeah yeah I've uh I know that the MTH ofr stuff is also in your uh yeah it doesn't it doesn't cost anything so I mean $600 seems a lot given that you can do a whole genome sequence now three billion base pair we're not talking Snips whole genome sequence for $300 today damn that's crazy yeah I don't know man but then you get his you know interpretation of it which is you know it almost feels like he's hoping you have one of the most aggressive methylation impairments so he could point to it and say Here's why you feel this way like that feels like what

[02:40:00] I'm gathering from the content or you know oh you clearly are a worrior because of your CT polymorphism here like this is why you are so concerned about like little problems that you shouldn't be ruminating over all you need is some Sammy or whatever and it's like I don't think that's like I feel like even if you are right you got a needle in a hay stack cuz there's so much that goes into genetics that is beyond these like maybe common Snips that have some impact like for example if I'm the most methylation impaired sure I'll look at ban or whatever to lower my homosysteine like totally reasonable but like don't assert it's the root of my you know everything that's wrong with me or I don't know like he highlights it as it just like comes AC a little bit disingenuous to me and I really do wonder how much of it is him perhaps deluding himself cuz he speaks so confidently it's hard to believe he's this good of an actor or just genuinely doesn't know which I think is unlikely but I mean like he goes on the biggest podcast in the world and spits you know the complete misinformation says that T4 is methyl in the gut to T3 and like all yeah so if if you have a gene mutation if or if your MTHFR is messed up like you will not convert T4 to T3 and that's why you might have hypothyroidism like that was an assertion made recently on

[02:41:25] Joe's podcast which is pretty [ __ ] wild to me because Joe is actually hypothyroid and has been for a long time so you're basically appealing to some like actual medical condition he has saying you have the answer and it's your like cheek swab thing and it's like I'm highly doubtful that's the case and I'm nearly certain that methylation is not the thing that converts T4 to T3 it it absolutely most certainly is not it's a series of enzymes called diodes that make those conversions and U that to my knowledge has nothing to do with your

[02:41:57] MTHFR Gene yeah Chris Master John had a really good video recently that kind of like summarized it all and um i' I would recommend people check out his stuff if you want to know anything about methylation you've had had CH on the podcast super intensive and great podcast by the way really enjoy that one we'll link to Chris's uh discussion on that um anybody else out there that's got you excited I don't know I guess

[02:42:19] Brian Johnson's an interesting D do we talked about um briefly Brian Johnson the liver King other Brian Johnson the vegan King I don't know Hees he he doesn't have a nickname two Brian Johnson's in the world yeah and shockingly as like prolific as each other just in their own way so yeah this guy is like the total antithesis of that guy's diet model he's like eating sludge vegan [ __ ] on camera every day and saying it's proven by data to be the you know the answer to longevity but um I don't know that guy he like uh he's done the fall Staten thing he's done tons of stuff he's on you know Tel themir linking peptides he's on you know thymus regeneration enhancing peptides ones that are all banned now based on the thing or at least you know Category 2 um he he's on like a billion I don't think

[02:43:10] I've ever seen somebody on more stuff than him like his protocol is endless and I'm like how do you control for anything at this point like you're adding in the other day he added in oral minox at 22 Mig which is you know super outdated anti-hypertensive that causes edema and like all these arthia is he doing it for hair growth yeah but it's like okay you've added that in which could affect myriads of things that are also affected by the 77 different things you're on right now like how are you other like obviously hair growth is a pretty easy metric to count but when you're counting Health metrics on organ function and stuff I just don't really get how he's controlling for everything granted no one else is doing it so it's it's interesting but I'm also just uh I watch with skepticism about what is going to come of it if it's going to become this you know monetary incentivized hype train or if he's just going to produce the data some like noble billionaire dude who's just doing it for the good of longevity Community or what but I know he's interesting um but um what's up with Mr V shred uh I don't know because I have my

[02:44:16] YouTube premium so I don't see him yeah you got to get on that dude did you do it last night I didn't do it last night I'm going to do it get on that um what what is what is what is what is vshred do um he it's like I don't even know where to start with the worst things he's done but well I just like what's the the business model is I I don't despite having seen the commercials I still don't actually know what to do because I I have that skip button that I use in general I think his go-tos are here's your body type quit is and you tell me if you're like an Ecto meso or mes uh endomorph I don't remember the types at this point but and from there I will tell you the diet that you need to like actually get lean because you've been given misinformation by everyone else this whole time and then you end up with his Pro you're Ecto more if you're already lean yeah so then if you're an

[02:45:09] Ecto more you don't you can do whatever you want is that the is that the takeaway I've I don't know man like his I've heard his programs are pretty cookie cutter and it doesn't surprise me cuz he's like a he's clearly a hammer you at scale I'll just recruit as many people even to the detriment of my credibility kind of guy so I don't think he gives a [ __ ] what happens but also very old school marketing but like

[02:45:32] Harvard has discovered this secret ingredient that they've been keeping from you and it's the secret to Fat Loss I figured out what it is and it does xx and x and it's like a 15-minute commercial where he's hyping this thing up and you've invested so much time to find out what it is even if you're you're thinking there's no way I'm going to buy this [ __ ] you just want to find out what he's going to say at this point it turns out it's like capsacin which is from like Peppers or something and it makes you feel a bit hot and it's like okay so I waited for you to drop the caps on me now what and he's selling me you know a fat burner that has some negligible amount of caffeine and capsacin and like four other things which is like pretty typical old school marketing that is not that great and certainly not ethical and then he'll sell it for like $130 even though it's worth you know it costs like $4 to manufacture the bottle costs more than the ingredients like that's how bad it is but he's giving us a discount because you know we made it through the video and you know we're clearly so instead of 140 you'll you'll get it for $999.99 yeah yeah but on subscription subscription you don't run out of course of course yeah he's doing us a service so yeah that's one of the worst ones

[02:46:39] I've seen though was him pretending to be on the Joe Rogan podcast I did see that little commercial that was unbelievable yeah I don't know if Jo C and I haven't sent it to him but like dude that was it was almost ingenious level unethical like to actually think because you know without even having to say it that's what people are thinking oh this guy was on the podcast he's probably a trusted Authority on X whatever he's talking about Joe must trust him because he's asking about what he should do with his diet and he's just sitting there like confidently you know

[02:47:10] I know it's complicated but this is how fat loss works let me tell you the secret you just need to take my body fat Chris Joe so go to vshred.com whatever and it's like surely people fall for it cuz you know you see the ad over and over again so it's like that means it's working because he's dumping the ad dollars into it so yeah the guy is uh I don't know I feel like that guy needs to change his name and get like plastic surgery at this point to avoid the the damage he's done to his credibility like from people in the industry who know who he is and it's just like an at scale Hammer as many people as I can with ads kind of model which yeah it was interesting that you're served up him so much cuz it's like well it's funny you know I haven't even seen an ad for him in months and it's funny like I there was a period when I was getting them nonstop I wonder if there's a way to like selectively exclude certain like demographics or something cuz surely knowing that you said he's a huster and you see his ads all the time and you were starting to say some stuff about him publicly doesn't help him so I don't know I don't know if there's a way to get that granular on the ads but that's interesting yeah well my friend this was interesting uh the biggest takeaway for me here is I need to get one of these ninja creamy things I'm really curious to to see if I can up my protein shake into ice cream game so um well let's order one of those things right now yeah

[02:48:40] I'm down I let's go get you YouTube premium Perfect all right thanks man thanks for having me [Music] no
