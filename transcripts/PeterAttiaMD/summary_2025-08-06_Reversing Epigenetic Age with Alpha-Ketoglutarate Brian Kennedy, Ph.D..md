This clip is from episode #357 ‒ A new era of longevity science: models of aging, human trials of rapamycin, biological clocks, promising compounds, and lifestyle interventions | Brian Kennedy, Ph.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- Chronological vs. Biological Age – Peter explores whether biological clocks can outperform chronological age in predicting lifespan and health
- Development of Clinical Chemistry Clocks – New “second-generation” biological clocks are being built from standard clinical data
- Superior Mortality Prediction – The second-gen clinical chemistry clocks predict mortality better than ASCVD risk scores and some epigenetic clocks
- Hospitals Are Taking Interest – Hospitals prefer these models because they're based on tests they already understand and use regularly
- Actionable Health Insights – Doctors can act on this data—like treating LDL or hypertension—potentially reducing biological age and mortality risk

## AI Summary

Based on this transcript segment, I'll provide a partial analysis focusing on the discussed content:

**Executive Summary**:
The episode features a discussion with Dr. Brian Kennedy about alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) and its potential role in aging intervention. The conversation focuses on research findings regarding AKG supplementation and its effects on lifespan and healthspan, particularly highlighting the importance of time-released formulations.

**Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- AKG is a central metabolite involved in hundreds of reactions, similar to NAD, and is part of the TCA/Krebs cycle [00:01:11]
- AKG levels decrease with aging in organisms [00:01:11]
- Mouse studies showed:
  * 5-10% increase in lifespan with AKG supplementation [00:01:42]
  * Dramatic improvement in frailty measures [00:01:42]
  * Synergistic effects with vitamin A in male mice [00:00:28]
  * Combined effects with vitamin D in both sexes [00:00:28]

**Supplements & Medications**:
- Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG):
  * Time-released version is crucial (regular AKG dissipates in 5 minutes) [00:00:28]
  * Product mentioned: "Rejuvenant" by PDL Health [00:00:28]
  * Combined with vitamins A and D in commercial product [00:00:28]

**Notable Quotes**:
"If you did not extend lifespan by a day but you just improved healthspan, that's a home run." [00:02:01]

**Research Context**:
- Studies have shown AKG may reverse aging by a few years based on methylation clocks [00:02:21]
- Ongoing controlled placebo double-blinded clinical trial testing time-release AKG without vitamins [00:02:21]

**Follow-up Questions**:
1. What are the specific mechanisms through which AKG improves healthspan?
2. What are the optimal dosing protocols for AKG supplementation in humans?
3. Are there any contraindications or potential side effects of long-term AKG supplementation?
4. How do the effects of time-released vs. regular AKG compare in human studies?
