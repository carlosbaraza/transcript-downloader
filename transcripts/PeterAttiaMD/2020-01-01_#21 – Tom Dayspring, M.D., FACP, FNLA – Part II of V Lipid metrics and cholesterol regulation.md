## AI Summary

Here's my comprehensive analysis of this episode of The Drive podcast with Dr. Tom Dayspring:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on lipid metabolism, particularly the complexities of lipoprotein structure, function, and regulation. Dr. Dayspring provides detailed explanations of cholesterol synthesis, transport, and metabolism, with special emphasis on the historical development of lipid science and modern understanding of lipoproteins. The discussion is highly technical and covers everything from basic lipid structure to complex regulatory pathways.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Lipids cannot circulate freely in plasma due to their hydrophobic nature; they require lipoproteins for transport [03:01]
- John Goffman discovered different densities of lipoproteins using ultracentrifugation [06:05]
- ApoB is the key structural protein that never leaves certain lipoproteins [10:46]
- The brain makes its own cholesterol and is independent of plasma cholesterol levels [13:44]
- Cholesterol cannot be metabolized for energy in humans [47:58]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal recommendations:
- Don't rely solely on total cholesterol measurements for cardiovascular risk assessment [21:45]
- Consider both LDL-P and ApoB measurements for better risk assessment [34:55]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Caution advised regarding phytosterol supplements [51:48]
- Discussion of potential risks of phytosterol supplementation [52:59]

5. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- LDL particle number (LDL-P) is more predictive than LDL cholesterol [35:37]
- ApoB measurements provide better risk assessment than traditional lipid panels [36:42]
- Non-HDL cholesterol correlates better with ApoB than LDL-C [28:16]

6. **Notable Quotes**:
"Atherosclerosis is just the evidence of illegal dumping where a lipoprotein instead of bringing lipids wherever is supposed to be bringing it was bringing sterols to the wall." [04:50]

7. **Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the optimal testing frequency for ApoB and LDL-P?
2. How do different dietary patterns affect lipoprotein particle numbers?
3. What are the best interventions for reducing ApoB levels?

This episode provides an exceptionally detailed look at lipid metabolism and transport, though it's highly technical in nature. The information is particularly valuable for medical professionals and those with a deep interest in cardiovascular health and lipidology.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com hi everybody welcome to episode 2 of 5 in the week of Dayspring this episode we cover lipoprotein basics what's lipoproteins and lipids 101 we talk about Goffman in the ultra centrifuge and how we came up with these hold ideas of densities of lipoproteins we get into very specifics around the lipoprotein structure their function and their metabolism we talk about how to measure the lipoprotein and the cholesterol content and what NMR is and how it has changed the game a little bit we get into the distinctions between LDL cholesterol LDL particle number and a PO

[00:01:15] B there is some confusion here amongst physicians and presumably amongst patients so hopefully that will clear that up we get into the biochemistry of lipids and then we talk about sterols specifically as a more broad category now before we could measure anything to do with lipoproteins if my memory serves me correctly it would have been the late 40s very early 50s when the first assays were developed maybe was 1951 that could actually just measure total cholesterol so you would take plasma from a patient you would presumably in an assay break down all of the lipoproteins and just aggregate the total amount of cholesterol and you would yield that number which still amazingly shows up on a panel today you go and get a blood test and it might say your total cholesterol is 200 milligrams per deciliter so that was in my correct that was the early 50s maybe no I think they were analyzing cholesterol along for that because I was that's a molecule you can take blood and dissolve whatever you got to dissolve and cholesterol appears so they had cholesterol measurements for a long long time so like the first lipid nobody could ever measure what you're talking about in the fifties is where John Hoffman discovered that hey wait a minute there are no lipids floating around in plasma because lipids are incredibly hydrophobic your plasmas water you can't have lipids circulating in plasma so lipids obviously have to be within what I call water-soluble lipid transportation vehicles and that turns out of course to be a lipoprotein a protein wrap the collection of hydrophobic and AM PP thick lipids that just wouldn't be in your plasma unless they're attached to a protein Peter mention albumin it's a protein so lipids can attach to albumin and be circulated around and other type proteins but albumin is the most frequent protein in the blood so it serves as a carrier I think an albumin can carry like 17 molecules of cholesterol a few of phospholipids to so it's it's a player out there we got a ton of albumin in our plasma as you'd be shocked to find out how much cholesterol is in it not quite as much as albumin is kind of an amazing protein it'll carry hormones it'll carry just about anything has everything to do with osmotic pressure 's and things like that so albumin is kind of an essential Deena say talese performing many many functions but when John Hoffman a physicist by the way who had physicists have been playing with Ultra centrifuges for a long time separating their radioactive particles and stuff he somehow wound up separating lipoproteins or saw things floating around in a centrifuge a test that he then identified as the lipoproteins so if you learn nothing else today learn the first thing is lipids for the most part go nowhere in the human body unless they're a passenger inside a lipoprotein so if you believe there are a lot of lipid associated diseases and I certainly believe atherosclerosis it's cannot have a thirst grossest without a star wall and lipid being in your arterial wall and I know that artery arterial wall didn't over synthesize sterols creating a sterile buildup somebody had a delivered of steroids there and that of course turns out to be a lipoprotein and one of the places the lipoprotein should never deliver sterols to to any serious degree of course is your arterial wall intima so being a

[00:04:50] Jersey guy one of my standard jokes on a lecture circuit was atherosclerosis is just the evidence of illegal dumping where a lipoprotein instead of bringing lipids whoever is supposed to be bringing it was bringing sterile city wall and over decades you got a problem you know we could do it for a few days six months you're not gonna die so when did it become clear so Hoffman figures out by first principles basically he imputes that there's got to be something that is transporting this very very hydrophobic molecule through plasma it doesn't you know I mean it's it's easy in retrospect to make light of what an observation that is but the next observation would be it would lead to be spherical right I mean it's it's to optimize the volume in which you could transport it would have to be spherical you're a mathematician a volume of the speaker third power the radius so if you're gonna devise the transportation vehicle it's a few and far the most that Jacque you know so how long was it until I mean I know the answer this question but I just have to sort of tee it up who then went on to figure out these things occur in different densities it's not just one there's not just one spherical molecule that's transporting these things because this is a beautiful story right I was

[00:06:05] Hoffman he noticed that there and they weren't calling maple being a particles at today but there were different densities there were gigantic so explain what you mean by density because this term you know we talked everyone knows low-density lipoprotein Haydn's little bit would tell me what where that terminology actually came from well I think it has to do with water has a certain density so it's wetter things float in water or sink in water we know rocks sink if we throw it in a pond so they're very dense things whereas other things float on top water they obviously are less dense than water is so everything is relative to water there so if you establish what you think is the density of water things that float so when he separated these things InnoCentive fuge the lipoproteins or these fat balls that didn't move at all we're obviously very buoyant some sunk just a little bit so they were less buoyant but still pretty boy and some went right to the bottom of the test tube obviously incredibly dense and it turns out what makes a lipoprotein Boyan is a ratio of its lipid fat content because I think we all know fat floats on water or if proteins check out the molecular weights of proteins really heavy they sink so they're the rocks so your density of a specific particle here a lipoprotein particle is gonna be related to its lipid content versus its protein content so our big monsters that are delivering as I told you triglycerides but have a lot of phospholipids on our thing they have some proteins but they have so much lipids they float there the buoyant ones and as they lose the lipids they become smaller they might lose a few proteins as they shrink but they're really using them but they're fundamentally concentrating protein as they get some I mean because when you look when you go from chylomicron even though they're not the same lineage so I want to be very careful you'll explain this in detail you do not go from a chylomicron to a

[00:08:10] VLDL to an ideal to an LDL to an HDL there are three separate lineages I just described but in size they loosely track as the smaller they get the more they've concentrated protein within every category of lipoproteins B you talk chylomicrons which intestinal ii produce v LDLs hepatic produce and the classic teaching is as VOD else becomes smaller you call them intermediate density and low density we now know the liver can make utilities without making a VOD l first high densities which form themselves in the things sort of go the opposite way whereas the vo the O's in kylos come out as big monsters and lose lipids and become smaller and denser the HDI was a gathers lipids becomes bigger and more buoyant but within every class of lipoproteins you're gonna have a heterogeneous range of densities from big species to small species and this is why to me I like to tease because you always hear people talk about the small dense LDL within every lipoprotein classification the smaller particle is always more dense then so that's a redundant system just tell me dense LDL just say small early I know it has to be denser if it's dense I know it has to be small compared to its sister particles within that family or so somehow small is only been applied more frequently to LDLs cuz that's the killer one or hdls oh my god you want to have the big hdls another joke that's turned out for a long while if you don't have big hdls you're in big trouble or so and if you got the small

[00:09:51] LDLs you're in the biggest trouble that basically turns out to because if you have smaller leo's you need a ton of them to carry whatever your lipid load is so you got a super high LDL particle concentration if you have small LDLs and that's more related to its pathology per say than the size not that that won't cause certain functional characteristics as helio but the VLDL the kylos canal big in a shrink now the reason though that differentiate chylomicrons and the vo they ELLs ideals and LDLs is they have a lot of april proteins on their surface which they do lose as they shrink but there's one protein they never lose and it's the one that has the most mass of molecular weight April hyper protein B so that's why they are never gonna be as dense as an HDL particle cousin H cos doesn't have this monstrosity high molecular weight April

[00:10:46] B on it it's got other things far less lipids but to sum the LDL z' IDL's V Liz are always gonna be way more buoyant because it because they do have a little bit of an anchor on I'm creating two their densities that April B and it's the only as you study a proteins are probably up to 20 to 30 of them now all of which have certain functions that sort of directs a lipoprotein down which paths it's going a catabolic path the only a Poe protein by the way get definitions out the way

[00:11:20] Apryl protein Apel lipoprotein lipoprotein and April protein is the protein your cell makes once it binds to lipids it's called the napal lipoprotein and of course the whole particle itself is called a lipo so let me read synthesize that the lipoprotein is a spherical structure whose membrane is made up of mostly these phospholipids but also other lipids the a po protein is the thing that kind of gives it its signature so for example the chylomicron has a b48 the IDL VLDL and LDL have a b100 etc that's just called the a p-- of protein it's once the a p-- of protein and i assume its covalently bound to the lipoprotein that becomes the april lipoprotein and we short we abbreviate that a po fill-in-the-blank yeah so if I took a vo the L particle and later on

[00:12:13] I'll tell you boy on a VOD oh you're gonna find a PO c1 a possi - a PO c3 a bowi v and abundant and including April B but it's gonna lose everything but April B as its soon lose most of the other ones cuz they're transferable they can jump on different lipoprotein if they so desire to April B never does for a bunch of reasons it provides the structural integrity to that particle throughout to the existent but April B turns out to be the ligand for receptors that internalize those particles when you your body don't need them anymore so the LDL receptor did everybody so the ligand just forgives them some people listening it's like the key that fits into the lock if their receptor is the lock the ligand is the key and in biology that's sort of how everything works the key has to fit the lock correct and if it didn't and that lipoprotein is gonna stay in your plasma probably wind up going somewhere it's where it's gonna create a so so when was it figured out that a polite but proteins are going to come and go there's one of these ones that not only always stays but you have one because that's a big deal the realization that a poby 100 if you knew that concentration you had a proxy for how many particles you had yeah so Goffman certainly figured out there were proteins involved here but he wasn't applying that nomenclature to him and everything it's guys who further a few years further down the road Frederick's and Levy and

[00:13:43] Lee's stone we've we've talked about those with Ron Krause these are really there are some very important structural and functional proteins on these particles that we better start investigating and giving names to so their research led to the identification of them and ultimately I mean we know now the amino acid breakdown of every darn

[00:14:08] Apryl protein that's in our body or on our particles and everything so it's just when one researcher invents a little bit of the story other ones pick up the pieces and start further elaborating on it with different studies and technology improves and some of these things that were not a saleable at one point become that you can measure them and identify their structure and everything so it's one of these evolutionary things and and it just made such perfect sense to because we knew these particles are changing so they're undergoing catabolic processes why what's doing that and then all of a sudden you figure out that these ligands these April proteins are keys to various receptors some of those receptors pull the particle next to where the expression of a lipid dissolving ends I know lipase and it starts they'll all make perfect sense to use over time we've identified numerous of these enzymes that can contain Emmer's of the reset there's that temporarily buying these particles in place so they can undergo this thing ligands that lipid eight fill the particles with the lipids or d lipid datums so if you're listening to this and you're confused at this point it's okay one there's gonna be killer show notes but more importantly we're gonna take a step back now I'm a guy listening to this I'm a girl listen to this all I know is every time I go to the doctor he or she gets a blood test and it spits out the following total cholesterol equals this

[00:15:46] LDL and they won't even let it'll be worse it'll say LDL equals this HDL equals this triglyceride equals this and maybe it will say non HDL equals this what are those things mean in relation to everything you just said yeah first of all the misinformation on labeling lipid metrics is one of the things the miracle hasn't given me a stroke yet I do a lot of peer review I'm gonna associate that's why we're fasting you

[00:16:14] Tom Journal of Clinical lipid ology and I will reject a paper instantly that uses improper lipid metrics don't tell me you're the LDL is this because LDL is a low-density lipoprotein it's not a laboratory metric you want to tell me what the LDL cholesterol is the olio particle number is the lipid omix of an

[00:16:34] LDL is the LDL oxidized are not great we do have asses that will measure that so let's please all you don't identify yourself as an ignoramus and like I've told this to many of the top lipid ologist in a country let you stop telling people what your LDL ask them what is your LDL cholesterol what's your if we don't all talk to talk you're never gonna understand the process so this patient almost assuredly is talking about total cholesterol LDL cholesterol HDL cholesterol and non HDL cholesterol yes give you a quick and by the way Peter did mention something very quickly before I just wanted to expound he talked about hey April be 100 April be 48th April be is a giant structural non-transferable April protein that's on chylomicrons or vldls the intestinal machinery that synthesizes a column micron makes a certain type of a poby and the april-b that is made in the liver makes a much bigger a poby as a higher molecular weight so they knew the april-b that's being made in the intestine is much smaller so it turns out to be that the April be in the intestine is for the audio system the molecular weight of the hepatic produced staple be if you get into genetic April be to see April be 31 that has 31 percent of the molecular weight of what's considered a normal

[00:17:58] April B so when you hear April be 48 that should identify it as an intestinal e produced April be particle and a liver would be an April be 48 and LDLs that come out of the liver no should have April be 100 on it like the vo the our VLDL it becomes an LDL the April be 100 is still there or so so just keep if you hear a hundred or 48 what does that mean it sort of tells us the origin we are going to be talking about nuclear magnetic resonance and one of the parameters they used to give you a lot on less so nowadays is VLDL particle concentration when you analyze the lipoprotein using nuclear magnetic resonance it cannot tell the difference between a kala micron and a vldl because

[00:18:42] NMR doesn't measure the proteins it's hey that's a very big particle so it has to be a vo the other kylos most you're big but if you're fast yeah and even in a postprandial state kind of microns have half-life some minutes they're gone so the vast majority of Vol particle number via NMR is still vo but there could be some powers but I want to go back to our lady so her total cholesterol is 190 milligrams per deciliter so total cholesterol remember my premise that lipids go nowhere in the body unless they're within a lipoprotein it's not exactly true but for today's purposes that is true and certainly understanding lipid metrics that's true so total cholesterol would be the laboratory has separated all your lipo proteins from the serum and their take how much cholesterol is in this serum tube so where would that cholesterol be that they're analyzing well it would be found in if there were any chylomicrons there that were hanging around or maybe they didn't fast some of it would be called a micron cholesterol some would certainly be V LDL cholesterol a lesser amount because there's just so many so fewer of them would be intermediate density cholesterol particles and the would be in either LDL particles low-density lipoproteins or the high-density lipoproteins there are other types of LDL particles called ALP little a which we'll talk about so total cholesterol is all of the cholesterol it is every single lipoprotein it's in a deciliter of your plasma and that is directly measured it is not a calculation that is assayed so it's anyway there's always a coefficient of variability that's inaccurate and so if you want to use cholesterol for anything nowadays because let's face it that was the first parameter look dad in the epidemia may certainly correlated total cholesterol levels with the risk for heart disease but think about what I just told you it's the cholesterol within all the lipoproteins what is the if you counted particles what is the most numerous particle in your bloodstream the april-b particles well actually the HDL s are more but they're so small they don't carry much cholesterol so most of your if you want to put a parenthesis around atherogenic cholesterol would be within your april-b particles so if you want to ascribe any use to total cholesterol it's a real poor man's april-b level in general most people with very high total cholesterol levels will have a very high April beat up on there and that's the real reason their risk for atherosclerosis because those are the particles yeah I mean the original epidemiology basically said you know you have to sort of applaud them for doing the best they could with the tools they had but let's take total cholesterol which was at the time the only thing we could measure clinically let's take the patients who were in the top 5% and the patients in the bottom 5% was there a difference in their risk of

[00:21:45] MI and the answer was yes right now it would be another at least decade until Framingham it's kind of an interesting story right how I got this this part of the story got ignored in Framingham was that low HDL cholesterol and high triglyceride turned out to be 4 times more predictive of MI than high LDL cholesterol and again this is still crude measurements but that that's didn't come back into people didn't come back to try to explain why that might be the case until jarir even had sort of done his work on metabolic syndrome but

[00:22:19] I also realize I'm gonna get us off topic I want to go back to this other question so we've just explained 190 milligrams per deciliter means when it says HDL it really means HDL cholesterol as evidenced by the units so those lilies would be either be measured in millimeters per deciliter that's a direct assay or an indirect assay yeah so framing who of course did measure total cholesterol was easily they always did it they measure triglycerides too although they really had no clue what they were they related to us but it was measurable glycerides they called it glycerides back then and they did have a direct assay for HDL cholesterol they were you know you could also measure

[00:22:58] Clin you know you can send a huge particles you can take out the LDL fraction and analyze how much cholesterol is it and that's theoretically the gold standard you can separate the HDL product but that's too time-consuming nobody's got ultracentrifuge --is so to have real-world tests chemists had to develop direct a say so HDL assays were developed real early on so Framingham could not only measure total cholesterol they could measure directly measure not calculate HDL cholesterol what they could not measure and it took a long time was LDL cholesterol without interested with a ultracentrifugation without ultra Senta fication correct in the seventies somebody came up with a formula that here's a way of at least estimating or calculating LDL see which cook fire because by the seventies they realize the most numerous atherogenic lipoprotein were the low-density lipoprotein so as Framingham started calculating LDL cholesterol whoa this is the story here so they can clear what they're doing is they're directly measuring total cholesterol because you can just do that off serum they precipitate out the HDL right so you could measure the HDL without interest ultra centrifugation and you can measure triglycerides so now the formula for estimating LDL cholesterol became total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - triglycerides / 5y the triglycerides / 5 yeah sofrito wall put 2 & 2 together and realize hey total cholesterol is in essence vo LDL cholesterol + LDL cholesterol + HDL cholesterol a equals B plus C plus D so if I know parameter a and I know parameter D and I know parameters say I can figure out what parameter and so what he did was he said

[00:24:49] I'm gonna ignore chylomicron and IDL and LP little a well LP little a was at that point probably being not even it was being included in the LDL they basically counted it is the hollows are counted as vo the ELLs in the idea was counted as L do okay so therefore if I know the HDL cholesterol and I know the total cholesterol if I only knew V LDL cholesterol I could easily calculate what your LDL cholesterol was so then it becomes you have to know what is a VOD l particle and at least if you have a physiologically normal vo the L particle most of those lipids are in the core the particle no triglycerides on the surface no cholesterol ester on the surface if I only knew the composition of these particles I could figure out so they came to the realization at on average a physio at least in the 1970s a vo the L particle composition had five times more triglyceride than it did cholesterol and virtually in a fasting state all of the triglycerides are not an HDL they're not in an LDL we're not measuring chylomicrons because you're fit they're in a vo the L so cholesterol in the vo the L has to be triglycerides divided by five because there's one-fifth as much cholesterol and LDL particle Iser so v LDL cholesterol and triglycerides divided by five so now if I have HDL cholesterol the LDL cholesterol cholesterol you do to math you're a mathematician Peter it's very easy aha this is what your LDL cholesterol is and as they calculated that and they applied it to clinical trial data correlations are very very good and they knew that's probably where the money is because of our a bobeat particles the particles are that are the ones delivering these sterile city artery war the overwhelming majority of them ninety-five percent the lowest said 90 percent our LDL particles it's where the money is we need a metric of LDL in the calculated LDL see was earliest introduction to that now down the road people have developed direct assays of

[00:27:03] LDL cholesterol but you know what turns out it's not that much more accurate than the calculated V LDL cholesterol unless as you start to go up up up and triglycerides that calculation falter so which is something we're seeing more and more of today then we saw in the original Framingham dad who said oh boy if your triglycerides get above 400 don't use that calculation it's ridiculous so they actually develop the direct LDL see to give us a LDL cholesterol metric and people with triglycerides of eight hundred twelve hundred four thousand we're now you know what their LDL cholesterol is whereas the formula would be useless there we now know that formulas thoughts to become kind of erroneous that somewhere between a trigger 150 and 200 and the higher you go above 200 be careful with a calculated LDL cholesterol and rely on direct LDL see but and here's what nobody realizes the only value that calculated or directly measured LDL cholesterol brings to the table is it's a better poor man's estimate of your LDL particle concentration then is total cholesterol so an LDL cholesterol would

[00:28:16] Carl a better with a PO B or LDL particle concentration and would a total cholesterol down the road a little bit we've come to the realization and if we get another calculation called non HDL cholesterol that even better correlates with april-b or LDL particle concentration than does LDL cholesterol so that's why that's the new thing that's involved we also thanks to your I know you spent a little time down in

[00:28:42] Hopkins some of the lipid guys down there have invented a much better calculated LDL cholesterol which they're trying to get incorporated rather than they older calculation the freedom all that how we been using forever in most labs entirely whose nowadays or so so NMR which is you know my first exposure to

[00:29:02] NMR was in high school when we were taking organic chemistry and you learned that we had these tests I still remember how fun these tests were where they would show you an NMR spectroscopy and you had to figure out what the molecule was by knowing where those spikes were so was Jim hot post the guy that first figured out that you could use that stuff to actually count the number of these a PO B's yeah I think office was certainly one of the early pioneers and over father time the real pioneer who evaluated lipids and lipoproteins using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy he knew that lipids would emit specific spectral signals that he could analyze and through very complex mathematics turn them into a variety of lipoprotein metrics including you can do an NMR Oh

[00:29:56] LDL cholesterol level and allyl triglyceride level in the future that's one of the ways we're going to be measuring phospholipids on various lipoproteins is NMR spectroscopy because this Peter says every lipid has a different spectral signal and if you know what you're doing you can look at a spectral signal and know what its molecular composition is and everything so Jim turned it into you know as we had all these lipid metrics that we're talking about cholesterol even triglyceride metrics deep down the guys know these are just poor man's way easily a sayable ways of quantifying lipoproteins and it's a quantification it matters in many cases or so so we have to it turns out in the long run it's the the number of april-b particles that primarily is what forces it into the artery walls very little l I mean there are other factors but that's the number one was that when was that pathophysiology first stumbled upon that it even mattered how many of these particles you have vs so let's just take out the estimates and let's assume that you have the ability to measure the total cholesterol concentration within an LD particle which is what's showing up when someone gets a blood test and it says direct when it says ldl-c direct that means they've actually measured it so now it's better than Frieda Wald's estimation but that's different from if you have an NMR where it says LDL P an animal per liter and that's counting the number of those particles so one is the number of particles the other is the amount of cholesterol contained within them we'll we'll get to what a revisiting of Mesa and Framingham made unambiguously clear which is one of those predicts better than the other but was that really the realization that it was a gradient driven process by number or was that understood beforehand or at least hypothesized beforehand and then more more verified by the experimental evidence early on they discovered it was the april-b particles going into the artery wall and delivering these star walls and everything that set off this maladaptive an inflammatory process that led to a whole other area of investigation or so so the particle number data came once they sort of identified in a way of a cing particle numbers and they almost evolved that this may be April became a little bit first but Danja mafiosos work on LDL particles came at the same time and it clearly became evidence that April B is a better risk factor and remember there is one April be on every VLDL IDL and

[00:32:32] LDL but 95% of the April B particles are LDL so April B is just a way for the labs to report to you what an LDL particle concentration is our foes identified in LDL particle concentration using these methyl signals coming out of the methyl groups that are on cholesterol ester and triglycerides and phospholipids and translated into a particle number that Wow either a PO B or LDL particle number correlates a lot better with clinical events or the presence of atherosclerosis you haven't had an event but if we do some imaging and we see plaque in your wall then does the cholesterol measurement per self so it's not a surrogate of particle our particle measurements april-b or LDL

[00:33:19] P so april-b is an LDL particle metric what too many people get lost there a VLDL particles are in April B particle so VOD LS are prime there's no doubt that vldls can get in the artery wall and contribute to it but it's like a minor the number of vldls that get into the artery wall are infinitesimal the number of kylos that get in are infinitesimal compared to the number of

[00:33:45] LDL particles so yet are all bad guys they and a vo the L per particle have significantly more cholesterol molecules in it than in LDL but there are just so many more LDLs that collectively the LDLs deliver more cholesterol to that artery water by the way gives us no information on vldls it's an LDL particle metric you can't use it for anything else so don't call me up and say my a PO B is high cuz I got too many V LDL particles unless you have a rare lipid disorder where there are no LDL particles the type 3 this beta lipoprotein emia that's the only time in April B is measuring it's a VLDL measurement or a remnant measurement it's not an LDL measurement but everybody else

[00:34:30] April B leop those are the tests you need because although they correlate very well with LDL cholesterol if they're both high in a given person that person's a terrible risk but as you well know and probably because of the metabolic make up of our existing humans at least growing throughout the world now is some people have a very high

[00:34:55] April Bo the LP very good LDL cholesterol some people have high LDL cholesterol perfect April B LDL particle counts when those metrics agree they're said to be concordant hey use them both either one will give you the same information but what happens if you get a patient where they don't agree these metrics in virtually every single trial ever looked at the risk follows the particle metric more than the cholesterol metric so the only way to know who is discordant with a cholesterol metric and an April B or an LDL particle metric is to do both of them you could also say hey if I'm just doing

[00:35:37] April B or an LDL particle count I don't even need lipids and I'd agree with you except I think there is value in knowing what a triglyceride is for other reasons so who uh that's the real key and if you ever go to a doctor and you're told I'm very happy cuz your LDL cholesterol is normal so you also my doc but by the way what was the April be your LDL particle count and if the doctor didn't do it you demand you do it instantly cuz otherwise you don't know your lipid related risk yeah we're gonna upset a lot of doctors here because I've already and you've already been in the business of that where people will hear you talk or something or read something you've written or something I've written and they'll go to their doctor and say hey I want my LDL P or my tipo B and the doctor says that's nonsense that you know fill in the blank TBD bla bla bla bla bla and it puts patients in an awkward position I mean I really feel bad about this because especially on depending on what country they live in at least in the United States I think anybody can go to LabCorp directly and get the assay without a physician's prescription but it upsets me I think the patients even have to do that it upsets me that something that is such an important metric I would list LDL P as one of the five most important metrics

[00:36:47] I've talked about this that every patient should know their LDL P or a PO B and that that wouldn't be sort of fundamentally a part of screening somebody for disease and that a patient would get into a position where they're having to argue with their doc about that is it's disconcerting and look hopefully this is sort of why I do these podcasts is I think it's just as much to help physicians say look just because I didn't learn this in my training doesn't mean I don't need to sort of pick it up today amen and I'm sad there's so much what I consider inferior lipid care being administered by health care professionals in the United States but there's nothing I can do about that it's try and teach them one at a time or expose my writings and other people's writings and the data on this as much as

[00:37:33] I can and is tragic with public health problem number one or number two that this is lag so far behind in part [ __ ] by guidelines and third-party payers who just don't want to pay for different metrics and such other reasons behind it but a big part is they don't understand it you have had cardiologists call you up I have had being recognized as maybe in northern New Jersey one of the hey hey Tom you know you told my patient that you know what I said about LDL cholesterol doesn't matter cause you've done an LDL particle and book you know not everybody believes that or they give you some horse [ __ ] like that and I said

[00:38:16] I'm gonna say hey doctor would you like two hundred manuscripts delivered to your desktop tomorrow I'll do it if you promise me you'll read them every single so you know it is what it is I think the Internet is help people in certain ways I think the Internet is confuse people in a lot of ways too because there are people out there who what we just talked about and it's pretty much that who become deniers of the particle concentrations because whatever else they're exposing as their way to cure heart disease somehow aggravate oh the old particle can they just choose to ignore it and look are there people with high LDL particle counts who don't some help yeah they're out there but the overwhelming amount of literature says the odds over if you keep this for twenty thirty years you're going down you until somebody does a serious study showing there are people who can escape this ritalin you're playing with fire to ignore an elevated LDL particle County people be I don't have a way of identifying who who might have a high metric there is somehow protected against that there's corrosive well I have lots of thoughts on this myself but and maybe we'll come back to it but I and I think we've gone back and forth we had this fun email string a while ago with you Ron me Alan I think Josh

[00:39:34] Knowles was on it as well where we just you guys were the first people to be exposed to my new model which is the necessary but not sufficient sufficient but not necessary neither necessary nor sufficient causalities because you can actually have Mazal metrics that fit each of those buckets but will will digress and come back to that I want to go back to one semantic thing you use the word sterile a lot I'm very comfortable with it I want to make sure the listener knows the difference between a sterile a stand all a zoo sterile a phytosterol we're gonna

[00:40:05] I think we're gonna touch on this later so let's just hammer out the semantics well cholesterol of course is the molecule we all fear cuz it's been drummed into our head that cholesterol in an arterial wall is where what is plaque it's a cholesterol core and that cholesterol can cause impaired vascular biology resulting in clinical events so what is cholesterol and we certainly in

[00:40:29] Peter's notes here you're gonna have pictures of the cholesterol structure and it's got four rings it's an aromatic compound and off the fifth ring is a little tail sticking out which is a carbon chain so the precursor molecule is called the stirring so you have the the rings the four rings and you may or may not have this tail sticking off of the 17 carbon in the fourth ring so all of the bonds are saturated that is called the stirring so if you unsaturated one double bond in that strain it's called the stirring and if you then stick a hydroxy group on the third carbon in the first ring it's called the star or it's an alcohol because you got a hydroxy group now sticking out hydroxy being Oh H oxygen excuse me correct so you'll see the pictures in my grams there and that little tail that sticks out on the other end in a molecule has a lot to do with what exactly type of star all that is and how it will function in a cell or in a cell membrane or so so cholesterol would be this four ring structure three of the rings have six carbons in it the fourth ring has five carbons in it you have this tail sticking off of carbon 17 it goes out and in cholesterol it's a totally saturated tail every bond and it is to saturated fatty acid and then on the free position you'd have this Oh H group the hydroxy group by the way since Oh H is sort of soluble in water that part of the cholesterol molecule is soluble in water where's that carbon chain stick an ounce of pure lipid that's all corn that's not soluble in water so when cholesterol does exist in a surface membrane like a cell membrane or lipoprotein its collisions itself so the hydroxy group is sticking out in that allopathic tail is sticking into the core at a particle or so now the cholesterol it's in the middle of the particle oh that the hydroxy group can't be in the middle of the particle that's water so they stick a really long chain fatty acid they replace the hydroxy group with a long chain or really any chain Satya so mostly it's a long chain so you esterified cholesterol remember I told you attaching a fatty acid to something is called a star so cholesterol which is the active form of cholesterol that can be changed into a hormone a bile salt or function in a cell membrane becomes a storage form of cholesterol or a lipid core transportable form of cholesterol called cholesterol now it's yl it's not Oh L ester and we abbreviate that as C II so free cholesterol is either gonna be abbreviated as a C or an FC and cholesterol ester and it's very difficult if I wanted to if I'm an adrenal gland and I got some cholesterol ester stored and I want to make a hormone because I need Questor I have to dias terrify that cholesterol ester to free cholesterol if the liver has cholesterol ester storage pools and it does and it wants to make a bile acid it has the dias terrify cholesterol ester cholesterol is stored in huge quantities in fat cells as cholesterol ester and it would have to be the esterified to be utilized to do something else or so one little story I'll just tell before we get to the stanols and all the other stuff is one of my prouder moments in front of Bob Kaplan was when you sent an email like this a couple months ago you sent this an email and you said see if you can spot the error in this figure and it was like a figure that had a million things it and I was like oh I'm not getting up until I figure out where the mistake is and sure enough somewhere in there it took me about ten minutes the illustrator had written because this was out of a paper something they had written cholesterol oh El Estor instead of cholesterol y el estor and and when I responded to you and you responded in the affirmative I was like I've got my stripes and that figure he's talking about came out of one of the productions for the company that I work for we developed educational pieces for physicians and I obviously drew it in label there but you send it off to medical illustrator who formats it for the PDF or whatever in cholesterol cholesterol and they make the mistake even though I sent in the picture where it was properly labeled because I had a heart attack the first time I saw and we've since changed that but somehow

[00:45:04] Peter got ahold of an older version or something they probably even I sent out and didn't recognize initially but yeah so it is cholesterol is there anything that's esterified becomes a yl so you'll see lipids this discussion illustrates one of the challenges of lipid ology which is I find this to be certainly among the two or three most complicated subject matters I've ever tried to master and again no one masters anything in life I mean that's sort of the beauty of this you haven't mastered this but this journey of trying to learn it I am constantly humbled by how hard it is it's just so goddamn complicated well that's true especially you want to take it to the nth degree but you need to invest yourself in some degree of education to at least be confident in today's a world or so so you have to know some of this stuff well and that's something you have to be willing to learn some of this chemistry I mean you have to steep yourself in biochemistry and understand the because the significance becomes enormous one double bond in one of these things completely changes its properties and not to say that that's not true in general in biochemistry but it's much easier to talk about blood pressure or to talk about elevated levels of uric acid or insulin or glucose without getting into that level of minutiae it is not possible to discuss lipids without that that is the problem when a lot of people are spouting off on the internet and elsewhere about always did you just don't have on their understanding of the complexity of all how this all works and fits together and why what you just said is wrong because there's something going on stoichiometrically that you haven't even considered or so to finish the sterile so a steroid is a sterile it's got another keto group stuck on it someplace look at all the hormones you have a double bond with oxygen attached but a stain all is you take and let's take cholesterol as a stand off our star wall and remember cholesterol at the third carbons in O H group there's a double bond at carbon 5 to 6 in the first ring and then there's that tail at carbon 17 if i desaturate it cholesterol the double bond at c5 and 6 disappears that's called cholesterol it's a stain or a stain all essentially a saturated star all changes the characteristics of that my cholesterol free cholesterol can be readily absorbed in your intestinal

[00:47:34] Walk stanols cannot be absorbed and it's kind of funny our liver to get rid of our body to get rid of cholesterol sends it to the liver the liver sends it through the bile to the intestinal poulos free cholesterol and your intestines more than capable to just reabsorbing that cholesterol that delivers trying to Yvette accept our little friendly microbes down here in the gut convert a ton of the biliary excreta cholesterol into a Stan all called cholesterol or there's an isoform of it called copra Stan I'll sustain all cannot be reabsorbed so you poop it away and that's out about he gets rid of cholesterol it changes a lot of it to a stain or anthropologists have been measuring specimens for Co processing all that tells them humans live there I don't want because they find that in certain specimens and that human had to excrete it you know so a Stan all is simply saturating that adds other applications because hey if Stan else cannot be absorbed and I would like to have a metric of whether you're absorbing cholesterol or not if I measured cholesterol in your blood shouldn't be there to any appreciable degree because it tells us or bit if it is elevated in your blood for whatever reason and we now know why your intestine just absorb that cholesterol and if it's absorbing cholesterol which it tends not to what is it absorbing an humungous excess cholesterol so cholesterol serves as a biomarker of are you or are you not or what degree of cholesterol absorption is going on in your intestines and the last thing Peter did mention he said phytosterols he called it a zu sterile

[00:49:27] I call it zoology cuz I call it as oo sterile so I don't know who's right I know I'm gonna go with you're right I'm just gonna give you that and I do have a degree in zoology when I went to college and that was one of my majors and you're wearing just so everyone knows you're wearing your Rutgers t-shirt right now as well you're just perfect alright I wouldn't be here electors that's medical school is inconsequential I learned everything in Rutgers pre-med at least a biochemistry in the physiology anyway so phytosterols what plants are full of steroids their cell membranes are not cholesterol those there are some plans to do have cholesterol in a most do nah but they have sterols that if i show you here's cholesterol and here's what's in this plan you would think you're showing me a lot of cholesterol but if you look closely you'd see that tail that's coming out of carbon 17 it's constructed a little differently or wait a minute if there's another double bond in one of those rings in there so it looks like cholesterol but it's close but it's really not and since it was made in a plant collectively let's call them phytosterols but we hopefully all need a few vegetables there in a day so you're eating phytosterols unless you're a total non don't eat any vegetables and they give you an even in other things even you're eating shrimp and stuff fishy by phytoplankton and stuff so ders phytosterols and a bunch of foods but you're he knows the only sterile I need to function is cholesterol out any plant sterols why would I want a human to ever absorb the plant sterols they would get in a way could they even be toxic you know so evolution must the figure that they were so evolution made sure our intestine did not absorb phytosterols why to me tells me there's a certain level of which phytosterols are toxic well this becomes interesting because I had a disagreement with a physician recently who jointly takes care of one of my patients because the physician wanted to put this patient on phytosterols supplements because this physician became convinced that it was such an elegant way to lower cholesterol it turns out about 10 to 15 percent of people in whom you give massive doses of phytosterols you do indeed lower their cholesterol this physician felt that was a good idea

[00:51:48] I felt otherwise for reasons you'll explain I'm sure and needless to say after a long discussion we agreed to stop the phytosterols yes and again to me the best argument with that is if your evolution thought we needed phytosterols your intestine would be encouraged to absorb phytosterols if somehow they brought some miraculous property to the human body that enhanced survival you'd want them in there and everybody said Oh plans to carry a lot of great stuff we're only talking about the sterile that's in the plant the phyto sterile other ingredients in plants do get absorbed and probably are good for you but not phytosterols well there's data to show that phytosterols on a per molecule basis are probably more atherogenic than cholesterol there certainly is that data there but again the people who just so focused on lowering LDL cholesterol don't even entertain it won't even look at order you dismiss it as nonsense you know and it's never going to be studied in the proper type of trial that you'd have to study and you know so and there's Peter just hinted if you're not a hyper absorber of sterols probably giving a phytosterols supplement it does compete with cholesterol Ferb's so you will absorb less cholesterol and maybe that's one way of lowering LDL cholesterol but

[00:52:59] I would say who cares but it you would get a little bit of April be reduction in certain people with that but if you're a hyper absorber I'm looting your body with something that evolution didn't want in your body why would I do that so I beg anybody who's a big advocate of supplementing phytosterols please monitor phytosterols in the bloodstream that's how you identify oh my god you're the one person

[00:53:21] I absolutely should not be given as to and I can send you a lot of data Peters talking about showing you phytosterols Aqsa city and humans and stuff so and when we say someone's a hyper absorber I mean you and I have both written about this ad nauseam so we'll link to it rather than get into a diatribe but we're basically talking about in your analogy as my favorite I've always borrowed it just outright stole it I hopefully I've always given you credit you got a ticket take her in the bar niemann-pick see one like one transporter he lets everybody in if you can fight the door yeah he lets any sterile and if you can fit through the door you're coming in but then you've got this atp-binding cassette g 5 g 8 and that's the bouncer that's the enforcer that's the one who in theory probably informed by lxr is making some sort of decision about you're a good guy you're a bad guy you got to go you got to stay when someone is genetically a hyper absorber is the quote unquote defect more on the the ticket taker or on the bouncer it turns out that it's both because when we talk about absorption let's face it there's a million molecules that can be absorbed by your intestine we're talking about the sterile absorption right now and cholesterol is a key ingredient for human life so evolution not only gave every cell in your body the wherewithal to synthesize cholesterol it allowed your intestine to absorb cholesterol because it certainly didn't want any cellular deficiency of cholesterol which has nothing to do with plasma cholesterol by the way you can have an

[00:54:50] LDL C of 3 and have perfect cellular cholesterol metrics so as evidenced by the hyper functioning pcsk9 agents so this niemann-pick c1 like protein in our proximal intestine recognizes sterols and there's a sterile domain on air that binds tightly to sterols but it binds most tightly to cholesterol because cholesterol has that structure it has a less added finding to a phytosterols minimal binding to a stand all now ultimately

[00:55:25] I'll bind to all of them but cholesterol gets the first preference to be pulled into the anthracite xeno sterile as I call it rather than phytosterols you know meaning other star all a star all other than cholesterol I would get in secondarily and a Stan all they get in but at much less concentrations so now the enter site has this sterile you just absorb now the enterocytes position is I got to get this to the rest of the body so I have to take this sterile and put it in a collar micron that I'm gonna make or I could also heat flux any star wall out to a baby HDL let's looking for sterols

[00:56:02] I can lipid eight an HDL so that's how sterols get out of the intestine or the intestine say we don't need any more sterols I'm getting rid of you and that's where the bouncer comes in so these eighty binding cassette transporters atp-binding cassette transporters are a sterile efj flux membrane transport or so and this is important to distinguish because and again it might be confusing but the diagrams will make it easier there's two e fluxes you've referred to there's an e flux on luminal side and then an e flux back into the body both of them are leaving an enter a site one ends up leaving the body if it goes out the ATP binding is that it's going into the lumen it's being excreted with stool if you eat flux on the other side of the cell into either the chylomicron or into the HDL you're actually putting it right back into circulation and that is such a crucial point pyramid on that more so yeah remember we talked about the enter site like the liver and enter sites have a lot of things they can do with sterols so they can get rid of it or they can even use it remember enter sites have cell membranes they need some cholesterol for their own cell membranes and everything so they can ship it out hey body needs cholesterol in a column micron they can lipid it in HDL or they can return it to the lumen of the gut where it'll go out your rear end so these ABC g5 or GA transporters as you're called then it's a heterodimer so you have one of each we'll eat flocks and they also have different affinities so unlike the niemann-pick which really wants cholesterol to come in less so phytosterols and not so stanols which tells me evolution didn't want those other products in your body the APC transformer or exporters they number one evict phytosterols first that's another evolutionary happenstance

[00:57:55] Tomita tells me the body evolution didn't want phytosterols in your damn body cuz why is it giving you a phytosterols protein in your intestine and the liver has it too just in case of phytosterols it as far as the liver it could see vic tip back to the bile to go back to your intestine so second in line for exportation would be a stan all and third would be cholesterol so your ability to absorb cholesterol is a happy working relationship between the expression of your niemann-pick c1 like protein and your ABC g5g a transporters so technically if you even had a good normal degree of absorption but you couldn't even ten Easter rows because you got a loss of function of an ABC g5 ag8 you're gonna be a hyper absorber cuz then the only way those sterols can get out of the anthracite is in a column micron or in an HDL and by the way when will you do measure these phytosterols in the blood people it's like when you measure cholesterol in the blood do you understand I've already told you where that cholesterol met it's the cholesterol within all the lipoproteins so if I'm measuring site toss they're all stigmasterol Camp Estoril which are some of the names of the 50 phytosterols that are in our plant products what am i measuring well since the vast majority of lipoproteins are LDLs i'm measuring

[00:59:19] LDL site Austral LDL cholesterol like i'm measuring LDL cholesterol so you're measuring there but god forbid that particle invades an artery wall the sterols go with it and one last intriguing part of this story which better put the fear of god a phytosterols into that evolution didn't want it in so it gave you a protein that will not absorb phytosterols of its work and right it gave you a protein that immediately vics fighters steriles but for any stirol' to go into chylomicron what does it have to be esterified how does the intestine

[00:59:53] Storify cholesterol into cholesterol ester which is what makes up a giant part of the core of the chylomicron there's an astera fiying enzyme acyl cholesterol acyl transferase a cat guess what is the favorite ligand for a cat cholesterol guess what is not a favorite ligand for a cat phytosterols so they you just don't esterified phyto sir which retards than getting into your body and you know the real way to get in that abca1 efox transporter which is what lipid it's a baby

[01:00:27] HDL Pardo it's not a b c g5 g8 alright abca1 exports turtles into baby HDL and just for the listener again you're saying ABC what you're saying is ATP binding cassette so when they hear you say ABC that's what you're referring to it's an energy driven process so some of that phytosterols you're measuring in the blood are an HDL particles also so that's a way to get in and I always make and you'd have to do a study improve it we're gonna be talking about HDL dysfunction suppose I measured phytosterols in your HDL it's very high it's probably a type of dysfunctional

[01:01:03] HDL particle you know there's all sorts of intriguing we're also you know not to get too esoteric but that would also suggest enter a site dysfunction because the inner sites should also quote-unquote know better that that's not the direction of e flux I want it is but it's relying on the ABC g5g eight to eat flux it then it wouldn't even get to an

[01:01:23] ABC a1 to e flux it on the other side and a cat is not going to stare off' i it if it's all being evicted to be very little it would wind up being a snare a flight and the last part of this puzzle as peter i thought you have a gut lumen side and you got a plasma side or ab lymphatic side which is where column microns exit we probably talked about it somewhere today is this crazy process they used to call reverse cholesterol transport which is another one of these idiotic terms that should have disappeared a long time ago at least if you think it's mediated by solely by HDL high density lipo proteins that's the part that's got to change a big pathway of how does the body get rid of cholesterol we're all taught oh it brought it back to the liver and the liver we'll get rid of it in a certain way guess what a ton of it is just bought directly right back to the intestine and me cholesterol in the particle or the particle itself finds its way into the enter a site through the and then the enter site has another supply of sterols all the sudden that it didn't absorb and so what it then will do with that store what it once it can eat flux it through a b c g5 g8 into your gut lumen and you can poop it away so the process of a lipoprotein or some other trafficker albumin red blood cells bringing cholesterol back to the small intestine bypassing the liver gets right out into your stool is called trans intestinal cholesterol a flux abbreviated it's theis and it's a major reverse cholesterol transport pathway do we have a sense because we're gonna talk about direct and indirect our CT in a moment I think that might as well this is good a foray into that as any do you have a sense of how much cholesterol is being reversed transported so to speak through theis versus the sum total of direct and non direct reverse cholesterol transport yeah this has been studying me dynamically but you know the real small studies and it probably varies individually depending on the complexity of your lipid and lipoprotein transportation systems or so some P in some people it's probably 20% in other people it's just been reported high 60% so it varies a lot but it's a major player it's not this infinitesimal minor baby pathway that's inconsequential acceptance some rat in a laboratory or something it's this has been proven in humans now there I just read as part of the review process and a really cool article coming out in a journal clinical lipid ology where because of some biliary surgery the guy had the only way cholesterol gets out of this person's body was through the intestine and they did so he shows you how he can get rid of cholesterol without a biliary system how many articles do you review a year there's two things when you're an associate editor the main editor will say here here's a submitted paper do you think this is pretty good if so send it out to four or five reviewers they will send their review to you and then you make your decision and send it to me and

[01:04:27] I'll make the ultimate decision but then also I'm Joe so just to reviewer yeah we're another associate editor would say I think Tom knows a lot about this subject so I'll ask him would he please review this article to me so I don't know I probably get about 15 articles a year where I'm the associate editor and probably double that where you're one of the reviewers so just one of several reviewers or so but that's still about 50 papers a year that's my stage in a game to have a job where I do have I don't have to see patients anymore I'm not traveling throughout the United

[01:05:02] States a hundred times a year on flights doing lectures here there and everywhere so I am blessed in my current position or my true health diagnostic who Peter probably when you hear this the first time you all get a list of my who I work for who I don't that's the only company I work for nowadays and I'm their scientific academic advisor so my job is to stay on top of the literature know all this stuff and explain it so I have the freedom every day to spend time reading and as you can and part of my education anybody who's a reviewer and edit or with other you'll learn a lot doing that because I in I don't know everything that sent to me for review but all I sure as heck know where to go yes well there's a small group of us that are very lucky we're having dinner with

[01:05:49] Jaime Underberg tonight but you know Jaime said there's like this group of like ten people that you always send out the most interesting papers to and about a year ago I had forwarded a number of these on to Bob Kaplan and he was like hey can you put me on this email too and I mean we'll have to think about a way to firt for you to create a special group where because it strikes me that there's a broader group of people who would actually like to get the once a week email from Tom with the most interesting lipid paper I've read this week yeah I think the best way of doing that is somehow contacting me add dr. lipid or so I mean you put a lot of this stuff out on Twitter I do so you can research it but you don't get the commentary because your emails are sometimes so great because what you'll do is you'll say look I know all of you aren't gonna read this 12-page paper here's like a 300 word summary of what you would learn and then that like for me to read that then open the paper it's like it's quick and it's just don't want to get I don't know how many people listen to Peter spod guess but it's immense I don't want 4,000 emails tomorrow saying and there's two things as part of that email one would be my interpretation of song which is fine it's a Springs a number would be weekly and I can't attach PDFs to it that I might to an isolated friend yes yeah of copyrights yes yeah that's that's that's part of it that's part of an issue also so if it's open access great and if it is I've probably tweeted it and your best bet and look they aren't afraid to ask me questions I mean a lot of them are asinine I ignore them but I will answer it my Twitter followers know your legitimate no your direct message you yeah yeah okay so let's get back to the business of lipids here so we've done a pretty good job explaining one side of the equation at how cholesterol is oh all sterile would be cholesterol it's the only sterile we the animal kingdom produces yes yeah yeah cholesterol is oh yeah okay so the other end of this regulatory pathway so we've described the reabsorption side pretty well there's a synthetic side which you've alluded to obviously by making the statements that hey every cell in the body can make cholesterol and most of the time it's sufficient for its needs obviously exceptions will I'll let you explain what the exceptions are to that there if a certain scenarios and certain cells where they actually do need cholesterol from other tissues but let's just go back to this synthetic stuff just briefly because I don't want to give anybody too much headache how do we make cholesterol very complex Lee it's a multi-stage process 20 to 30 individual steps where one molecule is changing into another into another and at the end of the day cholesterol is made and it starts very small it's basically acetyl co a acetyl co a it's two carbon chain molecule that keeps growing in length because cholesterol is 37 carbons in it so it has to grow through much of that growth it's just a linear structure and at a certain point this linear structure is long enough that it bends and changes into a star all configuration when Oster all being the first arrow that appears in the cholesterol synthesis chain by the way if I wanted a lab and labs with liquid chromatography and mass spec could give you a low-cost olynyk stirol' measurement and if it was up hey you're over synthesizing cholesterol that's not the one they focus on they pick a more downstream a cholesterol precursor to do that but even you could pick some of the earlier ones and they do serve as markers of cholesterol synthesis you know now the cholesterol synthetic pathway is bifurcated tell me a little bit about that so once you go through squalene and an annette bends into a ring structure lanosterol has to become cholesterol so inositol and it's cross talk between the pathways but it has one or two pathways that it's gonna go down and at the end of the day both pathways you'll wind up with cholesterol and no good pathways don't come with names mister facetious yes well my favorite of course is the block cuz if you die and I Twitter picture I ain't foot up recently he won the Nobel Prize for discovering this pathway in cholesterol so it's probably important they give you a Nobel Prize for discovering this pathway of cholesterol synthesis so the blocked pathway would be lanosterol goes through a lot of precursors and become something called DES master old des MOS tu rol

[01:10:43] Master looks exactly like cholesterol except in carbon 24 there's a double bond there's no double bonds and that tail it's on the cholesterol molecule so if I just saturate that double bond and does the master all I change it into cholesterol and of course there's a specific enzyme that does that if you inhibit I guess it if it's just so people can understand what these enzymes mean so that I remember learning this in college all right so our med school on college enzymes always end in ace right now you just told me it was carbon 24 so it's it's probably gonna have something to have it's kind of a 24 in there well and we often throw Delta's into these things because Delta denotes the position of the bond and did you say that does master all has a double bond at 24 and it has to be saturated saturated so it would probably something like a delta 24 saturates or desaturate correct all right so that would be the enzyme so when you say that when you rattle that off it sounds crazy and intimidating but it's logical right it is and this is why what you were talking about before you really have to notice though or you might number and the presence or the expression or the lack of expression that at Ensign is gonna are you gonna use that pathway if you're using that and you don't convert des

[01:12:00] Malstrom to cholesterol you're gonna have a lot of des most role in your system are there consequences to that there's a human disease called dis master also said if it occurs in utero dat kid ain't coming out alive or he does he live in for more than a few days and is that disease a genetic deficiency in the enzyme does the 20/40 saturate it is yeah now there's another pathway when

[01:12:20] Austral doesn't and what determines sort of is if you've got a double bond at that 24 because it's gonna go through that pathway now there's a leno stroll has another pathway that goes through that's gonna wind up with cholesterol and the precursor or the penultimate as we call it the next-to-the-last cholesterol molecule in a chain is on

[01:12:41] Cola faster all some people call it lay so sterile I call it a foster all la th Oh stir all and that is called the can Dutch rustle pathway obviously after the guys who discovered that the Nobel Prize for some reason even though that was I think the Nobel Committee said we already gave one of these things out and also that you can only have three people receive a Nobel

[01:13:06] Prize so that would be - yeah yeah so whatever everybody else I guess who worked in black so I've got no credit to Sarah but anyway so it's the can Dutch Russel pathway so and it's kind of interesting because in most people both pathways exist and there are some ways of jumping from one pathway to another so the end of the day you're gonna make cholesterol or so but if you want to start interfering with these pathways there are specific enzymes in each pathway that maybe that's would be something you could play with or maybe if you're building too much of something there's a lack of expression of that enzyme in you which maybe has consequences maybe a dozen so it's all important to know but some of this may be tissue specific one of the things I know it's a big topic of yours and I hope we get into today is the brain everything I've talked about cholesterol today that we're measuring in the blood has zero to do with cholesterol in the brain cholesterol lipid ology in the brain is might as well be in another different body it has nothing to do with what's the cholesterol is going on and the rest your body the brain makes every cholesterol molecule it needs and therefore there are no LDL particles delivering cholesterol to your brain so again if with a soup I'm glad to be clear this is because the LDL particle just doesn't fit through the blood-brain barrier even HDLs where a little bit of our cholesterol might get into it's delivered dated through these ABC things and some of that might work its way and inconsequential amount the april-b is like it's too big the brain doesn't make

[01:14:44] April be so but the central nervous system has two traffic lipids from brain cells to peripheral nerve cells a bowi is the protein transporter in the brain so cholesterol or any starless attached a bowi in the brain and that's how it's traffic's around there or so and again I've got nothing to do with the apoE that's involved with whatever lipoproteins are doing in your the rest of your body also so just understand it but obviously I want to come this is such an important topic that I absolutely want to come back because I'm glad you brought it up but that said at the moment I would love to go back to this synthetic stuff so you've got each cell in the body can basically start with the most simple carbon subunit which is a two carbon subunit acetyl co a and through a process of carbon fixation go on to make these very complicated for carb four ringed structures they first and foremost the cell uses these things they make a bit of important part of the cell membrane if any one organelle membranes and deposit that's right so everything from the Golgi apparatus to the ER to this movie are rough ER etc you also you don't have to be I think a biochemist to look at a picture of a molecule like cortisol estrogen testosterone and I think you could show a four-year-old optimal picture of those and then a molecule of cholesterol and they would be like hey those look similar yeah it's like maybe I look like my mother and father or did they have an origin or do they come for an answer sure so certain cells can certainly transform cholesterol into reproductive hormones or adrenal cortical hormones certain cells hepatocyte scan transform cholesterol into a bile acid I don't think there's any other cell that can change cholesterol into anything else so when people talk about cholesterol metabolism there is no cholesterol metabolism it can be converted into sauna in specific tissues but it can be excreted that's it there's no other way your body can heal so do we is there any evidence that we use cholesterol for energy zero why there's no energy is really coming out of a saturated if the fats that have the most no double bonds that's the most they're carrying the most ATP cholesterol is not producing energy cholesterol cannot be metabolized in produced ATP I mean to me that's the bigger issue right I think what says some people get confused about this it's not that there isn't energy in a carbon-carbon bond or a carbon hydrogen bond because that's exactly what's being liberated in the metabolism of a fatty acid the point is we don't have the enzymatic machinery to undergo the chemical process of breaking down those bonds and liberating the chemical energy into electrical energy can't metabolize cholesterol cholesterol ester which carries that that s can be d esterified but your cells aren't making cholesterol ester the liver is the intestine is but he adipocytes are but my hypothesis for why that's the case which could be entirely [ __ ] and I'm just making it up but it that's what hypotheses are they're guesses is that it would have been evolutionarily dangerous if we could have metabolized cholesterol because in periods of fasting which we all did evolutionarily the last thing you want your body doing is going after cell membranes and hormones as a source of energy so I think it's actually a very deliberate design quote I use design in quotes to say hey no matter what your cholesterol and your hormones are off-limits during starvation and instead we evolved this other remarkable pathway of ketosis which takes an ample substrate of fats and goes down the path of metabolizing those and actually saving our muscle from the catabolic destruction that we would undergo if we couldn't undergo ketosis this is the brilliance of peter thea to me that he can tell you how to sell god cholesterol what he can do with it but he's figured out it what sounds like a really plausible reason and everybody's so worried about depleting cholesterol in the plasma is measured by LDL cholesterol which has nothing to do with anything because actually there's more cholesterol in your red blood cells then yes and you're not making that zero by any means by using a lipid drugs or something so but you can't deplete a cell of cholesterol beyond a certain amounts you're gonna scrub cellular function and you can't put too much cholesterol in it cell because it'll crystallize and kill that cell so that's why it's so tightly regulated synthesis it influx and efflux now are there cells under certain circumstances for whatever reason can't make enough cholesterol the other there are pediatric disorders where if you don't synthesize cholesterol things happen to you in utero well the only thing we see this and I didn't even know why I started noticing this but this is one of the things I used to do in residency that used to kind of piss off some of the attendings is I would do little experiments and it was always a measurement experiment so it wasn't like I was putting a patient at risk other than made a few more milliliters of blood were being drawn but I remember once happening on a finding which was maybe by accident I had checked akha lipid panel on a patient in the ICU and I saw something interesting and I kept rechecking it in other patients over and over again and I kept seeing this which was anytime a patient was having a sirs response that's capital S IRS systemic inflammatory response syndrome so this is the vaso you know metabolic response to sepsis infection trauma you name it enormous drop in HDL cholesterol and I think we could look at that today and say it's very likely that what we were seeing was in that period of profound physiologic stress the body is greatly ramping up its hormone production glucocorticoids and it's and others and that would be one of the situations where cells were actually you know HDL was now delivering cholesterol to the adrenal glands in a period of you know because that's about the most physiologically stressful thing that an organism can respond to again I don't know if that's been documented but it seems to me pretty logical that that would be a at least the most plausible explanation for why HDL could plummet in patients who are going through that degree of stress by the way it's the reason you never doing a lipid profile in an acute situation because a lot of lipids are gonna be transiently change or so here but Peters right we know this for a lot of reasons clearly the your story genic tissues need cholesterol to make their steroid hormones B they reproductive organs or your adrenal cortex and in the situation's Peters talking about cortisol it's a pretty useful or hormone to have around or other mineralocorticoids and things like that are so so clearly the those organs those tissues are going to need a lot of cholesterol pools to make all that so they turn up their synthesis rates so they make a lot of cholesterol but they would also tune up their heylet's gather some exogenous cholesterol so to speak so those cells would up regulate

[01:21:53] LDL receptors and that's a case where there's a tissue that might under certain surface ances pulling LDL particles full of cholesterol ester they would do storified and use it but in a physiologic person who's not in one of these acute situations the adrenal gland most of the time just makes all the cholesterol it needs but if it needs a secondary source that's why you have

[01:22:17] HDLs HDLs have a half-life of five days one of the reasons they circulate for five days is it's a floating plasma reservoir of cholesterol for tissues that might actually need cholesterol now my nose cell it I talked about before it doesn't need hdls or anybody else to deliver cholesterol to it no other cell does except those there orogenic tissues in other words to be really clear and specific your sloughing off and etherial cells in your nose every day well you have to replace them the lion's share of the cholesterol requirement is to make a cell membrane it's just it has the machinery it has the machinery within the nucleus to produce that just as its producing other structural proteins right so this is what people just translate low cholesterol plasma measurements to think you're screwing up cells throughout the body and you're not yeah this is one of the challenges that

[01:23:13] I've never come up with a great way to explain this idea of flux which is you do a lipid measurement at a moment in time you're getting a snapshot of what's in the plasma at a moment in time which doesn't give you two pieces of information how is it changing over time and what's the movement or the velocity and secondly it gives you no insight into what's happening in the cell or what's happening in the endothelium for that matter and instead that's the nature of lipid ology is you have to be able to extrapolate to these other things by indirect measurements it gives you zero insight the only usability of plasma measurements are as surrogates of lipoprotein defining whether you have

[01:23:53] April be April a1 particles and we know too many April B particles you're over time at big risk at increased risk birth from Scott ik disease or events otherwise why even measuring lipids in the plasma tells you nothing and what we're talking about you call it in flux e flux and that nails it down but it's cholesterol homeostasis or sterile homeostasis and your body has evolved a lot of ways to do interesting too and say that a crisis is going on adrenal needs continued it's not just hey you're you cured yourself in 12 hours overnight you survived whatever and if that catastrophic process was gone going hdls eventually would run out of cholesterol you just said your HDL cholesterol level is plummeting and it's been documented many times so the HDL Oh a sudden has to go back and start grabbing cholesterol molecules from some other tissue and get it to the store autogenic tissue and the number a mega place where HDL is get most of our lipid ation as it goes right back to the liver and gets lipid ated or what is the biggest cholesterol storage organ in the body not the liver you're out of the site's everybody thinks that besides our just learned triglycerides there are massive storage organ so baby hdls that are depleted they run back to the adipocytes which express this abca1 transported at pumps out all their cholesterol to an HDL which moon right back to the adrenal gland bounces back and forth like a ping-pong ball you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog and the nerd Safari at Peter DMV calm what's a nerd Safari you ask just click on the link at the top of the site to learn more maybe the simplest thing to do is to sign up for my subjective lean on lame once a week email where I'll update you on what I've been up to the most interesting papers I've read and all things related to longevity science performance sleep etc on social you can find me on Twitter Instagram and
