## Description

Full title: #70 – David Sinclair, Ph.D.: How cellular reprogramming could slow our aging clock (and the latest research on NAD)

Original release date: 9/9/19

In this episode, David Sinclair, Ph.D., a Professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-Director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging, returns to the podcast to discuss the content of his new book, Lifespan: Why We Age – and Why We Don’t Have To. This conversation focuses on the biological mechanisms involved in what David terms the Information Theory of Aging which provides insights into the “clock” that determines our aging and to what degree it can be manipulated. Our discussion on aging of course leads us into interconnected topics of epigenetics, sirtuins, cellular senescence, as well as what compounds David is personally taking for his own longevity. Additionally, we discuss the most up to date information related to NAD and longevity by looking at the potential benefits (if any) of supplemental agents (NAD precursors, NR, NMR, etc.) that pose a promise of increasing NAD.

We discuss:
-SIR genes and cellular identity [8:45];
-Sirtuins regulate gene expression [14:30];
-DNA is methylated at the deepest layer of the epigenome [17:45];
-Methylation pattern and determining cellular age [20:15];
-Cellular reprogramming [33:45];
-Yamanaka factors to push cells “back in time”  [41:00];
-Human cellular reprogramming viability [57:00];
-Measuring the rate of aging [1:02:45];
-Cellular reprogramming for longevity [1:14:45];
-Compounds David takes for his own longevity [1:29:15]
-NAD precursors (NR, NMN) and pterostilbene [1:40:00];
-The current field of sirtuin activators [2:03:15];
-David’s artistic work [2:05:15] and;
-More.

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD calm

[00:00:41] everybody welcome to this week's episode of the drive I'd like to take a couple of minutes to talk about why we don't run ads on this podcast and why instead we've chosen to rely entirely on listener support if you're listening to this you probably already know but the two things I care most about professionally or how to live longer and how to live better I have a complete fascination an obsession with this topic

[00:01:04] I practice it professionally and I've seen firsthand how access to information is basically all people need to make better decisions and improve the quality of their lives curating and sharing this knowledge is not easy and even before starting the podcast that became clear to me the sheer volume of material published in this space is overwhelming

[00:01:23] I'm fortunate to have a great team that helps me continue learning and sharing this information with you to take one example our show notes are in a league of their own in fact we now have a full-time person that is dedicated to producing those and the feedback has mirrored this so all of this raises a natural question how will we continue to fund the work necessary to support this as you probably know the tried and true way to do this is to sell ads but after a lot of contemplation that model just doesn't feel right to me for a few reasons now the first and most important of these is trust I'm not sure how you can trust me if I'm telling you about something when you know I'm being paid by the company that makes it to tell you about it another reason selling ads doesn't feel right to me is because I I just know myself I have a really hard time advocating for something that I'm not absolutely nuts for so if I don't feel that way about something I don't know how I can talk about it enthusiastically so instead of selling ads I've chosen to do what a handful of others have proved can work over time and that is to create a subscriber support model for my audience this keeps my relationship with you both simple and honest if you value what I'm doing you can become a member and support us at whatever level works for you in exchange you'll get the benefits above and beyond what's available for free it's that simple it's my goal to ensure that no matter what level you choose to support us at you will get back more than you give so for example members will receive full access to the exclusive show notes including other things that we plan to build upon these are useful beyond just the podcast especially given the technical nature of many of our shows members also get exclusive access to listen to and participate in the regular ask me anything episodes that means asking questions directly into the AMA portal and also getting to hear these podcasts when they come out lastly and this is something I'm really excited about

[00:03:25] I want my supporters to get the best deals possible on the products that I love and as I said we're not taking ad dollars from anyone but instead what I'd like to do is work with companies who make the products that I already love and would already talk about for free and have them pass savings on to you again the podcast will remain free to all but my hope is that many of you will find enough value in one the podcast itself and to the additional content exclusive for members to support us at a level that makes sense for you I want to thank you for taking a moment to listen to this if you learn from and find value in the content I produce please consider supporting us directly by signing up for a monthly subscription I guess this week is Professor David Sinclair now that name may sound familiar to some of you because I've already interviewed David in fact his first interview appeared podcast back in November I believe of 2018 I wanted to bring David back on the podcast for several reasons first of all he's always interesting to speak with and spend a lot of time speaking off podcasts and I want to be able to share those discussions with people second he has a new book that is coming out in fact we have time the release of this podcast to coincide with the release of that book which is tomorrow September 10th and third we wanted to revisit some of the ideas around nad NR they could hinder my tribe aside that is and longevity these are still to this day among some of the questions I get asked most about and even though truthfully I don't believe this is even at the top three level you know most interesting questions in longevity for whatever reason people want to know all about it and therefore I wanted to provide a little bit more insight into that so it was a bit of a refresher David's a professor in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School he's the co-director for the biological mechanism of aging program or it's a center actually he's best known for his work in understanding why we age how to slow its effects we talked in the very first podcast about his role in the discovery of sirtuins and the treatment thereof let's see I think you know you can go back and listen to his bio from that let's talk about what we talked about here we talked about this idea of the information theory of Aging and this is really a big part of what David's book is all about and I knew that David was going to be interviewed by a lot of people for the book so I felt that it was probably going to be most helpful to listeners if I interviewed him on some of the more technical details of that book which deals with again this information theory of Aging basically what is the clock that determines our aging what does it look like and perhaps most importantly can it be manipulated there are lots of other topics that are covered in his book such as the ethics of delaying death to significant degrees you know what would it mean to him and if we could live for you know hundreds of years those are very important questions I don't touch on any of them in this interview and I suspect you'll hear a lot about that in some of the other interviews so if this topic is of interest to you one I recommend you buy the book I really enjoyed it and I learned a lot and that's saying something because I don't really learn a lot reading books about aging unfortunately anymore the books are written at such a low level that that's not the case here this is this is really good secondly I think the discussion we have around nad and our some really up-to-date stuff including a couple of papers that were published in the weeks leading up to our talk and so again I don't think this is the final word on the subject but I do think that you'll come away from this with an even more nuanced appreciation for the potential benefits if there are any of

[00:06:56] Supplemental agents that pose a promise of increasing nad so without further delay please enjoy my second conversation with David Sinclair David thanks for swinging by thanks having me back congratulations first of all on the almost released book well thank you that's an interesting time just waiting for the thing to draw up September 10 yeah yeah well by the time people hear this it will be dropping so I kind of want to just start with the book because I think I said this you last time when we were together if maybe a couple months ago but once you start recording a podcast you end up listening to podcasts a little bit differently because now you're sort of thinking about it through the lens of the interviewer as well and similarly once I think you're trying to write a book all of a sudden you have much more interest in other people writing books not just for the content but the actual process and things like that so I remember we connected on this about a year ago and I won't lie I'm kind of secretly jealous and envious that you're done yeah well the scary thing is as soon as you're done yeah you're never done your agent says what's your next book oh well that's not even what I was thing I was thinking the bigger issue is the moment you're done you think oh wait there's just one more thing I want to say there is that at some point the editor said no more changes David you're doing but the sake of a lot of work anybody who's written a book real respect for those people and you're in the throes of yours right now right yeah so you had sent me your proposal like a year ago maybe longer actually was definitely longer than a year ago and it's probably a great example of how proposals and books often differ quite a bit I'm generally the book I think ends up being so much better so much richer because there were things in the book that weren't necessarily in the proposal that kind of caught me off guard especially the first part of the book which is kind of what I want to talk about today I think the second part of the book where you talk about the societal implications for a longer lived population are inter but I'm gonna let somebody else talk about that with you I want to talk about sort of the biology of this but this idea of I mean you introduce a very important mathematician who wrote a paper that I remember seeing in my engineering studies paper from the 1940s so let's just start with that why is

[00:09:10] Shannon relevant to the story of aging because I certainly didn't learn anything about him as an anti-aging researcher 25 years ago well Shannon's one of the most respected guys in math what he did in the 1940s was essentially figured out how to mathematically encode information and make sure that information gets to the receiver it's called the information theory of communication what it led to is what the world we have around us the

[00:09:36] Internet tcp/ip protocols what that is to do with aging I wrote down in the book it began really when I was just a postdoc in Lenny grinches lab at MIT interesting quote Chanin was a at MIT - we discovered to our surprise that what was controlling aging in yeast in part were these sirtuin genes now sirtuins in science in an aging pretty famous but what a lot of people don't know is that the word sirtuin stands for gene called co2 which in yeast we found responds to dietary restriction heat starvation and it allows the East to live about 30% longer if you up regulate it or put just another copy of that gene in the yeast cells and make cable line who's now a famous professor he was the graduate student who did that experiment to put extra sort of gene into yeast and they live longer so that was a massive breakthrough but what sir stands for is really telling it's actually been forgotten over the last twenty-five years but sir-- is an acronym for silent information regulator silent information regulator what does that mean this is a gene that controls all the genes it switches them on and off its main job is to keep gene silent and that allows cells to be dividing be healthy but what they do that is not appreciated is when the cells are stressed too much temperature a broken chromosome the protein that this gene makes this sir gene it leaves the silent regions and it goes to repair the problem or fix the so in the case of DNA breaks what we did was we broke the chromosome of these the sir enzyme protein leaves where it should be goes through a pair of the DNA and when it's all fixed it comes back again to shut those silent genes down you might say that's what weird thing to do as an organism well this is a highly conserved process it's found in each cells just make sure the listener know what you're saying you have a gene that's being silenced that then gets broken the thing that is silencing it leaves it's silencing post to go and repair that which is broken only to come back and silence it so from an expression standpoint the world outside hasn't changed that's right and the reason that

[00:11:45] I think it's set up that way is that these genes that get turned on by the absence of the sir protein help with the problem they turn on DNA repair they hunker down these are a survival program that's in every cell on the planet I believe and the sword enzyme that we're talking about is a master regulator of that survival circuit so why does that have anything to do with information theory well what I think is going on is that this program that's set down in our cells and when a yeast cell is young which gene should stay on and which genes should be off it gets messed up it gets lost in the noise and what's the noise it's this constant having to go and repair DNA or respond to too much heat or some other imminent threat yeah doing it once doesn't matter one cut to a chromosome of Birken chromosomes not going to kill yourself if it's repaired but what it does over time is that cells lose their which genes should be on and off the genes that should be kept off any cell come on one way to think about this a very simple analogy is Hurricane Katrina okay so the sir protein are the first responders they rush down to fix the problem they do their job but what happens is most of them come back home know the law and pay the bills and everything's good but some of them get stuck down there they marry someone or maybe they get lost on the way home they can't afford a ticket home and the airplane and you do that a hundred times or in our case in our lives every cells getting a broken chromosome every day so you're doing this how many days do we live thirty thousand days this is a problem I think over time you actually end up losing that program and our cells lose their identity and the hallmark of aging in yeast is the loss of cellular identity they become sterile they don't make dysfunctional so Claude

[00:13:38] Shannon figured out how to preserve information you keep a repository of the original data a hard dressed disparate backup and he said if the receiver of that information which in his idea was the radio receiver of the signal in World War two and after in our world it might be our email in aging its ourselves in the future and we lose that program about keeping ourselves young cells in cells and what Shannon said is that there may be a repository of that information if our cells are right if they're doing a good job there should be a way to reset the system to get that complete email back again and I think there is one we have some early evidence from mice that we can actually find that hard disk drive and reinstall software so that its pristine again and we find that we can actually improve the health quite dramatically if parts of the mouse's body now to really get into this the way you do in the book I think we have to take a few steps back and assume for a moment that a listener doesn't know much about DNA beyond sort of the high-level stuff but maybe doesn't understand what an epigenetic modification is what things like methylation mean and how that occurs so let's go back and go through a little bit of that stuff because I think to get a firm understanding of this will enable the other things are going to talk about to make more sense so we could use a mouse we could use a person I doesn't really matter for the purpose of this discussion but let's use a person because I think it resonates with a listener more so you and I have lots of

[00:15:13] DNA we've got somewhere between twenty and thirty thousand genes these genes are made up of lots of this coding stuff and there's coding and non-coding segments of these DNA but basically it's a whole bunch of strung together nucleotides now some of them are not working at that point in time right they're sitting there but they're not actually getting turned into RNA to be turned into proteins correct absolutely we don't turn all our genes on because then we wouldn't have any different cell types we'd all just be a giant blob of cells

[00:15:46] I'm John Schumer probably so when you take a piece of my skin and you take a piece of my liver or you take a piece of my eye nerve in the back of my eye they all have the same DNA right yeah except for your sperm oh you're a again right and some immune cells I don't have any eggs by the way just for the record yeah okay I can believe this but your point is some of them are getting turned on so the DNA that are seeing in the epithelial cells of my skin are being instructed to express proteins in a certain way and that's what ends up producing skin versus the nerve in the back of my eye versus my liver etc and what's interesting is the skin and the nerve at one point were the same cell types when you are an embryo mm-hmm but the pattern is a pattern of gene expression the way the cells turn on different genes allowed nerves to become nerves and hopefully stay nerves for most of your life but I think towards the end of your life that's the problem it's their losing our identity and reverting back to something that was more primordial more like a skin cell and the way the cells do that's really interesting so that your DNA if you stretch it out of the cell about 6 meters long and there are little proteins that wrap that length of DNA up inside a microscopic cell and it's essentially like spooling a hose in your garden and then you spool Lowe's spools on top of each other so it's a way of packaging something very long but very very thin and tiny but if it's packed up in a spool it won't be read by the cell and that's what these saw proteins do the surra proteins actually maintain that structure of that spool but if a cell needs to read the gene they remove the so proteins and now that bundle can open up and the gene can be read and there are different layers of the epigenome there's the superficial layer where the surra proteins are and throughout the proteins going around turning genes on and off but there's a really deep layer the deepest layer is what's called DNA methylation and cells can permanently for decades mark a gene to be silent by putting these chemical groups called methyls next to or in a gene and that tells the cell spool that up as tight as you can and never unless I tell you to reveal it again and that's the reason how brain doesn't turn into a liver one morning when we wake up now let's define methylation only because it's such a buzz term right now I think everybody in there brother is reading about oh my god am i a bad meth later am i a good methylate or do I have an MTHFR mutation data that uh but let's sort of demystify all this stuff a methyl group is a carbon group with three hydrogen's on it so we're talking a very basic molecule in the broader architecture of organic chemistry and you're saying that when you put one of those methyl groups when you attach one of the carbons on that methyl to literally a carbon on one of the ends of

[00:18:28] DNA you have the ability to program it to not carry out the function of expressing itself is that a safe way to say that it is this is the underlying code that tells us L what type it is and there's a guy called Konrad Warrington from the 1950s who didn't know that there were these methyl groups so what he imagined was the embryo or the fertilized cell is at the top of a hill and it rolls down the hill and if it lands in one Valley it's a nerve cell it stays in the valley but if it rolled into another valley it's a skin cell and stays a skin cell and that's a great metaphor for how an embryo and then eventually a baby is formed out of 27 billion cells that a baby is made of fording Taneka bout as much if at all was what happens after that baby's born what happens 80 years later to his

[00:19:19] Waddington landscape what happens to those valleys in those hills and what I think is happening is that we're having not just erosion of those hills so that the cells don't stay where they should but they're getting jostled by these DNA breaks and this reorganization of the cir proteins and others so the cells start to migrate up over the valley into other new valleys and now your neurons in your brain your nerve cells are starting to behave a little bit like skin cells or liver cells and I think that's what's underlying many if not all of the aspects of aging that we eventually will succumb to and what role does entropy play in this because when you think about these hills and valleys there's a place where things want to settle out there should be a place where things settle and stay put but the figure you have in one of your talks which shows this projection right into the future it starts to get blurry at the end in other words it starts to look like there's more chaos in the system is that just the natural drive of entropy within our systems is that the way it's expressed I guess is what I'm asking right so mathematically it appears very much like a loss of information and interaction of noise because these methyl groups that are laid down in a pristine precise fashion when were young there are other methyls that accumulate over time in different places what appears to be randomly so it's a loss of the original pattern and that's why we talk about entropy now anyone who's familiar with the second law of thermodynamics says ok we're screwed we're never gonna be young again because you've lost information similar to falling into a black hole you're never coming out or even let's think of more obvious examples like you can't unfree an egg once proteins become denatured once the clear part of the egg becomes white you don't get to make it clear again yeah or even worse if your genome is a compact disc or DVD you scratch that up and you can't read it again or even worse you break a piece off that information is lost you throw it in the trash but what I think exists in cells we have some evidence is that like

[00:21:21] Shannon suggested for the internet or information is it if you have a backup copy and now going back to the genome there seems to be something in cells that tells them these methyl groups the program that was laid down when you're a baby is still there and cells can access that somehow to say all these other things that have happened since you're born or since you're a teenager that's just noise that's crap ignore that in fact when I tell you and in my lab we can reprogram cells to to go young again to read the right pattern there's a process that we're just beginning to understand that says this stuff is noise get rid of that ignore that get rid of it but these other methyl signals these little flags on the genome that have been there since we were babies that's the good stuff keep that and in that way these spools of the hose the DNA loops that have become untangled and messed up as we've gotten older reset back to being young again so let me make sure I understand that if you could take the version of

[00:22:21] David Sinclair that was born and you could look at every single piece of methylation across every single strand of DNA on every single gene in every single chromosome and you had a picture of that and you knew what that always looked like fast forward 50 years some of those methyl groups are gone you've lost methylation in some places and presumably in many more places there are now methyl groups added that were not present so you've had both an addition and subtraction of methyl groups and that now looks like a different picture are you suggesting that at least to the first order if you restored the methylation status to what it looked like when you were born you'd have a younger phenotype that's exactly what I'm saying that wasn't like a Candace question I wasn't even asking that rhetorically because that's on one level that seems really complicated but on one level it actually seems kind of simple you know what I mean that's sort of what's weird about what's amazing about it is that we don't even understand how it fully works yet we just know that there is this backup copy that we can access at least we have early evidence of it so we have this manuscript that says that if we turn on a few key genes in the body of a mouse or in a cell it will quite literally not just act younger and turn on young patterns of genes when you measure its age by Counting these methyl groups where they are it is young again and so this back up copy exists but what warps my mind it blows my mind is that there is something in the cell that we've had all along in our lives that allows the cell to reset can I ask you a question tell me if this is the right time to answer this question a lot of what you're saying sounds like hey isn't that quote unquote a stem cell it's very much like that because what we've done in the field is we've taken the knowledge from the reprogramming field which is using the order called Yamanaka genes and they're used in the field right now by scientists by companies to take an adult cell I could take your skin soul for example grow it in my lab and I can make a stem cell out of that how does that work it strips pretty much all of the methyl groups off the DNA and that's a reset not back to being young but by being primordial by being pre embryonic in other words methylation by definition implies an aging in some level of a cell so technically your most primordial cell had no methyl groups on its DNA right right very few and as we get older and it's not so what we've discovered as a field is what again a few years ago I wouldn't have believed it but it is true is that this clock starts aging from conception so even as we're growing in the womb our DNA is accumulating these chemical changes these methyls and that extends throughout life forever and if you gave me a sample of an embryo or a baby or a teenage girl or an 80 year old i and some other labs in the world can read that DNA and by the pattern I could tell you exactly the age of that cell or that tissue it's almost like you're describing carbon dating of a cell for lack of a better word no that's perfect that's the best way of how to describe yet and I didn't realize that the fidelity was as great as you just described it I understood that you could look at methylation and tell the difference between a baby and a 50 year old but if I heard you correctly you're saying that if you took a fetus at one month of development versus a newborn a full eight months later you would actually be able to distinguish those on the basis of methylation I mean obviously phenotype and many things would give that away we would and in fact the pace of change is very rapid in an embryo what is the fidelity of this when you look at one two three four five year olds is it literally that precise that it can measure the age of DNA to within a year oh I don't know what the latest statistics are for a human blood sample it was 95% accurate for chronologically but what we've realized is that that clock actually changes depending on how you live your life well it was just about to say this is not that interesting if there's nothing you can do about it it's just one more reminder of your birth certificate it's only relevant if either things speed it up which we'd like to know what those things are avoid them or things can slow it down or even as you said reverse it although that seems too good to be true right well it's even more important than your birth certificate your birth certificate just tells you when you're born this clock tells you how fast you're aging and a few labs Steve Horvath is one of the inventors of the clock we actually call it the Horvath clock he is able to estimate not just how old you are but predict when you're gonna die with high accuracy and that's really scary that we are predestined based on our lifestyle up to that point how long we're gonna live and there are some things that slowed down exercise is one good thing calorie restriction smoking does the opposite so right now at this moment having not eaten in a couple of days I am slowing my clock you are so that there are probably mechanisms actually we know of mechanisms that are turning on sorta ones so your energy levels go up when you're fasting and sort to unzip do a better job of both repairing the

[00:27:24] DNA and keeping have more substrate now to do their job right and just like in yeast our cells need to do both at the same time repair DNA and keep the genes silent that should be silent but if we're lazy and we a lot of food and we don't exercise those programs that are designed to keep the clock from accelerating don't honors actives so that's what we think is going on and that's why if you have smoked a lot of your life or you don't exercise your clock will on average and for most people that are tested will be older than your actual age and so the only thing that you can do is either slow that down right now we don't know how to reverse it in humans but in mice we're getting glimpses of how to actually literally make a cell half its age that it once was and how does this clock work in its prediction relative to other things that get a lot of attention such as the length of the telomeres of a cell and maybe define for the listener what telomeres ours and some people might not be familiar our chromosomes all 46 of them are linear DNA molecules so they have ends to ends each chromosome and those ends need to be protected and those ends are called telomeres and good analogy it's like the hard piece of a shoestring exactly that's what an aglet is but as we get older they get chewed back and eventually they become so afraid that the cell recognizes the end of a chromosome as though it would be a broken piece of DNA and they shut the cell down trying to repair it and try to stick it together with another piece and you end up with a bunch of genetic chaos one thing that cells do to prevent from becoming a tumor as they shut themselves down and they become senescent and that's a whole other problem for the body once you've got a the zombie cell that's not dividing and is in panic mode but telomeres do a road as we get older so they've served as a pretty good clock but what happens is that cells can divide faster in different tissues some tissues don't even divide so it's not like a universal clock like the one that

[00:29:19] I just described that Horvath and others discovered was a paper that came out maybe six months ago in science after remember that you had the twin astronauts one astronaut was at the space station for a year the other his twin brother was on earth for the same period of time of course and the paper was interesting in that and there were two actually I'm trying to remember there was one of the two papers I read so it's possible I'm going to misrepresent this because I don't have all of the data but what I remember struck me is interesting enough that I was surprised nobody else was talking about it or if they were I was somehow missing it was they made a big deal about the fact that a lot of changes occurred in space and certainly some of these were very obvious and predictable you could imagine bone density going down muscle mass things like that but they talked about how there was this dramatic difference in the length of the telomeres of these two twins who presumably would have I assume they had measured pre and post so it wasn't but what was really interesting was within something like two to three days of being back on earth the twin that was in space had a complete reversion to what his brother was when he was back on earth and maybe I'm just skeptical but that made me a little less interested in telomeres is a particularly relevant metric of the age of an individual would you interpret that differently no I agree with that that something that can change within days is less interesting as a clock compared to something that seems to be immutable and ticking every day of your life that's the holy grail and it looks like we may have found something like that in the field and

[00:30:48] Horowitz is a pretty young guy yeah younger than me so he's in his forties I think and he's a mathematician he is at UCLA he needed to be a mathematician because to find the clock you can't just read all the methyl groups you actually need to train a computer that uses machine learning to find out which are the ones that change with age and those others that just randomly change I know I've read a tiny bit about this enough to be dangerous right so horath used the data from like alumina or something like that there was publicly available data he had maybe eight thousand samples to study and presumably enough of it was longitudinal in other words he must have had some samples of the same people that would give you one piece of data but I guess if he knew the age of the person's you could train a machine as you're saying I guess to see how much methylation has occurred I guess I apologize if this question goes beyond your level expertise on this subject that sounds like he's someone I should interview as well is he able to or are you able to in your lab look at methyl groups and know if they've been there for a long period of time if they're new if they are additions or if they basically they were largely inherited I mean do you have that capacity we do that works because we know from building the clock that at age five years of age this is the pattern that was likely there for an average human and this is the pattern of an 80 year old and all in between but that would be true at a macro level but I'm saying at the level of a given gene are you actually able to infer that yes so Corvettes clock is built there were a number of clocks whose latest one is built on a few hundred sites on the genome they're very specific and for reasons that he doesn't understand and I think we are beginning to understand those are the ones that are sensitive to

[00:32:28] H and that tick along and some tick differently in different tissues but he recently published a universal clock and another group at Harvard published a universal clock for mice which means it doesn't matter if I give you a blood sample or skin sample or a brain sample by looking at that precise location on the genome next to gene X and you look at 300 of them all so then you can actually say exactly what age that Mouse is independent of what part of that

[00:32:55] Mouse you're given that's kind of amazing when you consider the fact that if you didn't know that a priori you had to start with all of the genes and look at all of the potential sites of methylation but just be an unbelievable problem when Hovis and the other guy that did this when those papers came out it was really hard to believe because for the last 50 years we've been dreaming of a clock but the evolutionary biologist said nah it's just uh organisms wasting away like a car breaks down like of selection for longevity there's no way there's gonna be a clock because aging is not considered a genetic program and it isn't there isn't a program that tells us we must age no one I know in the right mind believes that but there are processes like I was describing about the movement of these so proteins in yeast and movement in mammals like us that leads to a predictable change on our genome that changes the way genes are switched on and off as we age in very precise locations but what truly blows my mind is that the cell somehow knows which are the young ones in which are the old ones and when we tell it to it can reset the cell back to what it was but you don't want to go too far your point about stem cells is well taken if you push it too far and some labs have done that one colors--

[00:34:14] Belmonte at the Salk Institute showed you turn on this reprogramming you can actually cause tumors in a mouse or actually turn them on really fast and they'll die within two days you can push those balls up that landscape from the valleys far too quickly and the cells they don't just regain their identity they go all the way back to being basically an embryo and that's that's not going to help anybody if we kill people off to two days but in my lab we do what's called partial reprogram when we push them a little bit so that they regain their youth but they don't lose their identity so let me think about this for a second so when you go back to the analogy of

[00:34:48] Shannon which is you've got receiver operator trying to communicate through a signal through an electrical signal there's a loss of fidelity in the signal so the receiver operator pair have to be able to compare this transmitted signal to a master signal when you bring that analogy down into our DNA is it the expectation that within every cell resides a master copy or not necessarily within every cell it appears to be within every cell because when we reprogram the animal and currently we're choosing to reprogram the retina and restore eyesight in all mice the cells that get the reprogramming signal from the three genes we put in those cells will survive will regrow will restore their function back to being young again and if a cell next door doesn't get the reprogramming signal it doesn't regenerate so it appears to be intrinsic for each cell we can also do that in the dish we can grow human cells grow nerve cells mini brain in the dish we can reprogram those to be young again and survive a stress such as chemotherapy and regrow as though they were young embryonic cells again so let's talk about what this reprogramming means what I mean by reprogramming is that we can use technology that we use now to generate stem cells but to partially reprogram them so that they turn on the youthful pattern of genes that we once had that we know we lose there's no question as we get older our cells don't turn on the genes that they once did we know young and genes that should be on when you young get switched off so we lose that that's that noise of genetic noise I call it reprogramming somehow resets that pattern in terms of the hose and the spooling of the DNA what's actually going on is that genes that were once tightly bundled up by the sir proteins and by methylated DNA coming undone as we get older this noise reprogramming somehow tells the cell that region of the genome package that up again get the so proteins to go back there get the methyl back there or remove them and get that gene to switch off again because that gene has no business being on in the retina you might need it somewhere else and somehow somehow a liver cell knows that that gene shouldn't be silenced maybe it should come on but there's a repository so in shannon parlance he calls it the observer his backup disk is called the observing the observer keeps a signal keeps the original signal until it's needed and if the receiver of the signal does the checksum you know where to checksum is I don't know you listeners will know that every time a signal is sent we know that it is complete because it all methods up if that doesn't add up that's a signal that says oh there's been a transmission error right and instead of going back to the original sender it goes to the observer who keeps a copy of the original signal and gets the rest of the data so if you're sending and let's say a photo to Instagram often you're in the subway or it doesn't make it half of the picture will make it but

[00:37:54] Instagram computers will say hey I only own half this picture didn't add up the checksum didn't make any sense please resend the rest of that signal it may be stuck in Denmark it may be stuck in Iceland somewhere but the system set up that way and that's what I think is going on in every cell in our body is that information is still there how DNA is largely intact we haven't lost the genes gene mutations that was the old idea in the 1950s that information is that we just don't access it because the cells don't know whether to spool up the

[00:38:24] DNA and hide it or to expose it to turn on the right genes and I'm still just kind of blown away by this notion that you can you shared with me once a story about how the horvath clock was accurate enough that you could even predict how much a person had smoked yeah this paper recently came out they had the records of packs per day that were accurate based on I guess medical records and then he also asked these patients how much do you think you were smoking over your lifetime and they made up some number based on what they remembered the clock matched what the medical record said and not what the person said so I'm sure they weren't lying no of course not because they would have had to have told the medical record in the first place but presumably it's easier over time to tell like if you ask a person every year how much they're smoking you'll get a more accurate response of the aggregate smoke versus at the end of that's exactly right what it tells us is that this clock there's there's no line here your DNA doesn't lie your clock records probably every good activity and every bad activity that you've had in your life you talked about the ultimate wearable could you imagine we love our rings and our see GM's and all of these things but imagine you had a little horvath clock you could stick into your interstitial fluid it's coming if you gave me your DNA I could tell you how old you are biologically I would love to do that in fact you know it would be fun is let's do a longitudinal sample we'll sort of stress the system a little bit so we'll do here's some DNA and then we'll do a fast you know I'll go a week without eating or something like that because that's a pretty extreme stress like a week of fasting should do it in fact we should do this with rapamycin dosing like I'm curious as to whether the pulsatile dosing of rapamycin that I take does that have an impact in other words you you start to wonder are there final common pathways that so many of these higher level interventions impact I think level is the right word the spooling of the DNA this epigenome there were various levels the superficial level are these transient proteins we call them transcription factors that jump across the genes and tell them to be read another level down of these search ones that we work on actually chemically modify the spalling proteins your column histones and then the deepest level the third level down is this methylation clock which is very hard to reverse as far as I know the only way to really do it is using a stem cell technology this reprogramming factors Yamanaka in other words your belief is I want to come back to that cuz I actually like that level system you just put forward but the reason you're saying that is the best year evidence suggests in the lab today outside of using a vector to actually insert new DNA or something is you can change the rate but you can't change the direction is that sort of what you're seeing yeah that's a summary of now hundreds of papers on this topic it's a scary thought all of these interventions rapamycin nad boosters metformin all the data is not in of course we need to do more but the first studies have said that they have relatively little impact on this very deep clock and they slow it down that's fine they stopped the marbles or the balls from jumping too far across valleys but they don't get the balls to go back into the bellies that they were once when we were young which makes sense you can take rapamycin or nad boost or metformin and restore vision in a mouse like we are with reprogramming factors so let's talk about that that's a obviously now we're we're entering the future this is so talk about that experiment well so what we did was we took three of the Yemen arkad genes that they used to make stem cells and we packaged them into what's called an AAV at no associate of ours there's a virus by the way is you already used by many companies there are a number of products on the market some are used actually to fix eye diseases genetic diseases so this isn't some crazy super science fiction story this is medical fda-approved drug development we take these vectors viruses we package these three genes in which is not easy because they don't hold much so he whittled this down we gave it an on-off switch which is important because you don't want to become a stem cell you don't want your eye to develop a tumor if it mine we did another trick which is important which is we left off the fourth Yamanaka factor called Mik now Mik is a well-known on Cugine gene that causes cancer that didn't take a genius to leave that off but what was surprisingly rewarding to see was that the Mik gene was superfluous we didn't need it to reprogram cells to be partially young again how did you program the on/off switch oh that's really interesting - this is a in the field we use a system where we can feed a cell or a mouse doxycycline and it's just an antibiotic so my daughter who had Lyme disease will tell you it's not great for long-term use but just for a week or a month it's fine we've given it to mice for the whole life they seem to be okay we set it up so that what's called a doxycycline responsive gene and so now when we have the virus and you can silence the gene with doxy basically you use something inert that has a trigger yeah we could have used a bunch of different chemicals but we use this one because it's you understand it well and it's pretty benign and the FDA would likely approve it because we know a lot about it we didn't reengineering so that was extremely tight so we don't want any leaky gene if we don't want it and we also made its levels very low because we don't want to blow the system out so we made this new version of the virus and delivered it and an adenovirus for folks who might not know what that term is these are very common viruses well many of us have been exposed to these already presumably everybody has I mean it'd be hard to not be exposed to an adenovirus at some point but unless you live in a bubble and there's so many different ones yeah and remind me is an adenovirus a DNA virus or an RNA virus I can't yeah I can't remember yeah I used to know that okay so it's a basically and how much DNA can you pack into it I'm pretty sure it's a DNA VAR so we packaged DNA in there you can pack 5.4 thousand base pairs of DNA okay alright and you go back to these mice and the phenotype of the mouse is what at this point it's a old mouse middle aged mouse well we've done three crazy things to a mouse to test the first thing we do is we crush the optic nerve so you took a normal mouse and you crushed its optic nerve so now it can't see ya and only very very young mice will regrow nerves you break your spine you're not gonna walk again and so we thought maybe if we turn the age of those cells back to being extremely young they'll grow back and there's nothing that works to grow all the way back healthy optic nerve so we did that I won't reveal the punchline yet we also these are all collaborations

[00:45:06] I should credit my collaborators gee gang here at the Children's Hospital in Boston and a Bruce Cassandra's lab did this experiment I'm going to tell you about glaucoma so he puts pressure in the eye pressure is one of the largest rivers of glaucoma and disrupts vision and then third experiment was to take just regular old mice there were two years of age and reprogram those actually there were 12 months of ia tweeting go too far but by 12 months of age Mouse has lost a lot of education about interesting cuz that's only about 35 year-old human right yeah 40 it's about 40 year old but those mice we thought even that's an old house so most people can't restore vision in anything we have now treated much older mice and we do see some partial effects but okay so let me recap that so you've got the first group are young mice but they've had their optic nerve surgically traumatized or traumatized through compression you have a second group I don't recall the age but you increased intraocular pressure to mimic glaucoma and then the third group you ters took relatively old mice that had a natural decline in their vision right and there are two ways that Bruce's life measures vision in mice one is you expose all you show it a TV screen with moving lines and the lines can be thick or thin and you've got really good vision you can see the thin lines and you can watch the mouse turn its head and if it's blind or can't see it obviously won't move its head now that's partially subjective it's not bad but doing something completely objective and you can't measure the electrical signal yeah in the occipital cortex okay so we stick an electrode in the back of the eye and measure the signals they come like an electrocardiogram for the retina and that doesn't lie you want both to agree with each other but that one we can measure before and after treatment and there we can see what the virus is doing now one thing that I haven't mentioned which your listeners may be interested in is when do we turn on the virus and because we want to treat patients we're not just doing this for fun we turned on these Yamanaka genes in the virus after the treatment not before because if you've got glaucoma or you've damaged your optic nerve or you're old you need to be able to reverse that not just prevent the damage and so we did that so these results that we've put out there actually show that in all three experiments you regenerate nerves and in the case of glaucoma and old mice they get their vision back so let's go through actually technically how you do this so the adenovirus vector now contains the modified stem cell basically the genes of a modified stem cell is that a safe way to describe it well a better way would be that these are genes that specify us during embryogenesis so it tells the cells but you took it back - yeah I was trying to figure out where you so you basically have the methylated pattern of the gene that Mouse would have had during development well we think so we've measured the clock in no cells after reprogramming and they are younger

[00:48:04] Steve Horvath helped us with that but what's also interesting is we can look at which genes are on and off and if we look at the young Mouse and the old Mouse and look at which genes are on and off we can see that we've got noise now genes that shouldn't be on coming on such as genes that are involved in stress responses and other genes interestingly are coming on that shouldn't be in the eye any young Mouse and those are very interesting some of those are think about 80 of them are taste receptors meaning proteins that stick out of cells and smell actual receptors in a mouse or homologues to other animals well they're predicted to be taste receptors or smell receptors they're called olfactory receptors but what they doing in the back of the eye and why they change with aging is so far a complete mystery

[00:48:49] I could speculate that they're important for signaling chemicals that have nothing to do with smell has this been identified for example in humans do we know that humans also have olfactory nerves in their eyes I don't believe so I think we were the first to figure that out that there were sporadic accounts of it because it's so weird very few people have paid attention to it but anyway the end of the story is that when we reprogram the retina those genes that were coming on during aging get turned off and vice versa how many genes are we talking about David this particular process just a hundreds hundreds of genes in terms of statistical significance depends where you want to draw the line so I think it might be a few hundred that are really significant but the thing that blows my mind about this result is that the genes that went down with aging just a little bit when we programmed come up a little bit and those genes that went way down with aging when you reprogram away up so it's as though the cell knows that this gene should be put back to the way it was and

[00:49:47] I haven't some ideas but I have no evidence how that actually happens sorry to interrupt but does that correlate to how much methylation is on the gene in other words you talked about this gene was down a little bit and it corrected to going up a little bit this one was down a lot and it corrected to go up a lot is the little versus a lot correspond closely to the extent of methylation we don't know that yet you're right at the cutting edge of the work in my lab one prediction would be that those chemical changes map to those genes that we see change but we haven't overlapped those data sets yet but it's the next exciting possibility one thing that we do see is that if we stress a sell-out let's say we break its chromosome for a day the cell actually has these hypersensitive regions that will open up and stay open and that's evidence for epigenetic noise and so what I think is going on is that cells in their daily response to broken DNA in other things like UV damage when we go to the beach don't wear sunglasses that back-and-forth of how we have got to go put out that fire we go to go repair that chromosome has led to these regions of the chromosome that are sensitive to opening up and once they're open up and that methyl groups have removed or have been added in the wrong place they stay that way unless we reprogram them somehow the cell knows oh that one screwed up let's go back to being young again so let's play devil's advocate for a moment in clinical medicine we're actually 20 years almost exactly - the first time someone used one of these adenovirus vectors to treat a patient wasn't it 20 years ago at Penn Jesse were they I don't remember his last name now cuz of the G I believe blanking on this but basically a patient died right and that sort of really really changed the trajectory of genetic engineering and I always thought that as tragic as that death was it was a little bit of a distraction from what I always took to be was a much bigger issue which was how penetrant can you get these vectors how ubiquitous can you get these vectors let's use an example if somebody had the belief that a pony for gene was predisposing them to Alzheimer's disease which it is right it's a predisposition it's not a fait accompli the likelihood that you could engineer a vector to swap every copy of a pony for with a new copy of a pony - for example it seems very improbable if you're doing that once they're an adult I mean if you're gonna have a shot at doing that as there's reports of this in China I haven't really followed this but there's all this talk about these CRISPR babies where they're engineering out LP little-a and things like that in embryos but how technically difficult is this to do in a complex organism like a mouse or ultimately a human where you need to change enough of the gene to actually put the right program and I'm blanking on what the analogy is going back to

[00:52:48] Shannon's observer because that looks sort of binary it's sort of like receiver operator observer okay but here it's like don't you have to get enough of the corrected version of the gene to actually get the optic nerve back I don't know my question makes sense by the way it is binary in the sense that if a cell doesn't get the virus it's not going to be reprogrammed so the current limit to technology right now is getting it into how many of the cells can actually get the virus that's really what I mean yeah at the cellular level it's binary but but it's sort of analog across all the cells right yeah it is and that's the problem we face that's why it's gonna take a while to reprogram an entire human being these viruses like the liver for example and you don't want to you know give yourself liver cancer just trying to reprogram your nose or whatever that wins the Darwin Award right if you the person who does that I cured my wrinkles when I died of teratoma I would predict that at some point people are going to try and use this for cosmetic effects as well we don't know what we can rebuild we know we can restore retina we can regrow optic nerves we don't yet know how much we can reprogram an entire animal let alone an entire human but one thing that has held us back in my luck is that we can't deliver these AAV these viruses to every cell in a mouse now the good news is we may not have - maybe we only need to reprogram a quarter of them and we get to be a lot healthier and younger we don't know that yet but in the eye the reason we chose the eye as well besides the fact that we really like a challenge is that the eye has drugs approved for viral delivery it's relatively insensitive to the rest of the immune system so even if you've got anything someone's interested you know it's protected organ and then we've got the fact that we can deliver a lot of virus and in fact about half of the optic nerves in the back of the eye can I get a vote on the next tissue to work on here so a prostate you have a lot of the similar features you have a very immune privileged location every single man will get prostate cancer in his life well we can't figure out as which ones are gonna die of it imagine you could take the prostate gland of a man who's 50 so a 50 year old has I don't know something like a 40 percent chance of already having prostate cancer again fortunately most of those will not go on to kill but the prostate causes a lot there's really no need for your prostate gland once you get beyond a certain point but rather than eradicate it imagine just restoring it back to you prostate and getting rid of the cancer and getting rid of some of the hypertrophy and the other things that come along with it I mean it just strikes me as a very discrete immune protected organ that you could go after

[00:55:26] I'm sure there's ten problems I haven't thought of that a urologist is listening to this sort of yeah I think it makes sense except from a business standpoint where diseases that have much more need than long term effects oh so you're saying that that loss of vision is acute enough that there's there's a reason to do something about it immediately as soon as you're experiencing visual loss exactly oh you're having heart failure got no other choice but to try this are you gonna die those are the early low-hanging fruit that to help people we need to figure out is this safe there's some risk right there's no risk-free drug except for fish oil which we don't know anymore if that's highly effective so there are risks and with this technology that we don't yet know what those risks are we're going for the eye because it's not likely to cause any problem we've gone long-term studies in the mice many months no effect on anything negative if it was perfectly safe I think the prostate would make a lot of sense if we had a drug on the market the doctor could try that in clinical trial off-label but I think the future looks bright if we can get one tissue or one organ be reprogrammed so so cardiac myocytes how technically challenging will that be and do you have a mouse model for that yet a heart failure or mouse model we have hypertrophy that's the best model we have in my lab they may be better ones third time the problem with hypertrophy is they retain contractility right so it's sort of you almost want a mouse model where they've lost some of the contractility that strikes me as it I don't know I could be wrong but that strikes me as the easiest place to try to figure this out all right yeah need to research this I wonder if two oxen would be one way to go hmm interesting so what steps exist between this proof of concept in mice to an actual human clinical trial even in Phase one well the good news is about and I study is that you go straight to Phase two because you have enough other adenoviral vectors out there that they give you your safety in phase one well my understanding is that in the eye it's a special condition where healthy volunteers don't want their eye injected with virus of course so you're not going to do a dose escalation and by the listeners they make you do dose escalation in a disease population for example with cancer drugs a lot of times the phase one is still done in cancer patients all right well the advice that I've been given is that we could go to our face to immediately and so that obstacle is surprisingly not getting the patient doing the trial actually making it a virus there's such a gold rush an interest in gene therapy that making these aDNA viruses can take a year and it's about twice as much as it cost a couple of years ago gene therapy has gone from wow so that's kind of the opposite of what you think of with Moore's Law on the sort of transistor side we're more interest more technology should get cheaper it will but we're in that uptick of supply versus demand and the demand is huge and it's probably because it's the hottest thing now being able to edit the genome correct genetic diseases and now reprogram the body this is massively interesting area that holds huge amount of promise and presumably profit if there's promise well otherwise you're not gonna get people to put their hard-earned money behind it unless they're very philanthropic the point is that I think you raised this Olli I know you raised totally that the gene therapy used to be the pariah of medical treatments because it was thought to be dangerous risky probably won't work that's gone at 180 and now if you have a gene therapy company they've been a few they're being sold in the billions recently these are extremely hot everything that's new breaking new ground investors are all over it how did the vectors today differ from the vectors 20 years ago and I don't even remember the story particularly well of when this boy died presumably he died of sepsis or something sort of related to but not the direct proximate result of the gene therapy my understanding is these were different types of viruses that could integrate into the genome and cause mutation and that led to problems not least with standing up the could load tumors the viruses today don't cause cancer they don't integrate and they don't have any negative side effects other than an immune reaction how is that possible that this is not putting sorry you're saying the problem used to be that it was putting its

[00:59:41] DNA in as well as packaged DNA that it was carrying with it yeah that's my recollection that they had a propensity to integrate into the genome so where is gene therapy today with things like sickle-cell and some of the really obvious like if you're thinking about what's the poster child for gene therapy its sickle cell its thalassemia its cystic fibrosis like you can rattle off 20 diseases that are tailor-made for this because they're single known gene mutations yeah well people who are interested in this should google it clinical trials dog clinical trials.gov has a bunch of these oh yeah many many this is a great example of how asleep at the wheel I am it's like my day job to pay attention to medicine but you get siloed into one thing that I'm interested in and I'm my knowledge of gene therapy is 18 years old it's kind of embarrassing myself as I the more I'm talking the more embarrassing but don't be so hard on yourself even I can't keep my head is spinning and this is my day job I absorb a lot of this because it through osmosis I meant meetings and whatever but every day I have to read or at least skim 50 papers just to keep up and in my area let alone someone else's so there's no way you or certainly anyone who's not following this for a living can keep up so you're saying that right now there are active clinical trials ongoing for people with these really obvious candidate genes sickle cell is a company that looks really promising as clinical trials Eveline in progress so yeah I think it won't be long maybe just a few years before these diseases are correctable now that cost a lot and this is probably topic we shouldn't jump into because it's a completed version but because they're one-shots then to recoup the cost that it cost these are extremely expensive the SPARC therapeutics drug that treats a type of retinal degeneration it's one or two injections I think student injections but it's in the high hundreds of thousands per treatment that's a lot of money and some politicians are up in arms about that so companies are getting more innovative in how this might play out and I'm aware of one biotech that said if in five years you're not cured you don't have to pay for the treatment it's interesting I've also heard of models this sounds even more controversial where the cost of the treatment is basically taken out as future earnings of an individual whose health is restored so you're sort of tying it back to a gain in productivity so if someone who can't see as their vision restored well they're gonna presumably be able to make more money or do X Y & Z and a more productive fashion over the remainder of their life and a portion of that gets paid back to remunerated I mean I got to say I am really glad that that's not the problem I have to solve because I can really empathize with both sides of these debates I don't it's very difficult for a drug company to sort of find their motivation to do these things without some clarity around how these things can be priced and at the same time it seems criminal to say it's gonna cost a couple hundred thousand dollars for someone who's born with sickle-cell anemia to be free of sickle cell anemia I mean that I'm glad the smarter people let me get to figure that one out I want to go back to this thing because I'm still sort of wrapping my mind around this idea of the horvath clock so two totally unrelated thoughts first is in the short-term can we use this as a way to measure our progress with the interventions we have at our disposal so remember a few months ago you and me and

[01:03:12] NIR we're sort of hanging out in Boston I don't even remember what we were doing we were just sort of talking about some stuff but I made this argument that we already have some pretty amazing quote unquote drugs out there there's the really obvious ones like rapamycin that are actual drugs but then there are other quote unquote drugs like exercise exercise is a very potent drug fasting is a very important drug if you want to use that terminology loosely but we still don't really know how to dose these drugs that well and again with the case of rapamycin I talked a little bit about my use of it I reading the literature says pulsatile use of rapamycin probably the right way to do it constitutive use probably not but truthfully should it be pulsed every three days every five days every seven days every ten days at what dose not really sure fasting you and I have talked about this all day long could come up with an infinite number of permutations and combination for how one should fast and my fear is we won't get really good answers in these because one the biomarkers we have today are far too crude to really tell you what's going on even slapping a continuous glucose monitor on 24/7 doesn't come close to giving you this insight looking at IGF in my opinion certainly doesn't give you this insight we need something deeper to your point right we need to go deeper deeper deeper and because these interventions are not essentially profitable there's really no great incentive for the biomedical community to be studying them but yet those are some of the best interventions we have and for many of us will never have the opportunity to have an adenovirus shove down our retinal cavity to fix our eyes it's gonna be hey how do we eat how do we sleep how do we exercise and how do we take drugs that are currently available so do you think there's an opportunity to do this to use these clocks to look at the extent of methylation an epigenetic change within our DNA - as you said even though none of these things are likely to reverse it the way the intervention that you described is if we study rates of change that could be a great first order proxy right but it's still not going to tell you within a month of what you've just done is working if every year a person had a look at their clock and you could say hey David I'm sort of making this up but David since I saw you last year your genetic clock sped up nine months relative to the 12 months of chronologic aging that you've undergone keep up the good work I can't tie it to what you've done but would I be able to at least directionally say whatever you've done in the last year has been directionally correct versus if you showed up after the following year and it said oh gosh

[01:05:59] David you've aged two years epigenetically something's not good now you might say yeah I got a divorce and got fired oh okay no guff it's not good but that doesn't offer much help but anyway I'm just sort of thinking about this through purely selfish reasons I'm gonna be completely transparent I just want to know what to do yeah I think the clock gives us the ability to do that we did it with telomeres got the filter it would telomeres but it wasn't as as this new clock so you could do that you could every year even every six months do your DNA methyl I'm the

[01:06:29] Horvath clock and have a look at your rate of change if you've got stored blood samples you could go back and see what that change was back in time be interesting everybody could save a blood sample and go back in time - are there any companies that are doing this there are that just have sprung up I can't remember their names off the top my head but you can find them on the internet they'll tell you your DNA methylation age yeah interesting I was actually just looking at something totally unrelated to this but equally outside of my wheelhouse the other day which was it was looking at something around endogenous versus eggs Aegina se GE formation and I was like how has no one come up with a company to measure this because that's the crux of everything right it's not about people get so phosphorylated about how many AG EES they're eating and they don't realize it's the endogenous production of Ag es that are far bigger issue this is like screaming commercial application well yes host evolve ëthe and i were approached by someone who wanted to start a company that would measure your age and then tell you what supplements to take and he and I didn't believe that the science was rigorous enough yet to say what would correct the clock but those experiments that you're talking about could actually do that so the second thing I wanted to come back to on this is something I think we may have touched on very briefly in our first podcast is around senescence cells and this is one of those things where you see the picture on the front cover of science or nature and it's mind-boggling so you've got this old mouse this old decrepit Mouse sitting right next to what looks like a spry plump young beautiful mouse and the punchline is guess what they're the same age but in the beautiful young one we took this subset of cells called senescence cells and we killed them so maybe explain what that is at a high level and how it overlaps with or differs from everything you've just described with respect to the methylation clock well if it just doesn't go back to the jostling of the epigenome and the noise that's introduced what we've shown in my lab is that creating this noise and the way we do it in my lab we like to use a broken DNA to distract the proteins what we see is that the early stages of aging do this epigenomic noise leads to a loss of self-identity the very end stage of that process is that the cells check out of the cell cycle so they don't divide anymore but they don't die they just sit there and they're stuck in this emergency State there are other things that can cause senescence loss of the ends of the chromosomes the telomeres will also cause a cell to say whoa got a real problem here got a broken piece of

[01:09:08] DNA at the end my chromosome let's shut this down before we become a tumor and it's thought that these cells these senescence cells are really important to prevent cancer from taking off because they shut themselves down and they stay like zombies in our tissues for decades and they don't die the problem is that they don't just sit there they're actually they're sort of poisoning the well they're in a state of stress and they're saying to these cells around them oh my god I'm panic you guys should be panic too so they they send out chemicals and proteins that stress the other cells the other cells are now in a panic State and their epigenome I believe is getting disrupted and accelerated as well so if I'm hearing you correctly you're saying the senescence cells can be part of the cause of the methylation and epigenetic interference with the non senescent presumably dividing cell or active cell yeah and so there's some evidence for that like I said we can disrupt the epigenome they get senescent those senescence cells you can now put extra normal cells and they will induce senescence or cancer in those cells or make them tumorigenic we call it the other experiment that was beautiful was done by a Jim Kirkland at the Mayo

[01:10:21] Clinic he took some sinasohn cells and he implanted them a little bit in a little dab into the peritoneal cavity the lining of the gut under the skin and those mice ended up having signs of premature aging higher blood sugar and other things so a little bit of citizen cells goes a long way and that's what's scary because if you take fat from a young and an old mouse or a young and an old human we can actually stay we can color them whether they're senescent or not and when they turn senescent we can say in them blue there's men's own they make or be a collector size if you stain tongue fat it actually looks white but if you look at middle-aged it's pale blue and an older mouse or an older human 50 years old my age now it's dark blue it's packed with these essence cells in the fat and no wonder the rest of the body is in a panic state if these fat cells are now sending out the emergency screening signal what is the phenotypic identification of a senescence cell well that's still debated at conferences but we all agree that they turn blue that beautiful exercise is there are other genes that come on the signal DNA damage one called p16 one called p21 these are genes that cause cells to check out of the cell cycle and stop cancer if you lose these genes actually it predisposes you to cancer it makes sense there are other issues which is that some certain cells don't have that particular signature and there are other cells that are non senescent that do have those signatures presumably right not so many well there are some there's a mouse that was made by Ned Sharples who's now the head of the FDA so he made a mouse that would fluoresce with firefly lucifer aids a glowing mouse that was under the control of the p16 gene so that if he 16 came on that cell or that tissue would claw a green so he had that mouse we found that if a cell or tissue got stress let's say they a mouse had an infection or it got damaged or was nibbled on or for some reason was just stressed out the p16 gene that fluorescent signal came on so that you're right there are other things that can turn this on so it's not definitive there is actually no definitive way to tell senescence in a tissue versus none besides this blue stain which seem to be pretty good Wow going back to the third group of mice that you worked on this was the one that was just older presumably at had senescence cells it had senescent optic neuron cells they weren't senescent yet I see so you'd stay in those you knew that they weren't you didn't have any senescence cells that were contributing to the visual deficits that were slowly accumulating we looked because I was curious as to whether we saw that I don't believe we saw some essence the reason that it's also highly unlikely is that we don't know how to reverse an essence even with reprogramming well so that's exactly the question I was gonna ask which is if you saw them did they change in the presence of the reprogramming or did they still stay there that's the next experiment actually in my lab we need to know if that's true there's a postdoc listening to this who's cursing right now because

[01:13:22] I think I've rattled off a couple of next experiments for your lab right well there's 30 people in my labs oh yes that's good but yet it's an important question but what I think is going to turn out is that if you're priests innocent and you just lost your identity then that's reversible we see that in the lab in the retina but if you've clicked over into this zombie State then you're in this state that maybe possibly never reversible I would never say never but that's a lot more difficult so what does that mean for the future how does that fit into your CD analogy so if you've got a scratched CD and the scratches are being caused by a senescent actor that's out of the replicating pool but it's poisoning the well you're telling me you can buff out the scratches in the CD but you can't get rid of the scratcher and you're accumulating more and more scratches over time you are but it theoretically it should be possible to even get a citizen cell to grow again because it should have all of its DNA still there now there are issues if it's lost as telomeres it won't like being brought out of senescence or its soonest because it's full of mutations that can also cause senescence so there are reasons why you wouldn't want to get us in a cell to start growing again you might cause cancer but there are other reasons cells check out that isn't cured of loss of information so we've got a pretty badly scratch to CD that we can polish with reprogramming but if you've

[01:14:47] Gaudet even reprogramming can't work then we need something else probably but I wouldn't say for sure so this is now let's get into sort of a little bit more of the sci-fi speculation where do you think would be the ideal application for this clinically in terms of in humans explicitly for the purpose of longevity and not disease treatment so we've already talked about lots of applications on the gene therapies is your belief add that is the only application that using reprogramming as an anti-aging tool is a precise tool that goes after the specific anti-aging phenotypes oh look your skin is more wrinkly and more saggy boom here's a virus ah your vision is deteriorating boom here's a virus ah your heart muscle doesn't pump as hard boom here's a virus versus a global approach that says no we're gonna go right to the master CD and somehow we can restore your methylation pattern to that of you at your birth which of those two paradigms do you think is the sort of quasi sci-fi but quasi if you had to guess predicted approach well I think within our lifetimes we'll see the first one the coma patients are waiting for this we're working on starting a clinical trial hopefully within the next 18 months so this isn't as far as you might think how long before we can treat other diseases

[01:16:13] I think that it's going to depend on the severity of the disease in the FDA but I could imagine within this decade that a multiple diseases heart maybe not skin I don't know about that but other severe disease will be tackled either one by one but we're not just waiting for that in my lab we've already dosed mice with the virus intravenously to see what would happen the good news is that we're all still alive they're all still happy no evidence of what's the expression pattern ah well this is the issue majority is in the liver some in the gut that's him add no feature isn't it bad no really loves the liver yeah if somebody hadn't n know that got into every cell evenly we be said that science fiction future could be within our lifetimes where we get a dose only young of had no virus we get to age 40 and we're starting to experience the signs of aging our eyesight isn't as good as at night we have to hold them in you bit far away I'm there by the way yeah mate I just I hit it man I hit it at 45 and a half I can't believe it it happened overnight and it's exactly the scenario you described it's the restaurant tiny print dark well you're losing your vision if you had been infected with the adenovirus your doctor or your doctor you could have someone prescribe a course of doxycycline for a month and in if we're right you'll get your vision back and you'll get who knows what back it's amazing it's funny with all of these incredible as you describe at this huge re uptick in the interests around gene therapy I have to believe some of these companies are looking for better vectors as well I mean if the fact that I remember ad know has a predisposition for the liver that tells you it's 200 years ago as news are there other viruses that appear more promising well there were dozens in academia now they come with greater risk of course right no these are slight variations on what's currently using that clinic and different companies are using different vectors so av9 it's good for muscles so companies are going for muscular dystrophy with AV 9 AV 11 and 2 or good for the eye there's a menu now of dozens but there briefly I'll still adenovirus they are there slight tweaks on the proteins that tell the virus way to go in but what I hear is that some companies I forget if it's Roche bread that's my recollection has made millions of different varieties and if that's true we may be able to choose any tissue we want you know in other words we're not getting away from the tissue specific paradigm well eventually we will why not I mean if it's on the market what's gonna stop somebody from trying this anyway cuz I think it gets to a theoretical question which comes down to you sort of alluded to it earlier why do I need a new car eventually can I just keep replacing each individual failing part or at some level do I need a new car is there some final thing that it becomes impossible to replace like the chassis just especially you're in Boston like us

[01:18:59] Californians we don't our chassis is never rust but at some point you could replace the engine and it's not enough we're gonna replace the axle place.this your implies that so if you take this organ specific approach the skin the eyes a heart the lungs the brain is there something else that ultimately is going to lead to our demise or is that effectively just the accumulation of enough senescence cells that the gouges in the CD becomes so deep that even an organ specific approach ultimately fails where I'm really going with this is is there even theoretically an argument for cellular immortality theoretically this is as close as we've come to finding weight and actually live for thousands of years I don't know about immortality I think that the problem with what I'm calling the information theory of aging which is what I wrote about in my book is that we do lose information every cell does experience mutations it's not perfect though I know I can take some of your cells and clone you make a young version of Peter but it doesn't work for all cells and so ultimately if you're a thousand years old you may have lost a lot of the genetic information but epigenetic information because there's this backup Drive this observer that we have found exists in cells somehow that you can tap into as long as the genome that DNA strands are still largely intact we can reverse aging but it's an information loss issue so the gouging that we get may scratch some of the foil in the CD or the DVD and you lose a little bit of the song which you'll never get back now that said if I was George Church using my department he would say no big deal by the time a thousand years goes by we can replace anything and that's probably true a whole system recode of bones why not grow a whole new heart put it in that's going to be doable so what I think the future holds is the following a lifestyle where you're monitoring yourself with devices devices tell you what to eat when to eat if you want to pay attention you don't have to listen but when there's a problem you're notified you've got a tumor somewhere in your body we've detected it go had that killed before it grows that's going to be 20 years ahead of what we can do now for patients that'll keep you young and healthy for a lot longer in the meantime we'll learn thanks to guys like you and clinical trials what to do to live longer whether it's the perfect exercise that the perfect combination of diet but is that necessary I mean if you really stop to think about it couldn't you just make the case that all of this nonsense that people like me do and all of this ridiculous effort that goes into fasting and rapamycin and this exercise and sleeping and all of this fun killing activity of my existence if I could reprogram why would I do any of this well yeah I mean who could argue with that I mean like I could literally go and get a biggest most beautiful pizza burger imaginable right now and not worry about any of this stuff all right that's if it comes true so so far so good you know if you can restore a vision I'm sure you can restore a lot of parts to the body let's say reprogramming doesn't work that well and you say you get senescence cells your organs eventually lose their information in their genome then what well you can delete senescence cells you can take someone else's organs or grow your own in the dish or have a pig grow you're on with all that put down if that all worked I would challenge anybody to say that that wouldn't allow people to live a lot longer there's still people out there who say we're never gonna make it past on average 80 85 let alone 200 let alone 220 well I don't know I think it's much easier to imagine an upward movement to a hundred for example I mean look that's sort of my point of view right I think genetically I'm probably engineered to stick around till I'm in my early to mid 80s again this is just looking at my parents which once you get over 80 your genes become a far bigger predictor of your longevity than in your 60s through virtually uncoupled I feel like I've got a gray roadmap on what it means to get to be a hundred which is still stochastic there's no guarantees but it's like how would you stack the odds in your favor kind of thing but it's an entirely another animal to imagine a world where you can take individuals and even get them to be 200 that's a really big leap and I would have said three years ago it's impossible what did you think three years ago would have been the limits of our technology and that's again three years ago you were thinking I could give you more nad I could give you more certain things to activate your sirtuins

[01:23:41] I could tweak your mitochondria this way versus that way based on that level of manipulation what were the limits you thought we were so my thinking was having come from the calorie restriction world that animals that are calorie restricted live at best 30 percent longer and they healthy which is great and the CR mimetics like rapamycin and med for they can depending on how sick the animal is but let's say even rapa in a non sick mouse can give you 30% more life right so as long as we're like a mouse we could live 30% lower so you know 30% of 80 it's a big deal that get 100 right yeah that's 100 that's why I thought someone who does all these things has a better chance of reaching 100 than ever before but what I didn't take into account in those numbers most people don't when they think about this is if we make it to a hundred okay so that means I'm still alive in the year 2000 and 69 what technologies do they have in 2000 69 is reprogramming a common thing probably it will be yeah so in other words this is the optionality play it's if you add 20 years of life extending someone from 80 to a hundred you have to take into account the probability that things come online during that period of time that can also impact very variable that you're trying to manipulate yeah and already every month that we stay alive we get next to a week of life that's how technology is going currently great say that again extra month the distance you'll be able to live an extra week come on that seems too good to be true that's a 25% plus up it can't be right

[01:25:15] I'll check on it did I hear you right I'll tweet that out if it's right but that's what I'm recall here I'm only questioning it just based on it seems too good to be true every additional month of life is offering a week of additional life extension just based on the technologies associated with it I mean because there's no evidence of that to date is there because we really have seen a compression of life expectancy over the last two years haven't we actually seen so up until I think again

[01:25:42] I don't want to I'm probably miss quoting this but directionally I think this is right up until about 2015 life expectancy was increasing at about 0.4% per year that's now crested I don't believe that in this environment that we live in in other words we have figured out a way to eat stress and not exercise our way out of all of the technological benefits that have come our way and that's I think why you're seeing this sort of cresting right where we've solved all of the infectious problems that gave us most our longevity gains way back in the day we figured out that you shouldn't drink out of your sewer and we learn to wash our hands and we've got great antibiotics but these chronic diseases that are killing us now the force that's driving them which I think is basically food sleep lack of exercise stress etcetera etc I feel like those things are weighing down on us more than modern medicine is giving us tools to fight back and at the very least they're at a standoff suddenly in the u.s. that's true it's not true for all countries but one week to a month thing might be a non-us stat then oh yeah it's a global increase in the maximum lifespan so that might take into account again I don't follow this research closely enough to say it but it might be that well you're getting more vaccines in the hands of people who are otherwise unvaccinated and getting fresh water and food into people who are otherwise don't have it is that you think it's not now I have to correct what I said because it's very important it's a graph of the average lifespan of the longest-lived country at the time so Japan has been leading that for the last decade or so so that's important it means it's average lifespan is increasing at the top end so if a country uses all the new technology and has good healthcare and people don't eat themselves to death or take opioids that continues to march up what doesn't seem to change in fact if anything is plateaued or reversed is the maximum lifespan of humans which if you believe

[01:27:37] John Coleman she was a hundred 22 people debate that but some people have made a ton of 1780 no question about it but that seems to be our current limit but did those people take care of themselves absolutely not no no they're the opposite yeah near has done great work on that topic they smoke and drink themselves to an untimely 117 but what if they had access to the knowledge that we have now which is lifestyle some of these medicines that we think can help maybe they would help those people to get beyond that but to really go beyond that I think you need something really new and that's why I'm a lot more optimistic than I was having seen what reprogramming has in terms of potential to be able to not just slow the clock down which is inexorable seemingly inexorable but now actually get cells to go back in time well I mean it's interesting I could talk about this for a lot longer think at this point I mean I think the readers will I think enjoy your book greatly I've deliberately avoided asking you I think some of the questions that are also on my mind about what are the implications of this and I think I get asked these questions a lot and I just defer I just punt I just say look I'm not even trying to solve a societal issue I'm interested in the longevity of the individual and that's a hard enough problem so that's kind of the one that I want to think about and put all of my energy into but in your book you really do actually try to ask the broader question which is what is the implication of a society where people can live to 200 it would change a lot of things so I'll let the readers either hear you on other podcasts to talk about that or do what's even better and just actually read the book themselves but I want to kind of come back to some things that we touched on really briefly in our first discussion that I've had so many follow-up questions on and so if you still got a little eat up to go back to

[01:29:23] Boston tonight to you okay so let's talk a little bit about your own personal habits around stuff so let's start with metformin we've talked a little bit about metformin there are a couple of papers that have come out kind of recently that have suggested hey maybe metformin in the metabolically healthy person and or the person who's exercising is either not effective or potentially blunting the effects of that how are you reading those papers well I thought what you wrote online was excellent I think about the same way which is we've known that one of met

[01:29:54] Foreman's main effects is to quote unquote poison mitochondria it inhibits a group of proteins that generates energy in mitochondria and the response of the body when it has a bit of inhibition of this is to say wow I'm low on energy let's build up those factories so mitochondria are often called the

[01:30:12] Power Packs or the battery packs of the cell they generate chemical energy if you're young or you exercise or you calorie search you'll have more greater area for activity of these mitochondria so more is better in general for humans while mitochondria is good and as we get older we lose that ability metformin slightly inhibits that activity and the response is to make more of them problem is that if you're constantly inhibiting those mitochondria that's not going to be seemingly helpful with this new study for building up mitochondria for exercise now you could argue that maybe you don't need to have more mitochondria after exercise but I think you probably would benefit from more mitochondria so what you suggested that

[01:30:52] I think makes a lot of sense though we need to prove this or at least test it is that if you're exercising don't take metformin on the days we do intense exercise maybe the next day after to let your body recover and build up mitochondria this leads to something that I think is a very clear theme in all the work that I've done the work that others doing what you've been talking about which is pulse your biological stress put your body in a state of anxiety or fear adversity but you don't want to do it all the time your body needs to chance to recover if you want to take a supplement maybe don't take it every day same with rapamycin you don't want that on all the time in fact I wouldn't take rapamycin suddenly if I was exercising because it's gonna tell the cell to hunker down and not grow and you may not even heal after exercise as well with recognizing so I think that the view that the combination of hunker down fast but then exercise on alternative days or take the supplement and exercise I'm told it turn it down they make up a lot of science do you think anybody's going to be able to probe this I mean near is working on obviously getting tain funded and that's obviously asking a slightly different question that's really going after sort of a non diabetic population but is it going to be able to look at this do you think it will be able to tease out this issue that we're talking about or does the study not going to be structured to be able to answer this question I've not heard of anybody who's testing that directly usually there's just one variable and has this changed the way you take metformin it has but I need to put a caveat is that I don't take mid for man regularly anyway I need to find the right time to take it and before I was taking it when my stomach felt in good shape and you can tell when your stomach feels out of whack either you've eaten a big meal the night before or you're just not feeling right a little bit of heartburn out of those cases I don't take me for me because it does a number on my stomach which is great if you don't want to eat but also I'd prefer not to always have a a sore stomach so I was already timing it so now I just take me Foreman went on I know I'm going on a long trip and I'm not gonna sighs you know I'm on planes and trains that's a good time to rebuild your body and then if I'm at home and I'm exercising a couple times a week I'll lay off the mat for me and then what about rapamycin have you ever revisited that I did take it just as an experiment but haven't been taking it regularly one of the things I do when I'm fasting is

[01:33:12] I'm not taking those things obviously so any period of fasting longer than a day those things get stopped again that's sort of a an idea that's not sort of supported necessarily by evidence one way or the other when we last spoke you were taking receiver a trawl you noted that you were taking it with sort of a fattier meal is that still something you're doing that evidence of residual just continues to be good it certainly does no harm I do take it with my tiny bit of yogurt in the morning which I make myself I mean I grow yogurt at home

[01:33:45] I miss that that does no harm I don't have any negative effects my cardiovascular system seems great so do you think that risk Vera trawl like where do you think it ranks in sirtuin activators there's others on the market out there there's other supplements even like pterostilbene that are sold that you can buy online you very eloquently described the story and if people haven't listened to our first podcast obviously this is a great opportunity to hit pause go back and listen to it because you talk about sort of the novelty of resveratrol and how it was sort of the first sort of built for purpose custom this is what it should look like oh let's go get it it's been over ten years hasn't it wasn't like 2006 2007 we first showed that it activated the enzyme sort once or to an in yeast an extend lifespan that was 2003 jeez yeah so do you still think resveratrol is the best if I because this is something I haven't done yet I just haven't been able to convince myself that it's just one more thing I need add to my already complicated regimen and if I wanted to start taking sirtuin activators would you recommend risperdal if so at what dose or would you recommend I take something different and again you can speak to me and you don't have to give advice anybody else oh yeah I never give recommendations but

[01:34:54] I continue to take was very tall because it's cheap its harmless as far as we know but the evidence keeps stacking up that long-term is beneficial I mean it's not going to cure diabetes it's not as powerful in human studies in mice as rapamycin no question but does it extend the lifespan of a mouse that's eating a Western diet absolutely it does that's been done many times it almost seems like it falls potentially into the metformin trap which is the metformin data in metabolically unhealthy people it's pretty hard to argue and metformin is beneficial paradoxically the people who are most obsessed with this stuff are already doing so many of the other quote unquote good lifestyle things that it you wonder is it possible that you're already doing such a good job of all the other things you manage with respect to your health the resveratrol is neutral well maybe if you're optimized like you are I think as good as they can get but if you're elderly and you're not exercising you know wheelchair what else are you gonna do there is some data in my lab that I'll share with you that we haven't published yet but I think it's interesting to mention and I presented it at a meeting in Rotterdam last week for the first time to a big audience so let me just tell the audience quickly what resveratrol is it's a plant molecule you get it from red wine in very small quantities but the amount that we're giving the mice and human studies it's a lot it's hundreds of times more than that so you can't drink your way into enough for a sparrow at all no but you know a glass of wine but that hasn't stopped people from trying right the molecule I take a gram of resveratrol in the morning it's high dose it seemed to be fine what did the

[01:36:24] ITP study way back in the day as a human equivalent or is it too difficult to make that normalization so ITP showed that if you have a healthy Mouse on a lean diet it doesn't extend their licence sorry yeah and then in your lab you took obese or unhealthy Mouse on crappy diet extended lifespan well it depends when you start the diet it was extensive it was 20 30 % I know how you count it and the dose roughly was what we did two different doses they both worked one was 24 mix but Katie Nolan was 240 MiG's per kick it's a big difference that's a 10x difference Yeah right and the low dose was just as effective what did the log higher dose do that the lower dose didn't it kept the mice from gaining weight all right so you're closer to the 24 MiG's per kick no I guess your if you're taking a gram yeah you're sort of in between those right yeah it's on the high end but the result is the following we had a science paper published in 2013 where we went to the effort making a finding research for a mutation in a cert one gene that we had published is likely the way research all works and that mutation blocked resveratrol his ability to activate the sirtuin enzyme and that's been heavily debated and highly controversial it's one of the big controversies in my career so we were forced if not encouraged to do better so we went back we found this mutation that blocked the activation of this enzyme and if we're right then research hall won't work if you've got this mutation in a Cell and we found that was true the drugs that were in development the super potent ones also blocked by this one mutation what the mutation did was it made an enzyme that couldn't be moved it had a stiff elbow and without the bending of the protein at the elbow resveratrol couldn't activate it anymore and we know this very clearly it's been well published in cited but here's the big experiment and being ten years in the making you take the mutation you put it into a mouse not just to sell a mouse that takes a couple of years took us a couple of years and now we have a mouse that isn't normal it's missing one amino acid in an enzyme that renders it susceptible to respiratory worse calcitriol it's immune to the effects of resveratrol in the test unit and now we could repeat how 2006 study of the high-fat diet with him without resveratrol and with and without this mutation and I didn't know this was gonna work in fact in the history of pharmacology I don't know if anyone's ever found one I mean and I said change the block suppliant molecule in the diet and isn't very difficult because in a diet these molecules and plants hitting probably hundreds of proteins but we made this one change and now we could ask the question definitively if you give a mouse was virtual which benefits still occur yeah what are you attenuate but also which are off target which are working through something else that's just as interesting and I really don't give a damn anymore about what the answer is I just want on her and so we did experiment my student pretty much definitively I would like to hear anybody who couldn't disagree with this statement that resveratrol extends lifespan by activating syrup one and it begs the question can we apply that to ourselves which is during those periods of time when we are not fully dialed in would we benefit from risk fair at all well that's what the reason

[01:39:42] I'm taking resveratrol is I don't all sit as well no unfortunately you caught me out I'd like to take it every morning I found that it's been good to me health is great I'm doing fine it's one of the longest experiments I've ever done will be the longest but it's ongoing and because I'm changing other things all the time to see what works what doesn't

[01:40:02] I've kept that constant so I would love to chat about and got a little bit more time here if you're willing is I still probably get more questions about nicotinamide rye beside then and nad specifically than almost any other molecule that's sort of out there we talked about I'm writing a book now and part of that book there's an appendix in it and in the appendix what I'm doing is writing a short section on sort of the drugs supplements and hormones that I think are most interesting and so I'm including of course something on nad and then are I think I've identified 17 or 19 drug supplements hormones that I want to address in this appendix I would say that I get more questions about NR and nad then all other 18 put together maybe with the exception of metformin so this is a topic that just continues to interest people I would say that my understanding of it is sort of at the six out of ten level which is enough to be dangerous and enough to be frustrated at the fact that it's not 9 out of 10 level and we talked about this again the first time we spoke but let's go back for a moment and explain why do people even care about nad or why should one care about their nad levels well I've talked a lot about certain ones today these the protectors of the genome and the epigenome they lose their activity over time they have two things they require for activity for maximum activity we've mentioned resveratrol which is activating you can eat or take in a supplement that's the accelerator pedal on this enzyme family the fuel that they also need 100% without it they don't work is nad nad is a molecule that's in our bodies we require every second of every day to exist our bodies use it for chemical reactions and without it everything shuts down and we're always making more and we're recycling it all the time we have many grams of it in our body it's probably one of the top two molecules that's important for life and one of the earliest that have ever evolved on the planet the other one is ATP which is chemical energy nad is also used to be the most boring molecule in biology you just had to learn by rote how it was used by the body and recycled and it was just a bunch of chemical reactions and it was forgotten about during the 1960 70s and 80s in the 1990s especially in the 2000s was discovered that it also acts as the body's signaling molecule and we think tells the body when you're exercised when you're hungry and is largely how calorie restriction works so we think that in organisms like worms flies yeast more energy is better when you give them more energy they live longer and now the question is is that true for humans as well and the idea is that by either replacing lost nad or boosting it to levels that you would only get if you run marathons constantly you can turn on these sirtuin defenses and other aspects like DNA repair proteins that need nad so again we could almost be back in the paradigm that we potentially are with metformin and with resveratrol which is it might be that the less healthy you are the more you could benefit from supplementation or restoration correct I believe that because in our animal studies and other studies that people have done the benefits of nad and of resveratrol are seen predominantly in mice and humans that are obese or have a disease and so they replenish what's lost that said if you boost the levels in a mouse of any D we published a few years ago actually no it was it patty here ago that raising them above normal levels in an old animal get you back to having a young cardiovascular system and they can run just as far as e all Mouse but when he gave nad boosters to the young mice they didn't run further but they did if we exercise them and gave them the idea mooster at the same time so it was the fuel but not the trigger I mean huge still needed to actually it wasn't enough to get the expression basically of the behavior you know three-month-old / young mouse but in a 50 year old I would say that at least speaking for myself I already have some deficits I'm not as perfect or as healthy as I used to be and so that may actually help more than it has before all right so let's talk about boosting it so the first question is David can I just go out and buy an ad and a pill and take it I think they will sell any D is a pill let me reframe that is there a biological rationale for taking nad orally very few people have studied taking nad orally what we've studied in humans and in mice extensively maybe not as extensively as many would like is giving precursors to nad because most people take nad intravenously that's sort of the typical way it's administered in this country or elsewhere right right but there's this adage and there's some evidence that nad doesn't directly get into cells it's a large molecule there's some evidence that nerve cells take it up but in general it has to be broken down first before it's taken up into cells and reconstituted inside the cell that may work fine I've heard anecdotes that IV nad is interesting interesting results although you could argue that the placebo effect coupled with the actual physiologic response as one might have to nicotinamide could explain the quote-unquote reactions and the feelings that people have to intravenous nad but is it safe to say that the at this point in time our scientific understanding is that intravenous nad is not sufficiently making it into cells and more importantly mitochondria is that a safe assumption well it gets into mitochondria because there's a at least if you believe that this literature there's an nad transporter that pulls it into mitochondria but not from the plasma right you'd have to make it into the cell first yeah I haven't seen convincing evidence yet no I haven't read every paper on the planet but I'm unaware of what you haven't read every paper in the planet shame on you

[01:45:56] I know you don't come on this show without reading every paper on the planet well I'll sell my kids the IV nad needs a lot more clinical research I agree with you yeah I'm a little skeptical okay so then you said okay well look we've got this idea where we can orally take something like nicotinamide ride beside and i can go buy this on amazon today yeah you can so n are for short we're gonna talk a lot about abbreviations so NR becomes nad how right so NR is nicotine my driver-side it looks actually chemically similar to how DNA is made interestingly it's what the rover side means nicotinamide is vitamin b3 so it's partly a vitamin b3 partly a piece of

[01:46:35] DNA so that is a molecule that cells suck up through a transporter it's well understood they stick on a phosphate it becomes n MN nicotinamide mononucleotide and then the cells turn that into nad so it's two steps NR in two cells to n MN to nad and then once it's in to nad it's then recycled it's turned into nicotinamide when i sirtuin reacts with it makhotin amide is abbreviated n am yeah typically and that's a version of nice and o vitamin b3 but many people ask me can I just take a high dose of vitamin b3 and that there's some interesting things you can raise nad by just taking vitamin b3 but you're missing out on the other components that the cell now has to make which is the ribose or DNA part and the phosphate so it's not surprising that other labs are showing that your goal is to raise any D in the body at least in a mouse that's been studied that niacin isn't as effective as taking in our or in a man and there's actually reasons to avoid taking high doses nicotinamide unless you're a cancer patient where it may help but nicotinamide we showed back in 2002 is a really effective inhibitor of the sirtuins which are enzymes that you want to keep on it's the whole point of raising an ad and so we try to avoid nicotinamide while raising an ad and actually I hadn't thought of this but it would be very useful if the field had a definition which is the ratio of an ad to nicotine line because that would give us an indication of the boosting the gas to the engine versus the break yeah so right after you and I spoke last year there was a paper that came out from Princeton Josh

[01:48:18] Rabinowitz his lab that looked Aurel nicotinamide ride beside it was a tracer study that looked at mice where they gave them oral and are and basically the question was what is the fate of this where is it going and what that paper showed was the liver took because this was oral of course so that stuff gets the NR gets absorbed out of the gut presumably and very quickly everything in the gut makes its way to the liver first hence it's called this first pass effect and it was in the liver that most of that nr got turned into nad but the study didn't find that much NR made it out of the liver in fact what the study if I recall and I know it's been so long since I look at it but

[01:49:01] I think that they saw na M nicotinamide was up in the blood but not nicotinamide rai beside which you presumably will still wanted some of that leaving the liver to go to get into other cells because I'm assuming that you don't just need more nad in the liver correct wouldn't you want it also in the muscles or other cells well yeah you would but there was a new study that came out that showed that if you give n R to people in a clinical trial they could get an ad levels raised in muscle as well which study but this one was the just was posted on by walk yeah yeah this is the one that hasn't been peer reviewed yet correct it also showed their very high nicotinamide levels in the blood yeah yeah right and so I think where the field is now is it's trying to get the nad levels high without okay yeah that's the study that was using a very high dose of NR correct this is a thousand milligrams right yep okay so that's taking on somewhat four times the posted dose that's given when you buy the supplements online yeah it was a good study placebo-controlled they had average BMI was slightly higher I think it was in the high 20s average age was I think up in the mid 50s it was a higher age group where you'd expect some effects so they proved at least what we had seen in mice that you can get nad to rise beyond the liver how do you reconcile that if that study demonstrated that there was an increase in nad in the muscle how did it get there it couldn't have got there from the liver the liver can't to my knowledge can't export nad to the plasma to the muscle does that imply that the dose potentially in the

[01:50:33] Rabinowitz study was not high enough for enough excess nr to leave the liver to make its way to the cells does it suggest as at least one author has suggested potentially there was a methodologic error in the Rabinowitz study where through freezing the samples some of the NR was not detectable on thawing something that by the way I've asked people on both sides of this and

[01:50:58] I'm getting conflicting inputs on this by the way it's very difficult to sort of understand this again I don't think people are bad actors here I think it's complicated stuff and the assays don't lend themselves to necessarily working out every time but what is your best explanation for how the thousand milligrams of oral NR and humans made its way into increasing muscle nad well it's getting past the liver the NR is getting past the liver right well that's the simplest explanation you've got to start hand waving and saying oh well Lua then sends out an enzyme or a signal I think that possible they didn't look in the mitochondria we don't have the entity made it into the mitochondria correct they didn't they didn't but there are a couple of recent studies that show that it's very important for the NAD to go up in mitochondria particularly yes and I don't think that's been demonstrated hasn't at least not in a healthy we're gonna come back to the other study in a moment if I recall that study you're talking about showed a few improvements in certain inflammatory markers is that correct right there wasn't much change with DNR it was on some inflammation went down in the muscle and if anything mitochondrial markers of activity were lower we're lower that was something that didn't make a lot of sense although you could argue if the mitochondria became more efficient perhaps you needed less activity but you start to wonder if that becomes hand-waving as well what's your interpretation of that particular finding I don't have a good explanation other than that's what happens and that's what we'll see with other studies

[01:52:25] I think we just need to check if other precursors do that because we don't know if it's a in our specific effect or if the whole class of molecules will do that as well that'll be interesting to see but what I can say is that it's a surprise because the ohana viryx who's over in Switzerland of myself and my cable line even who's shown in mitochondrial disease that any man in some cases NR as well does boost mitochondrial activity now these are mice and it may be unfortunate that humans are just not myosin that's where it ends I don't expect that hope is not true but the data online will do the clinical trials all will be blinded we got many trials to go but there are differences between NM n and n are so curious to see if an amine has the same effect in humans as well those studies are ongoing we don't have any good data just yet and do you think that n MN would be best administered through a regular oral route or would you want to do it through an SL route somehow bypass the liver do you think that there are opportunities there with either NR or n MN to get even higher plasma concentrations but without this compensatory rise in nicotinamide that potentially is harmful well the SL route I lost about a lot sublingual put under your tongue try and get it taken up by that and let me explain why this is the case because it might not be obvious if you're listening because you might be saying why would putting it under your tongue be okay but swallowing it not and the reason is when a person swallows the medication it goes through from the stomach into the jejunum and the ileum usually in the jejunum which is the first part of the gut after the stomach it gets absorbed and that blood supply goes straight to the liver through this thing called the portal circulation and so most drugs actually have to be designed with that in mind either immune to the livers metabolism or design such that they're

[01:54:16] Pro drugs and the liver actually turns them into the right drug when you're talking about putting something under your tongue just like someone who for example carries around nitroglycerin if they run the risk of getting chest pain that drug gets directly absorbed into the circulation and doesn't go through the liver so they just explain that for the listener to make sure they understand why that would be a potential advantage yeah and also there's the complicating factor that a microbiome will love to chew up that NR probably and there's an increasing studies showing that microbiome does eat up some of the molecules that were ingesting so that nice and part of the molecule nicotinamide it comes off pretty quickly even if a molecule in your fridge gets wet you all start to lose that knee in my bond and it'll break off and in the gut some evidence that people have published and some haven't points to the gut playing a major role in how much this actually gets into the body and how typically that public and are not doing this for a living they don't see the brutal struggle for academic survival going on but now in the days of podcasts like yours Peter the public can actually see this play out now that's good because the public can see what is the cutting edge of science and make their own decisions and hear experts opinion but it's bad because it makes it look like science is one giant food fight but that's normal any new field will have these disagreements about is your essay working is there a transporter taking it up is the microbiome destroying it do we need pro drugs for the liver or can we just put in a mint under the tongue and we don't have any good answers really good answers I'm afraid to say that right now but I can tell you what I see emerging I'm happy to give my opinion these are not facts these are opinions and I think we're all entitled to our own opinions certainly not facts my opinion is that the microbiome removes a lot of the nicotinamide from nmn and event are before it's taken up by the gun there are some studies that I've seen and I'm yet available that trace the movement of these molecules through an animal we don't do those in humans typically because they're very expensive you need to have isotopically labeled molecules labeling different parts of the molecule but then you can say okay where did the nicotinamide go with it the sugar go and so I've seen some of that data now it's not all in agreement but if I was to summarize it I think there's a little truth in everybody's results

[01:56:39] I think there's truth that it makes sense not to put it all through the gut it makes sense that if you put a lot in the gut that's also going to work some of it will get through there's some truth in that in a man gets broken down in the gut and then taken up by the gut and remade in the body into an ad because you're basically just pulling a powder you know a three piece Lego set putting it through the screener and then reassembling it on the other side that seems to happen too but also I've seen data that looks convincing that some in a man and some gets straight into the body goes to the liver some goes beyond the liver into the muscle and so it's messy and it's probably never gonna be one single answer to what's going on in the body with something this complicated but here's the way I view it is that certainly for the members of the public

[01:57:29] I don't think they care if there's a transporter or not they don't care what we want to disagree about mass spectrometry assay for in a man we'll figure that out that'll come out in the wash what's important is does it work in a human that's really all that matters we know what these molecules do amazing things in minds to health and in some cases to longevity look potentially the most important study of this is not yet out yet which is this IT p4n are in mice correct that should be the most robust analysis of NRO should it not in mice it is so they used mixed strains they use a variety of labs across the country and so that's it's considered a standard but it's not definitive because there are plenty of ways to dose plenty of ways to deliver it plenty of molecules in our kit but if it doesn't work it's another data point and so with ITP we'll say maybe it doesn't work Yohann over experience with Solon says if you give in are too old mice it does work

[01:58:26] I took saying that I spent a little bit we don't know about any man we're running that experiment in my lab that's no secret so we'll see if that works or not we'll see I think ITP is a good start what I find somewhat frustrating is that they've never asked me for advice on how to dose or what to give for anything so yeah I was surprised as well that you weren't involved in that now what you're basically saying is look in the end does this stuff clinically work is all that matters because there's really smart people out there saying show me the evidence that increasing intramuscular nad matters what if it's indifferent what if this is true true and unrelated very recently a paper came out looking at mega dose of oral nicotinamide right beside with pterostilbene in patients with ALS and he was a miniscule study that had as many dropouts as it had completers if not more but the gist of it was that on some what appear to be subjective measurements of quality of life there was an improvement in patients with ALS taking this very high dose of nicotine oh my driver's side with pterostilbene versus those taking a placebo and what they measured some cardiac function as well I think they measured one pulmonary function called forced vital capacity yeah so which is how much air could you blow which would be a pretty important pulmonary function which is one of the more important things that gets degraded in somebody with ALS so the point is for a very small study that obviously didn't have any hard endpoints it looked like a success but I can't help but think of what you talked about earlier what if this is another example of something where to see the effect you have to be testing it in the most distressed organism you don't like to talk about people in that terms but a person with

[02:00:09] ALS is under far greater distress than you are and it's certainly possible that in somebody who is that close to the physiologic limits of survival can actually see a small benefit which i think is what that study assuming that study is replicated which of course is to your point that's the nature of science I mean each experiment is nothing more than I'm a way to alter a probability of something likely to be true but this would now make that case but that was my reading of that study which was interesting but I want to see that in someone healthy I want to see that in someone for the same reason I want to know what metformin is doing in somebody who doesn't have diabetes so someone really smart who it was on this topic once speaking very specifically about this there is so much smoke out there that you have to believe there's a fire but I just don't know where it is I think that's sort of how I feel well with the resveratrol experience that I've had in my career and with nad it wouldn't surprise me if what you said is true which is if you're in peak condition and you're young you're not gonna see a big effect if you've got ALS or some other disease that gives you low nad levels it's which ones are not working the way they should then you'll see the benefits that seems to be a theme that's emerging if that's true that's still good because we're not always gonna be super healthy or able to run every day there will be a come a time and for the ALS patients I'm sure they're rejoicing that this that study was the first real believable hint I'm choosing my words very carefully but that one looked like there may be some fire there in the ALS patients now it was a p-value point one and there was some subjectivity but if you look at the placebo versus the control that placebos got worse and the drug experimental most of them went up in improvement in terms of life measurements you didn't have to squint to see that result which was a nice thing now we'll see I mean again you got to remember that they don't have pure NR in this drug it's mixture of it's NR with pterostilbene and tourists Elaine is a very similar moly culture as virtual yeah I was gonna ask you the study was I believe they were using 1200 milligrams combined so it was a thousand of NR and 200 of Tara still having six of those capsules that they sell that's right now the question is is pterostilbene milligram per milligram as potent as resveratrol in other words for those patients only taking one fifth of their dose of a sirtuin activator that you're taking yeah they would have been so in other words 200 milligrams of pterostilbene is about the same as 200 milligrams of resveratrol no one knows that but whereas virtual is just again these methyls resveratrol has three little arms sticking out of two rings and two of those and methyls interest Helene so it's very similar molecule to res virtual whether or not its area I don't believe it is in some this marketing that says that it's better I haven't seen any data on that if this study we're done without the pterostilbene it might be more interesting because we could then it's almost like you'd almost have a third arm that had either NR only or PT only PT for the listener being pterostilbene yeah well that's the best way to do an experiment but it's probably an extra few million dollars to do that yeah interesting so what is the current field looking like on this or - in activators are there others coming down the pipeline is your lab working on next gens for - in activators what we're pushing hard on our pro drugs of nad boosters hopefully get around all the liabilities that we've discussed about these nad boosters such as better absorption not digested by the guy bacteria is released in the gut doesn't fall apart in your fridge these are all good things and hopefully is more potent than the natural molecule and those I've been working with a team of chemists for the last five six years with hundreds of different molecules that been put at least through animals and hopefully one day will be put into humans our most advanced molecule in that class is in human studies right now at the Brigham

[02:04:15] Women's Hospital in what type of patient well these are healthy volunteers so this is like phase one it's a phase one you so phase two would be if all goes well next year and what type of patient do you think would be most applicable I can't divulge what the company's thinking because they're paying for it but I can say that they're looking at diseases that are not common and so very similar to what you're sort of like this example of the so people who are closer to the metabolic cliff edge well there are number of reasons for doing that one is that there are good animal models for some of these diseases where these molecules and relatives of them have worked but also there's that business reason which is that trying to make a drug for obesity or longevity is currently uh no one would give you any money to do that be very difficult and so what's hot what people want to see is a fast track for a disease that is has an unmet need where patients are demanding something from the FDA and that there were actually bonuses incentives that the government has put in place to encourage people to make drugs for those diseases as well well

[02:05:18] David the last thing I want to talk about is how in the hell did you make those beautiful beautiful drawings in your book oh well I was surprised to learn that you had actually done those you're actual artists you're an artist who masquerades as a scientist well my enemies would say I'm a yes artist but I do drawing as a hobby and it was actually a real pleasure that I was forced to do drawing hadn't done it since the 1980s but I used to do a lot of drawing I was gonna be an artist or at least a an architect a paid artist I very Nelly became a computer graphic design guide before or such thing as

[02:05:54] Pixar I loved biology too I ended up falling in love with lab work and thought aging was the biggest thing that needed to be sold rather than pictures but the way I ended up having to draw all these pictures which are you haven't seen the book you can go on the website lifespan book common I've got a lot of the drawings up there even now they're posted or by the time people hear this the book will be out called fantastic so unfortunately they're reduced to the size of a postage stamp I drew them the size of a foot by half a foot on a sketch pad that's what makes them look so impressive though that's what they look like they're drawn by a computer they're so good because I'm trying to imagine you actually drawing them that small not that it's any less impressive that you drew them at larger scale but the detail is unbelievable they actually look like photographs that were then rendered into sketches that's that's how impressive that's why I originally did it and the lawyers at

[02:06:43] Simon shoes to us said you can't even use that you'd have to go and get permission from everybody who took the photo that I was rendering so I had to go back and basically make original art that I own I had 28 days to brought 28 human faces and so it was fun I really enjoyed it I'll get home sometimes at 10 o'clock at night and have someone's face - drawing what was actually helpful was that I couldn't obsess over it because I have that kind of personality of perfection and it was forced I finally got an hour or two to draw this now just sketch it out it's actually wasn't that hard because these days you can hit ctrl delete and or I'll delete and get rid of what you've just done if you don't like it in the old days with India ink you make a sketching a mistake you forget it's over start again wasn't that hard but really enjoy using that other part of my brain that I usually don't use well David thank you very much for stopping by today congratulations on your book I know how much work goes into that and I think people are really going to enjoy it I think it's so funny like it's actually a pretty different look at a pretty common topic I haven't done the

[02:07:46] Google search on how many longevity books are in Amazon but you probably need scientific notation to count it and most of them probably aren't worth reading to be honest with you but yours absolutely is I think people will really enjoy it well it's a fresh look I think from today it's been clear that there's a lot of new stuff in there it's a different way of looking at aging this whole information theory idea it's new nobody talks like I do about aging very few of us I should say and what's exciting about it actually is I was writing stuff down as it was happening in the lab so readers won't just learn about what I do every day and what my family does and what I think the future looks like but also what it's like to be part of these discoveries and how it feels and for the students and the impact on potential impact on the world so yeah I'm very appreciative that you've had me on allowed me to talk a bit about what's in the book looking forward to reading yours when it comes out - Wow I'll be a couple of years from now that'll be great and we'll turn the tables anyway thanks so much David really appreciative thanks Peter you can find all of this information and more at Peter Tiye MD com forward slash podcast there you'll find the show notes readings and links related to this episode you can also find my blog at
