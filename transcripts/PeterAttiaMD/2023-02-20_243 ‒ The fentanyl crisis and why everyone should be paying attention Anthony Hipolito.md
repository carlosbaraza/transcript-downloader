## Transcript

[00:00:02] Hey everyone, welcome to the Drive Podcast. I'm your host, Peter Atia.

[00:00:10] Anthony, thank you so much for coming over. Not just coming over, coming over on a Sunday. Um, the reason I I'm we're doing this on a Sunday. I don't normally record podcasts on the weekend, but um my wife and I saw you speak. Um, actually saw a video of you speaking. we couldn't make it to the actual event and we were both so moved by it and thought, you know, if there's anything that I can do to use sort of my platform to get this message out more broadly basically to everybody because I it's hard to say that there's someone who doesn't need to hear what we're about to talk about today. Um, and basically if if I had tried to slot this into our normal podcast schedule, we wouldn't be having this discussion till about June. And I was just like, you know what? Honestly, like if if if it makes the life of one person different by doing it now, we're gonna we're going to record this at the beginning of February and turn this around as quickly as possible. So, this will probably give listeners a sense of why this is an important episode, but um let's let's just start. Who Who are you,

[00:01:07] Anthony? What do you do? Um and and and why is it we're sitting here today? Yeah. Well, I appreciate the invite. Um, I'll never say no to talking about Vietnam and talking about the dangers it presents to everybody. It's it knows no boundaries, right? It's it's black, white, brown, it's rich, poor. It affects anybody and everybody, not only in Hayes County, not only Travis County,

[00:01:31] Texas, but the entire world. So, that's how prevalent this stuff is and scary. Um, but I again, I appreciate the invite and um I don't care if it's Sunday. So, I really appreciate you fitting us in and getting this getting us this going. Um, I've been in law enforcement for 24 years. I worked at the Austin Police

[00:01:49] Department for 23 years. I retired July of 2021. Um, I grew I grew up and basically lived my entire life out in Hayes County and I wanted to get out there and serve in the community that I grew up in. Right. So, um, I took the summer off and during the 2021 year and started in September. Um, I've been friends with the sheriff out there for a long, long time and he consistently recruited me to to get out there. So, um, I got hired by the Hes County

[00:02:18] Sheriff's Office September and I've been there just, you know, 18 months or so now. Um, I'm currently assigned to the community outreach unit. Um, during my time at the at APD, I did APD's a large department, right? So, you're able to do a variety of assignments. Um, obviously you have to start out on patrol, but I I worked patrol ser several stints. I promoted twice. Um, so each time you promote, you got to go back to the patrol um division and, you know, answer 911 calls and all that good stuff. But I worked in organized crime. I worked in um public affairs. I did internal affairs. I did some undercover work. I worked mount patrol, bike patrol on

[00:02:53] Sixth Street. So in a larger department, you're able to specialize a lot. So I was able to to experience a lot and learn a lot about the department, the inside, what makes it tick, and all that good stuff. But um it was just time for me to to move on. and I I reached a point where I was able to retire. So, um

[00:03:09] I jumped out to Haste County and I'm again I'm on side of the community outreach unit and all we do is get out in the community and and and visit and show the citizens of Haste County that we're human, right? We're we're police officers. Um yes, or sheriff's deputies, yes. But we're humans, right? And um our job is to get out in the community and and reach people and talk to them. And we do that through a variety of ways. We have a citizens police academy. We do junior deputymies during the summer. We visit HOAs. Um, but obviously now over the last since about August, it's all fit and all all the time just because of what's going on. So, you retired in the summer of 21 and what up until the point of your retirement, how big an issue was fentanyl making its way into other drugs? Yeah. So, at that time, uh, fitnol was was around. Uh, when I at the time I retired, I was an organized crime. I was a sergeant over the criminal interdiction unit. And that's what we did on a daily basis was battle the Mexican cartel. Um, obviously I35 runs up and down through the middle of

[00:04:15] Hast County, through the middle of Austin. Um, so I had about 10 10 officers that were assigned to me and we had officers that did interdiction work up and down I35. We had officers that worked at ABIA. Um, we also had officers that worked with FedEx, with UPS, with the postal service to try to interdict not only drugs, but money, guns, and any any any type of criminal element. So, um, at that time, uh, I think I did about three, three and a half years in that assignment. Uh, and we started seeing fentanyl probably 2017, 2018, but it was more on the black market. people would order that in the dark web and it would be sent from China. Um it would be sent FedEx or UPS and the majority of our seizures at that time were through

[00:05:02] FedEx and USPS. We would work with the postal inspectors and security folks with um UPS and FedEx and we we would intercept boxes and boxes of illegal uh illegal illicit counterfeit pills. Um so that's where we started seeing it. What's going on now is the Mexican cartel um being that they're very competitive and they want to own the drug market, they have gotten into the fentanyl game and that's why we're seeing it become more and more prevalent over the over the last number of years.

[00:05:28] Now, I kind of been sort of asleep at the wheel here and haven't paid a lot of attention to this until maybe the past six months. Um but back when I worked in a hospital, we used fentanyl all the time was a very potent intravenous narcotic. So um you had morphine which you would typically give in milligram doses right? So if a patient was having a lot of pain you would use an intravenous infusion of morphine 1 2 3 four five milligrams right so uh you know thousandth of a gram of morphine.

[00:06:04] Fentanyl was much more potent, came on quicker, um, and it was dosed in micrograms, right? So now you're you're you're talking about like it's it's a lot smaller a dose. And, um, you know, it was a very good drug for pain and sedation. So, you know, if a patient was having even something like a colonoscopy, for example, you would use maybe 100 micrograms of fentanyl. So, that's 0.1 milligram. and say a couple milligrams of another drug called versed that kind of you know makes you drowsy and makes you forget what's going on. Anesthesiologists use this all the time in the operating room.

[00:06:45] So it's one part of anesthesia is the is the pain part is the fentanyl. But again I never knew it existed outside of a liquid form and I had no idea that it was being uh put into other drugs. So when did that transition take place? What what is it about this drug? And I guess we could maybe why don't you explain to people how these drugs work and why we're even having this discussion. What's the problem with them? Is it just that they make people high and it's bad to be high? No. So you explained it perfectly the the how powerful this fit is, right? When you're talking micrograms. Um and that's the difference between the fentanyl that you would get you the doctors would prescribe, right? and what the Mexican cartel is making in their labs in

[00:07:33] Mexico, right? The difference is it what they're making is synthetic opioid, right? So the same molecular whatever that is, molecular structure, whatever structures is all the is all the same. It's just the the they don't need the poppy plant to make it, right? So that's that's the difference. The big difference is the dosage. um they don't know how to control the dosage and they

[00:07:56] I don't think they really grasp how powerful fentanyl is and what we're talking two milligrams can kill you, right? So, oh my god, two milligrams would I mean that's that's a beyond lethal dose, right? Beyond lethal dose. And that's we're we're seeing more and more of that as we're learning as we're getting more toxicology back from these victims. And tell tell folks just so they understand like why does this drug kill you? Is it giving people heart attacks or what is the actual thing that's killing people? Yeah. So how it works is when you when you take the fentanyl and it has a lethal dose in it, it basically attacks your resp respiratory system, right? It slows everything down that you get that euphoric high but you don't realize that it's shutting your body down and once your your respiratory system starts shutting down, your heart rate starts going down and you're can be dead in an instant. And that's how powerful and scary this stuff is. Yeah. Yeah. And and

[00:08:44] I'll tell you, even in the hospital, we saw that that was not uncommon in a in a hospitalized patient that you accidentally gave too much. Um you know, you you misjudged a person's sensitivity and you gave them 100 milligrams when 100 micrograms, I'm sorry, when they probably should have only had 50 or 75 because you didn't understand some other factor about them. and all of a sudden they would slow down their breathing rate to the point where you would either have to put a breathing tube in them to breathe for them or you would have to give them something like Narcan to reverse the effect.

[00:09:20] And again, there were actually examples in the hospital I trained in where patients had narcotic overdoses completely by accident but due to the potency of these drugs, especially to fentanyl. much less common with morphine, more common with fentanyl. Um, and so you think, gosh, if that can happen in a hospital, how much more likely is it if you get this dosing schedule wrong outside the hospital and as we're about to discuss, they're not off by 10 or 20%. I mean, they're off by an order of magnitude in this. So, okay.

[00:09:56] So, let's go back in time, right? So, and again, think about this over the the course of your career. um what was the bread and butter of the DEA and law enforcement when it came to elicit drugs? Like when I think about this, I'm thinking it's cocaine, it's marijuana, methamphetamines, like heroin, right? Those those would be your big four. Mhm. Um when did it turn into other drugs like Percoet and uh legal drugs but being used illicitly and sold illegally? When did that transition take place? I think um when you look back at it I think it's 2010 2011ish 2011 when you started seeing um the pain management doctors recklessly prescribing the oxycodone the vicodins the percoetses um and there was no regard for um anybody it's you know that's how powerful all these these these pills are is they they people get addicted to it right so that's why a lot of people when they have surgery they don't like taking these pain pills because they're so addictive they're afraid they're going to get hooked on them. And um once we started seeing that 2010, 2011, people would doctor hop. If they one doctor wouldn't prescribe, they would go find another doctor and once they found that doctor um they would continue to go back to them and they would just stockpile the stuff, right?

[00:11:20] So um we started seeing that probably 2010, 2011 that the opioid addiction was pretty prevalent. Um and I think this is where this is the fallout of it, right? So, um, the fitnol game is, um, has just elevated the the opioid crisis to a whole just an entire new level. And why is it that we think that fentanyl is being even put into these things? I mean, I I guess one of the things I understood from your talk was that um, once the uh, military and police authorities kind of crack down on

[00:11:54] Mexican cartels, the poppy fields are getting harder and harder to grow. But you can now make this stuff synthetically. Presumably that's cheaper. Less labor, easier to do. Correct. Did that immediately shift production to China? Um so when the Mexican cartels they when they found out about what China was doing over there um they started buying the precursor chemicals from China to start making this it's again synthetic.

[00:12:19] So it's an illicit pure fentanyl, right? Um so that's what that's um they want. They want control of the drug game. They want that. And it's much cheaper for them to make the fentanyl than it is the cocaine, the heroin, the methamphetamines simply because they don't have to worry about the poppy plants. They don't have to worry about the weather. They don't have to worry about the labor. They don't have to worry about a variety of things when they're trying to grow the poppy plants.

[00:12:41] Um, so when they found out they can make it synthetically and make it just with chemicals, um, that's when they started buying from India and China. What we're learning now and what I've heard is they're starting to make the precursor chemicals themselves in Mexico as well. Um, which is obviously making it cheaper is they don't have to buy it from overseas. Um, so they can make it much cheaper and much faster. Um, and once they get that fit by the kilo, they just ship it across to their, you know, the counter ports here in the US. Yeah, it's the same. Maybe before we go any further because there's so much more I want to probe on this, um, let's kind of bring it back to a story. Mhm. Um, so we'll show a video now that you you shared that night when you gave the presentation here at the school district um about uh the parents of a of a of a boy who who lost his life. So let let's let folks watch that now. Yeah. This is

[00:13:35] Kevin McConville. He was 17 years old

[00:13:44] [Music] and he was my baby boy, my pride and joy. Born May 9th, 2005. Uh amazing kid. Uh full of life and uh love the outdoors, very creative. um was planning a a career in the military and possibly becoming a welder. He would have been a senior this year. He has a little sister that he loves very much.

[00:14:16] The night of August 2nd, um he asked if there was any more pizza and I told him no, unfortunately, and I could make him his tuna and he said no. said, "I'm just going to go upstairs and go to sleep." I said, "I love you." He said, "I love you, too." [Music] The following day, I found him in his bed asleep.

[00:14:45] What appeared to be asleep, but he was gone, and I couldn't bring him back. Later we we found out that uh after their investigation they they said that there was a pill found next to Kevin in an Altoids tin uh can with a pill in a bag. It was a a light blue color pill with the M30 logo stamped into it and they said they're believed to be fentanyl. Uh these are the counterfeit pills that are going around.

[00:15:20] I contacted um one of his friends shortly after he had passed away to let him know that Kevin was gone. He was very heartbroken. Um and he had told us that Kevin confided in him that he was taking Percoet and Xanax to help him sleep. I think one of his I don't want to call him a friend. I can't call him a friend. Um was doing it as well. And that friend originally gave him the pills cuz he probably confided in that person.

[00:16:05] And Kevin probably took them before and nothing happened. And so he continued to take them. I can't tell you how many times cuz I don't know. But it doesn't matter how many times you could take it. It could be your first time. It could be your last time. And no parent wants to see their child in that position in that

[00:16:42] He looked like he was asleep. [Music]

[00:16:58] Um, that's a that's a that's a hard video to watch. Very hard. That's and it's powerful, right? So, um, and that's one of the reasons I put it at the beginning of our presentation because I want that to be the attention grabber. I want kids specifically to sit back in their seats and really bring it home, personalize a little bit because that's somebody their age that has fallen victim because not everybody knows somebody that has died from the fentanyl because it's although it's very very prevalent, these deaths really in in the kids hasn't been as prevalent as what we're seeing these days.

[00:17:33] I think the other thing that you made a a really important point of in your talk is we we really want to talk about these is what they are, right? These are accidental deaths, right? These are not people that are intentionally taking a dose that is so high to end their life. Um, this is someone who thinks in the case of Kevin that they're they're taking something to help them sleep and then they don't wake up, right?

[00:18:03] Um, let's go back to this idea of do do we know by the way what dose was in Kevin's? I don't I I don't think toxicology has come back on on on Kevin's case quite yet. Um but as you mentioned, he was taking Xanax um or what he believed to be Xanax um because he needed help sleeping. So whatever he was battling personally um led him to to seek these pills to help them help him sleep. Um we all battle our own demons. We all have our own stories, right? So um we don't know what

[00:18:41] Kevin was dealing with, right? Personally, um did he have issues at home? Did he have um was he getting bullied at school? Was he girlfriend just break up with him? Um is he getting bullied on social media? Just the kids these days battle so much more than what we had to deal with simply because of social media. Right? So that's what I tried to relay to these kids is I I want to get rid of the stigma. Like let's figure out why you're making that decision, right? Why did you why why why were you needing Xanax to sleep in the first place and why are you you seeking this thing out? And it doesn't mean you're druggy. Yeah. Right. And I I I preach that over and over cuz I'm not trying to do a say no to drugs talk. I'm

[00:19:19] I'm trying to personalize it. I'm just trying to bring as much awareness to this crisis and it is a crisis um and what we're dealing with. Um I I want to be able to um personalize it and not we have to get rid of the stigma. We want kids to be able to come forward and ask for help. And whatever Kevin was dealing with um he led him to take these pills. His parents had no idea what was going on. Um, until his mom or his dad walked into his room the next morning and he was lifeless. Um, and they've been very brave. Um, they've joined us in several presentations. Um, it's very hard for her. Um, but I think it's also good for her and other parents to talk about it.

[00:20:03] They're very therapeutic and they're very passionate about saving somebody's life. So, um, they'll they'll never know why, right? And that's the hard part for for for them. Um, and I I still talk to them on a regular basis. Um, and they're actually having the celebration of life here in May for Kevin back home in

[00:20:21] Nevada. That's where they move from. Um, but yeah, so that's what I I really truly want to focus on for not only kids, but adults. Like why? Let's figure out the why. You know, I did the calculation the other day with I was with my wife and my daughter and I just did some numbers in the back of, you know, and does does my calculation come out right to you? By by my calculation, every five minutes someone accidentally overdoses in the United States, meaning dies as a result of an accidental overdose. Does that sound about right to you? Five? Yes, five minutes sounds pretty accurate. I think I heard that this morning on another I just happened to be going to the gym this morning to work out and I popped in my phone and it was a podcast about fitnol like I I didn't pull it up. It was wicked pretty is really being that I was coming here today to talk about fentanyl and that stat was there. So that's yeah I mean I basically just looked at the last 12 months of CDC data on how many people have died and again it's important to understand this is not including people who overdose as a way to end their lives. This is people who think they're taking either just a straight up recreational drug like cocaine or something that's laced uh or too they take too much of it or they're in the case of what we're seeing now more and more of those. Do you have a sense of what percentage of accidental overdose deaths today are attributable to fentinyl directly? Fentinyl is in the drug that they are taking. Uh I think twothirds about 2/3. Oh god. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:21:50] And that's why we don't um I catch myself because I I I say overdose a lot, but you you bring it up again, right? It's a poisoning. They're not intentionally tried to kill themselves. They're they're taking a drug for whatever reason. Um and they're they're not waking up. So, they're being poisoned um by these drug dealers, by the Mexican cartel. And that's um Yeah, it's sad. Yeah, it's insane.

[00:22:14] So maybe I'm silly for trying to apply logic to this, but if I putselves in the hands of uh or put myself in the head of the the drug cartel, the goal is I mean they just want to make as much money as possible. Killing your customers can't be good business. So, do they I mean, I'm asking you a question you can't possibly answer, but just sort of thinking about this like uh why in the world haven't they figured out a way to get the doses right? I mean, because again, they're not off by a little. When they get it wrong, they get it absurdly wrong. As you pointed out, you might as well be giving these people cyanide pills. If if I'm understanding you correctly, there are kids that are taking two, four, even eight milligrams of fentinyl in a single tablet.

[00:23:08] Yeah. Yes. And that's very scary. Just so people understand, like this is a hundred times a lethal dose that you might as well have cyanide. Yeah. one of our one of our 15-year-olds that passed away in August August 21st. Noah Noah Rodriguez um a sophomore at Johnson High School um was poisoned. This is Janelle's This is

[00:23:31] Janelle's son. Yeah. We're going to we're going to link We won't watch that video now because it's a bit long, but it's it's very moving. We'll link to Janelle's talk which we saw. Yeah. At the district there. Yeah. So yeah, he uh he took some percoet, what he believed to be percoet. Um and his mom got a call at midnight August 21st um to someone screaming on the other end of the line saying Noah, we believe Noah's overdosed. We believe he overdosed. I'm doing CPR. Um Janelle was in Butuda. Um the overdose of the poisoning took place down in St. Marcus. So by the time she got there, her mom and dad had already made it to the scene. She got out of the car and her mom just shook her head saying he's he he's gone. Um what she has since learned as you mentioned um

[00:24:22] Noah had 8 milligrams of fentanyl in his in his system. Um they got toxicology back just a week or two ago. Um and it was pure illicit fentanyl that was in his system. That's four times the amount that that it takes to kill somebody. It's insane. It makes no sense. you brought up why are they I get I get that question all the time every like why are they killing their customers and to me it's happening so often they they don't care what they do um obviously they don't want four kids to die in a four in a four-week time frame because that's when they get the attention of the DEA and other law enforcement but if they kill a person here or a person there to me they don't care because they don't care I mean yeah there's no question that they care about the kids I just think even if you were thinking about this through the lens of having a business empire. How about just floating below the radar and not killing anybody? Um, and and as you said, I mean, the numbers are exploding. So, 10 years ago, if you said to me, "What is the greatest threat to a young person's life?" By young person, I mean under 40. Sure. I said, "It's two things. It's only two things that matter. Everything else is a is is noise. Mhm. The only two things that matter is dying in a car accident. Yep.

[00:25:42] And suicide. Yep. You're going to take your own life or you're going to die in a car. Mhm. And again, we can get into all the wise. It's alcohol. It's, you know, a whole bunch of reasons, but as you know, today, accidental overdose dominates those two like they're now the rounding errors. 100%. In one decade.

[00:26:06] Yep. And those numbers have gone up exponentially since about 2010 2011. And I just want to make sure listeners understand you're not using the word exponentially hyperbolically. You are absolutely correct. It is not a line. It's an exponential line. 100%. I think somewhere here I even have these numbers cuz I couldn't I couldn't believe when I saw it. Right. Yeah. We're talking in in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Just looking at fentanyl seizures, you go from 200,000 to 1.5 million to 4.1 million to almost 10 million. Mhm. I mean, yeah, it's and you brought it up in 20 2021, if you're between the ages of 18 and 45, that fit was the number one killer. It wasn't gun violence. It wasn't car crashes. It wasn't suicides.

[00:26:55] It wasn't COVID. It wasn't any of those things. it was fit poisonings. Um, and unfortunately, I think when we get the 2022 numbers back that it's not going to be 18 anymore. It's going to be 13 or 14 to 45. And that's that's strictly because I believe um and the DEA believes that the Mexican cartel are specifically targeting our young folks and that's why that we're seeing. Can you say a bit more about what that looks like? How are they doing that? Um, one of the ways they're doing that is, um, they've started making what they what we've what we call in law enforcement and DEA calls is a rainbow fitnol or candy fentanyl. And it's made to look just like candy. It it looks it's it looks attractive to the young folks. Um, it looks pretty, right? So, it's it won't kill me. It won't happen to me.

[00:27:44] Um, and they're also targeting young folks because they want to get people addicted a lot younger so they have that customer base a lot longer. Tell tell me what the the chain looks like. So you're you're saying like if 13y olds and 10 year olds are potentially now being targeted, you're going to expand your market, right?

[00:28:03] What is the who's the drug dealer in that situation? How is it getting its way from a Mexican cartel to distribute these, you know, much more friendly looking drugs? It's no longer a shady percoet with a stamp on it. By the way, I think we're going to link to some photos of these that you shared because this is the other thing that surprised me is how good the counterfeits are. You can't tell. They're indistinguishable.

[00:28:28] Yes. It's not I would I always assumed when people were getting counterfeit percoet, I was always like, well, they just don't know what real Percoet looks like and that's why they're being fooled, right? But that's not true. Nope. This is color matched, printed, identical, which by the way, Anthony, you'll have to forgive me. This brings me back to my frustration. You figured out how to color match perfectly, stamp, and manufacture this, and yet you're off by a dose of a thousand on the active ingredient. It It just boggles my mind.

[00:29:01] I'll never understand. But so, back to the question, we're now seeing this in middle school. Is that right? Yes. As a matter of fact, our our most recent death in Hayes County was a middle school student. She was 13 years old. Um and it was it's all related back to So how did this drug get into how did she acquire this drug?

[00:29:20] Yeah. So so basically what majority of the time um they'll make the illicit pure fentanyl in Mexico, smuggle it across the border to the to their counterparts here in the United States and then it just gets distributed through through to everybody. So tell me how that happens by the way. I'm so ignorant of this. So, so the fentanyl is coming over in a powder form for the most part. Yes, it comes in and it's blocked in a kilo um just like a a brick of cocaine would have come across or so a kilo of fentanyl. What is the wholesale price for that? Uh I'd have to look that up to be honest. I don't know what that but it's cheap compared to a kilogram of cocaine, a kilogram of heroin, a kilogram of any other drug based on the fact that you get to make it synthetically. Correct. And they Yes.

[00:30:02] So your feed stock comes to Mexico now from China. They synthetically manufacture pure fentanyl. It gets shipped and it's cheap as hell. They get it across the border. Again, walk me through that. Where what's the most poorest part of the border that brings this stuff into the United States? Vehicles. I mean small in small batches.

[00:30:23] It depends various ways, right? So they'll they'll load cars up, they'll load semis up, they'll strap it to people's bodies. Um they'll send it via airplane. They'll drones are are real big now getting across the border. So drones that fly at what altitude? High enough to get over the wall, high enough to not be detected. Just they have grown their business their business models. I mean they're if they would use their if they were innovated in other ways, we wouldn't have traffic problems. We wouldn't have I mean it's insane because they they're so they're so ahead of the game of law enforcement. Um, like some of the stuff's not even getting detected by X-rays. Some of the stuff's not even being detected by narcotic dogs. Um, they're finding various ways to smuggle it in. So, when I when I talk about the the candy fentanyl or the rainbow fentanyl, they're actually smuggling it into the country inside Skittles, inside nerd boxes, inside um, it doesn't have

[00:31:17] Skittles in it, but it's full of Wait a minute. You mean in Mexico they make things that look like Skittles or they're just putting pure fentanyl into a Skittles box and shipping the Skittles box? Yeah, they're making the fentanyl pills look like a candy and putting them into a real candy box. Into a real candy box and then that just comes over in a regular in a regular truck. You would never even know. So unless you've got a sniffing dog or you do if you do a random inspection at the border, you'll never catch it. I I I think I think I heard a stat to where the the folks down at the border probably intercept 5 to 10% of the narcotics that go across the board. It's again, not to get so off on these tangents, but um is that a staffing issue? Is it simply a numbers game where unless you're willing to stop and seize every vehicle crossing, which would of course make transport over the border impossible, you just that's all you're doing. That's all you can get. There's so much of it and it it it is a staffing issue, but it's a variety of things.

[00:32:13] They're so smart and how they get it across the border that we're not able to detect it. Um, so they I heard a stat this morning actually it was between five and 10% that they actually were able to intercept at the border. So that leaves other law enforcement entities throughout the country to try to intercept it. Um, but it's and just from a jurisdiction perspective, the border seizure is the responsibility of border patrol. Yes. Or DEA. Uh, it's a border patrol.

[00:32:40] So the second it's they make it across the border, it's a DEA law enforcement issue. It's it's in every law enforcement issue 100%. Once it gets across the border, um, yes, it's a DEA, it's the FBI, it's the ATF, it's local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, it's anybody and everybody that specializes in tackling this narcotic. And just so I understand the logic, they're going to put these things in

[00:33:04] Skittles because the idea is a kid that tries one of these Skittles, even if they're 13, is going to get high. And getting high feels good. and they're gonna want more of those Skittles. Is the impression that the kid thinks it's a Skittle or pretty quickly realizes this is no Skittles, but whatever it is,

[00:33:21] I love it and I just want more of it. Yeah. No, I I I think they do that specifically just to smuggle it into the country. I see. Okay. So, it's not that they're selling Skittles. No. So, they're going to break it apart when it's a Skittles and turn it back into pills? Yes. Okay. It'll be it's it's a fentanyl pill and that's how they'll sell it. All right. So, let's go back to this this girl in seventh grade. How how did she come into possession of this stuff? Was it through an older sibling or was she the direct uh person who got it from a dealer? Uh I don't know the specifics on her case, but what how it works. Um today in today's world, it's social media and that's how a lot of the stuff is sold. Um it's a lot it's how that's bought. Um is social media. Um it's

[00:34:05] Facebook, it's Snapchat, it's Instagram. They're very blatant about, especially on school campuses, if they bring it to school, all they have to do is put an emoji up on their Snapchat and they all the kids know so and so's has pills today. Or they're downloading these encrypted um apps, Telegram, Signal to where once these messages are are sent and received, they disappear. So, it's hard for us to go back and try to trace where these pills. That's kind of the issue with Snapchat as well, right?

[00:34:33] Correct. Yep. So anytime in Haze County that we have an overdose that's fentanyl related, our narcotic folks actually go and respond to that scene to try to get the phones, talk to the the witnesses, talk to the friends to try to figure out so they're their sole goal is to try to trace back where these pills are coming from and to see if they can find out who specifically sold um these pills to these kids to to put them in federal prison.

[00:34:59] The people who are selling pills to kids, do you have a sense of how many steps they are removed from the guy that receives the brick of fentanyl? Is that two layers, three layers? Like it's multiple. It's not It's not a two or three. It's multiple. Okay. Yeah. There's different plugs in each city. It's It's just a whole enterprise on how it's distributed throughout the country.

[00:35:19] Yeah. It's pretty insane. Let's talk a little bit about what happens to a person when they overdose. Um there's another video you shared from an elementary school actually. It was a surveillance camera. Um why don't why don't we why don't we have folks watch that? Let's let's put that on.

[00:39:26] So again, Anthony, you know, this is these are hard videos to watch, but I don't think we're going to shy away from that. I think it's um I think it is important that people understand how uncomfortable this is. Um there's probably a lot of mixed emotions that are going on around the person who stops breathing. On the one level, there's the obvious fear and panic and oh my god, what is happening? On the other level, do is there some sense that you get from talking to people who have been there that there's a hesitation to call police or paramedics for fear of uh reprimand because hey, we're we're obviously doing something wrong here.

[00:40:06] Yeah. Yeah. No, I I think that in in this particular video, um the passenger that didn't wasn't getting poisoned, I think it was several 20 25 minutes, I believe, before he even called 911. And I think that's specifically attributed to not wanting to get in trouble and not believing um his friend is dead. Right. So, um I think that's the big um I think what what what is the law with regard to that? How clear is the law on prosecution of people who are, you know, let's just say someone calls the police immediately, calls the paramedics, everybody shows up, are they going to be prosecuted for uh for for for drug use?

[00:40:46] Um for well, if they're in possession of it, yeah, let's say they are. So, if if they are in possession of it, yes. Um, we had a young man who overdosed on one of our high school campuses that had um, I want to say three or four elicit counterfeit percoet pills on him at the time. He pretty much died in class. Um, and I think that's still in criminal proceedings. So there, yes, if you're in possession of it, um, obviously we want to save your life and we'll deal with the criminal part later. Um, but when you're in possession of it, yes, you're you're more than likely going to get charged. I know this is beyond both of our paygrades, but I wonder if that's, you know, is that the right solution to the problem in that situation? Um, I don't know if you heard this. I just read it this morning. Um, British

[00:41:33] Columbia being the latest, you know, example of, you know, at least in this case, a province or a state is decriminalizing from from a personal possession standpoint any drug. So, this is going to be their attempt to say, how are we going to address this problem? Now, I it's not entirely clear to me how that fixes the problem. I can see scenarios where it makes things better. For example, it would presumably reduce any friction to someone calling for help the moment someone is down because you now don't have to fear that you're going to be prosecuted.

[00:42:05] But I don't know what are what are your thoughts on that? I mean, do if you go back to the case of that kid, right, who basically died in class, it's a miracle he's alive. is pro again just taking off your law enforcement hat just from a personal sort of philosophical standpoint. Do you think that's the right thing to do? I think it's I think it's probably on a case by case um scenario um from a law enforcement perspective and there's laws that we have to follow. Right. So we if we have to end up putting that young man in jail um it doesn't meaning it doesn't mean he's going to spend the rest of his life in jail. It doesn't mean he's going to be in jail. Um we have to file the appropriate charges, right? Um but our also our main concern um is to make sure he's alive, make sure he gets the help he's needed. So we don't necessarily arrest him that day, right? So like that young man went to the hospital and got treated. Yeah. Um and then we turn those pills in, get him tested. If it comes back with with an elicit narcotic in it, then we would look at filing charges at that time. But filing charges and putting somebody in jail at that immediate moment is not a priority. Our priority is obviously life. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:43:15] I I mean again I I don't I I I don't think I'm close enough to the data because I I know that you know um Oregon has done this. They have you see it now in British Columbia. Portugal did this 20 years ago, right? So Portugal I believe I think it was Portugal basically decriminalized for any personal possession any drug. And interestingly, their accidental overdose rate dropped to lower, I believe, than any country in Europe. Now, that said, it is on the rise again along with this problem. So, in other words, the, you know, fentanyl is raising all boats at the moment, including even Portugal. Um, and truthfully, I just don't know where

[00:43:57] I stand on it because there's a part of me that still thinks that's a band-aid. And I think what you said at the outset is the problem. Even though it sounds like a copout, it's it's not. I think it is the problem which is why do you need fill-in- thelank drug 100%. Why do you need percoet? Why do you need Xanax? Why do you need whatever it is, right? Um and without the answer to that question,

[00:44:20] I think it gets very difficult to think about this 100%. I think um again, it's it doesn't make you a bad person. If I have to arrest you today because you have three pills on you, um I have a job to do. But I still need to treat you with respect and I need you to um try to help you. Like I'm going to put you in jail today, but let's when you get out, let's figure out a way to get you the help you need or find you someone to talk to to figure out again why. Why are you making that decision?

[00:44:51] Um because that's without that why, um that person will never be able to get the help that they need. Specifically, they don't know the why. Do do you see that that side of the equation is getting as much attention? Like I I I would like to believe that with all of the attention this is starting to get and once you're at the point where every 5 minutes one of your citizens of a country this size is um killing themsel accidentally with poison. That should be enough to get attention. Do you feel that most of that attention is being channeled into seizure? you know, stopping the cartels law the law enforcement side of it and and do you feel like enough of it is going into the that side of it that you're talking about, which is the the mental health side? No. Um, no, I don't think so. Um, I think it's because it's becoming more and more prevalent. Um, and more more and more people are starting to ask for help and we're starting to learn that there's not enough rehab places for these people to go to. Um, several kids have come forward at HCISD and asked for help.

[00:45:57] They've talked to their pediatricians. They've talked to the counselors and teachers and some of the issues they're running into is they're being told, "Well, give me six weeks and I'll have you a bed or give me three months and I'll have you a bed." That's not acceptable. Yeah. Right. So, um, it's not just a law enforcement thing. It's not a school district thing. It's a community that needs to collaborate together to try to figure out ways to to help everybody to help the folks that are struggling. Right? We're not going to save everybody. We're just not. Um

[00:46:26] I've been a cop for 24 plus years. Um I've arrested many people that have had drugs or put drug dealers in jail. Um so we're not going to save everybody. The war on drugs, we're never going to win. We're just not. But if we can take 10 pills off the street a day, that's what we're seeing now. It's probably six people that we've saved because six out of every 10 elicit counterfeit pills have enough fentanyl to kill somebody.

[00:46:53] So if we can take 10 pills off the street, we're potentially saving six lives. And if I can go talk to a a group of 300 students and I can keep one kid from making that decision to take a drug or if I can get one of those kids who's struggling with an addiction to say, "Hey, I need help." then I think I can sleep well at night knowing that we're doing something um to help. Right. So, so I want to talk about that because I think that's sort of why we're sitting down here today, right? Which is what you know I think one of the things that moved us about kind of your presentation was just how much you were putting of yourself into this like how much you're going around you know just talking to random parents like us going to school meetings doing all this kind of stuff.

[00:47:36] Um, but it's it's so much of what you talked about blew my mind. I want to get to a few more of those things before I come to the nuts and bolts of it. I have a lot of technical questions about Narcan and all that kind of stuff. But, um, I've been hearing some other really frightening things. So, talk to a friend um, I don't know, couple weeks ago I was talking to a friend of mine who goes to

[00:47:57] Burning Man every year. As you know, Burning Man's a place where a lot of drugs get done. Mhm. And he said, and maybe maybe I heard him wrong or maybe he got his facts wrong, so maybe someone listening to this will will correct this, but he said that at Burning Man, there were at least two deaths attributed to fentanyl in drugs that normally would never have fentanyl in them. One was cocaine and one was ketamine. Ketamine of all things.

[00:48:23] Ketamine is a perfectly legal drug. now probably was being used, you know, off label, so to speak, but clearly this was a person who was using, you know, counterfeit ketamine. What other what is the breadth of drugs that you're seeing this? So, we've already established it's going into every single counterfeit pill out there potentially. So, that's going to be all of your pain meds of which I'm guessing

[00:48:49] Percoet, Oxycodone, and Oxycontton, Dilotted are your big boys. Correct. Then you've got it going into the benzo. That's your, you know, Adavan, your ambient probably. Is it going into sleeping pills and stuff as well? Aderall stimulants. Any pill, anything that's a pill that kids want, they're going to that's going to be it's going to be laced 100%. Okay. That's frightening because I know that I I can hear this from my daughter saying it's not uncommon for kids to say, "I need something to help me study. I need something to help me sleep." 100%. Um, where else is it going? Has this crept its way into anything that has to do with marijuana?

[00:49:25] Yes. Uh we're talking every illicit recreational drug that's out there. Cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines, uh Molly pills, X, marijuana. Um we haven't seen this particular here in central Texas yet, but DEA says you you guys know how prevalent vapes are throughout the throughout the country in all the schools. um it's just a matter of time before we start seeing it in central

[00:49:49] Texas, but they're starting to see vape vape pens that have the THC in it also contain fentanyl. So any elicited drug, any vape pen. And again, just to be clear, there's no reason to do this unless you're trying to get people higher than 100% normal. That's the only reason because it's not there's no cost benefit to putting fentanyl into THC.

[00:50:09] They're they're totally different agents, right? Correct. So, they're basically saying, "We're going to we're betting that you're going to like this THC so much more because somehow it's going to get you the marijuana high, which is totally different, right, from the opioid high and we're going to make a more addictive product." And yet again, they screw it up and put too much in. It's a competitive market, right?

[00:50:31] So, they want people to seek them, them being the drug dealers, out for this particular drug. this drug dealer has the strongest cocaine on the market. Everybody go to him or her. These folks are thinking they're taking cocaine, not realizing that when the pure fentanyl gets here to the country that the drug dealers on this side of the border are starting to put fentanyl in all their drugs. So when they sell it, they want their stuff to be more powerful. They want that street cred because it goes out on social media. So and so has the strong cocaine. Go see him or her. And that's that's the only reason they do it is they want to stand out above the rest. So is there any drug this has not made its way into yet? No.

[00:51:15] So tech So right now we're sitting here in central Texas. It hasn't shown up yet. But do you think that's just a matter of time? Uh the in the vapes that have vapes. Yes. But fentanyl has been seized. Yes. Yes. Yes. I just mean in the in vapes. Correct. And it is it showing up in cocaine? Is it showing up in other drugs? 100%. It's in it's in co

[00:51:33] I to me if you buy cocaine on the streets today the chances of fentanyl in it is probably 90 to 99% if I had to bet and most of the time you probably get away with it because it's not a lethal dose correct but you're playing Russian roulette and every and I bring that up in my presentations u specifically regarding the pills because six out of every 10 elicit counterfeit pills has enough fol you. So, I I I I stress it to the parents and the kids, you're playing

[00:52:03] Russian roulette by by taking a pill that you don't know where it came from. And that's how because we're seeing so so many deaths and poisonings throughout throughout Central Texas and the country that Yes. You're you're playing Russian roulette and there's no other way to put it. It's just be blunt. Yeah.

[00:52:21] So, let's um let's talk to uh I would guess that the majority of people listening to this podcast um are parents. That's that's kind of the demographic I'm or they're going to share it with someone who's a parent, right? I got to be honest with you. I don't think there's a 13-year-old listening to us right now. I don't think there's a 19 cops either. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:52:40] But there a lot of parents listening to us. So, what can we do? So, let's start with you're just talking to me and my wife. Okay. We've got a 14-year-old daughter. eight-year-old and a 5-year-old boy. Yep. So, that's one of the reasons I'm pretty passionate about. I've got kids, right? I got I got a freshman in high school and a senior in high school. Um, and I see I've seen firsthand how it's affected my community.

[00:53:03] Um, but as parents, we have to be nosy, right? We we we have to take off the blinders and we have to say we have to stop saying my kid won't do this. Yep. Um, and how many of the parents, Anthony, that you've met who have lost a child were so shocked that it it was I never even knew this was happening. Versus, I'm sure there are some cases where my son has struggled with drugs his whole life. How many are in that former category where they literally are dealing with two complete shocks, the loss of their child and the fact that they had no idea their child was in need or in use of this. How often is it the that case? You hear a lot. Um I don't have an exact percentage, but you you you hear it a lot. And it it may not be because they they don't know, it's that they don't they they refuse to believe it, right? Um and I get it. Um, and it goes back to the stigma. Like I don't I don't I'm embarrassed if my kids are doing drugs or I'm a I'm embarrassed if my kids are druggy. So I I I stress the stigma. Like we we have to stop with the stigma to stop with the judging and we have to work together as a community to to get this as low as possible. We're not going to get rid of it, but if we can if we can move move the, you know, move it around a little bit, then we're doing what we can. Um, but yeah, I hear I hear too much, right? And as a parent, I I I catch myself sometimes uh like my nah, not my kid, right? Um but I have to remind myself because I see it so often like it could be my kid, right? So um social media, if you my kid, both my kids have phones. They have social media. Um actually my freshman no longer has social media. Um but you have to be nosy. You have How do you do like So so luckily my 14-year-old's not on social media. We're going to try to keep it that way as long as possible. But um you mentioned like emo, you know, this emoji means this, this emoji means that. Is there any chance a parent is going to figure that out? So when I when I talk about social media to the parents when I go talk to the PTAs or I go to HOA meetings, I I stress if you going to give your kid a phone and if you're going to give your kid social media, you better learn as much as you can about every single app that's out there. Um because I guarantee you your kid knows more about that app than you do, right?

[00:55:27] So if you give them Snapchat, you better have it on your phone as well and you better learn as much as you possibly can and figure out the tips and tricks that they probably know on how to hide things. Um they're always going to be more technology savvy technical savvy than we are, but it's our duty as parents if we're going to hold them responsible for for that. We have we have to learn about it. And I stress that so much um because there's so many it's not only the apps, it's the games, the roadblocks, it's the the the encrypted apps, Signal, Telegram. So I just I try to put as much information in my presentation in regards to social media just so it gives parents something to think about and I I showed that and we'll we'll link to a lot of these videos in this as well. So perfect.

[00:56:11] We're gonna have people we're going to leave all these resources in there for folks to go to. Um tell tell us about Narcan. So you know we used to use Narcan in the hospital. Um mostly the use was at the end of surgery if a patient needs to be brought back and you mistimed the opioid dose. You know you would use it but sometimes you would you know a lot of times you'd use it in the situation I described earlier which is um oh you accidentally gave that person you know 120 or 125 micrograms of fentanyl but in reality that was a bit too much for them. Their breathing rate is slowing. We got to back that off. Um, I've already forgotten how long Narcan lasts for, but what what is the approximate like if you if if a kid is down and you give them

[00:56:56] Narcan, are they out of the woods or is there a chance that the drug they have so much drug in them that even though they start breathing again, they're going to crash? Yeah, that's that's one of the things we we we try to talk about um because kids have started going out and buying Narcan and carrying it with them and saying, "Hey, I'm going to pop this pill. can hold talk to my friend. Hold my narc.

[00:57:18] I'm gonna snort this pill. If I fall out, can you please shoot me up? Um, what they're not know what what they really don't understand is this fentanyl is so powerful. It's not one one injection of Narcan or one nasal spray of Narcan is not helping because it's so fast acting. And it there I don't think there's a set time because everybody's different, right? Everybody, you know, is built differently, metabolism's different. Um, so there's not a set there's not a set time. I try to explain that in my presentation as well, but if you can the quicker you get narcan into that person's system, the better chance they have to live, right? So, but what we're seeing in a lot of these overdoses and poisonings throughout Hayes County is one one injection is not working. We had a kid two weeks ago that took 15 doses of Narcan. 15 doses. Yes. In the field. In the field before they were and and just to play ignorance, I'm sorry.

[00:58:10] Paramedics are not yet there or they're get they're there but they don't want to intubate yet. Correct. Paramedics are there. All our deputies throughout Hayes County carry Narcan as well. So usually um if we're first there and we know it's a fentanyl related overdose or poisoning presumably you're just giving Narcan no matter what. Correct. The guy could be drunk and you're just going to give him

[00:58:29] Yeah. Because it's not going to hurt them if if they're not. Right. So we we try to you know play it safe and if we even suspect there might be some kind of poisoning we're going to shoot them up with Narcan. It's very easy. And how do you do do you do intramuscular or intraasal? It's a nasal. Yeah, it's like a just like an afrron. If you have you're battling allergies, the same thing. And but this stuff is so powerful. And depending on how long it's been, their respiratory system could have slowed down to where the Narcan's not going to get through. So that's where the CPR comes into play. Um not only with the the Narcan injection, but the CPR just to get the blood flowing again. And um that way the Narcan can get in there and attach to these opioids. So, should parents I mean, lesson number one we're taking away is be be really hypervigilant about social media and understand I mean I I've read horror stories of you know yeah drug dealers on Snapchat are basically offering drop down menus right it's like% do you need something to make you feel happy do you need something to help you sleep do you need something to help you study I mean it's very benal language yep shy about it and then but every one of them is fentanyl it's some derivative of a fentanel into some other pill. It's different. It's going to be stamped as a different pill and then these kids die. And you know the few times that kids have taken screenshots of their Snapchat is the only way that these stories are coming to light where you're making the clear link to hey this this this innocent little high school kid is sitting there studying and you know wanted something to help him study wanted you know wanted aderall or wanted this thing and and that's life is over.

[01:00:03] Um so that's lesson one. How long does Narcan last? Does it have an an expiration date on it? I don't I don't I don't think so. So, you don't worry about So, so is it something parents should have in their house? Is it something kids should be carrying around with them in case they if the kids at a party, would you if your kids are going to a party, would you would you tell them to carry Narcan in case something goes wrong with with some other kid there? I have mixed feelings about that. Um, but I tell the parents, if you if you have kids, middle school or above, have Narcan at home, somewhere where you can find it under stress. We all react differently under stress. So, it's very important to to have Narcan on hand. Don't have it in the box in the garage in the top corner where you need the ladder to go up and get it, right?

[01:00:44] Have it somewhere where you know 100% where it's going to be and you're able to use it right away because it may not be your kid that's that's battling whatever they're battling, but little Johnny could could be spending a night with you that weekend and hanging out with your son or daughter um for the weekend, but you don't know that he or she's battling anxiety. You don't know that their parents are going through a divorce. You don't know if that person's getting bullied or they simply need medication to help them sleep and they've gotten pills off the street because they're going to go spend the night at somebody's house and they're battling anxiety. So, it may it may not be your kid, but if somebody's spending a night at your house and they go into uh they start getting poison, they start, you know, showing signs of an overdose, if you don't have Narcan on hand, you know, you're going to feel really bad. Can Narcan be purchased without a prescription? Yes, you can go to any you can go to websites. the federal government will mail it to you.

[01:01:33] There's it's becoming more and more prevalent. You can go to Walgreens and buy CVS. So, we should all be just going out buying Narcan, having it in the kitchen drawer where it's under any situation you can access it. It It's sad that we have to do that, but it's it's the world we live, but it's like you almost think of this like you I mean, we have, you know, fire extinguishers and fire blankets in the house in case one day the grill catches on fire or there's an oil fire. So, you just sort of have it. Um, tell me why you have mixed feelings about if your if your son is going to a party and let's just assume even though we should never assume that you feel very confident that you know your son's going to break some rules but not this rule, right? Your son's probably going to have a beer but he's he's he's he's not going to take a pill that he doesn't know what it is. Do you do you worry that that's sort of uh

[01:02:19] Well, tell me what your reservation is. Yeah, it to me it's almost like you're given permission, right? Um, but in the in in the same hand, it's almost like a designated driver. That's that Narcan is your designated driver. So, I guess if you're going to take drugs, you're doing it responsibly, right? I guess. But they're legal, right? Well, I'm not even think I I was just thinking more of, you know, you you're not even saying to your kid like it's okay to take drugs. You're saying if somebody else does and they get into trouble, you could almost do it through a selfish lens, which is I don't want you to have to experience this tragedy that will change your life forever. And it will.

[01:03:01] You know, you watch a video like that one we saw and you think like, yeah, it's there's two lives that are lost. There's the kid who dies and there's the kid who watched 100%. And if you can take that away, Yep. Um Yeah. In that aspect, 100%. Yeah. Um, I I'm completely on board with it. What I have mixed feelings about is Yeah. Take the take your drugs and have your Narcan on the table. Like that. That's where I have mixed feelings. As do I. Because And my mixed feelings aren't even ethical.

[01:03:30] They're practical, which is how do you know your buddy's going to give you the Narcan correctly? How do you know you have enough? Like there's a whole I mean to me that's, you know, that's that's you're you're really playing with fire in a dangerous way there. 100%. Um, Anthony, anything else parents can be thinking about here to because I have to be honest with you, there's a part of me that's, and maybe this is just the the skeptic in me that's thinking, "Wait, Peter, don't overreact to this. Don't freak out.

[01:03:59] Don't you know cuz I mean I mean, of course, you can believe it. I had a discussion with our eight-year-old, right? And I'm like, okay, Reese, if anybody ever gives you candy at school, unless it's in the rapper, you don't eat it." You know, I'm going down the path of I don't know how you I don't know if you're as old as I am, Anthony, but I don't know. How old are you? 47. Yeah.

[01:04:16] See, I'm older than you, but I bet you still remember when we were kids. Do you remember all the panic about going to never eat an apple at Halloween? 100%. Razor blades in it. Yep. I talk about that in my presentation. Because of the the candy fit all the It was just right before Halloween, I would get the question all the time at every presentation, should I let my kids go trick-or-treating or can I go trick-or-treating? And what I told them is like, "Your neighbor's not trying to poison you. Go out and have a good time.

[01:04:42] Let your good kid go trick-or-treating." But then I referenced the 80s when I was trick-or-treating. Yeah. I had to come home and dump it out because of the razor blades. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So, so you grew up in Texas. I grew up in Canada. It's amazing to think that everybody was putting razor blades in apples apparently across the globe, right? It probably happened three times, right? And yet it somehow created a moral panic. And

[01:05:04] I think that I I guess I think about this sometimes, right? is where where is the line here? And um I think when I look at these stats, it's hard to say this is a moral panic, right? Like when you think of other examples of moral panics, things that were like what was the most common what was there was a very prominent one, right?

[01:05:23] Which was um like all the satanic uh cults that were like killing babies all over the place. Remember that whole thing? That was kind of another 80s weird thing along with turned out not to even be the case. This is different, right? This is real. You have the bodies. The body bags are there. You've got more than a 100,000 body bags in the past 12 months. It'll be very interesting to see what the 2022 numbers are. I keep waiting for those to come and I'm

[01:05:47] I don't I'm not looking forward to them because I know they're going to be scary, but they're real and this is not a panic. This is I'm not trying to scare people, right? when I when I go out and talk to them, I just tell them what I what I know and try to just to because it's real. It's not going anywhere. It's be going to become more and more prevalent. And unfortunately, we're going to start seeing stuff that's stronger than fentanyl because they're starting to change different structures and the molecule structure to make stuff stronger than fentanyl. We we haven't seen it in central Texas, but up and down the east coast, they've seen like nitines and I think it's called isotopes. There's some other stuff that's there's another there's another variant of it called sufentinol that is sufentanyl carfentinol yeah sufentinel is like insanely potent I I I was told from somebody on the inside that it's the single greatest regret of the uh FDA was that they that they authorized sufentinel uh as a so so sufentinyl I think is technically a schedule two drug meaning it's you know highly highly controlled but still medically can be used um you know for like cancer patients and things like that. But but I I I've been told that they have enormous buyers remorse at having authorized it or or or uh allowing it to to become legal in that setting because it's, you know, it makes fentinel look weak. Correct. And you've sort of opened up an awful Pandora's box. Correct. I think in that in that aspect is they're also trying to create the Narcan like a super Narcan to try to battle what's coming. Um and unfortunately it's just a matter of time before we start seeing that here in central Texas.

[01:07:31] Yeah. Anything else Anthony that you want to you want to get across to I I think specifically to parents either for them directly or things that they can talk with about their kids? Uh, I think we, you know, obviously the most important lesson I take away from this is being very open with your kids. Uh, I mean, the first thing that I think we said to our daughter was, um, like anything you have a question about, just let's just talk about it cuz um, I'm not going to give you sort of like a legal answer. I'm going to give you a medical answer. Right. Right. I'm not going to tell you this is right or wrong. I'm just going to give you the medical like this is the no judgment view of what this is. Correct. Um, I don't know if that's enough.

[01:08:12] It it's something though and that's what I I I don't think probably enough parents are doing. So, um like I said, I have two kids, I have two daughters, and I I've seen so much in my 24 years of law enforcement. Um there's a ton of stuff that I want to unsee. Um but I've always been upfront with them about the world and what I encounter and what's out there on the street because I want them to know and I'm not trying to scare them. I want them to know exactly what's going on and how it affects you. Um, so we need to start in the elementary school. You mentioned talking to your 8-year-old. It's it's huge. Like the schools out in Haste County have started um hanging signs and posters um that are age appropriate talking about pills, talking about fentanyl to where that conversation is starting at a younger younger and younger age. We haven't gone into the elementary schools and talked to the kids, but we go and talk to the parents. We we go to the PTAs. um we we hold public presentations because I want those kids the parents of those elementary school um to start having those conversations um at that age because if that's where we'll start seeing the difference if knowledge the more knowledge they have you know the more right decisions I think will be made um and again I don't try to scare people I don't I don't high school kids don't want to want me to go up on stage and preach to them I just try to humanize the badge as much as I can and and just try to show um that I I I care about you guys and because it affects first responders too, right? Um because we go we go to these calls and we can never unhear the mom screaming. No.

[01:09:49] Because their their their kids lifeless on the ground and we I can't unsee that, right? And that affects not only officers but firefighters, paramedics, doctors. That's the stuff that I we don't want to deal with either. We don't we don't want to have to experience that. We sign up for it. Yes. and we we're going to try to save everybody, but um yeah, just start just have those conversations as much as possible and never not think that your kid won't do that, right? Um and just be nosy. Really, you just have to be nosy, unfortunately. Um and uh never believe your kid won't do it. I just have to stress that a lot because I' I've heard it too many times.

[01:10:28] I can't believe that happened. I never I never knew my kid would never do that. Um, and as parents, we want to believe that, right? I don't want to believe my kid did did did what they did, but they did. Let's figure out why, right? Um, and and just you know your kid better than anybody. Um, if you start seeing the different signs, their friend groups are changing, the grades start suffering, they're losing too much weight, they're gaining too much weight.

[01:10:56] Um, just you know when your kids's off, right? Um, I mentioned my my freshman not having social media. Like I I I gave her social media at a too young of age because I I tried to compare her to my older daughter who was much more mature and it it affected her cuz she battles anxiety, depression, some other things.

[01:11:14] And um I took social media away from her probably about a two months ago she came up to me and she's like, "Dad, I want to thank you for taking um TikTok away from me because I'm so much happier." I didn't realize how much it affected me because all she would do is sit in a room and scroll, right? It's just mindless stuff that and it's so it holds so much power over your kids. Just be mindful of that and and know get to know your kids. You know, it sounds funny to say you should know your kids, but some parents they don't, right? Get to know your kids and when you start seeing something's off, start having those conversations.

[01:11:50] You know, the way I think about what you're doing, Anthony, is um I think of um you're a guy walking down a beach. And it's not just you. There are a lot of people doing this, but I think you know the this has become your life's mission now. And your guy walking down a beach with another guy. I'm borrowing this from a story. And there's a 100,000 starfish washed up on the beach. Mhm.

[01:12:14] And you're walking with this guy and you're picking him up and you're every few steps you pick one up and you throw it back in the ocean and the other guy says to you, "Anthony, what are you doing?" And you said, "Well, the tide is out and all these 100,000 starfish on this beach are going to die if they don't get back in the water." You pick one up, throw it in. Guy looks at you funny and he says,"Anthony, you can't possibly save all these starfish out here. You can't possibly make a difference. You pick up another starfish, you throw it in, you go, made a difference to that one. And so I don't

[01:12:48] I don't I don't know how many you're going to save. But if you save a hundred, right? If if if through your work a hundred lives are saved, that's a hundred lives that are saved. Most people go their whole lives don't save a life. Yeah. So I want to thank you for what you're doing. I want to thank you for taking time on a weekend to come here and and talk with me about that.

[01:13:10] And we're going to put in the show notes for this, we're going to have all sorts of additional resources based on anything that you you tell us we should link to for other folks. So, thank you, Anthony. Yeah, I appreciate you having me. Thank you so much. It means a lot.
