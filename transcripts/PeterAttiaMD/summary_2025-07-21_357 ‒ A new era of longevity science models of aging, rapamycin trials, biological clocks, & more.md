## Description

Brian Kennedy is a renowned biologist, leader in aging research, & director of the Center for Healthy Longevity at the National University of Singapore. In this episode, Brian shares insights from ongoing human aging studies, including clinical trials of rapamycin & how dosing strategies, timing, & exercise may influence outcomes. He presents two key models of aging—one as a linear accumulation of biological decline & the other as an exponential rise in mortality risk—& explains why traditional models of aging fall short. He also explains why most current aging biomarkers lack clinical utility & describes how his team is working to develop a more actionable biological clock. Additional topics include the potential of compounds like alpha-ketoglutarate, urolithin A, & NAD boosters, along with how lifestyle interventions—such as VO2 max training, strength building, & the use of GLP-1 & SGLT2 drugs—may contribute to longer, healthier lives.

## AI Summary

Here's my detailed analysis of the podcast episode:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode features a discussion with Brian Kennedy, a longevity researcher based in Singapore, focusing on aging science, interventions, and clinical trials. The conversation covers fundamental questions about what causes aging, potential interventions, and the current state of longevity research. Key topics include rapamycin, NAD, alpha-ketoglutarate, and the development of biological aging clocks.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Aging involves linear accumulation of damage with superimposed cyclical changes [00:30:22]
- mTOR signaling increases with age, contributing to chronic inflammation [00:17:42]
- Rapamycin shows promise as a geroprotective agent through multiple mechanisms [00:57:40]
- Singapore study testing rapamycin in 150-200 subjects, 5mg weekly for 6 months [00:59:36]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Focus on maintaining lean muscle mass [01:51:50]
- Exercise is crucial for health span even if it doesn't extend maximum lifespan [01:52:28]
