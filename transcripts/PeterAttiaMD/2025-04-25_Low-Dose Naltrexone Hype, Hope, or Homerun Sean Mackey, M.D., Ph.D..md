## AI Summary

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Sean Mackey discussing Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN), a repurposed medication that shows promising results in treating various conditions. The discussion centers on how LDN, at 4.5mg (one-tenth of its traditional dose for addiction treatment), works by blocking toll-like 4 receptors on microglia cells, thereby reducing neuroinflammation. Dr. Mackey shares both clinical evidence and remarkable case studies, including a stroke patient who experienced significant improvements in both pain and speech function.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Naltrexone at 50mg blocks opioid receptors and is used for addiction treatment [00:00:00]
- At 4.5mg, LDN blocks toll-like 4 receptor on microglia cells [00:00:00]
- Microglia are neural immune modulators, not just structural support cells [00:01:22]
- LDN shows promise in treating:
  * Complex regional pain syndrome [00:02:23]
  * Multiple sclerosis [00:02:23]
  * Neuroinflammatory conditions [00:02:23]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider LDN for neuroinflammatory conditions [00:02:23]
- Take LDN two hours before bedtime [00:05:50]
- If activated at night, take in morning instead [00:05:50]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- LDN dosing:
  * Standard dose: 4.5mg [00:01:46]
  * Can be increased to 9mg or 13.5mg in some cases [00:04:35]
  * Traditional naltrexone dosing: 50mg [00:00:00]
- Warnings: Stop during active infections [00:05:50]

5. **Exercise & Movement**: Not discussed in this excerpt

6. **Nutrition & Diet**: Not discussed in this excerpt

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**: Not discussed in this excerpt

8. **References & Resources**:
- Expert mentioned: Jared Younger at UAB [00:00:00]
- Balmar Pharmacy in Colorado for LDN compounding [00:08:39]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"In some patients, Peter, this drug's been magical, like magical." [00:02:23]
"You cannot hurt yourself on this drug." [00:04:35]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What are the specific mechanisms behind LDN's effects on neurodegeneration?
- Are there any long-term studies on LDN use for preventive purposes?
- What are the optimal dosing protocols for different conditions?
- How does LDN interact with other medications?
- What are the success rates in different patient populations?

The cost is approximately $30 per month, or "a buck a day" [00:09:18], making it relatively accessible despite typically not being covered by insurance.

## Transcript

[00:00:00] One of the drugs that I have studied uh with Jared Younger who's now at UAB is a drug called lowdosese nalrexone. This is a fascinating drug and it's got like this underground reputation out there. It's all over the forums and the reason for it is because it's been around for decades and off patent. There is zero money for any pharmaceutical company for it. What is nrexone? Now trexone when given at 50 milligrams is used to block opioid receptors. It's an opioid blocker. And so we use this in the treatment of opioid and alcohol addiction because it blocks the rewarding experiences of alcohol or opioids. And so it's used as a as a treatment for addiction. 50 milligrams at 4 and a half milligrams onetenth of the dose it has been shown to activate to block toll-like four receptor on the micro ga now I just introduced like this really technical concept so allow me to briefly explain the micro ga are these cells that hang around nerves but are not neurons

[00:01:22] And when I was in medical school, a few years several years before you, what I was taught was these microgia were like the warm fuzzy blanket that propped up the nerves. I don't know what you were taught, but um they provided structural support to the nerves. What I learned is that was only part of the story, that they're key neural immune modulators.

[00:01:46] And so what I mean by that is in times of stress, injury, fever, these micro ga get activated. They release all sorts of inflammatory mediators, chemicals that sensitize the central nerves responsible for pain perception, pain transmission, pain perception. So you give lotto nrexone, it blocks that. It blocks that neuroinflammatory soup. And in some patients, Peter, this drug's been magical, like magical. Uh I give it in four and a half milligrams.

[00:02:23] What are the other areas where LDN is just captivating the world? Complex regional pain syndrome. It has had a that's a very tragic pain condition that is a neuropathic pain condition. And we see a fair amount of I've got a clinical trial. I'm just wrapping up on that using lowdos nrexone um funded by the RSDSA association. And another is actually multiple sclerosis they've used it in and they found some reduction in reoccurrences of MS. I think they did that at UCSF um or UCLA, but it's in these weird neurodeenerative type conditions um where they're seeing some help. Now

[00:03:10] I've had some wacky really wacky patient responses if you know I mean I can share one if he is disarthric he can't speak he's got weakness he has hemibody pain burning pain this is that central pain okay pain so he comes to me several years later can barely speak at all he's tried everything let's try low nxrux why does he come to a pain doc because he's got terrible pain. Okay. So, he wasn't coming to you for the speech issue. No, no, no, no. He has a speech therapist.

[00:03:44] It's not getting any better. He's a couple few years out. Stroke is stabilized. Okay. So, it's this burning pain on half his body. Half his body. I trial him on four and a half milligrams of LDN. He goes away. He comes back a couple months later. Pain has improved. But not only that, he's now speaking and throwing a few words together for the first time. and like since a stroke I'm like what the hell? I bump up his dose. You cannot hurt yourself on this drug. You know I know you know this. It's so I go to nine. Why not 10? Well cuz it's easy to take two capsules. Yeah. Um he comes back a few months later. He's now like talking in sentences. And I'm like I I said are you sure this isn't due to your speech therapist? And they swear up and down.

[00:04:35] Absolutely not. He I go on up to like 13 and I go up to 13 and a half and now he's having conversations. And how's his pain? Massively better on this. And um really remarkable effect. I cannot the only way I can explain these things is you know in a stroke you've got like these you've got dead tissue you've got live tissue you've got these intermediate zones and somehow with reducing maybe inflammation you end up with more functional brain some somehow if that model makes sense which it at least teologically does something about that inflammatory zone in the middle between what was clearly gone and not and not is poisoning the the part that's still okay, right? It's so um what is the downside of this uh meaning what would one need to be mindful of uh in in trying an approach like this? The beauty of this drug is uh the only side effects that I've typically I see 20 30% of people get vivid dreams. They get technicolor dreams, not bad dreams, not m not uh nightmares, but their dreams just take on a more colorful nature.

[00:05:50] Every once in a while I'll see somebody who they say it activates them we tell them to take it two hours before bedtime and if it activates them a little bit take it in the morning instead. I guess where I'm going with this is we think that at least a subset of people with neurodeenerative diseases and you mentioned multiple sclerosis but we think this is true in at least some cases of Alzheimer's disease that that neuroinflammation is a part of the pathology. Yeah. So would there be any efficacy to a trial there in either an individual with MCI, mild cognitive impairment, or as crazy as this sounds, is there a reason to consider it prophylactically? Yeah. In high-risisk individuals with the caveat that hey by the way if you happen to get an infection like this would be a good time to stop it and ride it out and get better. I think the short answer short answer is yes. A little bit of the longer answer is everything I know you know this everything we do is weighing risk and benefits. Y this is one drug I am hardressed to come up with significant risks. We have we have decades and decades and decades of experience with this drug in people with addiction at 10x the dose at 10x. And how long are they typically on that drug? Lifetime. So meaning for for a subset of individuals just putting them on the party dose of 50 milligrams of

[00:07:19] Nraxone keeps them free of alcohol and opioids for life because it so blunts the pleasure center. Yeah. The the problem is as all the addictionologists know is that um it's hard to keep people on this because they can just stop it and go back and use. Yeah. You know, so that's why you've got No, you have to want to be off. You have to want to be off. They have injectable uh versions of this. It's not called Vivitrol, is it?

[00:07:44] It's it's an injectable uh under the skin that lasts x number of days, months. Um but yeah, we've got a lot of long-term data on this and from a pilot standpoint with informed consent obviously and just you know I would view that as a kind of a novel treatment in patients that one could try out monitor um do some objective measures and uh see what what see what you get. Um, I wouldn't say that I I want to be careful. I wouldn't say that for a lot of the things that we do because there's real risks with a lot of the medications that we provide, a lot of the procedures we do. Not only that, there's big costs that come with them. Whereas this, I'm going to make a plug here. I have no relationship to, but we get our stuff out of Balmar Pharmacy in

[00:08:39] Colorado. Why? They're a compounding pharmacy. They've got all the certifications. So you the reason is you can't go to Safeway or Costco and get this. You can't get lowd dose nrax on there. You mean you have to it has to be compounded at 4.5. You're saying you're right. Okay. And so we go through this pharmacy because they've got good customer service. They take patients credit cards over the phone and they will ship it to you immediately and they're very responsive. Um you can probably find it in your local area at other compoundingies. It usually runs about $30 a month. So it's basically a free drug. Insurance doesn't often cover it because it's experiment. They consider it experimental, but it's basically a free drug. So, it's a buck a day. Yeah.

[00:09:18] Yeah. So, I uh it it's one that I use more and more and more because of its safety profile and its potential for getting me a home run. [Music]
