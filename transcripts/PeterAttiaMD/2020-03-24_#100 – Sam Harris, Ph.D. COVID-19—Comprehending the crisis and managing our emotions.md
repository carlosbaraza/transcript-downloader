## Description

In this episode, Sam Harris, neuroscientist, author, and host of the Waking Up Podcast, joins Peter to discuss this unprecedented coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis. The discussion includes the important distinction between COVID-19 and influenza, the impact on the economy, the dire situation in New York, and the challenge of creating a safe and effective vaccine. Additionally, Sam brings insights from his extensive meditation practice to help those struggling with stress, anxiety, and fear in this extraordinary situation.

We discuss:
-A time unlike any other—why many people don’t seem to fully grasp the magnitude of this situation [2:00];
-Why comparing COVID-19 to influenza is a bad analogy [10:45];
-The impact on the economy of measures like shelter-in-place—Is the “cure” worse than the disease? [16:45];
-Why are some places, like New York, getting hit so much worse? [24:45];
-The trickle down effect of an overrun healthcare system on non-COVID related health issues [34:45];
-How to calm our minds and manage our emotions during this craziness [38:00];
-Talking to kids about this situation without burdening them with undue stress [50:15];
-Insights from meditation practice—Recognize and unhook yourself from a heightened emotional state [52:00];
-How to make the most of a situation where you let your emotions get the best of you [59:15];
-What are some potential positive things that Sam hopes could be learned from this crisis and applied to the future? [1:09:30];
-The unfortunate politics being layered on top of this crisis [1:15:30];
-The challenge of creating a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 [1:20:00]; and
-More.

[00:00:03] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter Atia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness . and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of the space to the next level at the end of this episode I'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to

[00:00:42] Peter Atia MD com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode welcome back to another special episode of the dr podcast where we're really focusing on the kovat 19 pandemic my guest today is my good friend Sam Harris Sam's been on the podcast in the past as you may know and we spend quite a bit of time on this episode talking about really two things one is really talking about lessons learned I offer some thoughts in response to Sam's questions around what

[00:01:13] I think is happening what I think is going to happen and at the time of this recording which was Monday morning as you'll tell it was not especially optimistic especially in New York and again this is less of me interviewing Sam as a discussion and then of course we turn to talk about something that I think is equally important which is how do we as people sitting here watching this slow motion or fast motion trainwreck in different parts of the world in different parts of the country how do we manage ourselves manage our own emotions our thoughts and our responses to it and some of you may have noticed I put something up on social media last week where I just had a really really bad day and did a bunch of stuff that I was pretty ashamed of as a dad and that sort of prompted part of that discussion so without further delay let's get to this episode and I think he'll enjoy the discussion today with

[00:02:04] Sam I am here with my friend Peter attea Peter you are a top-flight physician and you have a background in finance I can't imagine you had much to think about in the last few weeks you know very little this has been I'm sure everyone feels this way this this has been a period of time unlike any other in our lifetimes there's really no analogy early on I said 9/11 was an analogy but in truth is this is really nothing like 9/11 yeah I actually had the same thought which was you know I remembered where I was during 9/11 it's obviously everybody who's old enough can remember exactly where they were on that moment and then of course in the hours days and weeks that followed but yeah it is actually kind of different and this has sort of an expanding array of confusion at least for me and then also somewhere in the back of your mind you have to realize now that between SARS one and MERS and now

[00:03:09] Tsarskoe v2 it's not like coronaviruses are going away right yeah and the idea that we are so fundamentally surprised by this and call it back footed is frankly scary Bill Gates pointed this out some weeks ago that this was perhaps the most predictable disaster and we knew this was coming I think even gave a TED talk in 2015 on this topic and everyone has been sounding this alarm in infectious disease for years and yet I'm not even sure that after this we will allocate the appropriate resources to have a network of virus detection or clamp down on the crazy bad eating practices in

[00:04:00] China I mean I just I feel like once this is over and we rebound and we in the best case we have a successful antiviral treatment and a vaccine and the economy is booming again I just feel like we're ready to go to sleep on this again it just we appear so masochistic aliy short-sighted in the way we focus on risk I just and to say nothing of our inability to think about something like climate change in in light of what's going on here I mean just the idea that a slow-moving emergency is something we could orient to when we can't even get our head together when we have Italians skyping us and giving TV interviews where they're bursting into tears telling us about what's coming and we're still debating whether we can keep Disney

[00:04:50] World open yeah it is sort of sad when you put it that way because it's sort of like the marshmallow problem everybody knows which is most of us really aren't wired to make short-term concessions in exchange for long-term payoffs and this one is not that hard because it's only a few years in the future in other words it's within our lifetime it would be hard to make the case that within our lifetime we won't experience this again whereas presumably one can say climate change is still from a disaster standpoint fifty years away the analogy to climate change is interesting to me because it is still abstract the promise of disaster is still something that seems debatable to many people even most people is just it is hypothetical it's based on models we can see it sort of arriving but even there we can't attribute any one storm or any one heat wave to climate change in any rigorous sense but in this case we see the wave of contagion crashing on the hospitals in the countries of Europe literally getting we see the faces of doctors who in their in their all to infrequent downtime are telling us what's happening and I just I see this through the lens of my personal relationships a lot now because I have a range of people in my life who have different enough information diets and political convictions and you know economic biases and incentives that lead the confirmation bias knobs to be too differently and so I've spent a lot of time having to convince people one-to-one to take this seriously and it's it's been an amazing experience because these are by and large very smart people and you can show them the article that just got under your skin and it doesn't work and or at least doesn't work as I think it should and so it's just been very interesting to see that than the layers of denial and obfuscation present themselves and to have to kind of punch through them I mean even in oneself I just noticed it's been disorienting to look back over the course of a week where you know week now seems like it's a about a a year long and see the what was at the beginning of the week felt to be kind of an extreme measure or you know a pessimistic hot take now seem like oh okay that was I'm glad I was on the on the threshold of being rational then I seem a little late you know in retrospect it's just psychologically it's very interesting to watch yeah you're right I was saying to my wife recently that each day seems to take they just they go by so quickly but because it seems like I'm doing the same thing every day there's no there's no difference between Sunday Monday Tuesday

[00:07:54] Saturday right it's all Wednesday it's just all the same day every day and it goes by alarming pace but week to week when I think about last Monday or two Monday's ago we were on our second day of quarantine that seems like months ago to your point you know I want to go back to something you said a second ago because it's something I've been struggling with which is another challenge that is unique to the human condition so if we struggle with appropriate discounting I think we also struggle with understanding what how to put uncertainty bounds on estimates you've probably played this game before it's a fun game to play where you take twenty questions for which there are known answers and you ask a person each question and you say look give me a range that has a 95% confidence that it contains the answer to this question and after 20 of these questions they should have correctly captured the answer within their range 19 out of 20 times

[00:08:58] I've never seen anybody can get close to it by the way because they're you know really hard facts like what is the distance from the Sun to Mars most people wouldn't know that off the top of their head and you sort of say well it's between this many miles and that many miles and so it sort of speaks to I think one of the challenges of communicating things like climate change and pandemics to people because error bars aren't a sexy part of scientific communication to the layperson but there's sort of nothing that you can talk about as a projection let alone a measurement in science where it's backwards looking that doesn't have an error bar and yet so much of what we talk about is binary it's on this date

[00:09:46] New York hospitals will be overrun we're going to see this many cases with this percentage of them being fatal but if we sort of force ourselves and I'm just as guilty of this by the way as anybody because it's just good shorthand to be able to rattle off numbers but if you really had to start putting error bars on those things like well we're 90 or 95% confident that it's this to this I think that would be a better way to communicate this stuff and I think it would be a little less alienating to people who are more naturally skeptical yeah and there might be a role for something like betting markets and prediction markets and just when you put things in terms of bets for people it it sharpens up their their sense of probability I've actually found myself consciously anchored to some clearly unscientific ways of thinking that have strangely seemed useful one of the reasons why I feel like I been a few memes here which of which I think have been frankly confusing for people and one is the flu is worse than corona virus is either just like the flu or the flu is worse the flu kills 50,000 people a year in the u.s. rather often and if we were tracking that on an hourly basis we would be we would never leave our houses and the flu kills kids too rather often so we've now been enrolled in this vast social panic delusion and we're just not seeing it and so the analogy to the flu among those who use it it seems to be totally clarifying and yet it has always struck me as just flat wrong and it has by a sheer accident which has just primed in me it's just a starkly unscientific way of thinking about this which is I just happen to know one person who caught the virus fairly early one of the guys who got it in Italy and came back to Los

[00:11:50] Angeles among a group of I think it was 13 skiers I know a guy who was in a group of five of them and he and at least one of his friends quickly got sick enough to be hospitalized and then put on ventilators and induced comas so I knew like a group of five where 40% of fairly young I mean you know 50 year-old fit guys without any comorbidities non-smokers 40% wound up in the ICU fighting for their lives this is not a statistical sample and yet it has seemed anchor to that fact I have just heard every comparison with flu sounding delusional and I don't even know how to characterize the the reasoning bias or error I'm making there but it's actually seemed somewhat analogous to someone saying I've got I've got 10,000 you know marbles in this urn and either 1% of them or or 50% of them are black you know reach in and pull out a few if you reach in and you pull out 2 of 5 being black you feel like ok well I'm not quite sure what's going on the rest of that urn but somehow I think getting on 50% is it sounds more reasonable so I don't know what you think about that but that's Pinterest an in my own view of this from you know now going back a few weeks and it's just it's changed the way in which I've dealt with some of these these memes that we've all been processing so I've sort of thought of it a little in a slightly different way which is there's the Beast you know versus the beast you don't and the beast you know is pretty bad I mean nobody is discounting the severity of influenza but there are a couple of things to understand which is influenza comes in a very predictable wave and it has a seasonal variation to it but that mortality that you described let's even just look at the global mortality it's spread out across a year and it's fairly uniform so the rate at which it is changing is not enormous we are still in a period of nonlinear geometric / exponential growth at least of new cases and by extension therefore hospitalizations critical care hospitalizations and death so there's no evidence yet that we are on the backside of that curve where that has stabilized so we don't yet know what the absolute potential for mortality is from this virus because it's in its infancy so it's it's sort of like there's a person who works when a job where they make $100,000 a year plus or minus 10,000 depending on their performance bonus and then there's someone working at a start-up who's making $10,000 a year but has a whole bunch of equity in the company well who's worth more well it depends on what that equity is worth right that could very easily dwarf the value of that hundred thousand dollar-a-year and so I mean again maybe not a great analogy but I think you get the point right there is this geometric component to this disease that is not present in influenza and so as of today if you could freeze the world and not one more person is going to get this disease yeah we may look back and say this was dwarfed by influenza even within a calendar year but we can't say that so to me the real point is how can we take as many steps as possible to freeze this thing selectively and that's really to me the challenge right as we sit here recording this today the stock markets got to be down 30% on the year if not more no one's going to look at this and say the cost of trying to arrest this was not enormous and there were lots of really smart people out there saying the cost was too great I really think that that's it I think that's a pretty good argument so the question is not just for this opportunity but for the next one not if but when what is a smarter way to go about locally addressing these problems without global economic calamity right yeah and barring a great system of monitoring and a great system of producing antivirals and vaccines I'm not sure what the fix is that protects the economy actually want to say a few things about this notion that the Cure might be worse than the disease because if that's cropping up a lot now I mean we've been you know you and I have been locked down for two weeks or so but most people it's it's at least a week less than that and we're already hearing of this you know quarantine essentially beginning to fray and people are saying this is crazy we need to find some other way of doing this the economy is imploding and I definitely share the concern that the economic damage could be as bad or worse than anything the virus can do I mean I am I'm certainly worried about that I'm worried that we might tip into a depression I'm worried about the the loss of social cohesion that could follow up on that you know none of that's trivial and I think it's we have to guard against that and hopefully the government will ram through a stimulus package that is appropriately targeted and takes away the immediate pain and Shores up businesses of various but it's interesting to say so when you hear the arguments of people again it comes back to the often - the flu analogy listen we're all hiding in our houses and only a few thousand people have died in the United States at this point this is crazy the flu has already killed twenty-two thousand people this year what the hell are we doing and there's kind of just this this global faith that our health care system won't be overwhelmed we'll be able to handle it the virus is just going to peter out on its own by some dynamic that is just running against its apparent exponential growth it's just the I've talked to smart people who just think there's this natural life cycle of a of a corona virus or you know any cold virus that it just kind of Peters out and you don't have to do much of anything about it again these people are not doctors or much less epidemiologist but they're smart business people who want to get the economy started again and one thing

[00:18:41] I would point out is that no one to my knowledge is running the opposite program of happy talk which is to say no one is saying as we're in our homes watching the economy fall off a cliff that there's nothing to worry about economically I mean listen this is businesses fail all the time we have our chapter 11 and chapter 7 laws for a reason there isn't actually any wealth destruction going on because even if the

[00:19:13] Dow goes to zero we have our buildings and our roads and our factories and our laboratories are you noticing any of these things disappear no they're all their people it's just that there is no real wealth destruction here this is just this is all a a fantasy right I mean you could say something in that vein that would be analogous to the kinds of things that are being said about the corona virus so as to mollify or to attempt to mollify economic fears but i think most people would recognize that it was delusional and i haven't heard anyone say it i mean everyone is worried about what could happen to the economy and rightly so but is there something in your cognitive toolkit around thinking about the health side of this that can help they can actually arm people who are arguing that we should just let everyone get sick essentially I mean would keep the 80 year olds and the 70 year olds maybe in their houses but let's just go out there and get hurt immunity I mean the UK UK was briefly on this path I'm not sure what they're doing today but they did a 180 and you know maybe they're gonna do a 180 back but I just feel like the shelter-in-place mode that most of humanity is in at the moment or at least attempting to be in is beginning to unwind even only after about a week and the idea that we're going to maintain this for months if needed seems fairly far-fetched so I'm wondering what you're thinking about that I'll come to that in a second but I throw about one more analogy on why the influenza comparison is not great and unfortunately it's got its own political ramifications to it so it's not a great analogy but none of them are you could almost think of influenza like the number of people who died in traffic accidents every year which is frankly a lot higher than most people realize until you really scrutinize those data you'd be surprised at how devastating it is what the odds are of a person dying in a car accident and when 9/11 happened a lot of people said look why are we getting all better I mean no one said this in the immediate after fact but for understandable reasons there became a lot of political fatigue around the war on terror and a lot of people said wait a minute why are we doing all of this 3,000 people died on 9/11 and that's tragic but do you know how many more people died in traffic accidents and that's true but it again misses the non-linearity of terrorism now again I'm not even here to try to broach this discussion of whether our approach to a post 9/11 world was the right approach or what could have been done different but if you're you know a reasonable student of history you could at least conclude that 9/11 had to be countered with a much more severe response than just the number of lives lost as tragic as that was it's the potential for what could happen if this situation is not rectified and again I think that's the issue here which is not to discount how tragic influenza is because it is but to realize how much of an unknown we're dealing with right now and then how do you balance that with there's a way to immediately put this thing to rest if you could wave a magic wand which is you shut the world down and then of course what's the right way to thread that needle and now to your question well actually could we linger on that one point first admit why haven't we been able to communicate that solution better than we have because we know we're sort of stumbling into some mode of shutdown that risks cratering the economy why hasn't anyone articulated the total lockdown that only lasts a few weeks I mean that just seems like let's just talk about the biology of that for a second I mean that barring some crazy property of this virus that I think I'm at I haven't heard anyone allege if we all sheltered in place for what three weeks this would burn itself out I mean to have the sick people still in hospitals getting treated and recovering or not but everyone who's got this thing if you denied them contact with anyone else this thing would evaporate yeah maybe call it for weeks to include the 95th percentile it's a non normal distribution but yeah you'd say four weeks of total lockdown you could burn this thing out and by the way that's effectively what happened in the second wave in China that's the best estimator what really happened there but you see that's a political solution not a scientific solution the steps that

[00:23:58] China took to be able to make that happen I just don't see how you could do in a free society like the United States I mean governor Newsom how many days ago basically said you got to shut this down people don't leave your house unless it's absolutely essential and I mean I just saw the newspaper today it's like people are running around the beach and playing patty-cakes and doing this now the other thing and I'm sensitive to it

[00:24:26] I get it I mean they're saying hey I'm not going to be defeated by this thing or whatever the logic might be it's not the approach I would take but the point is they're not even listening to the closest thing we have to a directive shy of enacting the police so I just don't think we can do it and that gets back to my point about the 95 percent confidence interval you know I'm really starting to think that what we should have been doing all along was not thinking of the

[00:24:50] United States as one homogeneous entity but rather thinking of each city as its own country because even within Italy you know I talked about this on social media recently even within Italy it looks totally different right Milan to Sicily to Rome have not one thing in common not one so Milan you had almost 2200 deaths out of 10 million people that's a 2% mortality not case fatality total fatality to the population 0.02 percent and it's staggering right and in Rome 31 deaths on 6 million Sicily 3 deaths and 5 million so the mortality on a per population basis was 40 times higher in Milan than

[00:25:37] Rome and 300 times higher in Milan than Sicily so even within Italy it doesn't make sense to think of it as Italy is horrible no it's like basically which part of Italy got a head start on this there's all these analogies the one I like to use is they're all cars driving towards the edge of a cliff some of them are going faster some of them have more people on and they're heavier some of them have worse tires and some of them are on lousy or surfaces and they apply the brakes at a different point in time they're not all going off the cliff at the same time and some of them aren't gonna go off a cliff and so in retrospect I wish I was smart enough to think of that a month ago I wish our policymakers had have thought about a month ago and maybe we would have had a better shot at containing this if we'd been more directed towards where is there going to be grotesque mismatches between supply and demand and obviously

[00:26:29] New York is now that is unambiguously the case in New York as of right now right we're recording this on Monday the 23rd and yeah I think we're all expecting to learn a lot from the experience in New York over the course of the next week what's your sense of the likelihood that we're going to discover that New York at least is much more like Italy than it is like South

[00:26:56] Korea well and again I would say Milan more than anything else in Italy so we've built a couple of models on this and then we've even had we've been really fortunate that some really great inbound people have just come to us and shared their models and then let us put our assumption there and theirs and vice versa what kind of comes down to the following how many people in New York do we know are positive and as of this morning the most conservative estimate Ike fine is about just under 11,000 and that's probably what we're where we were last night so it's probably closer to 12,000 based on something Cuomo said this morning okay so that's how many people we know have the infection so then the first question is what is the population that is infected for whom yet we don't have confirmation so in other words what's the known to unknown positives this is where lots of models are spitting out unbelievable numbers and they're based on several different things they're based on looking at historical data within New York and looking at what is the number of people in the hospital tell you as a leading indicator for the lag on infection they're also based on the wuhan data so we have a very clear case of the up and down cycle of infections in China and so we are basically modeling approximations based on at any point in time when you go t minus one two three four five six seven days what did you see in the past that helps you understand the future now the problem with this before I go any further Sam as you know is you can't just use straight-up linear regression to solve this problem because if you do you need a new model for every day because there's just no linear extrapolation from across the span of say five days it just doesn't work that way it's changing way too quickly you use these things called vintage models and you start to have to look at first and second derivatives of change and things like that so then we pivot to another question so that whole series of questioning tries to get at this situation of what is going to be the number of infected people and by the way

[00:29:07] I've thrown in some really conservative estimates which is take R naught to zero in other words pretend for a moment that you have enacted draconian enough measures that not one more person in New York who's infected will infect another person now is that true based on what my friends in New York who are looking out their windows are telling me not a chance but I like to sometimes play that what you have to believe game which is let's make it as good as it gets before we go down that path what do we think makes New York such a hot spot here is it the fact that it's just urban density and a very active subway system and what would you attribute the problem to in New York I think it's everything including that and bad luck I don't think there's anything about Milan that makes it any better or worse than Rome so I reject the idea that the climate in

[00:30:02] Milan is more suitable for this than Rome I think that's just noise I think the issue is bad luck so it's this is a stochastic problem people were going to distribute from the epicenter of infection to different places and they got there at different periods of time and again the growth is so nonlinear that if one city got a 10-day head start over another it's a totally different world because remember the other cities get to see that response and enact measures to slow it down in other words everybody's generally applying the brakes at the same time but imagine if one person had a one minute Head Start of pushing on the accelerator towards the cliff we need a different analogy for what goes down in Florida when they get to preview everyone's horror then declare their world open for spring break and yeah yeah well no but that's the person who watches everybody applied the brakes and says somehow I'm immune because I have a parachute on my car yeah maybe I can fly yeah so so I think in New York just had a bad head start and then it's the perfect storm of population density subways and proximity and truthfully I mean based on what I'm hearing from everybody I know in New

[00:31:14] York there's a little bit of a cultural difference as well right a little bit of a hey we're in New York right like we've got this thing we survived 9/11 this thing is not going to be that bad so sort of a whatever all of these things sort of combine I think to just have enough kindling and oxygen and fuel to make this thing have burned from a little bit of a you know a dull ember into kind of a big fire so that's the supply side of the equation so you're giving me an R nought of zero yes I'm giving you an R naught of zero and I'm saying what's the most conservative estimate for how many people are infected relative in total relative to we know and I've never seen an estimate that's more conservative than 5x so for every person who we know is infected only 5x more are actually infected so that would place your New York infections at 50,000 people by the most conservative estimate by the way the estimates that I've seen range from 5 to 40 X so let's just take the lower bound the 5 X are not is 0 that's 50,000 people are infected now we ask the question how many of those people require an ICU I think that's the more important question than how many of those people require a hospital bed because we can makeshift hospital beds pretty well I see use are a little harder to makeshift so let's start on the availability so the stock number of

[00:32:39] ICU beds in New York City which basically is gonna service not just New York City but the Hamptons gonna service the surrounding area you've got at baseline about a thousand ICU beds know we've estimated from discussions we basically know people at almost every hospital directly and indirectly we think they can repurpose 2,000 beds so you could take all the surgical ICUs and say we're not doing elective surgery so let's repurpose those and get those ready for medical and pulmonary ICU you're still gonna probably occupy 25 percent of your beds for non kovat patients remember people still have heart attacks and strokes and the things that require ICU care so let's say you've got 1,500 ICU beds and maybe you can stretch this up to 2,000 from a capacity standpoint because you can start to double ventilate patients that are of the same size that have the same ventilator requirement so now you then ask the question how many of those at a minimum 50,000 patients who were infected not growing at all how many require and ICU well if you look at everything in Italy it's about four point eight four point nine percent and if you look at the numbers in New York today they're almost five percent so let's just be really conservative and say it's four percent well if four percent of those patients are gonna require ICU care I mean you're already talking about over 2,000 beds yeah you're full up already so that when you play though what you have to believe for New York not to get overwhelmed okay you really have to come up with some conservative estimates and and I were losing faith in that game and therefore we think that there needs to be a really important strategy of mitigation in New York and that every other city like Miami like

[00:34:32] San Francisco like Los Angeles and like Seattle who are next in the crosshairs needs to be pushing the brakes a little harder and also thinking about how you would bolster capacity should the unknown two known infections be higher than we're estimating do you think we're gonna get a good sense of the mortality associated with all of the other non kovat conditions that got shoved aside or otherwise handled badly in the wake of this so you've people who are electing to delay cancer surgeries say or or as you say they have routine or more routine emergencies like strokes and heart attacks and either they are reluctant to go to the hospital or they go and the beds aren't there I mean is that is that all being modeled we have not been looking at that internally I trust that it will be looked at and I mean I've seen it indirectly just through our patients right I'll give you the silliest example which is not life-threatening but we haven't drawn labs on a patient in two weeks and I don't know when the next time is that we will draw labs on a patient okay that's a trivial example but you start to think about what can and can't be done we've got two patients that are in need of a dental procedure right now one of them chipped his tooth and needs a root canal we're kind of on the fence about whether or not he should go and do that right now yeah you know I've been thinking about that just personally when I see what is how we live and how other people live and what we let our kids do I mean I just basically viewing everything that runs any risk of physical injury as we're sort of out in the wilderness right now not close to a hospital and you know we don't want to go to a hospital unless absolutely necessary so

[00:36:22] I want to do those things or not do those things that I wouldn't want to do if I were a thousand miles away from medical attention yeah I'm just thinking about like we just got a puppy God like maybe four or five weeks ago and I mean she's as cute as all hell but she didn't finish her vaccinations I'm just worried like oh god I hope nothing goes wrong with her because I sure as hell don't want to have to go and take her out to the vet and secondly I have two young kids two of my three kids are in that age group where they can do really stupid things and get bit by dogs if you're not watching they're making yank a dog's tail or do something dumb and so

[00:36:59] I mean that's constantly in the back of my mind which is watching those kids like a hawk when they're with her because if one of them gets bit by her yeah that we're going to the urgent care I'd rather do a root canal on myself right now than have to take one of my kids into urgent care to get some IV antibiotics for a significant dog bite yeah ya know and it's amazing to see people who are not or apparently not making any of those accommodations you know I've seen people because you can obviously get out of your house and we're not locked down in in that sense it's not crazy to be out hiking or as long as you can stay away from people but you know seeing people mountain bike and I'm it just I'm just picturing you know all the people who take a fall on a mountain bike or one of these scooters then having to deal with the aftermath and I could just you know why add that to the risk profile at the moment it's I mean I I'm embarrassed to admit the number of times a day I do that calculation with everything I'm doing of don't let this be the moment you break something and have to go in and get taken care of so I want to pivot to something else Sam because by the way you and I could have this discussion an hour every day and it never gets old to me but but there's something I want to pivot to we're just on a personal level could use your help and I know a lot of other people can as well which is our minds are running amuck at the moment and there are a few people who I think have been able to articulate the nature of the mind and how we are not our thoughts and yet right now so many of my thoughts are unpleasant they've permeated my dreams I've never had more sort of disturbing dreams than

[00:38:49] I've had in the last two weeks I think and they're not always related to this but they're just disturbing dreams in general and I know that part of that is my mind playing out anxiety as I sleep how have you dealt with that as you know based on having spent many years practicing meditation and and seeing the mind through that lens I have some tools which I you know now default to which are incredibly helpful so it's if you understand the mechanics of your own mental suffering if you understand how anxiety arises from the first-person side I mean not understanding it as a matter of neurophysiology but just actually able to witness it as a matter of experience moment a moment that allows you to get off the ride whenever you can remember - now the Devils in the details of just how infrequently you managed to do that depending on on how much this the skill has been ingrained in you but and there really is for most of us there's no alternative but to practice it first you have to learn it and then you have to practice it and then it becomes somewhat like any physical skill if someone who is completely untrained and unfit and you put them in the gym and they have a fair amount of work to do to get even anything that's sort of acceptable in terms of fitness and preparation for real physical stress and then you have people who their

[00:40:27] Olympic athletes or their jujitsu world champions or the people who have taken some domain a physical training to a point where their default setting physically under stress is amazingly different than people tend to be and there is a mental component to that it's possible to be really resilient obviously I don't count myself among the the super athletes here but I've done enough practice so that when my wheels begin to spin and I'm suffering unnecessarily whether it's from anxiety or some other negative emotion I can let it go it's pointed out to me by someone else or I just happened to notice it I can drop the problem that doesn't mean I don't pick it up again I mean then the thoughts come back and you don't notice them and it just feels like you worrying about getting sick in the middle of the night or whatever it is and but the question is how long does it take to puncture that with a clear scene of the nature of mind and for me the progress really is a matter of it's not a matter of banishing any particular emotion or pattern of thought from your experience for all time and that's an unrealistic goal it's a matter of getting more and more agile in the face of these arising thoughts and emotions so that you so that their time course is drastically shortened or at least the time it takes you to puncture them by in this case the state of mind would be called mindfulness but any mindfulness really is just clear attention to what experience is like in the present it's not so you know some mystical piece of software that you have to get downloaded into you that you don't have it's just it actually is just a non distracted nonreactive clear scene of let's say the physiology of anxiety and just feeling the energy in your body of anxiety at the moment you can merely feel it without judgment without reaction without contraction without thinking about all the reasons why you it's intolerable or you know or thinking more about the reasons why it's justified if you just become willing to feel it in the moment it loses its psychological content for the moment you can merely feel it it has no more psychological content than any other analogous feeling in the body does you know the indigestion or pain in your back or itching on the surface of your skin I mean all of these things can be unpleasant but they don't mean anything really or that or at least it's a further action of thought to link them up with some future state of the body or the world which cashes out their meaning so anyway I'm going to talk more about what mindfulness actually is and how to practice it but that's how I view this ongoing experience I keep puncturing it with just clear attention and it really does help no question you said something on one of your podcasts I think it was last week you said it and I I'm paraphrasing but like it's not about getting rid of fear but rather kind of letting an emotion like fear go when it no longer serves its purpose yeah I mean you want to feel fear when it's appropriate and useful to feel it and you you want to be able to release it the moment there's no point to it and the punchline here though is that 95% 99% of the vast majority of moments in which we feel fear or anxiety or shame or regret or you know any Nate classically negative emotion most of those moments are wasted I mean most of those moments in most of those moments the negative emotion is driving us to no good purpose in fact it's actually undermining our ability to recognize the happiness we're capable of in this moment because in fact nothing is wrong in this moment so it's great to feel anxious when it's goading you to do something useful but as a goad its utility is delivered in those first few moments very often I mean it's at the boundary of sort of the known and the unknown where you're trying to figure out what to do I mean around this kovat pandemic

[00:44:57] I'm feeling anxiety when I don't know what I should be doing okay how do we get groceries into the house what should I be doing there do I mean do we eat salad anymore or is this a vector for disease how do I wipe down a box or do I wipe down a box that was just delivered how long does the virus live on cardboard how long does it live inside a box that I opened now I'm taking something that's packaged in plastic out of that box a Maya lunatic for thinking any of these thoughts all of that uncertainty is the basis for a durable state of anxiety but once I figure out what I think is true and what I should be doing well then there is no utility to the anxiety and then just do the thing you think you should be doing and the moment uncertainty reimpose --is itself the moment I read an article which says oh actually you know it you can coronavirus can get in in this other way that you hadn't been accounting for well then okay then I'll get anxious over that but only for as long as it takes me to decide what my new policy is and you can either do something about it or not if you can do something about it the anxiety is pointless I mean it should have a very short half-life and the truth is if you can't do something about it the anxiety is pointless and should have a short half-life so in either case you want this punctate experience of what's essentially an

[00:46:26] Orient in response to danger and that the dangers are real this is not a cartoon we're in we're making potentially life-and-death decisions for ourselves and other people but you don't have to remain in this state of anxiety even if these decisions are actually very significant yeah there aren't many examples I can point to in the last two or three years which is about the period of time that I've been familiar with mindfulness based meditation where it's been more true to realize that what's happening in the moment is rarely that bad but what's going on in my mind is often much worse and in the case of what's happening now it's usually more forward looking than backwards looking obviously there were periods in our lives when we can suffer more based on the backwards looking emotions that tend to be more depressive and dysthymic but here it's really this forward-looking anxiety that can be devastating and yet

[00:47:31] I put something up on Twitter the other day and I was like you know it sort of occurred to me that I had just reached my new record in 12 years longest period of time not traveling and it's sort of funny because you're not gonna meet someone who hates traveling more than me Sam I hate it I hate airplanes I hate airports I hate being away from my home and for someone who hates it so much I do it an awful lot and so for all the uncertainty and the everything that's going on right now it's been it's been a long time and it might be a long time before I travel again there's huge value in that and certainly if I appreciate it in the moment that I'm in and yet so often I'm hijacked by my fear of uncertainty yeah well then one thing you're pointing to there are the many silver linings that many of us have found in this circumstance the people and people are reporting this on social media just listing the things that are surprisingly nice about quarantine essentially and the general circumstance the reason why we're all doing this isn't nice but but yeah many people are discovering that there's a kind of a hard reset of their value system and they're spending more time with family and then there's quality time of a sort that they haven't touched before or haven't touched in a long time I totally share the the less travel epiphany M is it's just I sort of had that even before this and decided to just cancel a lot of travel in just in general

[00:49:05] I like it about as much as you do but yeah there's especially for those of us who are so fortunate to more or less be able to do what we were doing before from home in isolation I mean that obviously there are people for whom their careers were completely zeroed out the moment they were told to stay home and there's a ton of financial anxiety that comes with that and everyone's feeling the financial anxiety to some degree but some of us I count myself among the luckiest here we're in a position to just either were everything was already distributed or we were in a position to make it distributed without really missing a step and that's just sheer luck in many cases because there's certain things you just can't build from home and certain things you need never even think about going into an office to accomplish so yeah I mean there's a lot that many of us are discovering about just how out of balance our lives became when everything was normal and I think it's worth insofar as any of those lessons seem like things we want to hold on to it it's worth taking stock of them have your kids voiced any sort of concern about this and how have you talked with them about it well my oldest is 11 and she's definitely old enough to worry about it and to understand how non-normal this situation is my six-year-old is pretty oblivious to it I mean she has a general sense of what we're up to but I don't get the sense that it's making her anxious at all I mean as you know the core ethic in my life and this translates into the family is honesty my daughter's know that we will never lie to them and we never find ourselves having to lie to them but that doesn't mean we tell them everything and my oldest daughter will ask a question to which I know she really doesn't want the answer it's just gonna make her anxious and so I'll basically just acknowledge in that moment there's a door that's locked that she's trying to open but there's no point in opening it

[00:51:24] I'll tell her what she needs to know there and that's not the same thing as saying oh there's nothing to worry about or giving her some dishonest answer that totally swishes her anxiety but it's a stronger foundation for a relationship a machine knows because the thing is she knows now that when I say something is not worth worrying about it's not a risk or she's fine she knows I'm not bullshitting her and in other moments where I can't say that honestly I don't say it dishonestly I just give her give her more of the attempt to give her more of the adult grade tools of dealing with probability and risk and whether it's working or not less I mean I don't have the counterfactual to go on but at the very least she knows we don't lie to her and that's to my eye that's a nice place to be have you struggled yourself with just irritability or you're one of the least irritable humans I've ever met so that's a pretty it's a pretty high bar for you to tell that to my wife hey well exactly that you'll get a big laugh out of it that's the litmus test right so what would your wife say has been the impact of the uncertainty the fear all of the things we've just discussed how has that impacted someone like you who for most of us we would aspire to have sort of the degree of separation from thought and reaction that you have through again years of practice yeah well again it's not that I don't get angry or anxious or uptight or have a negative reaction to things I do and by tendency I tend to be that sort of person I'm sort of on the anger annoyed pessimist channel more than certainly more than the the opposite right I mean no one has ever accused me of being too joyful or Pollyannish so yeah I mean I can definitely be a buzzkill and can be in a bad mood and can be irritable the difference is that if she calls me on it

[00:53:32] I can actually pull the brakes or get off the ride or just whatever metaphor you want for like the actual stoppage of the problem emotionally and this is not a matter of bearing down on yourself or oppressing it or doing some manoeuvre which just bottles up the rage or something it's not that it's I can actually just let it go that's just garden-variety mindfulness taken to a certain level in my case it's if you know anything about how I view meditation practice and the nature of mind and the elusiveness of the self and free will and all of these other you know nested top it was a pretty good app that I would recommend for people to help understand how you think about some of those things what's it called again this conversation is brought to you by the waking up athlete you know though we eschew sponsors on this podcast yes so something I taught there's a lot to say about that but the net result is it's possible to cut through the illusion there in a way that allows you to truly stand free of whatever emotional reaction you're having at that moment whether it's anger or sadness or or anything and you recognize that consciousness is just this open space in which everything is appearing on its own and there is no durable self riding around in the middle of it there's just just consciousness and its contents and everything is in its own place and and consciousness actually isn't even harmed by that awful mind state that you were anchored to a second ago there's just the energy of what used to be anger essentially passing through and you're your freedom from a problem in the next moment isn't actually even predicated on that energy leaving yet it's just in fact true that when you're no longer identified with the stream of angry thoughts the peripheral physiology of anger dissipates very very quickly I mean over the course of seconds 15 seconds at the most whereas and the thoughts disappear more or less instantly if you if you break the spell all of this the time course of all of this falling off is pretty quick but the truth is the moment you break the spell even while the the body is still incandescent with the the physiology of anger or anxiety or whatever you're free even in that first moment and that can take some doing to recognize that and that's why that's the reason why one would practice meditation but having brought your practice to that point where you can actually do that yeah I mean the thing Annika would say about me is that I can actually when push comes to shove I can stop being an and I can stop on a dime whether or not and whether or not I do it in that moment it can be influenced by some other factors and so personally the most stressful stuff that happens for us and in in this situation is if we're not on the same page with respect to something we're trying to decide again I mean we're talking about the the boundary of between the known and the unknown and trying to decide what we should do about the unknown right so if we can't agree about whether or not whatever to have someone over to the house say under these conditions right I'm gonna decide to to have her mom over but how is her mom living is her mom actually locked down as her mom wasn't your mom just at the supermarket and told you that such and such happened whatever it is member this is kind of hypothetical but in that situation if she is if I'm trying to convince her to be more risk-averse than she in fact is or vice versa that's where I'm gonna tend just to get caught in my own sense of urgency then my stress will be just largely what

[00:57:43] I'm communicating right and I'll be uptight and she'll be annoyed at just how I'm having the conversation and even in that moment she could if she actually said okay listen this is we can talk about this but I don't like who you are right now I don't the way you're talking about this that is something that as long as we can keep working to solve the problem at the level of the problem I could drop the emotional contagion in that moment which is an immense help but the place where I get what really is my kryptonite is when the door gets closed to actually solving the problem when I want to keep talking about something or keep trying to figure like there's something to figure out and she or someone in the world is shutting me down there it's very easy for me to just feel like okay the emergency signals are still appropriate here it would be inappropriate to be no longer anxious because the house is on fire and we're fighting about whether to use the fire extinguisher but that's the exception right I mean I'm very rarely in that situation but that's where my gear is truly grind and again you still want to be the person who can find the gear that allows for grace under pressure you do want to be the the smooth navy seal operator rather than the panicked grunt who's just firing his weapon in all directions and so there's always an argument for unhooking from the the heightened emotion in a situation once your your orient into the problem you touched on something there that I think is so helpful and doesn't get enough I think appreciation which is the importance of having a spouse that understands the exercise and knows how to help you in my case I mean that's something I feel really grateful for I posted something on social media a week ago it was it was really sad it was actually my birthday of all days and the night before I had just absolutely berated my daughter for leaving the lights on she left like every single light on in the hallway it's just a dumb pet peeve of mine then normally I just turned them off or just make some smart aleck remark like hey Olivia you know the light fairy's not working today maybe you could turn the lights off but on this day I just went nuts and then the next morning which again is my birthday

[01:00:11] I'm on friends call basically from 6 o'clock in the morning till 10 o'clock in the morning one call after another and my five-year-old just cannot understand for the life of him why I'm working on my birthday he thinks your birthday is the day you get to play and he keeps trying to come in the office and clay and finally after like the fourth time I just explode on him well two things right one is not a lot of mindfulness in that experience to you then at least for me you cycle into a horrible place of shame where now you are doing that backwards looking thing that we just talked about it's again I said most of it is anxiety but then the shame is very backwards looking equally unproductive and you sort of spoil the rest of the day but through a different mechanism not by lashing out but by detaching and that's actually for me my kryptonite is when I get in that place I just I pull back so far and it's equally troublesome but then fast forward a 2 to 3 days and

[01:01:14] I've reflected a lot on that experience and like how did you get there man how is it in the span of 14 hours you lose it on to kids so yesterday my same five-year-old who's obsessed with Lego and there are these trained Legos that are very elaborate they take a long time to put together and I've told him like four hundred times you got to be careful with this thing well sure enough he drops at his smashes into 50 pieces and the next morning which is Sunday morning

[01:01:42] I wake up to put it together and I don't if you've ever done this with Lego if you remember when you're a kid sometimes it's just easier to take the whole thing apart all 500 pieces and start from scratch then try to take the 50 that came off and figure out where they go but lead us to say this is a ton of work and at one point actually pull out a video to check something and by now he's awake and he starts he hippin at me like the video is too loud that I'm trying to fix his Lego admittedly he's being totally obnoxious and I'm just about to explode on him and basically say what do you think I've been doing here for the past hour buddy and my wife looks at me and she goes take a breath and it was perfect right I just stood up I went over to when I said Reese I don't like the way you're talking right now you're being really rude and dad's been up for an hour before you even got up trying to fix the toy you broke so I'd appreciate it if you'd talk a little nicer and afterwards my wife was like look you did it man like you weren't the biggest jerk on earth but my point is she was the one who helped me they're like yeah the practice that I had helps but I'm still at the point where I need that cue sometimes from somebody else to just give me one more pause before I lose my mind yeah no that's great and that is the virtue of certainly one of the virtues of good company and having someone who shares your values I mean one thing I would add is that even when you totally screw up you've blown up at your kids or someone else and you've you're now feeling ashamed by what you did and you know your lack of compassion or resilience or mindfulness or however you're judging yourself for the previous misstep and you just feel bad about it and bad about yourself again that that is no less an opportunity to cut through the illusion of self than any other moment it's like in this video game that's just the next screen right this is the next boss fight now you're fighting the boss of shame and it's no more real ultimately and yet it's an appropriate like anxiety as a signal it can be an appropriate guide to action so for me if that happens to me if I do something that I'm subsequently ashamed of or embarrassed by the signal for me there is how I want to use that information is I want to

[01:04:18] I want to repair the relationship if I feel like I've done any kind of damage and therefore it becomes a goad - very likely an apology and it's not an again given my view of freewill and it's interesting to just understand the psychology of this good you know as you know I think free will is an illusion I think there's just makes absolutely no sense to think that one could have done or should have done otherwise previous moment or at least thinking that isn't really thinking honestly about the past what it is is it's kind of an aspirational thinking which is in fact directed at the future it's like given what just happened I recognize that I'm not the person I want to be I'm the person who lost his mind when you know in this case my kid came into the room and interrupted me during a conference call I'm not satisfied being that person and this person is now in my past this person is very likely to show up again in the future what I want to do now is make that less likely and also I want to repair any damage I've done in this case an apology can really be healing I don't know if you have an experience of apologizing for for these kinds of missteps and feeling that that actually the the net result is is in fact even better than zero it's not just a matter of getting back to zero but you can actually get past zero to your in this case your child understands that you can get angry and it's okay and it's okay to express it and grown-ups can apologize and the kid can be empowered with their own judgement of when you were in the wrong I mean so like whenever I've found myself apologizing to this is more true of my older daughter than my younger cousin she's she's a barbarian she's she's completely clueless but my older you know it's like if she thinks I'm in the wrong and she's right that's a message I want her to be able to internalize right so like if I say or do something in a probe it makes her feel bad and I recognize that and then I subsequently apologized

[01:06:36] I want her to actually take the win of having been right and having to understood the situation her emotions were an appropriate guide to those previous moments what I want to communicate in making my apology is that I was absolutely wrong and my commitment to her is to not be that way again and if I'm that way again and she calls me on it I'm gonna see that again that I'm gonna see she was right it just seems like it's it's a healthy dialogue and again the the real toxicity in all of this is in the duration over which we're caught if this is all happening quickly it's fine if it's taking hours and days and weeks and months to sort out these problems well then you have a very unhappy life again it's not a matter of never feeling shame again it's just how long are you going to be stuck there and for me really the only tool is is mindfulness on that front yeah it which really comes back to the idea of anxiety fear can be constructive but for most of us they overstay their welcome yeah I would put shame and precisely that bucket because it's not it's a very toxic emotion but arguably the most toxic emotion but it's not that it's never appropriate I don't think you would want a mind that was incapable of shame incapable of shame I mean that is a the door to sociopathy is definitely left ajar there I mean even if you're there's some meditation masters and gurus who whose talents as meditators I really I can't doubt but whose careers have completely spiraled out of control and essentially self-immolated for precisely this reason I mean there's a kind of enlightened sociopathy certain people have acquired and shamelessness really is is the the master variable so far as I can tell it's like it there are people who have immense charisma and an immense sense of personal well-being based on how much contemplative practice they've done and they very easily it attracts students and set up organizations and begin teaching and the crucial piece is probably a doctrine that's easily found within Buddhism and other Eastern traditions that enshrines a kind of theocratic hierarchy which justifies misuse of power rather often but the shamelessness component of all of this it seems to me to be very very risky if nothing else I mean it is the it is the thing that is causing the downfall or has caused the downfall of many otherwise fairly impressive people yeah there's no doubt about that

[01:09:36] Sam what are you most optimistic about right now I mean I feel like you and I have been on the phone almost every other day for the past two weeks I think we were both I think independently frankly came to very similar conclusions probably three weeks ago that at the time seemed probably reactionary a lot of the time when we are talking we're sort of shaking our head and a little bit of frustration over a lack of perceived response is there something that you are more optimistic about today than you were three or four days ago optimism bias is not a bias I have in in much quantity but I have to think that there are certain errors of judgment that will become less common here I'm interested what had become very common in this prior age of the earth that existed as recently as three weeks to a month ago is a fairly systematic denigration of expertise the experts don't know anything what we need our reality TV show stars running the world and it's actually its friend it's not just on the right it's on the left I mean when you look at the anti-vaxxer will find new adherents in the coming months and years I mean perhaps I'm selling delusion short and it will but it just it should be just thrillingly obvious to everyone right now no matter what their commitment to the anti-vaccine that what everyone wants at this moment is a vaccine for coronavirus I mean this is just there's no how anyone could tumour on that point I just don't don't know and you're not hearing a lot from those people I feel like there's a certain style of imagining that we can do without science and real data and real knowledge and everyone with their humanities degrees can just criticize everything all the time and there's no difference between the people who are just making stuff up and people who can actually get things done in some conformity with the principles of physics chemistry and biology and reality as it is at large I feel like that that has to unravel to some degree and I'm hoping we can secure those games when this all blows over but again whether that's whether I'm truly optimistic about that or not I I don't know well actually I think that is actually that's a pretty optimistic thought actually I also like you don't don't know how what the half-life is on this pain and the realization that science is is important and there are a lot of unsexy things that we need a government to be able to do that are really convenient to forget about until you need them and you know that's the other species of myth that I think has been knocked down a peg or two or or entirely this just this there's a libertarian idea in several ways I consider myself a quasi-libertarian a majesty and so far as I think we should cede to the private sector everything that can be best accomplished there but it's just now painfully obvious that we need government to do certain crucial things and minimal government cannot be a sacred principle anymore we just we need to figure out what we need government for and we should shore it up as much as we need to on all of those fronts and pandemics are not something that we want a merely private piecemeal response to yeah this is the perfect example of how a public-private partnership is going to be essential there are absolutely parts of this that are going to be best addressed for future pandemics in the private sphere but there are things that just the natural owner to the risk is the government and and by the way it's not just federal it's local I mean I think that's the other thing we're seeing is this is as much a local issue as it is a national issue it's actually probably I think more a local issue frankly and therefore like I said it's really at the outset of the discussion it's more relevant to me how New York handles New

[01:13:58] York right now than what Washington tells New York and in the future I think that's one area where I think we will learn that lesson I think that's I'm optimistic that in the future cities will take on some more of that risk stratification and planning such that when we're waiting for the CDC to develop a test guess what we're not going to wait for the CDC to develop a test because we saw that that test was already developed in China two months earlier we're gonna procure the tests directly I mean little things like that so it's sort of the it is more of a

[01:14:34] Federalist view it's like let's kind of empower these let's decentralize some of these things as well yeah yeah I mean clearly we need to be more flexible certainly under duress like this that's one thing I'm not optimistic about but I just it's more aspirational and has the form of a prayer at this moment I just think we have to capture all the lessons we're learning as we go here I mean there's just so much that has gone wrong and in most cases it seems so unnecessary to have have screwed up and precisely the ways we have and so I just feel like I think I said this somewhere there should just be a Google Doc for this entire crisis that people are adding to and because it's it's yeah it's it's been amazing to witness me just the the apparent thinness of our institutions and just as you keep punching through layers of ineptitude what is gonna actually stop the problem it's been fascinating and unnerving to watch and also there's a layer of political controversy in a perpetual political controversy that has interacted so unhelpfully with this that you have an emergency and it's a health care emergency and now an economic emergency but there has been a political emergency running on top of this now for three years and it's distorting everything and people just have to learn to think apparently incompatible thoughts simultaneously because they're only seeming incompatible when you're a political dogmatist right so they I'll give you one example that keeps coming up Trump is showing a an aptitude for weaponizing this fray as the Chinese virus this is a bright shiny object that he's he's dangling in front of Democrats so that they can seize on it and castigate him as a xenophobe or a racist and thereby ignore all the other things he's done wrong which are far more deplorable and therefore politically actionable and worth campaigning on he's dangled this truly an oculus thing whether he's a xenophobe or a racist or not the reality is is that this virus did originate in China and it was born of absolutely bizarre and unacceptable cultural practices of eating bats and other wild species and housing them together still living so that they can brew up their various xeno virus cocktails and these are based on just patently insane beliefs about animal spirits and energies and traditional cures for whatever it is insomnia erectile dysfunction or anything else that people are trying to treat with

[01:17:32] Tiger bones and rhino horn and bats and I mean it's all colossal and colossal II dangerous and castigating the Chinese for it is not a sign of racism or colonialism or anything else it's self-preservation and so China has to be held responsible for these shitty traditions that it hasn't managed to purge and as undoubtedly it's not only

[01:18:01] China but it's certainly mainly China and on top of that they have an authoritarian government that tried to conceal the gravity of this outbreak and did effectively conceal it to some degree at least for some time and failed to give the world adequate warning in a way that in a collaborative way that we have to figure out how to achieve globally so Trump whatever he means by the Chinese virus he would be right to me in those two things and the world has to get its head straight visa the China on those two points so for the Democrats to just cry racism and xenophobia when he uses this phrase is to utterly miss the point and to be successfully gamed politically but of course what the

[01:18:50] Democrats are actually worried about is also obviously true and worth worrying about it's completely insane to absorb the facts I just put forward about China and on that basis be a xenophobe because first of all the virus is now global it emerged in China but now it's just as much in the Italian virus or the New

[01:19:13] York virus so it's everywhere all at once and also most Chinese people have zero responsibility for any of this because they're not running their authoritarian government and they're not eating bats and presumably most Chinese people are as horrified by bad eating as I am so racial animus makes absolutely no sense here Democrats are right to worry about that so you can hold these truths in buffer simultaneously and not be deranged by it but we don't have a policy or even a journalistic community frankly that is showing much aptitude for that so it's there the many needles like that that we increasingly have to thread and whether I'm hopeful we're gonna do that or not I don't know but it's just the imperative to do it it is coming to us hourly I am less hopeful on that one Sam

[01:20:07] I'm more hopeful on the hopefully the scientific community now has some of the ammunition it needs to make sure that we have the right type of vaccine program in the future again coronaviruses are a family of viruses they can be targeted with vaccines that can target both common and uncommon components to them in other words there are going to be pieces that are retained throughout them so you can have sort of antiviral therapies that might have efficacy against a family of them and then of course secondarily there are even vaccines that look like they might have efficacy against some of those common chains of the virus so if

[01:20:45] I'm gonna be optimistic about anything I just have to believe we're not going to emerge from this with our head in the sand about an approach to the next round of this which again not what people want to hear about today cuz that doesn't really address the situation at hand if I'm gonna close with one thing I'm optimistic about hmm definitely look before you give me any happy talk let me drive you further into the darkness what are the prospects in your view that a vaccine isn't really in the cards in the way that it you know it hasn't been for

[01:21:21] AIDS or some other viruses and it's just hard to create a vaccine for certain viruses and maybe even immunity herd immunity among born of those who have caught it and not been too harmed by it maybe that isn't even in the cards in the way that it doesn't appear to be for flew because it mutates so often I mean obviously we have a flu vaccine but we need a new one every year what if we get and what's the prospect that we're gonna get doubly unlucky here and it's just it's gonna be very hard to come up with a vaccine and even if we had one we'd have to have a new one every year so I do think it will be harder to vaccinate against this than it is something like polio or measles or smallpox but part of that's also technical it's the nature of the corona viruses they sort of behave a bit more like RSV viruses which to create enough immunity you have to create a larger exposure basically and the risk of the vaccine is higher so anytime you vaccinate somebody there's a risk that they get sick from the vaccine and the perfect vaccine would be the vaccine for which you get have no risk from the vaccine and you get perfect immunity obviously nothing is there so we now look at gradations of how close we get to that and my discussions with a couple of virologists and people in this space say we have to sort of caveat our optimism around how long it will take to make a vaccine for this and how safe it will be and this gets into the question of would you take a vaccine that had a 0.1% mortality I would be very difficult to make that case unless you're over I don't know what age you wouldn't even necessarily just say over seventy if you believe because even though the mortality over 70 once you have it is high you have to be multiplying that by the probability that you would contract it so it's going to really come down to the technical challenges of making this vaccine safely and again for a bunch of technical reasons that I don't actually understand completely this mirrors the type of virus for which vaccines have historically not been a great alternative because of the risk reward trade-off so ironically everything I just said it but the anti-vaxxer because there will be legitimate concerns that this vaccine perhaps could be more dangerous than your usual vaccine that is well I think it's a different argument so I think the anti-vaxxer gyu meant is the fear of unknowns like vaccines cause autism and like that here large clinical trials will give you very clear safety profiles it's like look and I'm making observe point one percent like for effect right

[01:24:05] I can't imagine it could be that high but 0.1% of people get really really sick for two weeks and 0.001 percent of people require hospitalization and 0.0001 percent of people die I mean if you knew that well then that's a very legitimate discussion whether you're Pro vaccine or anti vaccine I mean that is the type of discussion we need to have around vaccines the discussion we don't need to have around vaccines is let's go back to one stupid paper written by some guy who completely falsified data the paper was retracted the guy has been disbarred from ever writing another paper in the history of his life but a couple of knuckleheads celebrity idiots pick up on it and turn it into an entire message that is completely false I mean those are different statements I consider myself who is in favor of vaccine but also thoughtful about they absolutely pose risk there's nothing that doesn't pose a risk so anyway that's a whole other topic actually but just to illuminate that and that's another example of being able to thread the needle on a very difficult to discuss but important topic and very few people can do it so if you are worried about the social consequences another consequence to public health of the anti-vaccine a doctor say anything about the legitimate risk of vaccines as a medical intervention but of course almost anything we do to our bodies poses some risk I mean you know taking ibuprofen poses some risk of actual death so we have to be able to acknowledge these things I mean people know when we're lying to them so as you point out we need a more sophisticated conversation about risk and what is acceptable there you know it's kind of the micro mortality points we are willing to accrue given the benefits proffered benefits of doing anything whether it's skiing or getting on an airplane or getting vaccinated and we owe it to ourselves to be able to have the sophisticated version of that conversation in public as opposed to just hammering one side of the ideology space and denigrating the other there are often right answers even when there's probabilistic uncertainty in any individual case they're prudent things to do and they're idiotic things to do and we can make those judgments even when some percentage of people have a very bad experience doing whatever it is skiing getting vaccinated or anything else that has a nonzero risk of bad outcome that's absolutely right there is a reincarnation which I don't believe in but if there is and I get to come back for another ride I want to dedicate my life to teaching risk management to people like I would love to sort of make a career out of coming up with ways and tools to help people think through what we're talking about now because I think it is such an essential way to go through life and appreciate the nuance and uncertainty that is much more present than we are led to believe yeah we also just have to acknowledge that the answers on paper I mean the probability of death or injury in one circumstance may not actually seem better or worse or rationally what we know it to be because of some you know superficial differences in the situation that just we can't emotionally correct for I mean some things just seem sketchier than other things even if on paper they're not and some aspects of human psychology here that we have to figure out how to navigate around and I think we do that we have to do that at the level of public policy I mean the public policy really does have to be driven by statistics and what what is known for large groups of people to bear out in terms of risk of injury and death and yeah and then people are still afraid to get on an airplane just because they're afraid to fly and they're never afraid to drive let the people who are doing policy acknowledge how much more dangerous our roads are than our skies are but there are some ways in which we have to triangulate around human psychology to get right answers made actionable yeah Sam I love that I get to call you up and bug you every day and yeah likewise I'm glad we were able to have a conversation today that we can share with everybody I I hope it's helpful I know at this point information overload is a problem and I think what I appreciated about the discussion we had today it was really less about information and new information and frankly maybe more about how one can process it think about it and hopefully not over react to it but react enough to it yeah and I suspect we'll have something different to say a week from now and maybe we might have to hop back on a call and revisit anything we've learned yeah let's just pledge to do that I mean we get to a point where several other shoes have dropped and and the story has changed in some material way let's do a round two and not so much for what I have to bring to it I have a feeling my story isn't going to change very much but yours I think will on the on the medical front so I
