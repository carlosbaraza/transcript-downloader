This clip is from episode 355 – Skincare strategies, the science of facial aging, and cosmetic-intervention guidance | Tanuj Nakra, M.D. & Suzan Obagi, M.D.

In this clip, they discuss:

- The 4 Types of Facial Aging – Skin, volume, gravity, and bone structure all play roles in how the face changes over time
- First Impressions Start Instantly – Aesthetic surgeons often assess facial anatomy, symmetry, and movement within seconds of meeting a patient
- Understanding Patient Psychology – Many patients don’t know how to articulate what they want, so doctors must interpret both words and emotions
-  Red Flags Before Treatment – Surgeons often screen for emotional distress or recent trauma before deciding if it's the right time for intervention
- The 5 R’s of Rejuvenation – Relax overactive muscles, refill lost volume, resurface the skin, redrape sagging areas, and renew consistently
- Home Care Matters More Than You Think – Strategic skincare at home reduces the need for more aggressive in-office treatments
