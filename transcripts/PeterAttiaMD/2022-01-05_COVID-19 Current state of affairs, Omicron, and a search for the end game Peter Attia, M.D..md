In this episode, Peter sits down with Drs. Marty Makary and Zubin Damania (aka ZDoggMD), both previous guests on The Drive. Marty is a Johns Hopkins professor and public health researcher and ZDoggMD is a UCSF Stanford trained internist and the founder of Turntable Health. This episode, recorded on December 27, 2021, was in part inspired by some of the shoddy science and even worse messaging coming from top officials regarding COVID-19. 

In this discussion, Marty and ZDoggMD discuss what is known about the omicron variant, the risks and benefits of vaccines for all age groups, and the taboo subject of natural immunity and the protection it offers against infection and severe disease. Furthermore, they discuss at length the poor messaging coming from our public officials, the justification (and lack thereof) for certain mandates and policies in light of the current evidence, and the problems caused by the highly politicized and polarized nature of the subject. Themes throughout the conversation include the difference between science and advocacy, the messaging which is sowing mistrust in science despite major progress, and a search for what a possible “end” to this situation might look like. 

NOTE: Since this episode was recorded over the holiday and published ASAP, this is an audio-only episode with limited show notes.

00:39:00 - The difference between science and advocacy
00:46:00 - Natural immunity from COVID after infection 
00:57:15 - The unfortunate erosion of trust in science despite impressive progress 
01:02:30 - Do the current mandates and policies make sense in light of existing data?
01:18:15 - Risks associated with vaccines, and the risk of being labeled an anti-vaxxer when questioning them
01:26:15 - Data on incidence of myocarditis after vaccination with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines 
01:35:00 - Outstanding questions about myocarditis as a side effect of mRNA vaccination and the benefit of boosters
01:40:30 - The risk-reward of boosters and recommendations being ignored by policy makers in the US

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the podcast episode:

**Executive Summary**:
This episode features a discussion between Dr. Peter Attia, Dr. Marty Machary, and Dr. Zubin Damania (ZDoggMD) about COVID-19, focusing on Omicron, vaccines, natural immunity, and policy decisions. The conversation explores the balance between science and advocacy, while examining current data and potential future implications of various policy decisions.

**Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Omicron shows 90% less efficiency in infecting lung cells compared to previous variants [00:15:00]
- Natural immunity appears to provide strong protection, with T-cell immunity remaining solid against Omicron [00:25:00]
- Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic COVID drops to 35-45% within 10 weeks after booster [00:45:00]
- Myocarditis risk in young males after mRNA vaccines is approximately 1 in 7,000 [01:15:00]

**Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Consider individual risk factors when making vaccination decisions [01:20:00]
- Focus on metabolic health and vitamin D levels [01:30:00]

Context-specific recommendations:
- For older adults (65+): Consider boosters if no prior infection [01:45:00]
- For young healthy individuals: Weigh risks and benefits of boosters carefully [01:50:00]

**Notable Quotes**:
"We've moved to a second pandemic after COVID-19, which is a pandemic of lunacy" - Dr. Marty Machary [01:55:00]

"Strong convictions loosely held" - Discussion principle mentioned regarding scientific thinking [02:30:00]

**Follow-up Questions**:
1. Long-term impacts of school closures and mask mandates on children's development
2. Optimal timing between vaccine doses
3. Role of T-cell immunity in long-term protection
4. Impact of current policies on future pandemic response

[00:00:01] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia this podcast my website and my weekly newsletter all focus on the goal of translating the science of longevity into something accessible for everyone our goal is to provide the best content in health and wellness full stop and we've assembled a great team of analysts to make this happen if you enjoy this podcast we've created a membership program that brings you far more in-depth content if you want to take your knowledge of this space to the next level at the end of this episode i'll explain what those benefits are or if you want to learn more now head over to peteratiamd.com forward slash subscribe now without further delay here's today's episode welcome to this week's episode of the drive this week we have two guests simultaneously being interviewed something i don't do often my guests this week are dr marty machary and dr zubin damania aka z dog md both of these are close friends of mine who have also both been previous guests now i wanted to have marty and zdogg back on to talk about covid which is not something i've done a podcast on in some time in fact when i did my last podcast on cove but i really thought that was kind of the end of it and i was sort of done talking about covid publicly i would obviously continue to stay as up to speed as necessary on all things relevant to my patients but i really was kind of done with talking about covet policy and things like that but you know truthfully in the past i would say month i've become a little bit frustrated with what i've seen around kind of shoddy science and even worse messaging around covet so i thought it was time to revisit this so this episode we talk about a bunch of things we talk obviously about omicron and what's known and understand that these podcasts are always dated right so the date of the recording of this podcast was monday december 27th and by the time this podcast is out it's already been a week three months from now we'll know things we don't know today that's just the nature of things but nevertheless we talk about what is known today about omicron we talk about what we understand about vaccine both benefits and risk focusing on the mrna vaccines here and specifically looking at the differences between pfizer and moderna especially in the subset of young people and further stratifying that by gender we also talk about natural immunity something that seems to be a very taboo subject matter but it's a very important thing to discuss let's spend a lot of time trying to explore the what is the endgame here what is it that we're hoping to achieve from a policy perspective to get to living in a world that looks more like it did in 2019 is that even going to be possible what is the difference between a pandemic and an endemic so this is a very conversational interaction it's partly an interview but really in the end it kind of just a discussion between the three of us just by briefly a background marty is a johns hopkins professor and public health researcher he's served on the faculty of hopkins at the school of public health for the past 16 years and served in leadership at the who he's a member of the national academy of medicine and serves as the editor-in-chief of the second largest trade publication in medicine called medpage today he also writes for the washington post the new york times and the wall street journal zdogg is a ucsf stanford trained internist and the founder of turntable health he's also the host of a very popular podcast z-dog md podcast as well as the co-host of an excellent podcast called the vp zd show and that's with vinai prasad who by the way has also been a guest on this podcast and we reference venae here in fact i would have loved to have had vani on this podcast as well other than the fact that it would have been pretty cumbersome to have four people on a podcast final thing to note here is that because we recorded this on december 27th with the aspiration of getting this out as quickly as possible our video team was not in town so we did not do this on video and we don't really have the staff this week to put out show notes so we're doing this to be as quick as possible and responsive as possible to some of the questions that many of you i suspect are asking so i hope you'll accept our apology that this will be an audio only podcast and there won't be show notes beyond just a number of references so without further delay i hope you enjoy my conversation with marty macri and zubin [Music] marty so awesome to be sitting here with both of you as you know not a topic i have been spending much time on certainly publicly obviously anyone who's taking care of patients has to be paying attention to what's relevant to them so that's permitted me the luxury i think of being able to offer my opinions to patients my interpretations but i did feel a need to go a little bit deeper in the in the past few weeks and thought i'd reach out to you guys and we could do this as a discussion because you guys have been spending a heck of a lot more time on this than i have and in the last five days i've been drowning in this substance luckily i have wonderful analysts who have been able to organize information for me but anyway let's uh let's just start with helping me understand and the listeners understand kind of what we know and don't know and one of the ideas that we had talked about at the outset which i think you guys agreed was a was a a good thing that we can try is for the listeners helping people differentiate between what we believe is fact or when what is knowable and then what is opinion because i think we're going to very easily go back and forth between those two and i think people expect that right on some level people want to hear our opinions but i think they also want to know when that's separated from fact so hopefully between the three of us we can always kind of remember which of those pillars we're playing in but what i'd like to do is kind of start with some basic questions for you guys so we're recording this on what is it the 27th right and obviously a lot of what we're talking about is in flux part of what's prompting this is omicron being a new surge what do we know about this virus this particular mutation and how it differs from delta and do we want to call the original one alpha or og or what what do you what do you guys call that first of all great to be with you peter and great to see you again here zubin so i think we can compare omicron to delta because delta represents sort of the worst of the previous strains and now we've got some pretty good laboratory data that tells us that omicron is not infecting lung cells neither lung individual cells or what we call organoids in a lab which is a cluster of similar tissue types at the same efficiency it's about 90 percent less efficient in replicating in those lung cells so we've got laboratory data now confirmed by three independent labs that it's not infecting those cells as well that's why we're not seeing the cough and the severe disease and the systemic illness like fever as frequently with omicron we're seeing more of the upper respiratory stuff the nares the bronchus symptoms and by virtue of that you're going to blow it off more and maybe that's one of the drivers of it being more contagious but we've got the laboratory data we've got epidemiological data looking at south africa looking at the numbers down now over 35 percent off their peaks i've got a shorter length of stay there observed about two and a half days versus eight days hospitals were not overrun in a country with you could argue semi-limited resources and we've got bedside observation so we've got epidemiological data laboratory data and bedside data that all fits that it is in fact no longer an open question this is a more mild virus and i guess one of the questions that i have around the mildness of the virus because there is also that i think it's that hong kong data that you're pointing at that you have a lot of upper airway replication you know some multi-fold over the the og strain and delta but this idea that it's a milder clinical syndrome is a little complicated by the fact that in south africa you have a lot of a high sero prevalence of previous infection and so the question is how much of this is we have now a degree of natural immunity and some vaccine immunity in south africa and what you're seeing is a virus that's more replicatable maybe a little less pathogenic maybe a little less disease but in the setting of a much more immune population because if you're looking at the kind of the three precepts of a pandemic it's a very transmissible virus that causes a lot of disease that we don't have great immunity for so those three things and it looks like with omicron we have a very transmissible virus that may cause milder disease that we have quite a bit of immunity to already and and so all those things may collude to make this less of a problem than delta in terms of what we care about which are actual outcomes i mean at the risk of asking maybe a naive question is it still reasonable to say that this is absolutely a covid variant or at some point will mutations of the og strain a la the delta lineage get so far away from those strains presumably in terms of virulence as one metric that we really ought to be thinking of them more as coronaviruses and not necessarily covet 19. where would that line be look i think that is the ultimate question is kovid going to be the fifth seasonal coronavirus as i know you and amisha dolce had postulated early in this pandemic there you know as a reminder to those listening four coronaviruses that circulate year to year that account for about 25 of the cases the common cold this may be the fifth and it may be in this version now the russian flu which was 1889 to 18 1891 many are now postulating that that was a horrible pandemic of a flu season preceding the spanish flu and that may have very well been a coronavirus that turned into one of those four seasonal coronaviruses that we live with today so we may have essentially a fossil of a previous pandemic that mutated to a seasonal mild coronavirus and it may be in fact one of those four existing viruses yeah i think this dividing line is interesting right because it really is at what point do we decide that's the case because you know a seasonal cold can actually kill somebody who's medically fragile with comorbidities we see it every winter as hospitalists we admit it's an impending sense of doom it's like winter is coming every time in october we know that just standard flu standard seasonal cold the coronavirus stuff that we already have the adenoviruses even rsv in adults can cause a very nasty syndrome if you have a lot of comorbidities and it fills up our hospitals because the hospitals operate at capacity so at what point is where we are now considered very different from that and that's a really operative question another interesting question and again we're clearly now in the editorial phase but we'll again we'll come back to some data later but if you were thinking about this through the lens of evolution omicron would be by far the best of the three so far like if you're putting your virus hat on and you're saying what's in the virus's best interest you have the perfect virus it is highly communicative and not lethal and in fact like the worst viruses are the ones that are a little harder to spread and kill their hosts so is there any evolutionary argument to suggest that it's we would expect this to be the evolution of the virus that it's as it gets more evolutionarily fit it should be killing people less and it should be spreading more it seems that that makes evolutionary sense on many levels and actually if you compare it to sars the og the sars one sars one seemed to have a little higher case fatality rate affected a different swatch of people but it the way that it spread you could detect it symptomatically when it was contagious and when you were asymptomatic you weren't contagious so we were able actually to stop that virus through behavior restrictions testing of for people with what we consider now to be hygiene theater pointing a and this is editorializing pointing a temperature gun at somebody's head back then may actually have worked with that but if you look at then the success of the virus that wasn't a very successful evolutionary virus whereas this one oh boy spreads when it's asymptomatic causes severe disease just in typically more vulnerable people but but there's so many people that are vulnerable that you end up causing a pandemic level of drama but as you start to evolve it to omicron where man it spreads so fast that everybody pretty much has a date with you know omicron at some point but it causes less severe disease we think based on the data that marty's citing and emerging information well that's a very successful virus and that virus gets rewarded by being part of the pantheon of our seasonal biome that affects us every year and i think it would be very unsurprising if that's the mo of evolution in this case i like the temperature gun reference for some reason those temperature guns scare me as much as they but but um you know it may be that omicron is nature's vaccine it is far more mild and for the 93 of the population living in poor countries in the world they don't have access to a vaccine right now and it's going to be very difficult so a lot of people out there are going to get vaccinated essentially by getting omicron and like it's ideal to get the vaccine over getting the infection but it may be sort of a silver lining of this variant and it may be how a pandemic ends we do know from a johns hopkins study that's now on the preprint server that your t-cell immunity which is the most under-recognized part of the immune system in the entire covet discussion that is still solid against omicron just as it was against delta that the crossover is very high and that if you get omicron you've got t cell immunity to delta and vice versa that's now pretty can i jump in here on something because i'm glad you brought this up marty and i i suspect both of you will have a lot to say on this everybody's heard the expression what gets measured gets managed what we can measure we tend to fixate on and unfortunately when it comes to measuring immune strength we really have one tool in the toolkit which is to measure circulating antibodies which are not the same as neutralizing antibodies which are part of the you know b cell immunity and then you have this other thing that you've alluded to marty called t cell immunity i don't think we need to go into it in great detail i did a podcast with steve rosenberg that was cancer focused but we had a totally in-depth discussion on b-cell versus t-cell immunity so we'll we'll we'll send people there if they want the primer on it but the upshot is we don't have a laboratory test to measure t-cell immunity we don't even have a commonly available test to measure neutralizing antibodies we just measure circulating antibodies so we can't really even measure what memory b cells are doing do you think that's a little part of the problem here in that we're kind of flying blind and making a lot of assertions about immunity based on arguably the least important thing that you could measure and again i'm editorializing in my question a little bit but but what do you guys think of that or push back on that if you think that we're undervaluing circulating antibodies i definitely think that we are undervaluing circulating antibodies and cellular immunity as a broad group that is the memory b cells memory t cells listen to our public health officials from day one they talk about the antibody levels jump up and then we see them go down and then initially there was a fear of reinfection well we didn't see it clinically at the bedside then when the vaccines came early on they said you know you really have to get that second dose because look at the antibody levels just go up tenfold of what they go up after the first dose well that's good but it's good for activating your memory b cells and memory t cells it's good for the cellular immunity antibodies come and go that's in the textbooks right they linger for months in the system and then they they wane and by having this in intense fixation on only one aspect of the immune system and that is antibody titers what we have done is we've created a scenario where we're chasing our tail to keep those levels high because when they're higher you're less likely to test positive so what we have created that we've created this expectation that the vaccine is somehow failing now when you test positive even though that cellular immunity is still strong in preventing severe illness and it creates an almost a cascade of surrogate markers that don't really measure what we're directly interested in right because if you have the surrogate marker of okay neutralizing antibodies then that's trying to treat a surrogate marker of cases pcr-positive cases but what do we really care about we care about people in the hospital filling up the hospital sick dying maybe we can say long covet is in that question mark of things we care about and so how do we really look at that i think what peter's question really points out is do we have good measurement criteria to look at are we actually immune against severe disease which is that sort of innate memory response that as antibodies weighing you still are able to mount this which means hey you're still going to get cold and flu symptoms you're still going to potentially be infectious during that period but it's not going to settle into cytokines storm ards and being prone in a icu ready to die and that's what we care about i agree i don't you know we talk about things like t cell detect which i actually don't know much about it's one of these you know commercially available tests i don't know if marty knows more about it but i really don't think we have good outpatient commercially available tests outside of research that measure these things i mean in the study that we're and i'm not really that involved i mean i was involved in some of the planning of it but there's a study that's going on at the university of indiana right now and it's specifically looking at long-term b-cell and t-cell immunity and in speaking with the investigators there i mean the assays to measure that degree of function are quite complicated i mean these are not things that are amenable to commercial testing with any rigor so i i do feel pretty confident in saying that we don't really have the tools to measure those things and and i forget who i heard say this but i'm paraphrasing somebody they said measuring circulating antibodies and saying you know everything about a person's immunity is sort of like looking in a person's bank account and saying you know everything about their net worth it's probably correlated right but you know especially with a wealthy person like the their checking account is really not representative of their net worth you know their checking account probably doesn't have zero dollars in it they're probably not overdrafted but it's unlikely that a billionaire is going to have hundreds of millions of dollars sitting in a checking account so i think that's sort of to your point both of you i think created a series of metrics that are problematic especially when i haven't heard a clear articulation of what the end game is right so this is now a macro question right which is i had to go out somewhere today and it's actually pretty unusual for austin because austin really doesn't care about masks or anything like that but i was surprised i went in and the woman said you know she took my temperature and so i got the temperature gun in the face and then she said oh you know we're we're wearing masks so she handed me a mask and you know i don't i don't argue with people over that kind of stuff because i feel like it's this is just that's her pay grade right like that's her job to tell me that fine where i'm asking whatever but i keep thinking like well what's the end game here is the implication because if you're making me wear a mask now shouldn't it be implied that you're going to make me wear a mask forever because how do you extract yourself or walk back from this position of temperature gun mask you know etc so when it comes to what is the end game what can we all agree is a reasonable line in the sand beyond which the world goes back to 2019 i'm having a hard time understanding that so so what do you guys understand with respect to that you know if from my end so much of it peter is an emergent property if how we're measuring stuff it's actually the question that you asked in the beginning it's like if we care about cases and neutralizing antibody levels then it's going to be an infinite number of boosters and masking into perpetuity and even though the data is very questionable on all this stuff we keep doing it this is a policy question how do we want to be in the world how do we want to live our lives what's the difference quantitatively and qualitatively between 2019 before we had this pandemic but we would have severe flus that would overwhelm hospitals in the fall and certain places would go on divert and we've all worked you know i've worked in those facilities when that happens it sucks every medical person grinds their teeth and gnashes everything but we get through it and we don't disrupt society we certainly don't close schools we don't inflict masking on the public because we would never think to do that as a policy so this is really a policy question how do we want to be in the world and i think that's where all the division that's been sown on social media through mainstream media alternative media you know all this disinformation misinformation i don't even know what that even means anymore has created an environment where we're so atomized by tribe that even the policy questions become tribal identifiers so we need to kind of really see that clearly from a perspective of a more holistic you know integral perspective where we can go okay this is what's happening all right well what do we really care about we care about people not dying not filling up hospitals and we care about our economy working because health actually is correlated to wealth which is correlated to longevity i mean these these are things that are clear socioeconomic status education matters for that so these this is how we have to look at policy not a reductionist how many cases can we prevent and i think there's political stuff here that happens and and it just becomes a complicated mess can you imagine um guys if we tested for influenza every flu season when say four years ago we had 41 million flu cases in a matter of a couple months can you imagine if we graft on a daily basis the number of newly diagnosed flu cases and we'd create mass hysteria now it doesn't mean we blow off flu or we don't take it seriously or we don't tell people some reasonable strategies like if you're around someone vulnerable be careful if you think you've been exposed wear a mask if you have symptoms stay home i mean that's kind of how we live with the respiratory pathogen 10 to 25 percent of the population will get infected with a respiratory pathogen every year in perpetuity because there's a whole bunch of them there's rhinovirus and econovirus and influenza and para influenza and the four coronaviruses we talked about if a parent brought their kid in say for their newborn evaluation the first pediatrics visit and the pediatrician said your child will develop five to seven pediatric respiratory infections during their childhood i mean you could you could blow that up into you know a headline but the reality is this is we're not going to eradicate pathogens from planet earth real quick peter you mentioned something about we're talking about the antibody titers and sort of chasing our tail this just came out a day before christmas from britain from the uk now this is from the uk security agency they're pulling the data they've got great data so the vaccines as they have had them with the primary series are 70 effective against symptomatic covid 10 weeks after a booster it goes down to 35 for pfizer and 45 for moderna so within 10 weeks you're seeing even the booster wear off against your ability to test positive or have a symptomatic case but those memory b cells and t cells are still working the cellular immunity is still protecting against severe illness so if we keep chasing antibody titers you might be getting a booster every first monday of every month when you show up at work and it still won't work i was thinking about something this morning guys that i i thought could help us kind of anchor a little bit into the evolution that we've undoubtedly all experienced so if i think back to march of 2020 i actually pulled my kids out of school about two weeks before the lockdown so before two people you know two weeks before this got kind of insane i was like you know what i don't know anything about this virus i don't like what i'm seeing outside of the united states we're going to keep our kids home oh my daughter was furious how could you do this to me blah blah blah so i look back at that and i think that was the wrong thing to do because it didn't matter but i didn't know better and i think it was a reasonable precaution in the absence of any information right like if this turned out to be as bad as sars one meaning it was as as lethal as sars one but as infectious as sars ii would have been a good thing to do turned out it was overkill so i was thinking about like how many times has my view of this problem changed and the answer is many and i think part of it comes down to a framework around what tools do we have at our exposure at our disposal and what knowledge do we have about how to reduce morbidity and mortality for covid and i was thinking about this because the first time i delineated this was in the spring of 2020 and now when i do it today so so tell me if you guys would add to or subtract from this so i break it into three broad categories the first is preventing infections the second is treating infections and the third is providing supportive care for people who end up in hospitals in the preventing infections you have two things basically vaccines and behaviors in the treating infections you would have existing drugs versus new drugs and then supportive care so back in the spring of 2020 we had no vaccines we had behaviors but we didn't know which ones were right versus wrong being indoors being outdoors wearing this type of mask that type of mask you know we didn't know anything stands six feet apart sand 16 feet apart i mean it was just a whole bunch of made-up stuff on the treating infection side we obviously had no new drugs but we had a whole bunch of existing drugs and drugs and there was a whole slew of ideas around well would this drug work what about remember remdissever we talked about that so much and then of course you had half these drugs became totally politicized et cetera and then in the supportive care side of things we didn't know anything right it was like is this a rds should you be oxygenating the bejesus out of people steroids must be horrible i mean we really knew nothing you have a whole bunch of empirical insights and when you consider where we are today on that front i mean i just kind of jotted out a bunch of ideas it's kind of amazing that in less than two years we have multiple vaccines with pretty clear ideas about which behaviors reduce the spread of infection and which don't on the treatment side we have a pretty good sense of at least one existing drug that works which is fluvoxamine we can discuss if there are others and we've got at least two new drugs that seem quite promising i'm more familiar with the pfizer data than the merck data and you know you guys can probably speak much more to the the therapy side right the supportive care side but it seems to me that icu doctors and nurses have a way better sense of what to do today than they did a year ago let alone 18 months ago anything you guys would add to that framework because i i think it's important to differentiate between what the world looked like in the spring of 2020 with respect to those data points or those you know those parameters versus what it looks like today so would you expand or subtract on that i can say a couple things here that's a really good framework it's interesting because in the prevention framework you could also throw in hey you know what about things like vitamin d treating metabolic syndrome diet exercise those kind of things which are a little softer lifestyle but no i like it i like it yeah like lifestyle modification which i remember in the early days you were talking about things that you did uh things i i did too were were because i said uh this is more like og sars than what because we didn't know what the if the infection fatality rate was i was sitting there exercising like a lunatic and i stopped drinking alcohol and i did all these personal things to try to improve my metabolic condition so that's a piece of it and then there's a question of chemo prophylaxis you know some have been these politicized drugs they've been advocating that they're more prophylactic as well you could take it you know ivermectin once a week and prevent this way i mean it's worth exploring i don't think there's data that we have but your your comment that this has evolved so quickly is absolutely a beautiful vindication of the scientific process when it's allowed to unfold people i think people who've politicized this a lot on both sides say oh nothing's you know doctors aren't really trying to do anything to treat this we haven't really learned anything no the opposite is true multiple good vaccines things like dexamethasone in the hospital that have really improved mortality and we've actually thrown out things that don't work which is actually just as important because those things can actually cause harm so the question of hydroxychloroquine for example you know in ionidis is meta-analysis showing that maybe we actually cost lives by giving that much hydroxychloroquine these are things we need to actually really dive into and it comes down to this peter like let's say the ifr this is how i think about it if infection fatality rate let's say it's you know 0.2.3 somewhere in that range which seems reasonable although we don't have the exact data how many people in the u.s are roughly at risk then of dying based on the population of the u.s and the ifr of the disease and i did a back of the napkin calculation a few months ago that was roughly about 1.4 million americans if that thing was the actual ifr of the disease if we didn't do anything that's at the current state of the ifr that's how many people would die we're at what eight hundred thousand so the q the question is will we get to 1.4 or will it not reach 1.4 and if it doesn't what of those three buckets what i mean what what did we do to actually improve that and i suspect it's a mix of vaccines therapeutics in hospital lowering ifr by improving hospital care and some behavioral stuff like maybe avoiding big crowds when something's surging something like that but i but that's kind of my current thinking on it is you know the goal is get that down from 1.4 million as much as we can without destroying the fabric of society which will actually push it back up towards 1.4 through ancillary damage in terms of substance abuse overdoses mental health problems suicide that kind of thing yes it's amazing what we have in our toolbox how far we've come scientific innovation to me what's almost equally amazing is how we've not incorporated many of these new therapeutics into common practice and that is probably a glimpse as to what's broken with our broader healthcare system the average 17-year lag for new evidence to get broadly adopted into practice and we're seeing that play out now now maybe it's truncated maybe it's a three year lag but it's too slow for a health emergency yes it's amazing how how much we've learned but it's also amazing how we still have doctors telling folks oh you have coveted tough it out stay at home you know what we should be telling them in order based on evidence a list of things and in no specific order fluvoxamine reduces mortality by 91 percent budesinite a steroid inhaler markedly reduces hospitalization vitamin d has been found to be correlated with severity of illness in a german study in hospitalized patients hypertonic saline is an age-old treatment that's been used to sort of rinse out the navel nasal cavity and it's been used by doctors for a long time with many viruses and you've got all of these things that are not being adopted broadly and to me we are still suffering from significant group think we've been burned badly with group thinking medicine throughout this pandemic in the failure to warn about it in the surface transmission idea in the draconian and barbaric practice that doctors and hospitals were complicit in to ban people from visiting their loved ones to say goodbye closing public schools ironically with a less contagious strain out there ignoring natural immunity not talking about fluvoxamine i just saw another white house briefing we've never once heard our public health officials talk about it the group thinking not spacing out the doses maybe we wouldn't be talking about boosters as vigorously if we would have spaced out the first two doses as we should have by the way i want to make a comment on that when the vaccine started rolling out i spoke with three immunologists virologists so and these i won't name who they are just for the sake of protecting their identity but i mean i explicitly talked to them about this and i said why the four weeks between first and second shot that seems at odds with the little bit that i know about the immune system they said there's not a single reason to do that other than they probably did the trial that way for the sake of speed but they said if you can drag your feet as much as possible between those doses do so and i was like well do you think it's worth saying that and they're like no don't like not gonna say that just just you know drag your feet as much as you can show up three months later saying you forgot to get your second shot kind of thing so yeah there's a little bit of this going on by the way i do want to go back to one thing you said marty that that i have generally found the evidence to not be favorable which is vitamin d at least supplemental vitamin d so because my patients ask me about this all the time i've said look don't confuse your vitamin d level that you acquired being in the sun playing sports outside with the vitamin d level that you can get by taking 4000 5000 iu of vitamin d i don't think those are the same i think vitamin d might be a surrogate for health through other means did this study that you're citing specifically look at outcomes being improved with supplemental vitamin d or did it simply associate or note the association of higher levels of vitamin d and better outcomes the latter so out of all the things i mentioned that has the weakest evidence that was sort of a retrospective review of hospitalized patients just looking at their levels and they found some correlation but it doesn't imply causation necessarily all the other stuff has randomized controlled trial data behind it the vitamin d thing was a retrospective review yeah so my take on that has been and my practice has been not to prescribe vitamin d and instead to get outside and exercise in the sun and get it that way zubin do you have a take on any of those yeah that was my take on the vitamin d piece too is there's a correlation causation situation there there is definitely something going on with naturally acquired vitamin d that seems at least in a correlative way protective one thing that i think is interesting so fluvoxamine again i think when you've been through the hydroxychloroquine ivermectin mill there the group thing starts to shift and go therapeutics just simply don't work especially if they're repurposed drugs there is a lot of groupthink in medicine and people are then uninclined to look at these pieces the other interesting thing about this particular pandemic that makes it tough marty is that you know 99.6 or whatever of people are going to get better no matter what in other words staying home and doing nothing they're probably going to be just fine and so it becomes this question of how do we do we tell the whole world to take you know budesonide and fluvoxamine and all of that the minute they get sick like omicron it's going to infect everyone and i'm getting tons of emails hey i have cold symptoms i'm at home should i go get monoclonal antibodies should i you know because peter has his defined patients i have like millions of patients who email me and i keep telling them i'm not your doctor but what i always say is you know look you have to look at your risk factors you have to look at your age you have to look at where you infected previously how did you do with that there's so many intricacies whereas it would be nice to say you know what if you're if you have these symptoms here are low-risk high-yield things we can do and i don't know marty do you think some of those things on your list are applicable to say anyone who gets coveted or would you risk stratify well we've got a risk stratified because one it's it's just overkill somebody who's young and healthy the german data just came out that between the ages of 5 and 17 not a single healthy person died pre-vaccine so when you've got someone vaccinated it's probably a indicator of overuse if we're using some big guns in that population and you know i made a comment about doctors being slow to adopt some of this stuff and i just want to be clear we have put doctors in a terrible situation in the united states we've put them in a very bad situation by putting them on the front lines of this pandemic without any good data for a long time when this pandemic happened it hit this country and every single person all of our friends and everybody and everybody who emailed you zubin and by the way sorry for telling people who email me just to email you maybe i'll thanks telling them yeah you know if it just pay me a nickel every time that happens and then as peter says if you do if you do a wallet biopsy of my bank account i'll have like at least a dime in there it'll be great but we were all getting the questions how does it spread do masks work how long are you contagious for can you spread it pre-symptomatic all the basic questions of kovid we did not have answers because our gigantic 4.2 trillion dollar health care system could not do the basic bedside clinical research i remember peter was even doing a quick video about somebody please do this study we were all saying the same thing labs were mostly closed because there was no ppe the nih was unable to pivot their 42 billion dollars to answer these questions quickly so what we did is we had a vacuum of scientific research and all the doctors were on the front lines without any data to really answer these questions and that's when the group think began and guess what ended up filling that vacuum political opinions so we just did this study of nih research funding last year less than five percent went to covet research three months into the pandemic 0.05 percent of the nih's budget went to covet research the average time for them to give a grant was five months to fund a research team to then start the research 257 grants on social disparities with covid an important topic but only four on how it spreads and one on masks which hasn't even read out yet so the most basic questions doctors needed evidence for that was not being conducted i want to go back to something that you guys have both now alluded to and i talked about this a little bit on the podcast with rogan and i think it's worth mentioning again because it's a fundamental issue that i think we're going to talk about many times this afternoon david allison and i had a discussion a couple months ago and and he put this very eloquently and i it's something we all understand but i think i like the way he phrased it right which was always know the difference between science and advocacy and as we explain these differences now i think people will inherently understand it but and again we're now talking in the realm of opinion my opinion is perhaps the greatest disservice that has come out of this has been that that line has been so blurred to be non-existent so science is messy science is uncertain science speaks in probabilities and science constantly changes in the face of new information right so science is a process not a thing right science says this is what we know today with this degree of certainty as new information becomes available the new truth will be this so truth is not a constant within science right truth we hopefully converges on greater certainty and so when scientists speak it doesn't really sound that reassuring i mean you know we know this because we interact with scientists a lot they never give you a straight answer because if they're doing their jobs honestly they rare you know outside of really well-known phenomenon we we have to speak in uncertainty i think for understandable reasons advocates can't do that they don't have that luxury right if you're if you're a public health advocate your job is to communicate something with complete certainty but if you're observing this as a member of the public and you don't know the difference how do you know what to make of this so is it safe to say that anthony fauci is an advocate in kovid and not a scientist this is the central thing that's going on here i think peter i think you're absolutely right because what it is is if you look at fauchi say or you look at francis collins so recently leaked email francis cons talking about the great barrington declaration which was a bunch of scientists including someone who's been on my show jay bhaticaria saying hey as a matter of policy we think the following things should happen that would improve outcomes in this pandemic based on our interpretation of what the best science is right now there is no the science this is our policy interpretation right and what francis cons roughly wrote in this email was hey did you see these fringe epidemiologists uh coming up with this great barrington declaration oh by the way one of the fringe guys was a is a nobel prize winner at stanford mike levitt and uh if you haven't seen it we need to do a devastating and you know decisive takedown of this and i don't see it out there yet and so basically saying ultimately what i interpret this as is hey i disagree with this as a policy we need to put out something that takes it down as a policy and there's not a discussion of oh let's have let's discuss the underlying science let's actually have a discussion about policy like does it make sense to treat healthy people that are young the same as elderly people at high risk these are the conversations we ought to have instead they acted as advocates well our position is do the lockdowns make people mask promote whatever it is we're promoting and that's our policy so we need to advocate for it in no uncertain terms which means a devastating and immediate takedown of these quote-unquote fringe epidemiologists and that that's that is as clear an aspect of the difference between policy politics and science but this is a scientist who represents our one of our largest scientific public agencies so that was really concerning to me i'm curious marty what you think of that that was chilling when i saw that email from francis collins to fauci and it called for a devastating takedown of another opinion basically i mean they control the currency of academic medicine which is nih funding when you've got the head of that talking about taking down ideas and taking down people this is probably the greatest lesson we should learn from the pandemic in addressing how do we avoid group think in the way that it's burned us time and time again we've got to openly talk about the corruption of science itself how there has been a shutdown of scientific discussion how you cannot talk about certain things it started with google suppressing any search of wuhan lab leak and they admitted this openly they said you know we suppressed any searches because we weren't sure and we didn't want people to get the ideas if they weren't sure well that's not their role they did the same with the great barrington declaration took down dr bhattacharya i was skeptical of the declaration early on but look at what's happening in sweden now and tell me if there wasn't some truth in what they were talking about martin caldorf very well known vaccinologist from harvard on the cdc asip committee basically dismissed openly he told me this and he said i could say this publicly i've written about it in the wall street journal dismissed from the committee for having a different idea he was upset about the j j pause being too prolonged and creating vaccine hesitancy asked to leave the committee fda bypassed their own expert advisors called verpack on the boosters for young people vote cdc with their expert advisors on boosters for young people told that committee specifically you're voting on older folks we are not holding a vote on boosters in young people and then they go ahead and author and recommended for for young people two senior fda officials quit including the head of the vaccine center at the fda academic bullying how many people have reached out to us and said thank you for talking about natural immunity i see it in my patients i can't talk about it i'm told we have to keep one message and that is to get everyone vaccinated and you know thank you for speaking up i can't do so why is the nih not done a study on natural immunity they keep saying we don't know they're ignoring the 141 studies that have been documented by the brownstone institute it's not that hard go to new york where people had the infection interview them test their blood i mean why is my research team doing this without nih funding because the nih is not only not funding it they're not doing it and they're relying on two really flawed studies that the cdc put out this is the the distortion of science itself shutting down scientific discussion and that should be our greatest lesson i want to come back to something you said about natural immunity because now i want to kind of get into let's talk about what we know so let's start with that what do we know about naturally acquired immunity you know it's interesting because there are multiple studies showing that natural immunity is actually a real thing it's a real phenomenon it generates really good protection against either reinfection at a lower rate or severe disease at a much higher rate and then there are a couple of studies that are cdc sponsor studies that marty's reviewed in depth that say the opposite and what's interesting is as a matter again as a matter of policy then the policymakers in the us have chosen to go with that approach saying listen it doesn't matter if you've had natural immunity you still need two vaccines and a booster and by the way you cannot space them out beyond a certain point or they will not even count for the mandates that we're talking about so where policy actually contradicts evidence that we have it becomes at this point it's pure advocacy pure policy and that distinction between public health and science where public health says we have to speak with a monolithic voice that simplifies complexity into binaries otherwise no one's going to listen because americans are too stupid that's the subtext versus actual scientists who are like wait no wait wait wait wait wait and those are the emails we get right marty the people who can't even talk about this nuance because they'll get censored in their own academic institutions so back to you well i do want to ask a technical question is there a precedent for a respiratory virus to not generate natural immunity in other words like what would be your prior on this if you knew nothing like wouldn't i don't again this is so outside of my wheelhouse guys i i'm not an immunologist i'm not a fighter more importantly i'm not a virologist right i think that's the real question and none of us are so do we know if it's actually the norm that once you have a virus you tend to develop natural immunity to it i mean that was sort of my understanding from medical school but have things changed significantly and what would be our expectation here yeah so just real quick strep throat which is a bacteria that can re-infect you and re-infect you so you cannot have a viable vaccine respiratory pathogens in general you can get re-infected but your immunity against severe disease tends to be quite strong alternatively when they're just changing right so so of course like the flu you could get theoretically every year but that's because you're getting a novel pathogen effectively correct that's right and even then even the novelness of the pathogen is actually not as novel as a real phase shift in the antigens you're presented with like maybe would happen in h1n1 swine flu or a new bird flu so yes it's a spectrum all the way up to measles where it doesn't change that much even though it's an rna virus and you can get true permanent sterilizing immunity from natural infection for the rest of your life and that's why we don't even vaccinate people who were born before say 1960 because we assume they all got measles and they have immunity so marty i'm curious your thoughts yeah i know i look i think one of the um little known secrets is we all have our group of go-to people we've got our immunologists our vaccinologists our infectious diseases experts and we go to them frequently and we learn to trust the judgment of many of these and i even heard paul offit on your podcast zubin talk about how there's that spectrum so let's look at the hot coronaviruses what i call the hot coronaviruses the cold ones cause the common cold and they're seasonal the ones that cause severe illness or the hot coronaviruses there's only been three in history and that's sars mers and covid19 now sars was studied 17 years out and the natural immunity was solid mers was studied three years out and the natural immunity was solid probably longer but that's just the time points at which they studied the viruses that no longer circulate why would you study it much longer if it's no longer in circulation so the starting hypothesis in my opinion should have been natural immunity appears reliable we don't see people getting reinfected with severe illness on the ventilator and the icu and once we start seeing that we can change the starting hypothesis but let's use the starting hypothesis that natural immunity works at least in the time that it's been around and what you had was a series of studies come out from early on two months into the pandemic rhesus monkeys were re-challenged with the virus and they did not get reinfected the cleveland clinic then came out with their big study of hospital workers who were around covett all the time and found no re-infections and the vaccine did not add anything to their immune protection then you had the washington university study which actually did bone marrow biopsies and looked at the t cell activated t cells in the system the very difficult experiment that we talked about is not as simple as a blood draw and they concluded that immunity from covet is likely lifelong it's lasting and study after study kept coming out then we got the biggest study ever done out of israel a population study showing that natural immunity was 27 times more protective adjusted for age than vaccinated immunity tell me a little bit more about that one marty that seems difficult to quantify can you can you tell me a little bit more about what that actually means sure so what they did is just they have all the positive testing data as the cdc does but they won't release it of people who test positive and then subsequently testing positive again they also have all the vaccine records so if you tested positive and did not get a vaccine they looked at the rate of testing positive again and it was there was something like a 13-fold difference but adjusted for age because we know every age group is different it ended up being an age-adjusted 27-fold difference now when that came out it was a few weeks before the data came out on boosters reducing hospitalizations by tenfold in people over 65. the tenfold reduction in hospitalizations with a booster in older people dr fauci immediately described it as quote-unquote dramatic data and wrote up a lot of policy around that immediately the data on natural immunity being 27 times more protective not mentioned once ever by public health officials there's a general fear i i hear in my private conversations with public health leaders that if they talk about natural immunity people might just go out there and try to get the infection and we don't want them to do that and i agree we don't want them to do that but we can be honest about the data and encourage vaccination at the same time look how many careers we've ruined teachers nurses soldiers getting dishonorably discharged they have antibodies that neutralize the virus but they are antibodies that the government does not recognize that has been a tragic misstep and i think it's one of the reasons why the government has lost credibility there's a lot i want to talk about there but can you talk about the two studies by the cdc that suggest that natural immunity is not lasting yeah these studies would not qualify for a seventh grade science fair the methodology was so poor is that fact or opinion marty that is my opinion just but i think any any honest scientist will tell you that the conclusions cannot be derived from the data the first study was a study looking at a narrow two-month period in the state of kentucky and they looked at reinfection rates and they didn't say anything about whether or not they had symptoms or were hospitalized or anything and the rates in both the vaccinated and natural and natural immune group were exceedingly low they were 0.01 over that two-month interview in an interval but because they were both so low and they weren't equal one happened to be 2.3 times higher than the other in the in the natural immune group so they concluded those with natural immunity were 2.3 times more likely to get the infection again it's too small a sample it's so what happened was the cdc has data on all 50 states for 15 months the pandemic at the time they did something called phishing and anyone in research knows this technique you find some small sliver of data in some locale in some narrow time window that supports a foregone conclusion that you've made before reviewing the day so they found one state over a two-month period that supported their hypothesis why don't they release all of the nation's data on reinfections they've never done that in the other study they surveyed people in the hospital and asked them if they've had the infection in the past and they they make conclusions about population level risk by surveying people in the hospital you simply can't do that how can you derive a population level risk without knowing the denominator so both were highly flawed no one really defended them except for a lot of politically appointed physicians were just kind of mum about it and yet these numbers get quoted all the time like the maricopa mass study highly flawed wouldn't make its way into any hasn't been published in any journal that has a review process just the little mmwr rag that the cdc puts out now has there been a meta-analysis marty because one way to address a body of literature this vast because as you say there's always going to be i mean you're you're always going to find a signal and you're always going to find noise a good process meta-analysis could sift through that has someone done that definitive meta-analysis on this question yeah so martin kudlorf who was the harvard professor now he's at brown brownstone institute has summarized the 141 studies on natural immunity and so when falci gets on the tv and says we just don't know about natural immunity well do the study how hard is it this is not the riddle of the sphinx you can figure out how many people have been reinfected from the original days of new york and had severe illness and as when this issue was coming up i reached out to zubin and i said hey are you hearing about reinfections after somebody truly was sick not just an asymptomatic test but they were truly sick from covid have you heard of anyone coming back to the hospital on a ventilator or dying and look i'm sure there's some rare case out there but he said no look i haven't heard about it it's becoming like bigfoot everyone thinks they've heard about it but there's no good documentation and anecdotally i think we see the opposite right i mean i know many people who have been re-infected with kovid and i can say without exception every one of them had a much much milder course the second time now some of that's confounded because some of those people also got vaccinated right so they got the first wave they got their first illness pre-vaccine that was pretty bad you know that was again in a healthy young person that could still be like a bad case of influenza some of them just went on to get another covet a few months later pre-vaccine some got vaccinated and got another covid but i think the point here is this is knowable there are some things that are not knowable there are some things that are knowable this falls in the bucket of knowable and therefore it's frustrating when we don't have information on things that are knowable or when we claim we don't have information about things that are knowable and i think this points again at marty's assortations that are as a policy we haven't chosen to just devote resources to this and it is a central question and i think our anecdotal experience again speaks to the difficulty of preventing re-infection with a mucosal pathogen like a coronavirus and that's why you know you can get a cold year after year but you don't die that long-term immunity you know prevents severe disease and we see that anecdotally now speaking of anecdotes one thing i want to say about that everybody has an anecdote of somebody who broke through vaccine or did this or that and ended up getting sick and died and hospital people are really good at this because they see an enriched sample so they'll be like well there was a pregnant mother who was 20 who had no problems died of covet and this and this and all that that can happen but when we now have an internet where these anecdotes can be amplified into larger level distorting sort of data sets i think it influences a level of fear and policy decisions then that spring from that and that's something we have to kind of tease out by actually doing science actually studying the stuff directly and saying okay no this is actually a well-designed study that says actually no it can happen but it's a point zero zero one percent risk and so do we make policy to prevent that risk and the answer is probably not because it has costs yeah this gets back to i'll just keep harping on this idea of science versus advocacy science for savage i mean again on the other side of the spectrum you have you have a whole group of people who are saying hey vaccines are horrible they should never be used nobody should be vaccinated natural immunity is the only way to go vaccines don't even prevent illness because look at all these breakthrough cases and again i think a very arrogant approach is to say shut up vaccines cure everybody put your head in the sand you knuckle dragger but that would be an advocacy position right a scientific position would be like no you're absolutely right vaccines it's a probabilistic game vaccines reduce the probability of infection the severity of infection but that's all probabilistic so if you take a hundred vaccinated people versus a hundred unvaccinated people on an individual basis you can't make any assertion that's what science is and again i go back to this thing which is you look at all of the amazing things that have happened in the last two years that really speak to the scientific method so so imagine this pandemic took place in the 16th century like before we even had the scientific method so let alone the capacity to generate drugs and all these other things totally different game right and yet i mean to think we have monoclonal antibodies we have novel antivirals we have vaccines we've got all of this stuff done in less than 24 months what bums me out and i've said it before opinion not fact i think that this is a pirate victory for science i think it has what's the expression like we've we've won the battle and lost the war from a scientific perspective right which is yeah you know what 800 000 people died instead of 2 million that's an awesome victory but it came at such an erosion of trust that the next time one of these things comes around when you actually do need to take really draconian measures good luck with that this idea of the pyrrhic victory of science i think is is really central here because one thing you said about advocacy this advocacy position maybe it's a good advocacy position to say no vaccines you're you're dumb if you don't take them they're they're absolutely essential to ending the pandemic the only way through is with vaccines but even that as an advocacy position is ineffective because how has that worked it generates psychological reactants among people who are have ideological and moral reasons to be skeptical of these vaccines whether they're politically aligned with someone who's skeptical whether they don't like authority telling them what to do whether they distrust science whatever it is that approach to advocacy only serves to shore up people who already agree with you and it creates reactants in others which is the problem with mandates which is the problem with the inflexibility of recognizing natural immunity so even as a policy standpoint well all we've done is serve to do exactly what you said peter which is erode our trust and ability to understand science and then the next thing that happens is potentially a huge disaster if we had a super computer to calculate all the downstream effects of what we've done during this pandemic so let's say we saved you know a million lives let's say but how many did we cost in terms of future distrust in terms of childhood vaccines that now people are reluctant to get because they're so burned by this whole thing with the covid in terms of all the whatever screening for cancer we didn't do during the time that coveted was going on substance abuse the mental illness the further fragilization of our children through this culture of safety ism and overprotectiveness and and teaching them that you know words and people who disagree with you are evil and violent and so on so that's something that i think we really if we don't wake up to that then it doesn't matter how good our science is it it's not going to actually affect anything in a positive way you may have seen the brown university study that just came out i'm going to read the conclusion we examined general cognitive childhood scores 2020 to 2021 versus the preceding decade we find that children born during the pandemic have significantly reduced verbal motor and overall cognitive performance compared to children born pre-pandemic we are in uncharted territory we are playing with fire we're now going to have a generation now living with this we've got a mental health crisis declared by the surgeon general in children we've got a 51 percent increase in self-harm admissions to a hospital among young women we have yet to comprehend how significant many of these restrictions have been on the most vulnerable members of our society and that is children who don't vote who have been subject to so many of these policies one of the things about this that is odd to me is again when you contrast 18 months ago with today is based on what we know these proposed policies and mandates don't even make sense so let's talk a little bit more let me get a little more data so i can create a thought experiment which you know i love what is the best available evidence we have for how much a vaccinated versus unvaccinated individual reduces the ability to spread an infection to some other person in other words how much do vaccines reduce the ability to spread the infection i think one of the great mistakes we made as a medical community was to suggest that somehow being vaccinated was going to eliminate that risk of transmission and we've set that expectation and now people run around saying they don't work when in fact the vaccines are very effective in downgrading the severity of illness but the transmission piece now it's pretty clear is not significantly affected by the vaccines because the virus lenses lands in the mucosal area of the nose and upper airways replicates and you blow it off faster than the systemic immunity can kick in now the natural immunity is is more based in the local area of the mucosa and so therefore that's why some think it's more effective but when you look at this lancet study that just came out about a month ago the peak viral shedding was equal in those vaccinated and unvaccinated the difference is the window of contagiousness was more narrow among those vaccinated so we're talking one day versus about three days on average so we could again this is a very crude assessment but we could say there's a 66 reduction in transmission if you believe all things are otherwise equal you could but if you show up to the same day care center or same workplace every day you're still going on one of those days be shedding virus at a high level okay zuma anything to sharpen that analysis because that's again to me that's a very jugular question when i think about a policy decision right yeah i think it's interesting because there's two ways that i think we can see a reduction in transmission one is the narrowing of the window which marty talked about the other is that there is including in current data and i can't cite the specific studies that have to dig them up but there is a reduction in in symptomatic infection overall which means the operative question becomes when a vaccinated individual is asymptomatic and i'm not talking about pre-symptomatic like they're eventually going to develop symptoms and often we found presymptomatic people are quite contagious but they're asymptomatic but they would test positive by pcr say are they infectious and this is in the realm of speculative now right but the the answer is probably not and the more people that are vaccinated around them probably even the less infectious they'll be because those people have an innate resistance even to infection unless the inoculum is quite high which is why delta was kind of a a real drag if you look at vaccine numbers with alpha vaccine very effective but then the combination of waning neutralizing antibodies plus a very high r naught virus in the form of delta made it more likely to break through in terms of infection mucosal replication so again i think there's those two main mechanisms by which but then you have the emergent phenomenon of a community effect and i'm not using even the term hurt immunity anymore because it's it's just it's gone by the wayside it's more that there's this community cocooning effect and you see it in a place like say the bay area where the vaccination rates are 90 plus percent there really aren't that many cases and if i talk to my friends here they're like yeah you know there's a few really morbidly obese elderly people that are in icu but in general it's not happening and kids are doing just fine even prior to being vaccinated and schools are you know opened up and stuff is happening there is this kind of effect so i think it's more complicated than has currently been measured easily but that doesn't mean we can't measure it if you say it look at let's just take the most extreme like let's say it's reducing transmission by two-thirds and it's clearly reducing severity of infection by at least 90 i mean i think that would be a fair assessment in some demographics probably more than that but it's a good log reduction in severity so and then you you take on top of that do we have effective agents to treat it i think the answer is we have lots so now imagine a different world imagine a world in where you had a vaccine that didn't reduce severity of illness by more than 50 but it reduced transmission by 99 would we want to at least discuss whether there would be a different policy view yeah that makes perfect sense because if you're if the main goal is dropping transmission but it's not but for the people who do get sick they still get very sick then your policy changes to hey you know as many people as we can get vaccinated the better it is that's a true herd immunity kind of goal there we can do that measles etc but if it's the opposite then your calculation of policy changes dramatically and here's why i think it does at this point like you said we have treatments we have prophylactics in the form of vaccine we have prophylactics in the form of an n95 or can 95 mask we have prophylaxis in the form of you don't go to that concert or go out to eat if you really are that paranoid right so at this point we've shifted from a community level decision risk to an individual level decision i can get vaccinated if i want to prevent severe disease in myself i might have a little cocooning effect on my family that's fine so we don't want to minimize it but we don't want to maximize it either because it may not be true in a maximal sense if it's true it's on some continuum and then if i don't want to get sick and i'm high risk i don't have to go to that thing or i could wear a can 95 or an n95 and then if i do get sick i'm going to demand you know the right monoclonal that is omicron you know sensitive and fluvoxamine and all the other stuff right so at this point we've turned something from you know out of your control entirely to something that becomes a much more individual decision which is why policies that use the mechanism of the state to actually influence your behavior may be less effective less relevant and backfire in a bigger sense and it goes with colleges too when you're mandating kids be double vaccinated and boosted quarantine for 10 days in their room getting door dash if they test positive well why who exactly are they harming their own risk is low their professors are vaccinated and can wear masks so it's kind of like at this point what are we really doing so it the underlying situation matters to what policy you want to actually instill yeah and i think what what i'm struggling with is you could paint two extreme cases so again you imagine a scenario where the vaccine does not really reduce transmission but really reduces severity of illness versus a vaccine that really reduces transmission but not so much on severity of illness well again any person with common sense could say you have a totally different set of recommendations and if you're gonna wave a policy hammer you're gonna do it totally different in those situations it seems to me that we're using the wrong policy tool again opinion not fact we're using the wrong policy tool for the tools on the ground even when you talk about kids which i'm sure you'll talk about the policy tools we have are not concurrent with the situation on the ground in terms of these parameters that peter discuss look peter i think that's a very reasonable opinion but here's a fact that is the therapeutics we have today have cut cova deaths to zero in the clinical trials and once they get distributed remember they were just fda approved once they get distributed and out there no one should be dying of covet right now with rare exceptions with all the you know state of the art care with the randomized controlled trial data behind it and pax levitt and money preview no one has died from covid in those clinical trials period now in in fairness marty still relatively small right the pfizer study only had about a thousand in each arm is that correct yeah a little over 600 in each arm okay so we used to have a joke when i was at the nih at the nci whenever a small trial would come out in a phase two that showed an amazing result that the patients would say can i get that drug before the results change once the larger trial comes out but so so just to set expectations right i mean people are going to die even still through these drugs but i think the point is when you look at this protease inhibitor which is the new pfizer drug and this rna replicating blockade that's the merck drug they're kind of remarkable and presumably we will come out with another set of monoclonal antibodies that will be reactive to whatever strain is relevant just as regeneron was very effective against the og reasonably effective against delta i think we can talk about how effective it is against omicron but yes i think your point is kind of what we've been saying like oh my god we have tools today we couldn't fathom 12 months ago so good point now 23 people died in the placebo arms collectively of the multipurviewer and paxlavid trials zero died of covet in the treatment arms now it may not end up being you know that dramatic in a real population but whatever it is it's it's it's very impressive it's very impressive then you add to that the gsk veer monoclonals problem is we've got the monoclonals out for the delta variant we just can't sequence quick enough to know what to give people that's the dilemma but well especially by the way marty sorry interrupt when you start stacking these things right this is where it starts to get very bayesian you're vaccinated you have access to monoclonal antibodies you have access to a new therapeutic you have access to existing therapeutics is in flavoxamine and you have icus that are ninjas compared to what they were two years ago that's right that's five pieces of swiss cheese you can put on top of each other and you still have to try to get a piece of you know a pencil through there is pretty tough that's right and you add fluvoxamine budesinide i mean it's amazing so we're all in agreement the therapeutics now are have matured once they're actively available everywhere it changes the calculus so if people were jumping out of an airplane and some people chose to use a parachute and other people chose not to you would say you know people not using a parachute are making a very poor decision and you might even mandate parachutes of anyone jumping out of the plane but if the plane is flying at a very low speed only 15 feet above an inflatable mat that changes the calculus on the entire necessity of instituting martial law to require parachutes or whatever the mitigation is and right now it's as if there's this mild illness that people with immunity can develop and we're bringing all of heaven and earth down to lock up these college students in solitary confinement for 10 days requiring them to get a booster just so they can go to class despite no evidence that boosters right now help young people maybe some evidence that there's harm now that could change but that's the evidence to date and look at what we're doing to ourselves and we've moved to a second pandemic after covet 19 which is a pandemic of lunacy which is this overreaction to mild illness what becomes so frustrating marty is when we talk about the stuff and you and i are pretty aligned on this and this isn't this is opinion based on the best evidence we have so it's a mix of sort of editorializing and i will get emails from say an icu doctor who will say but i'm still seeing sick people in the icu and to which i will reply okay so what in our societal policies would actually prevent that short of locking everybody up in their house and forcing vaccinations on them and then telling them they can't do anything that they normally do and what's the cost of that and the same icu doctor will tell me well my son's actually having a lot of anxiety in high school right now has to see the counselor because he was kept home and away from a social network and then the pressure of using zoom and he's an introvert and it didn't really work out and so i i'm sympathetic to that it's like well okay now multiply that by how many millions of kids we've done this to for something that eventually it seems to me and i'm editorializing is going to be fully endemic in the sense that you have a respiratory pathogen to to which initially we had no immunity or limited immunity we now have much better immunity against severe disease we get reinfected every year like the common cold but people who get very sick have a series of therapeutics at their disposal to prevent them from dying some old and frail and comorbid people will die like they do from a common cold but we don't have to really change society over it because it's another common pathogen that we have next do we really need to vaccinate every single child for this when every single child every single season after they're born is going to be infected naturally they're not going to get severe disease because their parents pass along some degree of immunity even in breast milk and as it is we're blessed that the kids don't get very sick typically from this unless they're very sick otherwise and so they're going to develop immunity and so in some in less than a few years we won't even need to vaccinate anybody because all adults will be exposed or vaccinated all children will be exposed and will have another common circulating endemic coronavirus so that that's what i think is where we're headed and yet so why are we destroying our society in the process and generating so much division we're squandering our community to for this thing that just doesn't make sense to me now that's editorializing well i'm going to keep editorializing for a minute and then i want to come back to something you said marty which is let's now look at the data around the risks of vaccine because again i think one of the challenges of the scientists being conflated with the advocates is that no one's allowed to ask that question right as though somehow you know statins like let's take a drug that i mean just demonstrably reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease like you just you know you've got to look far and wide to figure out over the right time horizon if you give statins for a year you might not see a benefit but demonstrably the biggest sea change we've had in the reduction of risk for the most prevalent chronic condition in the developed world would anybody with a straight face say that there aren't risks of statins nobody with a straight face could tell you that statins don't harm some people and there's nothing bizarre about that right there's nothing odd to say that i mean like don't we talk about this every time we give patients a drug you give somebody a prescription for something hey let us know if you develop a rash if you do it could be really severe you know you please call us right away and let's stop it you might be one of the 4.9 percent of people that is susceptible to this side effect right so somehow it's become impossible to have the discussion if you're coming at it from the the sort of the advocacy point of view that there might be a risk associated with a vaccine until you know something like the j thing came along and then the response seemed the exact opposite which so this is the thing i'm struggling with okay so this is a long rambling question because i don't understand something i don't understand how when the first j data came out and said i believe it was six cases of vte in seven million doses so about a one in a million incidents the drug was pulled the vaccine was pulled and in a moment we're going to talk about myocarditis with moderna nobody wants to talk about that why the difference i'm asking for opinion because i mean we can talk about what the facts are which we'll get to but the broader question is help me understand the difference because i'm getting questions from patients of mine saying i don't want my 18 year old son getting a third mrna booster which is being mandated by his university do you think i'm crazy to which i say no you're not here's the data that tells me you're not crazy and i'll let marty answer this but i just want to say this i think it comes down to the difference between peacetime and wartime vaccine communication and again this is advocacy versus science so in peacetime vaccine communication you have children who need to get these series of vaccinations in order to prevent common what would we become common diseases like measles mumps etc if we didn't get a certain degree of herd immunity that happens which is above 90 odd percent and so the the messaging has always been hey listen there are very rare side effects of these things and by the way they can be quite serious but they're very rare but as a community benefit pretty much the risk to your child is so small and the risk of the communicable communicable disease is small right in an absolute sense absolutely small but if we don't do this as a community we're going to have a problem and you see it when vaccine rates drop below 90 you see measles outbreaks and that sort of thing so the public health messaging has always been hey zero tolerance for anti-vaccine discussions we don't talk much about the risks of them because we just need to do this and they're mandated for schools and so on now recent there's there's merits and demerits to that approach but that is the peacetime approach to vaccines the wartime approach where you have uncertainty you have changing data and you have risks and benefits that are stratified by age and comorbidities we're applying the same peace time approach which is vaccine absolutism with no quarter and anything you say against the vaccine is taboo so it becomes almost an unspeakable curse like in harry potter you can't use them or you're excommunicated from the tribe of medicine and it has become a tribal thing well now i think it's become this kind of absolutist thing that they've applied in wartime to something that it just doesn't apply to which is this vaccine which as you mentioned has risks that actually are worse for younger people and benefits that are much less for younger people so we ought to be looking at it clear-eyed so i'm sorry marty over to you that's just my rant no i like you're spot on here because what we now see in this tribalism of medicine and we've seen it in the group think of so many aspects of covet that the establishment got wrong and the reality is we've got a few people making all the decisions uncovered a very small group of non-age diverse non-ethnically diverse political appointees with political allegiances making all the decisions on covet for the country and quite frankly i think they're detached from the life of a young person in baltimore city who was barely hanging into in school pre-covered okay it's not as easy to hand that person an ipad and say we're you know we're gonna do remote learning as it is in the hamptons or in santa barbara county so what we developed was this sort of tribalism whereby if you would question anything that might result in an answer even albeit scientific that could threaten the vaccinate every human being with two feet message then that needed to be suppressed or squashed or ridiculed or labeled an anti-vaxxer it could it could be natural immunity you know i think that's maybe how i initially got sort of seen as hey is he one of us with the vaccine community you know last year i was calling for lockdowns beforehand warning of this thing wrote the first piece calling for universal masking to keep society semi-open and then the vaccine rollout came along and i said hey wait a minute it needs to be simply age-based and those who have natural immunity need to step aside in the vaccine line so we can save more lives and let's just focus on the first doses because the immunity is pretty good for three months we can save more lives tens of thousands of people could have been saved if we adopted those policies and some people would suggest hey wait a minute if you're saying hold off on the second dose you're kind of anti the vaccine and if you're telling people with natural immunity they can wait a little bit based on the data that's kind of anti-vaccine and if you're asking about the myocarditis complications trying to understand the rate of them that could scare some people off and therefore you might be putting an anti-vaccine message out there the vares data system which is the self-reported system the fda set up is such a shoddy poor way to track complications that it's basically unreliable it's overloaded and yet at the same time it's very cumbersome to report into that most doctors that tell me about a complication of say they haven't reported it to verse you really get almost no follow-up there's been deaths in children in the united states immediately after the second dose from myocarditis and the cdc says they are going to investigate one of them that was several months ago we never heard anything so if you ask questions it's almost as if you know how dare you now look the vaccine still makes sense in a certain context in a certain way in young people it's often to present misc and hospitalization more than it is to prevent death in children but it's nuanced it's not a one-size-fits-all strategy especially with those who have natural immunity so let's talk a little bit about that z-dog van i did a great video on this just the other day but let's talk a little bit about what we know and now let's just talk in fact for a moment right let's not editorialize anything what do the data suggest with respect to the pfizer vaccine and the moderna vaccine with respect to the incidence of myocarditis in males and females below the age of 40. and stratify that as much as you see fit so i'll give the high level and marty can dive into the details because he's a vastly bigger nerd than i'm capable of being but i'll say this the party line has been that and you'll hear pediatricians around the country telling their patients this when asked about vaccine they're kind of reiterating what cdc says which is the risk of myocarditis in young people is exceeded from a vaccine is exceeded by the risk of natural covet infection causing myocarditis in other words if they were to go out and get natural infection their x-fold more likely to get myocarditis than any risk of myocarditis from either of the vaccines pfizer or moderna now this is in the setting of not knowing the denominator of how many people are actually infected with covet out in the community they're just looking at kind of hospitalized patients and so on and of course those patients are sicker of course they have more cardiac side effects and so on when they're infected with covid there's two counting issues there just to clarify right zubin the first is you have a negative selection for patients and then you have a underestimation of the denominator that's right so in other words we don't know how many people got infected with covid out in the community that did just fine we're guessing at that or using incomplete tools and so that's part of the problem in the calculations whereas with vaccines we can say oh these guys got vaccinated and there were this many cases of myocarditis and they were hospitalized for this many days and they had this kind of cardiac function at discharge and these were the complications and so on so you can you can actually look at that data now looking at all that same data that was available the european authorities said you know what actually we see a bigger risk with moderna for myocarditis that especially when we have pfizer which seems to have less myocarditis so we're just not going to recommend moderna for men or people under 30. now that's a huge difference between us and european policy based on data sets now this is where the newer data comes out that marty can talk about saying hey you know this may not be true that actually natural infection is more myocardiogenic than the vaccines yeah so we generally recognize this rate early on to be somewhere in the range of one in seven thousand and that is young boys and young men so in the age group 15 to 25 the rate was about one in seven 7 600 according to a new england journal study after the second dose the complications 90 of them were clustered around the second dose and the myocarditis cases the vast majority of which were mild but two were severe in the new england journal analysis out of israel and one person died that is a 22 year old died i know it you know you can barely say that because you know of the sort of trigger that it creates but look by and large this is a safe vaccine but for parents asking these questions about vaccinating their kids against an illness that has an ultra rare rate of death in healthy children this is a reasonable conversation to have maybe the rate of death from the vaccine parallels the rate of death from covid in a healthy child now the cdc reports there are 668 deaths over two years so let's say roughly 300 some deaths a year from covid in k everyone under age 18 all children who are those kids we believe many of us believe that they are nearly all in children with a comorbid medical condition now they're still important members of our society we need to do everything we can to protect them but it does change the calculus now for healthy kids when we recognize that the vaccine is not halting transmission so to subject all healthy children to a vaccine when the risk of myocarditis could be as high as one in seven thousand young males and boys then all of a sudden you're talking about a very nuanced decision where some pediatricians might say you know what how about we do one dose there was a study of kids 5 through 17 in germany that just went on the pre-print server of all the deaths in germany over the 15 months the pandemic right up until around march march april there were zero deaths in healthy children no healthy child has died a hundred percent of the deaths were clustered in kids with a comorbid condition 100 so that changes the calculus now to a parent that says hey my kids healthy i'm a little concerned about the rare side effects i'd like to talk about the data this is a conversation it is not a one-size-fits-all strategy as we are being told and especially when you get to boosters i mean the here's new here's the new here's the new england journal paper from december 8th looking at boosters and no boosters in kids well i call them kids because i'm on a college campus in people under age 30 okay in people under age 30 who are vaccinated with the primary series there were zero deaths this is population data from israel zero deaths after the regular primary vaccine series you cannot lower that any further you cannot lower the number zero further with a booster well they looked at those with boosters and as you would expect zero deaths in that group and then in germany they looked at people really essentially over a period when there were there was no vaccines and the rate was also zero for healthy kids that tells me the kid has a comrade condition get the vaccine otherwise for healthy kids it's a nuanced discussion if you look at the circulation paper that came out in july of this year the knock on this is it doesn't distinguish between pfizer and moderna so we'll talk about that in a second but i think to me the most interesting table in there is the one that stratifies by age and then it does risk and benefit male for female which again seems to me a very reasonable way to think about this right so when you looked at 12 to 17 year old males and females and again this is all mrna vaccines we know now i think can we say that unequivocally the modern vaccine is three to four times more likely to be associated with myocarditis or uh myopericarditis at least at least yeah okay the supplemental data that came out literally two days ago looks like it's five times worse but let's be conservative say three to four times worse so keeping in mind i'm giving you blended data 12 to 17 year old females 8 to 10 cases of myocarditis per million doses males 56 to 69 cases blended benefits saves 38 icu admissions saves one death so here's where i'm struggling right now if you look at this and you say look you're going to give 70 cases of myocarditis to save a death what's the natural history of those 70 cases of myocarditis so zubin how many of those kids make an unremarkable recovery how many of those kids are going to have a chronic issue with their heart they're going to have a reduced ef for some point of their life and will any of those kids die and this is the thing we don't have enough data to be able to actually answer some of that i think there's a degree of uncertainty and when you're talking about the quality life you're saved in a kid if you if you're gonna in any way impinge on their ejection fraction of their heart in the future or cause any scarring or cause what we may even be under diagnosing whether there's arrhythmia happening it becomes a really open question that this ought to be looked at very carefully now marty may have his hands on some of the more specific data on the outcomes you mentioned the 22 year old that died it's all it's also a little difficult to peg causation sometimes because some of these kids had also pre-existing cardiac abnormalities we always think about sudden cardiac death in athletes and children and and whether to screen or not and those kind of things are outstanding questions but even if this were to provoke that to happen say if they were to get myocarditis you're impacting a child and and tons of live life years that are affected as opposed to say a 90 year old who maybe the vaccine gave them a fever that pushed them into cardiac arrest i mean just speculating right it's a very different quality of life years saved kind of calculation so i don't have the specific data of like how many of these kids go on to have chronic problems or even the hospitalization risk right so a certain percentage of these 86 percent in one study that i saw get hospitalized for a average of about three days when you hospitalize anybody you put their life at risk because they're in the most dangerous place on the planet because medical errors happen infections in the hospital happen complications happen that's why staying out of the hospital is a good idea if you can do it so you have to look at that as well and i just don't i haven't seen the data that compellingly says oh this is the answer to that the argument i hear by the way because i you know a few days ago i saw something that was ranking colleges or something like that and i made some snarky comment on twitter like can we start ranking the dumbest colleges you know when i was gonna put my alma mater you know gonna put stanford and hopkins there which are two of the idiotic colleges in my view by the way this is uh opinion not fact um who are mandating you know boosters for kids and not letting them back to campus without them and i couldn't believe the people that were just furious with me how could you possibly suggest this of course those kids need to have their third shot and the argument was they're putting so many other people's lives at risk by not having booster shots i'm thinking explain that to me like again this is every six months i do something stupid which is i engage on twitter i need to i need to create sort of like a testicular tasing device that is hooked up to the twitter app where anytime i look at twitter i get like 120 volt tase to my testes and it just says like don't ever do that again like don't ever don't ever go on twitter like nothing good comes of it it's a dec device guys uh direct epididymal current and when you apply at least 73 joules to your jewels it will dissuade you from ever clicking on that stupid app no no actually just real quick on this because this is the thing this is the tribalization so what you did is you behaved as an out group to the in group of whatever public health doctor types that are on there and this idea that that these vaccinating triple vaccinating these kids at stanford and by the way closing campus for two weeks because of omicron which is what they've done how have we got this far in the podcast without marty you referring it to omacold because this is your term right so so so for we're going to close the campus for two weeks because of cold continues zubin oh mccold rips through marty is you know cashing in his royalty money from every time someone says oh my cold and at this point the argument is oh well they're protecting professors they're protecting other people in the community and this is my take and i'm editorializing we have no data that that's actually at scale true we talked earlier in this podcast about the transmission effects with younger people too first of all who are they exposing well it's professors and family and community okay those professors and family and community can make the decision to triple vaccinate to wear a mask to stay away from big crowds in fact a lot of the professors are teaching remotely as it is so who are they really exposing other kids their age who are low risk who also have been vaccinated and if they don't get a booster or they get a booster what's the marginal benefit how many cases of myocarditis will you cause where that kid is out of school for three to six days in the hospital we don't know the long-term effects of it although i suspect they are generally mild but that's more editorializing these are the questions you have to ask so when people behave in that rubber stamp way now i'm guilty of it too because i editorialize in this way i think this is crazy i think these schools are out of their mind i think we're promoting a culture of safetyism and fragility in children and we're teaching them that this is okay to do and who's doing it people with power the elderly uber class that can sit at home on zoom they're doing it to young people who this is their chance to be in college and engage with other young people in person that's what college is it's not about learning that's a side effect it's about the other stuff so that's my take on it the who has put out an official statement very recently two weeks ago saying that universal booster programs threaten to prolong the pandemic they recommend against these booster programs and they warn that they will increase global inequities because 93 of the population of poor countries has no vaccine and one dose is better than no dose so they're taking a global perspective now look people ask me i'm over 65 should i get a booster the answer is if you haven't had the infection yes it's going to reduce your risk of hospitalization but if you just bring up what the who has already concluded somehow that's considered an outlier idea that you can we cannot discuss in the united states who tells people under age six they should not be wearing a mask the european cdc says that kids in primary school should not be wearing a mask many european countries have restricted or banned moderna vaccine from anyone under age 30 because of the risk of myocarditis so all of that suggests that in many ways the united states is lagging behind in terms of implementing scientifically wise policies suggesting that we're making errors in our policy that are ill-informed by science certainly the fda bypassed their technical experts what we call the verpack which is their external advisors so the verb pack had to vote on boosters for everybody they voted against it they voted 16 to two against it in part from because the the stuff we're talking about myocarditis and other concerns and a lack of benefit demonstrated and that was in what age group marty that was for everyone over age 18. so it was boosters across the board oh yeah yeah i see i see yeah the second wave of boosters yep yep so they voted it down the experts said no these are smart people then the fda made a second internal push in the agency weeks later and they chose this time during this process not to convene their experts to circumvent their own experts because they didn't want the input of people who were opposed to it and they unilaterally authorized boosters for young people cdc did the same and so what we are now have is this dramatic vigor of enthusiasm around boosting every 16 and 17 year old in this country with really a lot of experts saying hey we are not on board with this and a lot of the world is not on board with it and so that's where we ended up where we are today it's group think if you think about it when omicron came up it was almost like here's an opportunity to push boosters and young people pfizer makes a puts out a press release saying that hey if you get a booster it will help with omicron okay nobody knew anything about omicron at that point there was speculation it was mild now we have a lot more information the next day the next day after pfizer's press release about a experiment they did in the lab without releasing the underlying scientific data the next day the cdc rigorously puts out a strong recommendation to boost every 16 and 17 year old is that what we've come to now pharma puts out a press release and the next day we've bypassed all of our internal experts and we have this bandwagon effect of colleges and universities which are supposed to have smart people requiring boosters in a population that germany found doesn't have any deaths in five to 17 year olds without any vaccine i'm not recommending that but what are we protecting them from and again this is not measles this is not sterilizing immunity this is not high-level herd immunity that we're giving them by vaccinating them again i just i'm so troubled by this because of what i think about as the long game right the long game is i mean how many times has anthony fauci said an attack on me is an attack on science i mean i i actually had to go and look some of those things up because i'm like no he didn't really say that that's just a meme you know like nobody would actually say that he's had a rough year and he didn't say it once and he didn't say it twice right i lost count of how many times he has said that so you know there's a part of me that's very empathetic to anthony fauci right i think that's a horrible position to be in right he was sort of thrust into this position as the world's or at least the nation's expert on infectious disease matters in a moment when nobody knew anything right so he's having to sort of wear a mask don't wear a mask and but i think the lack of humility in expressing uncertainty and the doubling down and then the statements around i mean i have to tell you i didn't want to get too political today but i was very disheartened to see how vociferously he denied nih funding gain of function research in the wuhan lab i mean i don't really understand how you can deny that francis collins still thinks it's unlikely it came from the wuhan lab i mean the head of the nih he just said that last uh last week how did they not just deny it i mean you look at his exchange with senator rand paul like this is beyond denial right this is attacking anybody showing you the evidence that your institute has funded gain of function research in a particular lab through an intermediary like where's the ambiguity here well where's the humility people are hungry for honesty right now and if i were anthony fauci or francis collins i would say look we were out there parading around gain of function research giving grand rounds and lectures around the country writing op-eds about the importance of doing gain of function research we came we came at it from a perspective that was a little old-fashioned back in the days when it took months to sequence a piece of the gene now we can do it in 20 minutes there's no need to to frankenstein of viruses just to study them we feel terrible we don't believe the dollars from our research funding went directly to do this type of research but they went to the lab and for that we're sorry let's agree now to ban all gain of function research in the future in perpetuity forever of all kinds and let's make that an international treaty they could show leadership on that but instead it's almost like they're defending it yeah and what i struggle with and i think you'll both appreciate this i know i know you will because i've heard you both speak on this is when bad outcomes happen in medicine the doctors who get sued versus the doctors who don't get sued it doesn't come down to the grievousness of the error it comes down to the arrogance and the humility with which the physician interacted with the patient every one of us i know have made mistakes with patients and when you say to that patient i really screwed up i mean like i sent you to get a ct scan and it wasn't even supposed to be your scan that was a clerical error on my part and you got exposed to radiation unnecessarily or even the most extreme examples of of errors that have happened you go to that patient and you say what you did and you fess up and if you want bonus points maybe even explain what could be done different than next time so that it doesn't happen to somebody else i don't think there's a scenario under which a physician under that situation has been sued you start lying and you start posturing and you start denying and you start in the face of overwhelming evidence and you you sort of make the person feel like they're crazy i mean guess what like there's going to be a little packet coming your way from a lawyer this is like the highest order example of this right that's a really good analogy actually because we've all been in those positions and i tell you i've thrown i've thrown myself at the feet of patient's family saying this was a mistake i made here are the things we're going to do to make it better i'm sorry you know and again i have not been sued knock on wood but with fouchy it's interesting because let's i'm going to play fouchy advocate for a second here's a guy because i was part of a documentary that hasn't been released prior to kovid they had interviewed fauci and you know hotez and some other people about vaccine advocacy and the anti-vaccine movement and things like that prior to covet and you know he has just been kind of filleted by a lot of the sort of more activist conspiracy angles on things and really did feel like science itself was under attack to some degree now you throw in okay he's under a lot of political attack he gets all this hate mail and all of this he's probably doing what humans do which is entrenching solidifying his position and becoming an absolutist which is not what we need it's not what we need if he had insight or a good therapist they could probably tell him dude bro this is not good you need to be honest like if you think masks shouldn't be used because we're really trying to save them for healthcare professionals just tell the public that and i think that that's it as you know these are human beings he's 80 too and we forget that 81 now 81 wow i mean that's just had a birthday nice happy birthday anthony you know and i i was on i was on a call with anthony fauci during ebola that i was invited to where he was trying to talk to public health people about hey here's how we can think about ebola he was rational he was calm he was logical he was science-based he diffused a lot of fear i thought it was brilliant right and so to kind of see this transition is is is difficult and to be clear and i'm glad you said that by the way i'm not saying i would be one bit better like i just want to be clear everything i'm saying to be to be critical of advocacy versus science here i'm sure i would be doing the same thing i'd probably be worse he seems to have a much nicer disposition than i do i agree yeah yeah yeah but it doesn't change the fact right what's the aspiration here and and maybe this shouldn't be all on one guy's shoulders because it's your point how exhausting is this like i'm sick of this and it's not my job me too like i am sick and tired of this and i have the luxury of getting to focus on stuff that i actually find interesting so yeah maybe this shouldn't be one guy it shouldn't be one guy we should not be putting our entire faith and trust in one individual we should be hearing about multiple different medical opinions and we should from this we should have from the start you know i called in as you know i was very nervous about the pandemic and what it could do beforehand following what was happening in wuhan and calling doctors there and as editor-in-chief of medpage today i wrote some pieces and was reading articles coming in it was pretty clear to me that our country needed to wake up so i had some relationships with the white house for my work on price transparency made a phone call into the white house and said this was in february before the pandemic i said look this is going to be really bad we need to drop all kinds of contingency plans as a country stop non-essential travel get testing up and all this stuff went through the whole gamut and they were shocked and they said you know what you're saying here is would be a major shift in how we're approaching this and i said yes i look i've talked to the experts and i believe firmly in this this is stuff we need to do about a week later i got a call back from them and i they said well good news we got a chance to talk to dr anthony fauci and he says we're going to be okay now look we all make mistakes and that's okay but you've got to evolve when the data come in and he had hedged his bet watching sars one that is sars in 2003 it just petered out in asia and he kind of hedged that that's the way it was going to go and you had every media outlet going to him saying hey do i need to worry do i need to worry and as you know as a physician it's much easier to give reassurance than it is to say yes i'm very concerned so that's how i don't know whether or not to blame him or meet the press and face the nation and all these that just incessantly ran one opinion and not that of amisha dolga and so many other infectious diseases doctors with the chops to say hey you know they've got a different perspective can i have something heretical at this point though at this point in the pandemic where we have omicron and we have a vaccine we have therapeutics does it even make sense to push such widespread testing whether it's anagen testing or pcr i want to throw this at you guys and see what you think because i'm curious the answer to this i'll share with you my opinion i don't think so because someone's one of you has already made this point which is there really isn't a precedent for tracking rates of infection for respiratory illnesses what we pay attention to and as has been noted by many people what we pay attention to is hospitalizations severity of illness death so morbidity mortality effectively is the statistic that matters and somehow infection rate has now become a metric that matters so you can measure it look at measures matters we don't measure influenza infection rates i've never taken a test for it i remember when i had h1n1 in 2000 what year would that have been nine nine ten i had it i never got tested for it but we finally put two and two together because my lfts hit a thousand i mean i was sick as a dog i was literally on the verge of getting a liver biopsy before my doc went wait i think that illness you had a month ago or two months ago was h1n1 let's wait another month before we stick a needle in your liver and sure enough my lft's returned to normal so i mean i'd fully support i think or at least noodle the idea a lot more that what if we never tracked infection rates and we used it as epidemiologic data right so we did some sampling perhaps so that we could understand movement new strains and things like that maybe even use it to develop predictive models that might tell us when there might be an uptick in hospitalizations but it no longer became a metric like you didn't didn't see it on the news every day and people didn't talk about it as the thing that needed to go to zero on top of that i think there's the personal downside and upside of testing so i'm a young person i have a few symptoms or i'm screened let's say i'm screened asymptomatic you know to do whatever i need to do at school or whatever they screen me with an antigen test and i'm positive well now i'm stressed i have to quarantine for 10 days or five if you're listening to cdc's advice on hospital workers which apparently is different and has been downgraded in terms of time because of need i'm sitting there freaking out well oh let me see do i get monoclonal antibodies should i take this should i do that whereas my pre-test probability of anything happening to me is so low and in fact the pre-test probability of this being a false positive is quite high in an antigen test is that isn't that causing a degree of harm and cost and it might be now the upside is of course that person if it was a true positive can stay home and doesn't infect other people but if it's already so widespread does it really make a dent in something like omicron that's so transmissible now with an old person who's symptomatic you're going to test them anyways because at that point they do need therapies in the forms of monoclonal flu voximine et cetera so it's again it's stratified by risk it seems but of mass population testing another way to think about this is don't order a test unless the outcome would change how you're going to manage the patient and in the case of therapeutics for someone who's symptomatic the answer is yeah might be worth testing i think the idea of asymptomatically testing athletes is one of the most ridiculous things i've ever seen like we're going to just test everybody in the nfl and nba and nhl and nc2ma it's like serious like that what is the logic of this if if you test if you test athletes or anyone in the population for meningococcus bacteria in their nose 10 of the population will come back positive because that bacteria lives in a colonized you know non-virulent form everything to put these people in a neuro icu marty do you understand how deadly that bacteria can be i mean this can you imagine what the neuro icu rate is going to do at this point this is but by the way what if we just checked everybody for for staff on their skin like how many people are walking around with mrsa on their skin quite frankly guys you're not invasive enough i would do urethral swabs on everyone to screen for gonorrhea and chlamydia because god knows if you have an asymptomatic case of chlamydia i mean your nuts could fall off so you know there's all kinds of again i like peter's basic medicine internal medicine idea here don't don't do a test unless it's going to change your management in in some positive way look at what we've done to physicians and this is what i've sort of the complaint that i hear from the infectious diseases doctors i respect we've done a terrible thing to physicians in the united states we put them on this singular mission to block viral replication hunt it out find it block it at all cost and what we've lost track of is treating the entire person and we've lost track of the sustainability of any system to do this if we start mass testing everybody in the population on it you could test every child every day when they show up to school in perpetuity it is going to create a burden that's unsustainable it's going to bankrupt our system look at what we're doing right now with the mixed message coming from public health officials slash the white house and then look i don't have a political bone in me but this is this has been an endemic problem with government regardless of any political party red party green party doesn't matter no party you've got the government right now saying if you want to gather for new year's or whatever you need to do this massive testing of people coming in and at the same time they have a very limited supply of about 500 million tests that'll be rolling out over three months which is about 160 million tests a month you would need one to two billion a month to do what they're saying so they're telling you to do something and then you don't have the tools to do it is putting people in a very difficult decision paralysis and then we've got we put doctors on this crazy mission of hunt out all in viruses block replication at all cost we've done a terrible thing to the entire medical community right now yeah with no end point has anybody in the driver's seat signaled what the end point is because i do think that is an important question is let's use a totally unrelated example right so a person who's working their tail off to make more money because they believe that at a certain dollar amount all their problems are going to be solved right once i have this amount of money i don't have to work this hard i don't have to act this way i don't have to ignore my family i'm sort of making something up right you always have to ask well tell me what's going to change so tell me when you have that many dollars and you retire what's going to change so how many dollars do you need and how will it change things so when you bring that sort of silly analogy back to this i really haven't heard a clear articulation of that which is not to say one hasn't been made in defense of those who would make it but i haven't heard it have either of you i haven't heard it recently it's been an evolving thing in the beginning it was a bend the curve until we get better therapeutics and possibly a vaccine which we don't know if it's gonna is is gonna work or not then once we had a vaccine okay just try to get to the point where we have enough herd immunity from vaccine and natural immunity that will get to that point well then it turns out that shifts with new variants so now the question is oh well now with omicron the variance so contagious well we don't know at this point we have to go back to the same things we were doing before which is masking and forcing people to vaccinate including children and so on to get to i don't know what so that our hospitals don't get overwhelmed but no one i have not heard a public official say oh this is how we transition to an endemic virus or this is the goal where we're going to have a virus that lives with us forever and it's going to be okay but we just have to get to that point which means let's not overwhelm our hospitals so maybe we should shore up our staffing maybe we should pay nurses and doctors a little bit of overtime bonus whatever it is to get them through this that's the thing and we haven't even calculated in like well how many lives were saved say from the and this is kind of irrelevant but looking at the area under the curve how many lives were saved from preventing influenza for two years basically which we've done and then how many lives were caused by substance abuse overdose economic disaster and in the third world starvation from economic problems and so on so we don't look at things holistically and then we don't have an endpoint so what even if we looked at them holistically we'd have nothing to shoot for so it's been quite frustrating it's so hard because people are conflating two different problems that are happening simultaneous in the united states right now one is the sort of residual covid19 public health threat which is mostly delta but it's the virus infecting the 10 to 20 million american americans who are still at significant risk these are adults who have no natural immunity and no vaccinated immunity and they continue to show up in the hospital and go on ventilators and that is a problem that is a real problem and it's it's very precise it's about 10 to 20 million adults with no immunity whatsoever and they're going to keep showing up in the hospital and it's going to be during the viral seasons and we can't downplay that that is still a problem we still got to encourage them to get vaccinated but the separate thing going on is that 250 million americans have some form of immunity and they're at risk of mild illness and we're waging world war 3 to transiently beat back a mild infection or one that doesn't result in hospitalizations and we we're not putting that in context and if you say anything to say hey we've got to learn to live with this it's like hey there are still people dying but yes those that's a very precise group of adults with no immunity and some very older people with who are unboosted who are coming to the hospital about seven thousand americans a day are coming to the hospital being hospitalized with covid about 7 000 of them have no immunity these are adults often with a risk factor like obesity which we don't talk about and about 700 or so are unboosted older people so that is a very precise problem that's addressable but look what we're doing to the 250 million american or everyone else out there we're holding them hostage right now saying you've got to take this seriously and go and just you know make significant sacrifices here's what i think the end point is people are fed up they're pushing back and here's what the australian prime minister just said now if you remember australia had the toughest lockdowns maybe in the world draconian this is where sort of zero covid was a goal that's right yeah yeah that's right so they did a total 180 i mean they saw people just you know protest this and say look we're not we're not we don't want to live like this they did a total 180 on their lockdowns and the australian prime minister just made this statement very publicly he said we've got to get past the heavy hand of government we've got to treat people like adults we have to move from a culture of mandates to a culture of responsibility that's how we're going to live with this virus in the future and that could not summarize it better in my opinion all of this relates down to the form and function of covid so our response right so the form takes all kinds of different forms as masks and mandates and lockdowns and schools and so on and so forth but what's the function of it the function of it is to obtain some outcome that we all agree is reasonable well i think it's reasonable to say we don't want our hospitals to have bodies piling up in the er parking lot well so when and how did this happen well occasionally it did happen in certain areas but on mass it has not is it happening now well so far we're not seeing it with omicron how do we prevent it well targeted focused protection of the groups that marty mentioned that are still at risk is the highest yield way to do it boosting and triple vaccinating a 16 you know an 18 year old college student is not a high yield way to do it especially when the rest of the world is still begging for vaccine so there are policy solutions to get the function that we want using forms that are less disruptive and i think i don't know peter you shared with me like what ontario's hospital numbers look like in their icu utilization and yet they're going on lockdown and i looked at those numbers and i was like man peter like i've taken calls with more icu beds full than that like why would they shut down an entire province for this i mean i'm curious what your thoughts are well again it comes back to the price that will be paid for this uh do we have data on what the last year has done to the vaccination rates for children vaccines like mmr and things like that have we seen a noticeable shift so so the kids who should be getting those vaccines now what's happening are we seeing it go up down so i don't know if marty has the specific data but i've seen articles written about this and the at least on an anecdotal level kids going in for routine vaccinations have dropped dramatically into the more like the 80 ish range because again parents are frightened and there's also a backlash against vaccines in general it's a complex scenario but what will the outcome of that be right that's a huge open question i've said this now at least twice but i i just can't say it enough which is what is the what is the long-term consequence of this for a generation all the people who have been marginalized all the people who have been dismissed in their concerns all the people who have been told you are a horrible human being for questioning a vaccine you are a horrible human being for not getting a booster shot you are i mean i just wonder what the so let's assume let's come at this from the lens of the people in power want to stay in power that's a natural human reaction i'm sure if i was in power i'd want to stay in power so so if you're in power you want to stay in power and presumably staying in power has something to do with the people who put you in power keep you in power don't you think there would be some logic that would say i want to make sure that if i want to stay in power as long as possible i should take the most long-term view of doing what is best and yet you just see this doubling down on things that seem less and less logical so in other words with a very myopic view of power again totally not the right way one should be thinking about this but just as you know we're trying to think about omicron through the lens of evolution i'm just trying to think of the natural history of power and wanting to consolidate it and preserve it as long as possible this is not even in the best interest of those in power feeder is just so logical right it's it's just one of these things where it's please don't be so logical because what you're saying is making so much sense i think people at very high levels got a taste of what it's like to be king and they've got the keys and they don't they don't want to hand it back over it's just a theory but i don't think our policymakers are getting good medical advice look at what happened as soon as omicron cropped up in south africa immediately our public health officials retreated to the one blunt tool that they know which is we gotta now give everyone a third dose across the board including young people now older people there's data and young people there is not data to support it masks half of new york city closed down what about therapeutics what about learning to live with it what about all these other things and what you saw is this retreat to the same blunt tools that we've had and not start talking about pax levitt and fluvoxamine and treatment and learning to live with it you know peter i think i think you again your rational thinking is not exactly how politicians actually tribalize in our world now where it's tribal identity and it's a badge of identity to say oh no no i believe in this and this and this and this regardless of what the long-term outcome is i know it will rally my base i know it will you know it's covidien's versus covidius right it's the people who uh on the left feel this way about all these responses because it's been politicized that way and the right feel this way and so in a way they're playing broadly to their base like what do they do when omicron happen this they stop travel to south africa because that's easy that's a politically expedient thing except for the south africans who suffer and the americans who have family there and others and of course omicron's already everywhere which we were saying from the beginning so that blunt tool did absolutely nothing but it's it's politically expedient if you look at what say the administration's doing now well the key thing is keep case numbers down because if case numbers are high then it's going to be much trickier to get reelected say well then so what do you do you want to make sure you get as many people vaccinated and do the kind of blunt instruments that try to reduce cases which is surprising that they're actually encouraging testing because that's going to actually increase the number of cases trump was very explicit he's like don't test you won't see any cases you know don't let the diamond princess dock because it'll triple our cases he was at least quite explicit about it what he was doing so i think it's quite complicated and and there's this weird political tribalization that makes it irrational to people who are looking at it from an objective standpoint you said you said earlier something that i i think is also interesting which is like sort of what did you call them the covidiets and the kovidians kavidians right so i can't describe myself as either i know the caricature of what both of those represent because i've interacted stupidly against my better judgment with both of them and i feel like i'm trying to understand what's your guess on how many people are in the middle so on the one hand it's this is a conspiracy the whole purpose of this thing is so pharma can make more money blah blah blah the only thing that works is ivermectin like you've got that whole sort of group and then you've got the people we've largely been talking about here sort of everyone needs to have a booster every monday and we never ever want to see the world as it was in 2019 again until this virus goes the way of smallpox yes this virus will one day be in a museum and until that time it is a zero covered policy world so you've got so so how many people are not at one of those polls that's the operative question and i'll tell you my experience with my platform is we have created what we call this alt middle and it's not a politically central position it is the synthesis position so if you consider covidiens to be the thesis position peter lindbergh of the stoa talks about this the thesis position that lockdown zero covid vaccines for everyone mandates closed schools that position his thesis antithesis position is the other position you described the ivermectin therapeutics this is all about control the thing is not as serious as we think et cetera what is the synthesis of those positions where do you find truth there's everything is a little bit partial so this alt middle perspective is you can call it the center but it's really a synthesis position an integral holistic position i would say and every single political group says this that there's a silent majority of people who actually if you really ask them and you tell them well let's think about it this way forget about all the sound bites forget about twitter let's just talk they will espouse an alt-middle synthesis position or will resonate with it in a way that is really quite profound which means common sense is there i think critical thinking is there if you walk people through it a little bit and to a one i've never talked to a thesis or antithesis person in person that hasn't ultimately settled on a more synthesis position so it makes me think there's hope but the way we're doing it publicly is we're rewarded for polarizing into one of the extremes covidien covidient thesis antithesis and what we need to do is change our basic structure so that we reward a more alt middle kind of perspective i don't know how to do that honestly it's very similar by the way with kind of woke ideology on the one hand you have the people that in theory the woke ideologues are there to rally against right the true racists the true sexists the the true people who are you know think trans people should be killed or something like that so you have those people and then you have kind of the woke ideologues and i think you have most people in the middle that think this is crazy why can't why can't there be shades of gray here why is this why is this such a bipolar issue with no as you say no dialectical synthesis so this is why a podcast like rogan's is so popular because he actually very often espouses a synthesis rationalist position even when he entertains kind of people on the show that are really more antithesis or more synthesis you know like a peter mccullough vaccine guy he is you know when you were on the show too i was watching going oh this is the synthesis position you're poking fun at all the extremes of this and there's not very many rational people in the united states who would really want to hurt a trans person or really want to exclude somebody based on their sexual orientation or their race right consciously they would not want to do that and i think we could because we've had progress we've had decades of progress on this and so what we see though is that in order to belong in an atomized world in a tribe that you can identify with you take a much more extreme us versus them position and i think the woke ideologues are in that and what it does is it diminishes real racism real inequity the fact that you know we talk about covidius well are you going to call a african american like a black person in baltimore who's afraid because of tuskegee and a long history of medical abuse of getting a vaccine you're going to call them a covidian what is how are you going to reconcile that with your apparent wokeness right so it just generates a ton of cognitive dissonance until you can see this from a integral perspective that all this stuff has a bit of truth and partiality to it and you're always trying to synthesize something that's evolving like an organism towards something that's more true which means you also have to assume in most people good intent which we have trouble doing because we are tribal creatures that like to villainize out group and so getting over that assuming good intent i think you might have said this on rogan man if we were able to actually get in people's head maybe rogan said that and assume oh no they're actually well intentioned well that already levels the playing ground that now you can have a conversation i remember that that was a really great insight from joe which was you could totally eliminate racism or at least distill it down to the true races if you had mind-reading software once you had mind-reading software this issue of intent mattering you know because we were debating whether or not intent mattered which of course it does right but yeah no that's that's a fair point i want to say something else this is kind of a mia culpa i feel my tribalism more than i've ever felt it around this you know i remember a few months ago somebody sent me an image of a woman on twitter i think she was a pediatrician and she's clearly uh we're going to zero kovid philosophy or at least that's i shouldn't even say she's here you know that that was my inference based on what she had just posted which was a picture of her and her three kids at a grocery store they were in masks face shields ppe and this was this was not in 2020 this was like literally this summer and you know her comment like she was posting this picture very proudly with her and her three kids and and making a comment like this is how we roll n95 face shield this this this i mean you couldn't see her kids you literally would have seen more of them if they were girls in riyadh that's how little you could see these poor little kids that looked like they were none of them over 10. and i can't tell you why but i got really pissed i got so pissed at her i don't know her i don't know anything about her i don't know her story i mean i replied on twitter in some snarky response to the effect of please tell me your kids are immunocompromised like why on earth would you do this to them otherwise but it's that particular interaction has stayed with me so far because of how much it worries me about what i've become in this how have i become so angry at both extremes here first of all i'm really impressed that you have enough self-awareness to recognize that because most people don't i'm with you on this i think what you're expressing is the righteous indignation of the alt middle it is this like wait this is insane just like when you see somebody talking about this whole thing's a hoax and you need to take ivermectin bid for the rest of your life that's insane and it generates a kind of a moral outrage right based on our own moral palate of what we find valuable now what i what i'll add one other piece to this is that this has been potentiated by a collective anxiety of a contagion of marty calls it the pandemic of lunacy that is we are social creatures too so as much as we try to hide from it we're connected to others and this general level of anxiety and panic and disruption and social fabric tearing has then it feeds back on us as individuals because we're also part of a whole and that gen that generates that and that's why things like twitter really weaponize this like i try to stay away from twitter now because i know i feel it and you know who's my who's my you know if you think of this as a nuclear reactor and i'm about to blow i'm going to go to go chernobyl and the top's going to blow out you know it's going to be fallout all over the country the person who is my graphite control rod is my wife because what will happen is i'll see something on twitter and it'll be like you peter it'll be like a family of people like stay hashtag stay home and it'll they've got 13 pronouns in their description and they've got 14 masks on their avatar and they've put somehow like bend the curve in their name and i'm so triggered because i'm just outraged by they don't see the other downstream side effects of their approach and i'll start ranting and raving to my wife and these people are idiots i bet they're all over stanford where you work and this and that and the other thing and she's like could it be possible that and what she'll do should go could it be that that person is going through this and this and this and they're seeing it this way and they've been also paralyzed by fear from this and you're demonizing them as a bad person but they're actually a good person and you can just see like she's lowered the control rod and suddenly i have empathy for this person and suddenly i'm like okay all right okay all right but we're humans that's just how we react the thing is we've potentiated it on mass now with technology that hacks our dopamine drive to go in group out groups so i don't know i don't know marty what do you think it's a really good point that you're both raising here and i think we need to do everything we can to stand against tribalism i think we all of us can do that we can be role models to others we can listen to others we can admit when we're wrong i mean these are characteristics that are being completely lost in the echo chambers of cable news and hearing what you want to hear so you're living in an alternate reality because big tech is feeding you news that actually makes the other side look like they're crazy right because that's how the news has framed their position and you can't see it any other way so i love the rogan interview with peter and i think that's part of what we're not talking about in society that we need to talk about and we got to fix this because the next pandemic is probably going to be more severe you know we have we've had a number in our lifetime i mean beginning with polio older patients tell me what it was like going through the polio epidemic h1n1 sars mers ebola zika i mean we've gotten lucky we've skimmed the trees on a couple of these but the next pandemic that's going to be a major serious pandemic maybe antimicrobial resistance which is increasing each year maybe an influenza virus this covet 19 virus had an overall global case fatality rate for infection fatality rate somewhere around two tenths of one percent somewhere in that ballpark right well what if it's two percent with a strain of influenza and we've got this polarized echo chamber of hearing news and the politicalization of the human immune system where the bnt cells have joined the republican party and the antibodies you know non-neutralizing antibodies have joined the democrat party we can't do this in the future we're going to need diverse opinions an open form of discussion honesty humility and i'm concerned where we are leaving in terms of our situation at the end of this pandemic here yeah i got to be honest with you i'm not optimistic i mean i'm going to probably focus most of my energy on controlling myself which the easiest step on that is literally not looking at twitter that's that's and like i don't i spend very little time on twitter like i mean less than i mean i really don't spend much time on it the problem is like any amount of time on it seems to be annoying it's like you could spend 30 minutes a week on twitter and that's i have to think it's an anti-longevity agent right there i mean that's got there's got to be a study that will demonstrate that you know an hour a week on twitter will shorten your life expectancy by a year and more importantly will reduce your happiness all along the way because it just i mean i think there are people who are really good at twitter who just love to be incendiary and it doesn't bug them and nothing bugs them they just love to carpet bomb for fun but like if you actually think you're trying to make a point and engage which you know sometimes i do i think there's no upside yeah i agree it's it's a bad format in general for that you said something that i think is key that i wish more people would say which is i'm going to focus on me right like so much especially with guys you know we're so bad at dealing with our own internal states whether it's emotional states whether it's cognitive states that we repress deny and then project everything out into the world and we create the world that we hate because it's a reflection of our internal state and you know there there was an indian sage nisargadatta who said uh you know some dude asked him you know it was the book was like a bunch of like americans come to him and ask him a bunch of questions of this guru in india and there's one kid asked him it's in the 70s or whatever and he's like man there's so much war and stuff we need to like reform the world man the world's so broken you're sitting here in this cave meditating what's wrong with you and he's like listen buddy he's like don't be talking about i don't know why i'm suddenly doing my dad don't be talking about the reforms okay mind the reformer itself look inside you're creating your own situation until that internal conflict that's generating this unhappiness is pacified you're never going to see the world that you want to see and i think there's a lot there which means we have to be self-aware okay if twitter is bad for us if it really hacks our neural circuitry that causes us un discomfort and lack of longevity which i agree with you peter for me it does that's why i just i what i do is i dump and run i do the rogan i'll like dump a video there i'm like okay guys have fun with this and i'm out and then every now and again i'll be sitting on the pot and i'll open up twitter because i'm like hey what's going on on twitter and i'm like oh this went nuts this is not good another thing i want to maybe this is maybe a better question for you marty but what what can parents do because that's the demographic i find myself most concerned with right now is this this group of you know what are we going to call alt-middle folks who absolutely believe in science certainly understand the benefits of vaccines understand why we needed to do what we needed to do 18 months ago but today i mean these are the calls i get a lot of is hey you know my kids still are wearing masks every day in schools they're not being permitted to play sports if they're not vaccinated these are healthy 12 year old kids that are not permitted to play sports unless they get vaccinated i feel very fortunate right i live in a state that doesn't exactly believe in the government controlling you and therefore from the minute we've you know we've been here for 15 months school's never been shut down for a day our kids are not in masks or you know it's masks optional so my kids are not in masks no restriction on sports you know that kind of stuff i feel very fortunate what do parents do who don't live in these states i mean what you said earlier marty this is only going to change when enough people get pissed about it and the policy makers basically realize oh my god i'm going to get voted out of office as a result of this and by the way how do you do that with health advocates because they're not really on the hook for votes you have sort of two layers of this here which makes it a little more complicated right yeah well i think a lot of people are getting fed up right now and and this country has a democracy and the democracy does work it can take time but elections are already showing polling right now that people want a reasonable approach and for parents they should demand an endpoint to restrictions in the schools if there is a policy that they have no control over they should demand an end point when we put in so many restrictions in schools be it the plexiglass which ironically could reduce ventilation and airflow in a classroom and kids have to cover their faces with a cloth mask which the study run out of stanford and bangladesh showed had really no impact at all in transmission just such a poor quality mask or a vaccine mandate or a booster mandate which is what you know the bandwagon of the lunacy of what colleges are jumping into right now they should demand endpoints to these things you know at what point watch the pharma industry change the language and i i predict this will happen from a booster to annual boost have you gotten your annual booster it may be then you know we get a new variant they pop up a new booster in a six month interval the language will change to are you up to date like it's software and people that are chasing this may be getting boosters you know they may look back in 20 years and realize hey i just got 15 boosters for what people should demand an end point they should demand criteria to remove the masks they were put in place with no criteria to remove them they should ask their pediatrician about a single dose of the pfizer vaccine for their child that's a reasonable option it can depend on a lot of factors and maybe they have concerns maybe their pediatrician sees a risk factor in the child and thinks one dose would be safer spacing out the doses ask about natural immunity there's people with natural immunities should feel good about their immune protection so i think these are the things people need to talk about and ask about and vote on come election time i want to ask both you guys this question who are the people that you find to be voices of reason in this who do you who do you like to read who do you like to listen to zubin you you work pretty closely with vinai prasad i find him to be just another amazing example of a thoughtful person in the middle who's rational any other folks we can point people in the direction of besides the two of you guys i'm personally a fan of dr monica gandhi ucsf infectious disease doctor she's been a voice of reason calm she also has a really beautiful maternal kind of wisdom about her that she gives off that's a good contrast to a lot of the talking hazard guys and she's very smart about it and actually if you talk to her offline she is very much obsessed with getting us back to living instead of living in fear all the time and part you know part of the reason she was such a big advocate of even cloth masks in the early days of the pandemic is she felt that look if it lowers inoculum a little bit it'll prevent some severe disease but the main thing is it'll get people out there stop these lockdowns open up our schools these kind of things and and so she's a pragmatist very very smart and data-driven gal marty who's who's on your short list there's really just one person and that's dr anthony fauci no no in all fairness he is a true gentleman uh if you've ever interacted with him and he's a very nice guy i just have had different opinions on how to manage the covet strategy on almost every single aspect of the pandemic but to answer your question monica gandhi is terrific she's got a great sort of feed that she puts out she's got a site and a twitter feed that's got great information amish adulja from johns hopkins peter you've had him on i think early in the in the pandemic he's as correct as i think anyway everyone's been wrong every expert's been wrong every expert missed india and delta and so many other things but he's been as correct i think martin kaldorf he's the gentleman from harvard who's now with brownstone institute puts out great information and i would say more importantly i do not listen to anyone who's a politically appointed physician anyone current past or future if someone trying to become a politically appointed physician or was i just block them right out and i go to these go-to people who i trust can i add a couple here like so this interesting because i agree marty like i actually will even take it a step further and go someone who's very politically angled on on social media who's taking very strong political stances i don't trust them either just because they aren't able to disambiguate that tribalism from their recommendations i actually am a big fan of john mandrella he's a ep doc cardi cardiologist on twitter he's done good work in this space and has been very rational the other person and i don't know peter if you know this guy or if you guys have had conflict in the past because he's more of a vegan dude who i used to have a little bit of beef with but now i'm convinced he's been very rational on on this pandemic is david katz actually out of yale and he's really written extensively very heterodox like stuff that would get you booted out of the tribe basically saying hey we should look at the big picture here we need to look at the harms and the benefits to society and and he's been very rational as written very eloquently an alt middle synthesis of this pandemic the only thing i would add to that guys is by the way i don't even know everybody on the list that you guys have mentioned that's how little i'm personally paying attention to this but i'll i'll now start paying attention to some of those folks sporadically i don't want to i have no desire to spend too much time on this as a general principle i have no trust in people who can't change their opinion so when i encounter a person who says the exact same thing over and over and over and over and over again and when you ask them do you feel differently about this now versus you know six months ago or a year ago or 18 months ago the answer is nope nope double down double down double down no matter what they're talking about it doesn't guarantee that they're full of but it is it increases the pretest probability significantly yeah yeah like school closures last year and if anyone who called for school closures has not come out and said you know we got this terribly wrong and it disproportionately affected poor and minority communities i feel terrible then you know i've written them off yeah it's hard to trust them actually what peter's pointing at i think is something that i talk about when i talk about alt middle which is you should be able to question every single one of your beliefs because there's really you know if you're sticking to one single view either you're probably missing something the only belief that i think is a little bit beyond question is that you should always question your beliefs so it's like a meta belief about belief i think people who hold that where they hold their beliefs loosely based on new evidence and persuasion and so on but they're not wishy-washy they're not just going where the wind goes i think those are the people that are the most trustworthy and who are able to call out their own biases and say when they're wrong and also celebrate when they're correct and go listen this is this gives me some credibility i was right about this and this and this i was wrong about this for these reasons and this is how it's changed my thinking yeah the best investors will tell you they have very strong convictions loosely held ah and so i've always loved that mantra right strong convictions loosely held and what's interesting is i assumed we'd be fifty percent sort of fact fifty percent opinion i think a little more on the opinion side but what's really interesting is there's nobody who's successfully running a hedge fund on the mantra of i'm always right because in the hedge fund space it kind of doesn't matter what you think it matters how much money you make and the dollars always decide so if you just say i'm always right i'm always right i'm never willing to change my point of view in the presence of new information you're going to end up losing money eventually if you can be malleable and say this is my point of view based on the available data hey there's new data i'm going to change my point of view there's just no comparison in the long term success of those two investment strategies and so it all kind of shakes itself out it's very interesting that in policy in medicine even the system of reward is so uncoupled from the outcome that there's mass confusion around this and that's why it's very difficult to suss out the really good critical thinkers versus the not so good critical thinkers ah that's a that's a great point great analogy actually i think more people would benefit from having some of those endpoints sync with that kind of thinking in medicine because you're right they're disambiguated they're completely disengaged in fact it's even hard to know what outcomes like if you're talking about improving a healthcare system okay so what are the what are your endpoints what are you trying to do exactly well we want a lower hemoglobin a1c okay but is that really what you want or do you want this 62 year old hispanic grandfather to be able to see the graduation of their kid with decent faculty's decent vision okay that's a different endpoint than a hemoglobin a1c so how are you going to do that and how are you going to measure that so because it's a complex human system that's where it becomes so so interesting and difficult but how is it that different than the financial system the financial system is exceedingly complex it's just the measurement outcome is dollars it's much simpler and that's it the measurement outcome is unambiguous yeah right yeah it's very binary and it's very unambiguous and you see it in the style of patient management among physicians in the hospital i mean think about being on rounds in the icu um peter when you know when we were doing that together the doctors who say you know i thought this patient was not going to benefit from steroids but now it looks like they have a nice response let's go ahead and continue this therapy the people who constantly pivoted re-evaluated evolve their position based on information they were the best doctors the the ones who shut down suggestions by a student on the team who says you know i i read this and they said it's a dumb idea that's not going to work those were early predictors of not just who was going to be a great physician but who is going to be a great person down the road and the one criticism that irks me that gets thrown at the government and i've got plenty of criticisms for the government but the one criticism that i hear that i'm not on board with this when they say oh they're flip-flopping well they should this is you know this is not some political philosophy you got to dig in on they should they should constantly be changing i'm glad you said that marty because i completely agree with that and i think it's a very important distinction to make to me it is not a problem when an advocate or policymaker says this is the way we're going to do things actually this is not the way we're going to do things we're going to change situations change right no new taxes guess what when george h.w bush said no new taxes there wasn't there wasn't a recession going on there was a recession going on it wasn't a popular thing to do it got them outvoted but politicians get hammered when they change their mind which is why i would never wish being a politician on my worst enemy but it is a bit of an unfair criticism when we say in defense of the criticism now i will say this it's because it's typically done with a lack of transparency yeah you know relating to that is an interesting piece of this is this idea of persuasion so how are you going to persuade somebody of something you think is important based on the data that you have if you do not show them that you're flexible in your thinking but firm in your convictions loosely held and that new data would change your mind and i get a lot of emails saying you're the only person who convinced me to vaccinate i was so angry with biden or whoever for mandating this and they talk to me like i'm stupid and it seems like they don't recognize myocarditis and all these other things but you guys talk about it and yet you still say okay i think this is important for people like yourself and so on and so i get email after email saying you have convinced me but then in the same breath i get the dogmatists saying hey you're like some kind of anti-vaxxer you know you're you're holding back the cause and it's like well i wish you could look at my inbox then right you do need that flexibility now i'm not saying i'm perfect at that i'm very there's things i i need a lot of work on but at least it's on the radar right and i think um peter thinks this way that's why we all kind of gravitate to each other right peter and marty and me we were like oh no no there's something about you get the vibe this is someone who thinks independently and is able to change their mind and is it curious and so on and i think that sets an example for other people that you're mentoring or teaching or whatever and we see it in the hospital all the time you know those attendings right gentlemen i i feel like we could keep talking but i feel like we've also sort of provided i think hopefully some a some information for folks with respect to omicron a little bit of clarity around what we do and don't know about the the utility of vaccines the potential risks of vaccines i think we've also shared our biases right i think i guess we haven't explicitly stated it but i think we're all pretty anti-mandate at least given the current facts i love i don't one of you made this i think it was you marty it might be a reasonable idea to mandate parachutes if people are jumping at 10 000 feet it might be entirely another thing to not mandate parachutes when people are jumping from 15 feet into the water so you have to know the situation you can't just say we must do this we must never do that so i love that analogy and i think given where we are now i realize the amount of criticism i face for being against mandates but i think you got to let your you got your conscience has to speak on this and i think it's wrong yeah we got to treat people like adults strong convictions loosely held yeah that's right maybe maybe in the maybe in the presence of new information i'll change that conviction but given the evidence i have today it's a pretty strong conviction yeah uh gents thank you so much and i really hope we don't have to do this again i hope so too i hope we can just talk about what it was like in the hospital back in the 90s and 2000s because that's funny and concerning on many many levels and if you do figure out how to get that epididymal taser thing working you let me know because i really could use that device listen guys i am the patent holder for the pkg the prostatocardiogram uh i put a couple leads one on the on the perineum a couple on each testicle and i get a pkg sometimes you go into pfib where your prostate is just fibrillating at which point you get a high output failure you know i haven't fully thought it out but i'm hoping to help peter to your connections i can get an investment in marty through your political connections i can get some buy-in from policy but the pkg a prosthetic defibrillator in every closet i think is what i'm hoping for policy-wise you'll mandate it of course right of course i will candidate i mean with operative the word man in there because it's it's mostly for men but again i want to be gender neutral about this all right gentlemen thank you enjoy the remainder of your holiday season okay you too good to see you peter good to see you
