Stephan Guyenet is a neuroscientist focused on the neuroscience of obesity and energy homeostasis.  He is the author of the book, The Hungry Brain and founder/ director of Red Pen Reviews. In this episode, Stephan explains how obesity has changed phenotypically over the course of human history as well as what might explain the dramatic increase in prevalence of obesity in the last few decades. He talks in depth about the role of genetics, the brain, and hormones like leptin play in the regulation of fat mass. He dives deep into two common theories of obesity—the carbohydrate-insulin model and the energy balance model and provides his take on which theory has stronger evidence. Additionally, he provides insights on how we’re hard-wired to think about food and the consequences of modern foods designed for maximal pleasure. Finally, he goes through the factors that affect body weight, set points, and provides takeaways for people wanting to take advantage of what we know about the brain’s role in regulating our body weight.

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia hey stefan thanks so much for making time i've been looking forward to this for such a long time uh probably since i started a podcast which has been now we're coming up on four years i always knew we'd have to sit down so i'm glad we're finally doing this albeit not in not in person but that's more an artifact of my laziness so anyway you know again look i think a lot of people listening to this uh will be familiar with with you and your work but i think a number of people won't be so um let's tell people a little bit about kind of uh your path to to where you are now which is sort of being one of the most uh thoughtful people on the on the nuances of obesity um what what did you study in college were you a neuroscience major biochem yeah but i had a neuroscience in mind when i was doing biochem my idea at the time is that it would provide a foundation for going into neuroscience later which i'm not sure that uh reasoning really works out so well but um it worked out okay in the end and did you go straight from your undergrad to mike schwartz's lab or did you do your phd with mike schwartz or a postdoc postdoc okay yeah where did you do your phd phd was with alispada at the university of washington studying neurodegenerative disease interesting so tell me about that was that uh a detour that was always part of the plan or at that point were you not yet fully interested in obesity yeah i think more the latter so um i've always been fascinated by the brain but i didn't know which area of neuroscience i wanted to get into for a long time and i became interested in neurodegenerative disease for a few different reasons one they're just absolutely horrible diseases and two my grandmother had alzheimer's disease and the um but so in in grad school i was studying neurodegenerative disease but i wasn't studying alzheimer's disease i was studying a class of neurodegenerative diseases called triplet repeat diseases that includes huntington's disease or polyglutamine repeat diseases would be another uh name for them so huntington's disease is the most common that's the most common heritable um heritable and neurodegenerative disease but as you said it's it's an absolutely awful disease with i mean almost 100 penetrance correct i mean it's a deterministic gene well it's actually more complex and interesting than that it's actually the the genetics of it are real interesting because they are non-mendelian because the length of the cag repeat actually changes intergenerationally the weird thing about it is there's there's these cag repeats that code for polyglutamines polyglutamine stretches in the protein they are unstable in replication and so what you tend to see is an enlargement of these polyglutamine repeats from one generation to the next and so um yeah so it has this really weird um non-mendelian pattern i think i think okay you asked specifically about penetrance i think the penetrance actually is pretty high so in other words if you have a polyglutamine repeat in the wrong protein of a certain length yes i think very high likelihood you're gonna you're gonna develop the disease um but like anything it it is not you know 100 fixed but i don't think we really understand what makes it not fixed um but i was i was studying a uh one of the less common ones called sca7 spino cerebellar ataxia type 7 and uh you know it's an interesting disease it's a neurodegenerative disease with some relevance to other more common neurodegenerative disease but um i used to joke that there were probably more scientists studying it than people with the actual disorder i don't think that's actually true but um i think you get the the point of the joke um and i just kind of wanted to study something with greater impact and i also i've always been interested in fitness and nutrition kind of on a personal level and so when i started learning about the neuroscience of obesity during my phd work i got really into it because that was a way to kind of satisfy my criteria for something that's impactful it's hard to imagine much that's more impactful than that in the world we live in it's very common it um [Music] is it relates to my interest in fitness and health and it has a strong relationship with neuroscience and so once once i figured that out which i think to a lot of people is not obvious the relationship with neuroscience i think that's a topic we'll get into but once i figured that out i started realizing that not only was this really fascinating but there was a ton of information in the space that was incredibly enlightening that was not making it to the public what year did you finish your phd 2009 i think okay and did and mike schwartz was also at the university of washington correct correct at what point as you were wrapping up your phd did you connect with mike and uh or at least become familiar enough with his work that you thought you know this is kind of my finishing school yeah i'm not sure i i um i don't remember exactly what all the options were that i was considering but i was particularly interested in obesity and staying at the same institution after your phd is atypical it's something that i wanted to do in part for personal reasons um i don't i'm not really a big fan of the typical academic thing of it's almost like a military life you know you're moving around like five or more times before you you finally settle down um so that was part of it but mike was also a really good fit and there are other labs that could have been a good fit in other places but mike's lab was a really good fit and he was willing so i uh i did that and god i think that i feel like the first time you and i met would have been probably at a conference in 2012 um and i'm guessing you had had you just finished by then had you just finished your postdoc were you wrapping it up then that um would have been close to the end of it yeah i was i think i was a post-doc until 2013 so it would have been approaching the end of it wow it's hard to believe that's 10 years ago i still remember all that stuff pretty well so so let's let's tell people a little bit about the problem that you work on today um i think everybody knows directionally that obesity is a significant issue but you can probably quantify this for people a little bit better and help people understand maybe even over a few thousand years how things have changed in terms of the uh let's just talk about the phenotype we're going to obviously talk about the environment and the triggers but let's just talk phenotypically how have we as a species who you know we've been around what maybe six million years in our current rendition but what's changed over the last thousand a thousand years in terms of our phenotype yeah so if we're talk if we're comparing the uh body shape of people in modern affluent societies like the united states to what the typical human would have looked like a thousand years ago i think it's clear that we're much fatter today on average with a much higher percentage of obesity and a thousand years ago there was obesity i mean we have evidence even from egyptian mummies that among the wealthy there was obesity not to say that it necessarily was super common but i don't think it was that uncommon um among the wealthy i think probably for similar reasons that we have obesity today but um certainly the prevalence was much lower and when we start to get into the more modern historical period where we start to actually get data on this the first data that we can find on this in the united states or at least that i have found that is somewhat informative are from [Music] civil war veterans from 1890 and 1900 they did height and weight measurements on middle-aged civil war veterans so these people were i think almost exclusively white men however if you compare to the same demographic so middle-aged white men today you see that there was almost no obesity back then and today the obesity rate is something like for probably 45 for that same demographic and just to be clear we're defining obesity in the most traditional way which is the use of body mass index and we're defining it as a bmi of more than 30 correct yeah correct and so yeah so the advantage of bmi is it's really easy to measure and you can calculate it from these really simple measures that go back a long time unfortunately they didn't have decks of machines yeah exactly 1890 which would have been of course a more informative way of looking at it um but yeah using measures that we can compare over long periods of time like body mass index i don't remember the exact numbers but it was like a few percent it was like low single digits of people actually classified as bmi over 30 at that time 120 130 years ago and then if we um [Music] look toward more recent data what we see is that between so the first the first really good data we have starts in the 1960s for the united states that's when the uh nhes surveys started which later became nhanes and in those surveys what you see is by the time they started measuring it it had already gone up from that previous time in the in the late 1800s early 1900s so you're saying stefan that there really wasn't a lot of longitudinal data from 1900 to 1960 that that kind of can you know to check what that trend line was doing it was sort of this big effort in 1900 and then another big effort didn't take place till about 1960. yeah i mean i i don't know that i'd call it a big effort but the biggest that i'm aware of in the late in the the one in the the late 1800s early 1900s um and then the true like true representative national sampling started in the 1960s and then got better through the 70s and and now we have this this um nhanes survey methodology that is the best source of evidence that we have and so it started started getting good in the 60s and what were those levels there stefan in the 1960s yeah i think the earliest measures we have are like something like i don't remember the exact figure but it's like 12 of us adults had obesity at that time something like that in the earliest measures and do you have a sense of because i'm sure this is going to become more relevant today is looking at what what is the term that's used if bmi is over 35 isn't there a extreme category of obesity yeah or morbid obesity is that defined as 35 or four yeah i think the terminology has changed to you know try to avoid stigma uh it has been extreme obesity or morbid obesity i can't remember what the current um term is for it but yeah there's a category over 35 as well and and presumably there's been a change in that as well i'm i wouldn't be so yes yes sorry there's a class system so class one class 2 class 3. so i think that corresponds to 30 35 and 40 if i'm not mistaken anyway you were saying yeah so so basically this progression was not just at the kind of median level because i'm sure the median bmi was also moving the mean bmi was also moving the fraction over 30 and presumably the fraction over whatever that highest threshold is be it 35 or 40. yes and actually the most extreme changes happened in more severe obesity so you see very very little very very few people had bmis over 35 in the earliest measures and then now it's like it's it's something like nine or ten percent today so um of of adults so there has been uh more movement at the extreme end then than at the mean yes and um and that's what happens when a distribution spreads out which is what happened if you look at the the distribution of bmis it used to be a lot tighter and it just got less tight so there are still people who are lean there are still people in every bmi category just like there used to be but since it is spread out you get a disproportionate increase at extreme values what about underweight what was if you happen to know what was the fraction of underweight in 1900 if we would define that to say bmi below i don't know what it underweight is it's below 18 or below 20. and then how has that changed over time yeah typically the cutoff is 18.5 and i don't know the answer to your question i think it was higher than it is today uh but i'm not sure about that when did people first make the connection that there is an association between obesity and adverse health outcomes i mean presumably back when you think back to a thousand years ago or back with the egyptian you know uh aristocrats obesity probably would have been a sign of affluence and i don't think anybody would have looked down upon it too negatively when we back in medical school i remember learning about gout and how gout emerged around this time and it was really this disease of excess right excess alcohol excess sugar excess protein would manifest itself in gout and this was the ultimate rich man's disease uh basically a sign of affluence so i can't imagine people were too upset to be obese back then um when i mean we and of course today we take it for granted right i mean i think there's despite some of the the political pressure to uh understandably try to destigmatize obesity and somehow now suggest that it's completely completely healthy i think the reality of it is it's pretty unambiguous that obesity is indeed associated with poor health outcomes when did that become clear yeah that's a good question so i'm not real knowledgeable about the deep history of this but i know i've heard that uh you know there were physicians in ancient greece in india who recognized that being very heavy was associated with health problems such as having sweet tasting urine for example sign of type 2 diabetes or any kind of diabetes um and but i think yeah and then there were these insurance life tables um earl in the early 1900s that suggested that people who had obesity had shortened lifespans and greater risk of certain diseases but it actually became pretty controversial with a series of studies that was published catherine flegel was intimately involved in this work suggesting that there was actually not the relationship people thought there was between body mass index and mortality so these studies which were this was labeled as the obesity paradox because what they found is that there wasn't really much of an association between obesity and poor health outcomes and often if you look at the relationship between bmi and mortality if you just look at a graph of it the the nader the lowest point on that graph was in the overweight range or sometimes even on the low end of the obese range depending on what the study was and they were finding this in meta analyses of millions and millions of people and so suddenly people were saying well maybe higher body fatness is not bad maybe it's actually protective so there's been this this big debate about it um i think what has emerged in recent years especially the last 10 or 15 years and by the way let me take a step back the reason this is called a paradox is because there's all this evidence that excess body fat contributes to all kinds of diseases type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease certain cancers and so how could it be productive for mortality when it's driving all these diseases that are the leading causes of mortality so that's why it's called a paradox and i think the research that has come out since then is suggesting that it's probably not a paradox as paradoxes often are not and that it's a an artifact of those observational data that essentially there are probably a few different things going on but the biggest one is that people who are sick often lose weight so if you there are many different health conditions that can cause a person to lose weight so type 2 diabetes if it's not well controlled you can be losing weight certainly renal failure copd things like that yeah those are great examples alzheimer's disease cognitive decline those things can cause a person to lose weight and so there are many health conditions that can cause a person to lose weight and essentially the concern was that that makes leanness look worse than it really is because you're getting all these people in the lean category that are lean because they're sick they're not sick because they're lean so some people have called that reverse causation david allison corrected me it's technically um confounding that's right yeah you and david and i had a nice email exchange yeah because we did discuss this i'll share with you a very glib example i had shoulder surgery less than three weeks ago so in i don't know in the 18 days since i've had my shoulder operated on i've lost nine pounds now i don't know what my bmi was before versus after i probably went from bmi of 26 to bmi of 24. so on paper that looks good i would argue there is nothing about me today that is superior in health to where i was 18 days ago right if that of those nine pounds i've lost i'd be willing to bet seven of it is lean body mass so again it's a silly example but it illustrates that one can see an improvement in bmi with probably a deterioration in body composition and an increase in morbidity absolutely bmi is a crude measure you know no doubt about it it's useful i mean yeah you talked about this with with david allison in your episode and i think you guys had a nice conversation but cliff's notes is you know it's useful for population level studies it can be useful for screening but it's it's a crude measure um yeah so you know how do you get around this issue of confounding or reverse causality um there are some methods that have been developed for this one of them that i particularly like was developed by andrew stokes and his colleagues and that is the maximum attained weight method so instead of using the exposure variable except instead of looking for bmi right now and seeing that how that correlates with mortality risk right now you say what's the heaviest you've ever been and how does that correlate with your health outcomes and what you see when you do that so essentially that's saying like you know whatever health condition you've developed that might have caused you to to lose weight we're kind of screening that out we're looking before that and when you look at it that way you get a sharpening of the association between bmi and mortality and you find that the nader the lowest point shifts to a lower bmi so essentially whereas before it looked like maybe overweight was the best now you see that in the lean range looks the best and there's a stronger difference a larger difference between being lean and having obesity in terms of mortality so it really sharpens things up and the reason that happens is because when he looked into this you're excluding a bunch of people who were formerly in the obese or overweight category and went into a lower category and those people if you look at their health outcomes they're terrible so those people who used to have obesity and now just are overweight or are lean those people have massively elevated rates of chronic disease and of mortality and so they're essentially uh bringing all this excess mortality into lower weight categories and why why is that seven because that's almost sounds like the worst news you could ever hear right it would suggest that if your bmi is 33 all hope is lost that your fate was sealed the moment you hit that bmi you know what just dig in and eat more haagen-dazs because you know if you if you bring that bmi down to 26 you don't assume the health of the 26 you bring the health of the 33 which that doesn't sound right either right no it's not right and this is another limitation of the observational data because these people so it's hard to lose weight right and so most of these people it's hard to lose a lot of weight it's hard to change it off yeah it's hard to go from 35 to 25 bmi that's a lot of weight loss most people frankly are not able to achieve that and maintain it and so through voluntary means and so these people who are losing weight it's predominantly unintentional weight loss this is not people who start a diet and lifestyle plan and lose a bunch of weight this is predominantly people who are losing weight unintentionally and as a doctor i'm sure you know this when a person starts losing a bunch of weight for no reason that's probably not a good sign right even if they start off overweight and they're and they're lean maybe they even look good that's probably going to start ringing alarm bells um so if you look at studies that have measured the impact of intentional weight loss on mortality this has been done both for diet and lifestyle weight loss randomized controlled trials so you know we're talking about good quality of evidence and also for bariatric surgery you see a reduction in all-cause mortality that's how i was going to ask you i was gonna say how does bariatric surgery and pretty soon i'm very be very curious how does semigluetite affect this it's too soon to say but when we start to look at what i think is the most impressive weight loss drug out there and then of course when you think about ruin y gastric bypass which has been around for a while it'll be interesting over time to see if that can flip that paradigm huh well we have data for type 2 diabetes for people with type 2 diabetes for smagletite and it does reduce all-cause mortality in meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials so it will be interesting to see whether that extends to people without type 2 diabetes obviously people with diabetes are probably going to benefit the most from that kind of drug class in terms of you know the physiology of it but i think there are promising signals that at the very least is probably not going to kill you we go from the 60s to the 70s to the 80s when does it really from an epidemiologic standpoint just completely take off in terms of you know because even if i remember what you said a moment ago back in the 60s we might have been at 12 obese and i mean today it's hard to imagine such a low figure given 40 40 to 45 today yeah 43 is the latest that's that's simply unbelievable i i not that i don't believe it it's just hard to fathom that nearly half of the u.s adult population could have a bmi above 30. when when did it really hit its stride yeah so this is an interesting question so probably a lot of people listening will have seen graphs of enhanced data where it kind of spikes around 1980 but the interesting thing about that is that point around 1980 is actually the average date of that survey but it was actually a multi-year survey it was a survey that started i believe in 76 and ended in like 84 something like that i i don't remember the exact years but it's it was a range that's how the nhanes used to be today their the range is much narrower but at the time it was a broader range and so what we're seeing is you know we can turn that into a point and put it on a graph but really it represents a range of years so we don't know exactly when it happened but it's it if you look at the average value for that it's i think 1978 is the average value for that survey the average year um but we don't know exactly where in there it started to turn up and we don't really know how sharp it was because we don't have that resolution it looks real sharp on the graph again when you when you make it a single point it looks sharp but we don't really know exactly how sharp it is um and so anyway i'm i'm kind of putting a lot of nuance into this but to answer your question well it is actually an important point because i know that many people i've probably been guilty of this myself 10 years ago would also look at changes in macronutrient composition that occurred around the same time and say boy it's hard to uncouple those but in reality if they occurred over a different time scale it might make that correlation a little less robust i mean i would say that we have more we have a sharper focus on the changes in dietary intake because we have annual data from the economic research service usda economic research service the data on bmi are less sharp so i would say that there's those two those two changes are absolutely compatible and you know just on a logic level i'm sure they're related um you see big changes happening around the same time in the diet so yeah anyway to give a kind of simpler hopefully more satisfying answer sometime around between the late 70s and the early 80s we see an uptick an apparent uptick in the obesity rate so the rate starts to increase it goes up and up and up and then there's a couple of places where it slightly goes down for a year or two and then it keeps going up yeah it's it looked like it was gonna plateau or maybe start going back down but really in recent years it's really just been skyrocketing so um [Music] yeah so essentially from somewhere in the late 70s to early 80s to now we went from something like 15 percent of obesity to 43 of us adults and i want to point out something else too that i think is relevant one way i like to think about this is the lifetime risk so that's just the population prevalence that includes people who are 20 years old yeah that's includes people who may be growing into it exactly yeah if you look at the lifetime risk i don't know what the exact figure is but i think it's well over 50 percent so i think more than half of u.s adults will be classified as actually having obesity at some point in their life if the current context is maintained you see the same thing for type 2 diabetes the the prevalence is like the prevalence of all diabetes is something like 10 or 12 percent um but if you look at the lifetime risk it's like double that or maybe even more i can't remember what the exact figure is but it's like mind-blowing the number of people who will at some point in their life develop type 2 diabetes in the u.s yeah i mean if you take a 50-year look at the change in type 2 diabetes prevalence so the snapshot i believe it's a five-fold difference in risk over 50 years the past 50 years so you go back 50 years ago and look today just the prevalence delta is 5x so i could believe that so you have to then look at what does that rate of change tell you about lifetime prevalence what does it tell you about a person who is only five years old today or a person who's 15 years old today yeah it's i would complete i mean i haven't done the math but i would completely agree that their lifetime risk is probably at least one in five of having type 2 diabetes yeah absolutely and this this has been quantified i tweeted out a paper about this a while back and unfortunately i don't remember the top line figure but there are actual data on this so what about the rest of the world stefan where where are they in relation to us i mean we we we probably led the way uh along with a handful of other developed nations but one of the things that seems to have changed is this is no longer a condition of affluence correct well it at the individual level yeah yeah i mean i think it really sorry to be pedantic but it really hinges on how we define the term affluent because if you go to the very poorest people in the world there still is not a lot of obesity in those places places that are really challenged with food security where the diet is very limited like subsistence farmers in sub-saharan africa you're still going to see that there's a low prevalence of obesity in that pla in those places yes sorry i think what i meant was at the individual level so if you look at the united states from the bottom 10 percent of the population economically to the top 10 of the population economically is there a difference in obesity there i think bottom 10 the top 10 you would see a difference if you're looking in tertiles so just bottom third to top top third there's very little there's very little difference actually um if you start slicing and dicing it by uh sex and race then you will start to see larger differences emerge for example uh women who are in the top tertile are leaner than women in the bottom tertile but there's no difference for men in terms of income so you can start to find patterns when you slice and dice my overall feeling though is that there is no demographic in the united states that has not gotten a lot fatter over the last few decades even though i think if you look at certain demographics particularly with regard to education you're going to see gradients emerge but even among highly educated people you're going to see a higher prevalence today than there was 50 years ago so let's not bring this up to your work what did you what did you do when you got to mike schwartz's lab how did you begin your re-education around neuroscience as it applies to everything that has to do with obesity which let's just talk about this there's an input side and an output side um we i think we should talk a little bit about i mean rudy was on the podcast god's probably been two three years ago so maybe it's worth a refresher on the neurobiology of how the different parts of for example the hypothalamus can regulate energy expenditure can regulate appetite and what we can learn under very very controlled experimental settings with animals um and then how we can start to think about how that applies to to humans with a you know a primitive brain in a modern world so to speak yeah so i want to take a little step back before getting into that and say you know answer the question of what does the brain have to do with obesity at all just to make sure we're bringing everybody along because i think it's not obvious to everyone what the brain might have to do with obesity but i think if you start to think about it it becomes pretty obvious that the answer is just about everything and the reason is that you know the most obvious reason is that the brain is the organ that generates behavior and so if you think that behavior of any kind relates to body fatness what we how much we eat how we use your bot how we use our bodies how we sleep whether we're stressed or not if we think any of that relates to body fatness then we think the brain is is playing a role i think most people would agree that food intake quantity and quality is is pretty important there um and then the second reason is that the brain actually contains a regulatory system for body fat for body fatness i should say body fat mass and it's the only known system in the body that does that and it's located primarily in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus which is like uh forget who described it this way it's maybe it was herman poncer it's like a lot of bubble gum on the bottom of your brain near where your optic nerves cross so it's this little tiny part of the brain that specializes in homeostasis maintaining the stability of body systems i always describe it as a walnut but maybe a walnut okay yeah so just to give you an example it's the part of the brain that regulates body temperature and there's a thermostat in there and effectively a thermostat and thermometers there are thermometers that measure your core temperature there are thermometers on your skin that measure future threats to your core temperature like if you jump into a cold lake your core temperature doesn't instantly drop but your brain knows that it will drop because of the temperature sensors in your skin and so it can respond adaptively and then that system in the hypothalamus engages a behavioral a suite of behavioral and physiological responses to maintain temperature homeostasis so you'll on the physiology side you get vasoconstriction you get um non-shivering thermogenesis through brown fat you get shivering and then through the behavioral side you want to get out of the cold water you want to put a sweater on you want to you know drink some hot tea you want to adopt a heat conserving posture and through this coordinated physiology and behavior you get incredible regulation of temperature of core temperature i should say and uh you know like plus or minus one degree fahrenheit when the exterior temperature could be varying by 50 degrees and so it's it's an incredible regulatory system and the body fat regulatory system unfortunately is not so precise but i i give that as an analogy just to give you a sense of what the hypothalamus specializes in there's also a regulatory system for body fatness and a nice name for that is the lipostat so lipo fat stat the same and really we've known about it since 1840 or we've known there was something going on since 1840 when the viennese physician bernard moore published a case study about a woman who had extreme obesity that rapid onset extreme obesity he did an autopsy after her death and she had a tumor in her hypothalamus and to this day hypothalamic obesity is a thing that we have to deal with with people with tumors or other damage to the hypothalamus it often causes extreme obesity and what's the nature of the obesity how much of it is due to hyperphasia excess eating how much of it is due to loss of activity or even just a shutdown of metabolic rate yeah that's a great question so if you look at probably the closest experimental analog of uh hypothalamic obesity that a sort of human-like hypothalamic obesity would be um vmh lesion so this is something that's been done since i think the 20s they go in with a very precise instrument called a stereotaxic instrument in animals and they lesion this part of the hypothalamus called the ventromedial hypothalamus so basically they're they're replicating they're trying to replicate the damage of hypothalamic obesity and as soon as the anesthesia wears off these animals are cramming food into their faces and if there's no food in their cage they'll eat bedding they'll eat the bedding they will just like put anything they can get a hold of into their bodies and they will continue binging until they have rapidly gained a large amount of weight and then it will start to plateau off but they have extreme hyperphagia and if you restrict their calorie the first experiments that were done on this showed that if you restrict them to a normal level of calorie intake so that of a non-lesioned animal it prevents the fat gain suggesting that the or i should rephrase that it prevents the weight gain so they were just weighing them at the time suggesting that it's primarily a phenotype of hyperphagia however later experiments that were more precise found that it doesn't completely eliminate the weight gain it only eliminates about 80 percent of it and so there is a component from energy coming from energy expenditure so uh primarily hyperphagia but there's also an energy expenditure component that's smaller yeah it's funny i just remember in medical school one of the neurobiology professors saying if you if you were asked to give up a piece of your brain like the last one you want to give up is a piece of your hypothalamus if you if you had to give up like one cubic centimeter of brain tissue you just fight like hell to make sure you preserve your entire hypothalamus i agree with that i would say the brain stem and the hypothalamus probably not places you want to lose let's go a little bit further in that um we've you you referred to the lipostat so say a little bit more about what what we've learned about this this lipostat and what circulating factors might play a role in governing this and what's been learned through some of the uh work that was done using parabiosis yeah so i'm going to give you the simple version there is a more complex version that is emerging um but i'll start with the the simple version which is that um [Music] it is a negative feedback system similar to your home thermostat similar to the thermostat in your brain in that it there is um the hypothalamus measures levels of a circulating hormone called leptin that circulates in proportion to your body fat mass so the same way your home thermostat measures the temperature in your home your hypothalamus is measuring the level level of leptin in your circulation still some controversy about how exactly or where that measuring happens but the signal gets to the hypothalamus and um it uses that to determine whether you essentially have the amount of fat that your hypothalamus wants you to have so the same way that your thermostat has a set point and um [Music] your internal thermostat and your body has a set point your hypothalamus has a certain idea of how much fat it wants you to have on your body and you if you deviate from that it starts to engage a coordinated series of physiological and behavioral responses to restore the previous level of body fat and this system works better at protecting against fat loss than it does against fat gain and certainly over long periods of time we see that the average person in a country like the us tends to gain fat the lipostat is not stopping them or at least it's it's not preventing them it might be resisting but it's not stopping the process of weight gain um but we see that it actually is quite vigorous at defending against weight loss and this is part of the cruelty of or the unfairness of how obesity works is that your set point or your defended level of body weight is controversy about what what to call that but whatever it is it goes up and so a person with obesity their body defends against weight loss as if they were starving just like a lean person losing weight their body and brain would defend against weight loss and it's it's literally a starvation response it's the same behavioral and physiological process that ramps up your hunger that makes you uh more focused on food cues greater cravings it down regulates your energy expenditure and uh you know it does everything it can to try to bring the fat back and so that is i think a key reason and possibly the primary reason why weight loss is so difficult and so temporary if there was no regulation happening weight loss would probably be pretty easy and weight maintenance certainly would be very easy but it's not you see that people tend to regain back to their former level unless they're being really well supported in that weight loss and even then there's usually some amount of weight gain weight regain i should say so let's go back to leptin for a moment so leptin is a hormone is it made in the adipocyte it is yeah it's made in the adipocyte and secreted in proportion to body fat mass so the more adipose tissue you have the more leptin you have is it generally pretty static does it change with meals or exercise or anything like that yes it does so the so over the long run the amount of leptin in the bloodstream is strongly correlated with fat mass however it's also strongly impacted by short-term energy balance so if you if you let's say cut your calories by 25 for a couple of days you're going to see a drop in leptin that is disproportionate to your amount of fat mass and so where is the leptin receptor is there a leptin receptor in the periphery are they central there are leptin receptors in many parts of the body but the ones that are relevant for body weight regulation are in the brain are they in the hypothalamus there are there is a high concentration of leptin receptors in the hypothalamus yes there are leptin receptors in other parts of the brain too however it's not 100 percent clear what where the important ones are for body weight regulation probably somewhere in the hypothalamus but there are a lot of different papers where they take mouse models and they knock the leptin receptor out of different cells in the brain and um if you knock them out of gabaergic cells you get a really big basically you recapitulate animals that don't have the leptin receptor at all in terms of their body weight um gabaergic that's a a major one of the two big neurotransmitters that's the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and then you can knock it out of certain subtypes cell subtypes in the hypothalamus and get big effects there was a paper suggesting you can just knock it out of agrp neurons and get um and recapitulate the obesity phenotype of animals that have no leptin receptor however that um is controversial not every paper has shown that so i'm not sure what people who are on the cutting edge of this field would say about where that evidence is but certainly there are cell populations and probably the most important ones are in the hypothalamus there are cells in the brain probably mostly in the hypothalamus that are receiving that signal and conveying it to the key cell types in that are kind of at the center of this lipostat which are agrp neurons i refer them in my book as npy neurons just for storyline simplicity but more commonly they're called agrp neurons and palm c neurons so the agrp those are the hunger neurons the palm c are the satiety neurons or you could think of them as hunger slash body fat increasing neurons the palm see or the the uh the opposite essentially and so what is leptin resistance and how does it manifest why does it manifest um and how frequent is it leptin resistance so when leptin was discovered first in 1994 by a team led by jeff friedman and rudy libel they found that this was the gene that was missing in an obese mouse model called the obob mouse this animal was extremely obese as a result of lacking of a defect in the production of of this protein one single amino acid substitution that destroyed this protein and caused uh sorry one one single base pair that destroyed this protein and caused the loss of function and this mass of obesity and when this was discovered and also discovered that humans have leptin then it was like this scientific bonanza i was like well maybe we've discovered the cause of obesity maybe people with obesity don't have enough leptin and so their brains you know think they don't have enough body fat when really they do they the failure to perceive the body fat that's what causes obesity in these ob mice and so they started measuring leptin levels in people with obesity and it turns out they were actually high elevated yeah because it's correlated we now know it's correlated with fat mass and so what you know what's the deal if this is a hormone that regulates body fatness why is it that people with obesity have so much of it and it's not suppressing their excess body fat mass and the concept that has been invoked to explain this is leptin resistance so in the same way that people can develop insulin resistance where it takes more insulin to do the physiological jobs in the body people with obesity require more leptin for the hypothalamus to be satisfied so another way to say that they require more leptin to avert the starvation response that the brain has that where alarm bells start going off because it thinks you don't have enough body fat so they require more more leptin to achieve that state and so we call that leptin resistance but we don't really know how it works yet so you know that's just a general term for requiring more leptin to avert the starvation response but we don't know whether that is something where there's fewer leptin receptors on a certain kind of cell whether there's a downstream signaling impairment in interior cellular signaling cascades whether there is a change in cell to cell communication maybe the cell that's receiving a leptin is getting the message just fine but there's some kind of downstream change in neural processing where the signal gets gets clouded or modified we don't know the answer to that question it seems like the only thing we know is it's not too low an amount of circulating leptin as evidenced by two things one the high circulating levels of leptin and the fact i think more importantly that when you give exogenous leptin it doesn't improve the condition suggesting that that's not the defect yes i mean you can give high levels of leptin and it will cause weight loss but it doesn't do much and if you look at leptin signaling there's there were some early studies done in in animal models suggesting that if you're just looking bro if you mash up the hypothalamus and you look at what's going on in it broadly on average you find that the amount of leptin response the intracellular signaling cascade that's activated by leptin is not really impaired in animals with obesity it's like it's like they're getting the same leptin signal from a much higher level of leptin so that that's kind of like some evidence that we have i looked at some twin concordant and discordant studies identical twin and i was surprised to see maybe i shouldn't have been surprised but i was surprised at how heritable obesity was it was about 0.7 and that's i mean when you see heritability of 0.7 that tells you something is very very genetically predetermined so even though 100 years ago virtually none of us were obese and today let's just call it your lifetime incidence of obesity is 50 tells you and our genes haven't changed in 100 years so clearly our susceptibility for obesity has been with us for a great period of time and it is highly highly preserved it's just that in the last whatever 40 50 years we now have matched or mirrored our genes to an environment that is allowing that trait to flourish what do we know about the genes that that regulate obesity or fatness let's just talk about it through that lens i suppose yeah the meta-analysis of twin studies that i like to um cite these days suggests an average heritability of 75 percent wow so stronger yeah it's it's massive and and there's some debate about that you know i think but directionally this is this is a really big deal it's very heritable yeah and a lot of things are very heritable i think that's one thing we're learning um but yeah so you have this this very high heritability of body mass index so um variation between individuals and body mass index about 75 of those differences between people is explained by their genetics that's what that implies and um if we look at other methods that have tried to figure out what are the genes that underlie this what are the genetic differences these are the genome-wide association studies that i think are particularly informative in this regard they simply ask the question if we look at the entire genome and we look at these representative genetic markers where different people have different genetic code called snips single nucleotide polymorphisms where in the genome what markers correlate with differences in body mass index fortunately body mass index is really easy to measure so you can get really big sample sizes in these studies which you need to get statistically significant results because you're looking at i think like millions i don't remember exactly how many but you're looking at a lot of genomic markers so you need tremendous statistical power to detect anything with with a high level of confidence so you have these studies i think the latest is like 800 000 people um the leader of the pack is is the height genome-wide association study i think they have like three million and now they've saturated the heritability they've gotten all the information they can with that sample size out of what the common genetic variants are that correlate with differences in height so i think with body mass index we may in the near future we may saturate it as well we may know what are all the common genetic differences that correlate with differences in in body mass index so um essentially so far these studies have identified i think like 900 variants that differ so what this suggests is that differences in body mass index between individuals are very complex that genetically very complex are determined by a lot of different genes with very small effect sizes so you get this sorting of all these different genes and whatever combination you get lucky or unlucky determines whether you're to a large degree determines whether you are susceptible or not susceptible to obesity in a in a fattening environment is the way i would put it and so they have various ways of looking at what these genes are doing because you know that's one way you can use these genome-wide association studies that's particularly informative you could say what's the underlying biology that makes some people fatter and some people slimmer and i want to talk a little bit about why this is such an important approach one is that you're looking people so you're looking at people in their regular everyday context this is not an artificial lab scenario you're just looking at people living their lives and experiencing higher or lower weight and you're saying what genes correlate with that so it's very naturalistic second it's very replicable these studies are highly replicable in other words if you do three studies of this nature you're going to tend to get similar results so the methodology it's one of the most rigorous i would say in the biological sciences that we have and then and i think that oh sorry i'll let you finish because i was going to add something to that but go ahead um and the third one is that it's unusually objective as well it has a higher level of built-in objectivity resistance to bias compared to other types of investigation because it's not driven you're just looking across the whole genome and seeing what pops up you're not saying i'm going to focus on the connection between x biological process and y outcome you're just saying i'm interested in y outcome what correlates with it and let's see what biology pops up could be anything we're just gonna see and so that really gives you a chance to i think check your thinking on what the underlying biology is in various traits and diseases yeah and i think i think part of that comes from the strength of what ultimately makes genetic analyses like mendelian randomization so powerful is the genes are randomly distributed so that's what cleans out some of those biases is when you are looking at a million people for for whom the genes are randomly spread across them and you take an unbiased view of the sample and then you get those results over and over and over again i think it becomes very powerful and and look you know if people are listening to us saying god what are these guys talking about i mean i think it's just important to understand the big picture the big picture here is a thousand years ago a thousand years ago to all intents and purposes none of us were obese but that still means directionally 50 of us at least had the genes that would allow us to become obese in an obesogenic environment that's really all that's that's really what we're explaining here is that there are a highly highly heritable set of genes that will allow a subset of the population and actually one of the things i'm just curious about your thoughts are teleologically why is it 50 why isn't it 100 right like why is it that more people don't have that was this just a fluke of evolution was this you know you would you would almost think that evolution would have wanted everybody to have those genes yeah absolutely so i'm gonna i'm gonna finish up the the thought we were on previously just to wrap that up but i i would like to get back to that um so we have this incredible methodology for um looking at you know and and just a step since you want to step back a little bit i just want to also add like what we're talking about is why you know some people can effortlessly stay thin and other people have to really struggle to maintain their weight and maybe are not able to so that's kind of like the everyday thing that we're trying to explain here that i think many people recognize intuitively that that is you know a thing that different people have different uh propensities for becoming obese um or developing obesity or not and um yeah so we can look at the underlying biology and that's been done and there are a couple different ways you can do it one is you can say what are the genes that are that seem to be associated with these genomic differences and where are those expressed what tissues are those expressed in and there was a paper where they looked at i think 43 different traits of all kinds diseases personality traits other stuff and uh and this and they asked what what does the tissue enrichment look like and if you look at body mass index it looks like psychiatric diseases and educational attainment so all of those are heavily enriched for brain related genes to a similar degree so conditions that we know are related to the brain like educational attainment how you know how how many years of education you've attained whether you are susceptible to schizophrenia depression tourettes like all these brain related conditions obviously the brain shows up in genome-wide association studies for those conditions and you put those next to body mass index and you couldn't tell them apart like that's how heavily enriched for brain related biology body mass indexes and those diseases by the way that you just mentioned are some of the most heritable diseases we see in medicine i mean when you look at autism when you look at schizophrenia these have heritability indexes of 0.6 to 0.7 they're they're they're highly genetic conditions so there's two things going on right which is you have these parallel things that are highly highly genetic and then they're disproportionately concentrated in the brain that's right and um so we know it's you know and i don't want to say that it's literally 100 about the brain i think that's unlikely to be true but it's certainly the primary signal that emerges across the literature and um and so i think that really validates this idea of the brain being important for body fatness and if we look you know a little bit deeper at what is going on for a lot of it we don't really know we don't really know exactly how the brain is doing this what it is about these genes but we can see that it correlates with certain types of ways of interacting with food so people that have obesity promoting genes tend to have greater eating drive they tend to have lower satiety and but this is an area that hasn't really been very well explored yet so there's a lot we don't know um however if you look at the monogenic obesity syndromes so where there's one mutation that causes severe obesity those really revolve around the leptin brain signaling axis so those mutations tend to be in leptin the leptin receptor melanocortins melanocortin receptor that are downstream of leptin in the brain um and those types of signals also show up in the genome-wide association studies but they're not dominant a lot of this stuff is really general it's like stuff that affects general neuronal development and you know neurotransmitters that are involved in a lot of stuff so i think there's a long way to go before we really understand exactly how those genes are affecting the brain in a way that in impacts body fatness but i do think we can say that differences in body fatness between individuals are primarily determined by differences in how the brain is constructed and how it operates so stefan let's now go back and try to put all of this in the context we we were just ready to get to a moment ago which is it's 250 000 years ago for all intents and purposes we're the same creatures we are now obviously minus the environment that we live in but food and energy are one of our top priorities right like most i'm guessing i'm not an anthropologist but you know it would have to seem to me that security from other tribes and animals and the environment right weather uh acquisition of energy and reproduction were kind of the only things that would have mattered right there probably wasn't a lot of other stuff that mattered at the time and acquisition of energy was essential in that it could kill you very quickly if you failed to do that so acquiring energy storing energy was like kind of the struggle that defined us probably in the short term much more so than uh reproduction which obviously is a huge other contributor here so we evolved over millions of years and everything you said about leptin now starts to make sense in that environment right leptin is a signal that says there's not enough energy and that's what should really trigger the response so in that sense it's not surprising that leptin isn't doing the opposite it's not surprising that high leptin doesn't make you want to stop eating it's who cares nature wouldn't have cared about that but it certainly would care if leptin gets too low that should be a screaming signal to go and eat resist that resist that sign what do we know about the [Music] genetics the efficiency with which we store energy i mean we haven't really talked about that but this this ability that we have to get fat is kind of a remarkable thing right i mean we don't really store carbohydrates we can't really store protein and we don't want to be breaking down muscle to get amino acids so we do really have to rely on this ability to store fatty acids and excess carbohydrates as fatty acids in a relatively inert structure white adipose tissue yeah yeah absolutely uh you know i think herman poncer would be a great person to talk to about this he yes i definitely look his book is on my list to read and i definitely plan to have him on to to get into this yeah he has some good thoughts john speakman has some good thoughts on this as well another person i should probably have on the podcast yeah so i think there are good reasons to have a certain amount of body fat and i think you know some of them you know the basic idea is pretty obvious you want to have a way to cover your energy needs between eating opportunities and um you know we have other energy reserves we have glycogen but they're just far more limited the thing that's awesome about fat is first of all it's a very concentrated source of energy right like dietary fat is nine calories per gram carbohydrate is four protein is four yeah it's anhydrous there's no water it's exactly literally just pure energy that was the second thing i was gonna say is that it's hydrophobic and so you can store it without having to hydrate it like you do with glycogen glycogen the weight of glycogen i think is mostly water three three or four to one water okay there we go and then the weight of adipose tissue even if you include all the interstitial stuff and all that i think it's like 85 90 percent pure fat so the energy density is just off the charts depending on you know relative to any other storage method that the body has and so it makes sense that that's kind of our long-term energy buffer by the way just for people who think about evs and stuff like there's no battery that can come close to the energy density of our fat just to put that in perspective right like or any hydrocarbon for that matter yeah so um and so i think the importance of that is obvious to have a way to cover times when you don't have as much energy coming in as you would like and in the evolutionary context you know the thing that comes to mind from our modern perspective is whether they find food or not but there's also the question of illness and i think that's a really important one so if we look at um [Music] the primary causes of mortality in children under five in low income settings what we see is that it's strongly related to their weight for height which is kind of a different way of measuring bmi and and it's also strongly related to disease pressure especially diseases like diarrhea that interfere with nutrition and so if you look at the correlation between weight for height and mortality there's a massive correlation so kids who have malnutrition moderate or severe malnutrition that's what we call being underweight to a certain degree they have massively increased mortality because basically if you don't have those energy stores you can't defend yourself against infections and so it's not just about energy you know there are other nutrients that are important vitamin a and some other things but energy is is huge and so there's a because it's such a huge uh source of mortality especially in kids there's this massive selective selective pressure to maintain a certain amount of energy storage in the body so that would be you know just an example of a selective pressure that would select for a certain amount of body fat and it is interesting in this regard that humans have a lot more fat than our closest uh primate relatives so chimps are like mid single digits fat and they don't develop obesity they cannot physiologically develop human like obesity is my understanding um so we're kind of special physiologically in our capacity for fat storage has anyone ever looked at different uh ancestral populations for what and this might be just irrelevant to do because we don't have enough data where there were different amounts of food scarcity and seeing if there's an inverse relationship between the food scarcity that that population emanated from whether it's this part of africa versus that part of europe and how that translates into the um genetic predisposition to obesity in their modern ancest in their uh modern kin today yeah i don't know the answer to that but you understand the question i'm asking like yeah yeah it's basically does a history with starvation select for even greater obesity today exactly yeah i know that john speakman has argued against this idea he has pointed out that apparently people with obesity do not survive famines better than lean people um which is kind of counterintuitive i'm not sure why that would be i know that's a point that he's made um yeah so anyway that's about all i know about it i i don't really know the answer to that question okay so let's start to talk about the hedonic aspect of food so we have five tastes right we can taste sweet sour bitter salty and umami those are the things the five things we taste um what's the best way to describe umami to somebody it's a meaty flavor that is present in cooked meat bone broth soy sauce yeah yeah okay so i think people kind of get it it's distinct from salt i think is an important point here um yes although they often go together of course and i know different parts of our tongues have different you know uh we sense for example sweet on the very front of our tongue i recall but that's that's about the extent of my knowledge and recollection of where where our tongue resides in that but what do those what does the taste that we experience today you and i if we go out to a restaurant how does that compare to the range of taste that our ancestors experienced yeah i think i think this is this brings up a topic that um i like to i like to talk about because i think most people if you look at what hunter gatherers actually eat let's say we're looking at contemporary and historical hunter-gatherers where data have been collected and using that as a proxy for the types of food that our ancestors would have eaten it is radically different than what we eat today in many ways but one of them is the hedonic properties of it like if you look at what the hadsa eat you know if they go out and kill an antelope they just like cut off pieces of meat and throw it in the fire or put it next to the fire in coals they don't have sauces they're not putting salt on it and then they just like cut off the charred parts and eat and sometimes it's like half raw on the inside they eat rotten meat meat that we would consider literally rotten they will eat i was just thinking about that the other day by the way because i eat so much wild game that i've killed but i realize like i'm still a baby because like hey i cook it i don't eat it raw but more importantly to your point i season it right like i use salt i use pepper i put lemon on it and i'm sure it would taste fine without those things it would certainly be edible i just don't do it right yeah and that's right and you know i'm sure like yeah i think if a person a typical person were to try to eat at a hadza camp for like a week i think it would be really challenging for them um you know like even that meat even even meat as you said cooked unseasoned unseasoned it's not doesn't taste bad it wouldn't taste as good but now imagine like the outside is charred the inside is half raw you're brushing sand off of it like that's that's kind of the context and then you know that's the meat that's like one of the most palatable things they eat and then you know we have like probably the most palatable thing or yeah probably the most palatable thing and certainly the thing that they really like is honey but they're not putting it on toast with butter on it you know they're literally they're jam straight they're just taking the honeycomb eating it and like drinking the honey so it's it's a bit of a different scenario even there and then we have like they eat a lot of baobab that is a very fibrous fruit that has sweetness to it but it also has some off flavors it's not a very sweet fruit it's not like an apple it's got a lot of fiber and then there's the uh the tubers which is another major article of diet and to be fair this is their least preferred type of food okay yeah it's it's they would rather eat things other than tubers um but they roast these things in the fire they dig them up they're these like long stringy things that look like long sweet potatoes there are multiple species but um that's one of the common ones and they're so fibrous that they actually have to spit out a wad of fiber after they're done chewing it so it's like a sugar cane or something where you suck out the nutrient but you're spitting out the the pure uh unsoluble fiber yeah and so they're not sitting there sauteing onions on the stove they're not putting sauces they're not spicing like they're just taking food out of nature and cooking it and eating it and so i think it's it's just a radically different type of diet than we're accustomed to and i think in this regard um it's interesting to consider how rewards circuits adapt to that basically our brains are set up to not be satisfied with ordinary stuff once we have gotten good stuff is a simple way to put it and michael crashes did a really interesting neuroscience study on this in mice mice normally they eat these unrefined food pellets that would be like the default diet but they much prefer these calorie dense refined high fat pellets and if you give that to them they will very much preferentially eat that over the healthier unrefined pellets and what happens is they actually neurobiologically devalue if you look at the circuits activity of their reward circuits they devalue once they've been exposed to the preferred food they devalue the less preferred food so it no longer satisfies them no longer motivates them in the same way that it did before they were exposed to the highly preferred food and so you know to bring this back to our context if you have somebody like you or i who's been raised in a context where we have you know tasty calorie dense easy to eat food and that's how we were raised then going back to eat food more like how our ancestors would eat is is really difficult like not twice you've mentioned the calorie density so let's now talk about that because that's kind of different from taste right so the the taste thing is interesting to me and this is something you and i actually remember speaking about probably one of the first times we met this is like i said 10 years ago which was i actually think table sugar is disgusting like i truly do like if you put a bowl of that white crap in front of me and said dip your finger in and eat it i could maybe do it once but that's about it right if you said just mix it into water and drink it it's gross it tastes fine in coffee and tea but just by itself it's really disgusting and similarly if you just have me eat lard it's really disgusting like i despite the fact that i was on a ketogenic diet for three years i never developed a taste for putting coffee and butter and things like that but i freaking love ice cream right like i think ice cream is about one of the most beautiful tastes in the world everything about it so and it really isn't that much more than sugar and fat right i mean yes there's some flavors to it and if you make it a coffee ice cream i like it even more but so so i guess my question is can you walk me through what my brain is doing when it's tasting sugar when it's tasting butter neither of which by itself i find remotely enjoyable but then when i'm tasting ice cream and because the ice cream is not that much more caloric than the butter and the taste of those two things i mean like there's something i'm trying to understand here which is taste and energy density and how are those figuring out because i believe they are instantly rewarding so i'll give you one other analogy here i remember when my daughter who's now 13 turned six months old and my wife and i were really fastidious about not feeding her any junk right like you know fortunately my wife was able to breastfeed so she didn't have all that formula and you know we just we were like you know your typical idiot first parents right like we spent way too much time thinking about what she was eating i'm sure but on her six-month birthday we got her ice cream so you gotta so this is kind of an interesting experiment right like she's never experienced anything like this so i take a little ice cream cone and i put it up to her face and i still remember where we were sitting in del mar when i did this stefan it we're talking in milliseconds response from her milliseconds her eyes opened wider than they've ever opened and she couldn't get into that thing fast enough so to suggest that that isn't her brain responding is crazy right like there's there's nothing in her periphery in the moment that governed that response so whatever ice cream loving jeans i have she got them yeah absolutely so i'm in a hard degree on ice cream it's it's really for me like almost drug like the effect it has on my brain um so yeah this brings up a couple of interesting questions so you're alluding to the fact that sugar and pure fat are very calorie dense so if our brains are wired for calories why are those not very motivating which is a great question so i'll start with that and the reason is that this this starts to get into the the complexity of it is that there is an optimal concentration of these nutrients that is not 100 so you know a great way to illustrate this would be with salt right like eating straight up salt is not something that most people would enjoy like eating spoonfuls of salt it's horrible but at the right concentration it's excellent right it really enhances food and so that's actually generally true about all of these nutrients it's true also about carbohydrate and fat so a term that's been used for that is the bliss point so there is an optimal concentration for enjoyment and presumably also for reinforcement which is that dopamine release that sets your motivational drive and helps you learn and form habits and so ice cream you know if you take out the sugar it probably wouldn't taste bad without the sugar but not nearly as good right if you take out the fat yeah fat-free ice cream is not flying off the shelves even though it does exist um so it's really that combination of the two that really puts it over the top and that's generally true when you look at the types of foods that are most commonly associated with strong cravings and loss of control over eating so like addictive like behavior you see that generally the foods that are cited are combinations of carbohydrate and fat usually there's other stuff involved there's flavorings there's salt in in the savory items like pizza or or french fries um so sweet or savory generally they're combinations of carbohydrate and fat and i think that again it just relates to the fact that there is an optimal concentration of these nutrients in terms of stimulating our our our reward centers and so what you see in modern foods that have been crafted to maximally stimulate our you know enjoyment and motivation either either they've been crafted by food industry or by grandma you know passed down through the generations of recipes what you see is that generally these items are hitting multiple bliss points at the same time and that's just not really a combination you see in nature so i mean you don't see foods that are as reinforcing i mean i think the closest we would come is like maybe certain types of nuts would have some carbohydrate and some fat together um but we we really don't see anything that really hits the high points as much as the foods that surround us today let's go back to our ancestors for a moment um what apparatus was at their disposal subconsciously or consciously to help them understand and prioritize calorically dense food because i gotta believe that the three things that mattered most correct me if i'm wrong would be total calories protein and sodium i mean it can't be an accident that sodium is the only mineral we can taste right yeah correct so um or i should say by correct i mean that is how i think about it as well um and to break down the energy piece that would come for for an animal with a digestive tract like a human that would come primarily from carbohydrate and fat so we have carbohydrate fat protein uh salt and then sometimes i add glutamate umami to that list as well and essentially and this is subconscious stefan like were we is this again just part of that stuff that was now so wired into us that yes you know we didn't want to eat grass like we knew that even though you could sort of get the gastric distention from eating a lot of grass like a cow could it was doing nothing for us both it didn't taste good and so in the short term it wasn't pleasing and in the long term obviously it didn't satiate us yeah that's right and i think you know there's a couple angles on this one obviously humans have cultures so we figured out you know what foods are good over long periods of time but a key aspect of this is dopamine-mediated reinforcement and essentially our bodies are set up to respond to certain types of nutrients like the ones you mentioned and create a motivation and learning response that prioritizes and sets the motivational level on the seeking of those types of foods and so presumably these are the kinds of nutrients that our ancestors would have needed to prioritize to maximize the reproductive success the currency of natural selection so essentially we have these motivational systems that were selected to seek certain types of nutrients in the environment and if you look at the the modeling that's been done on foraging behavior in a wide variety of animals and in humans you see that it revolves around maximizing the energy return rate of foraging this doesn't describe every species but it does describe many species it's amazing to watch it in big cats for example where they'll be chasing an antelope and it's literally almost like they have a sensor inside that says i'm going to stop chasing now because my energy cost is not going to be met by my consumption over this period of time absolutely and these animals you know they don't know how to do math they don't know that they're actually implementing a mathematical equation in their head but they are it's just wired into their brains the same way it's wired into us you can predict hunter-gatherer foraging behavior to a surprisingly to a surprising degree just by knowing the calorie return rate of different foraging options so our brains are very much wired not just our brains but our bodies are very much wired around energy acquisition in terms of how our motivation and learning is set up on a non-conscious level and um this is very much hardwired so we have dedicated sensors in the digestive tract this this is all pretty recent research since 2018 they discovered these cells that they named neuropod cells in the small intestine primarily that have receptors for specific nutrients that are directly these cells are directly hooked up to vagal neurons so when they detect glucose or amino acids fatty acids so that would be carbohydrate fat protein they get the concentration and they start sending signals up your vagus nerve up to your brain stem and from there it gets distributed to many parts of your brain but um a particularly relevant part is the parts of your brain that have to do with dopamine release onto your reward centers and if the food that you're eating contains a high concentration of these valuable nutrients particularly in combination with one another you're gonna get a higher level of dopamine release the more dopamine release you get the more of a motivation you will develop toward that food why is it that there are and maybe this is just me i don't know what the literature would say so this this could be incorrect but in me like a rib eye is not something i seem to be able to eat into excess and i feel like i should like shouldn't i be wired to eat ribeye until i can't stand like shouldn't i be wired to eat ribeye until the point of vomiting given how high it is in sodium fat and protein and total calories like the only thing it's missing is sugar and and fiber and you know carbohydrates and things like that but but it's easier for me to over eat baked potatoes than it is to overeat a ribeye and i'm not sure i understand why so let me let me just clarify with with the potato is that with or without toppings with let's say with so yeah yeah let's let's put on let's put on butter uh sour cream and salt so so i'm clearly making it much more than the carb of course got it um and it has to be crispy skin too like if i'm gonna do it right you know i can't be like some lame ass buffet baked potato it's got to be my style um yeah that's but i don't know why i i don't know why like a fatty piece of meat is not something i have an amazing is that is my experience typical or would most people be able to just eat rib ribeyes until they puke oh that's a good question i i really don't know i will say that when you look at the foods that people cite as the most typically associated with strong cravings and loss of control over eating behavior meat does not usually come up high on that list and so which seems like it should right yeah i mean i can only speculate about that um i'm not really sure why i can understand where you're coming from i don't know whether that's a kind of generalizable phenomenon i can only speculate about why that might be so there are a couple of things that come to mind for me the first is that meat is about 75 water so the calorie density of is actually it's not low but it's not especially high unless you're eating a really fatty piece of meat so that's one thing if we're comparing it to something like a brownie or uh something like pizza which is more calorie dense than the um the second thing is it doesn't have any carbohydrates so it doesn't have that fat carbohydrate combination that is most closely associated with foods that people lose control around the third thing i would cite is the high protein level so even though we have this strong protein specific appetite that's been demonstrated in many different species protein doesn't work the same as carbohydrate and fat and i think i think we we recognize that that's the case protein seems to it's something that our bodies really want to get enough of but don't want to get too much of so there's really a not only there's a drive to acquire it but there's a drive to keep it within a certain range and not eat too much and we see that you know if people go on high protein diets their overall calorie intake will drop yeah i mean i wanted to talk about the carnivore diet with you a little bit because i know you guys did a review on a book um it's not a diet i've spent any time really thinking about so i've basically spoken to i don't know a dozen people who have gone on it and without exception they all lose weight um which i think for some of them is their motivation for doing it um and it must simply be that they just get tired of eating right they just don't they just can't take in the number of calories if they're doing it in that format i think there's probably so i would say that you know we don't have any good data on the impact of carnivore diet on on weight so you know there's no randomized controlled trials but you know we have these anecdotes of people saying they lose a lot of weight i certainly don't dispute that but i think if you came to me with this diet on paper and you asked me would this cause weight i would say absolutely because it has multiple properties that i would expect to make it a particularly effective weight loss diet one this is something we could talk about more if you want but it has zero carbohydrate so i think that anywhere if you're on the extreme of the fat to carbohydrate ratio in either direction that's more slimming than being in the middle so the most fattening diets are rich in both carbohydrate and fat so there's zero carbohydrate you're on the extreme or i shouldn't say zero very very little right right right you're about the glycogen in the meat that's yeah yeah there's a little glycogen so you're on the very extreme end of uh the macronutrient distribution it's high in protein that's also known to contribute to weight loss you're eliminating almost every type of food so your variety the variety of your diet goes very low i mean you can prepare your meat in different ways you can eat chicken or fish or beef or whatever but the variety is greatly greatly reduced so that's i think part of it um and you're cutting out all of these highly processed calorie dense foods that are the foods that i think you know we could debate about the why but i think everyone agrees that those are foods that drive excess intake and elevated body fatness so i think all these things together it's just even on paper it's a diet that i would very much expect to cause weight loss more to greater degree than your average diet and while we're on the topic what are you mean tell me a little bit about your review of this because i know you've put some time into this uh and for folks that are wondering you know i don't really plan to do a do a podcast on the carnivore diet i um i i doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me although i don't dispute that there are people who i think have had very um successful outcomes on it with respect to dealing with some of their physical ailments so maybe it has a role in sort of overcoming some acute illness um and maybe i'm just biased towards thinking plants are valuable but i i guess it seems to me that one of the core tenets of the of the diet is that plants are sort of low low grade toxic right i mean isn't that sort of part of the thesis yeah the thesis is basically everything is toxic except grass fed animal foods um so like even tap water is considered uh not optimal but um yeah so the the book spends a lot of time like going through the litany of all the potentially harmful compounds in in plant foods and actually you know what i i sympathize with some of this i think there is a bias toward thinking if it's in a plant it's healthy and i don't think that's true i think the book is right that that's not necessarily true and i think there are some plant compounds that at least for some people are not so good and you know there are well characterized examples of this like if you eat a lot of spinach you can get kidney stones from all the oxalate um there are studies suggesting that the glucosinolates in [Music] cabbage family plants might contribute to type 2 diabetes uh you know there's like kidney beans if you don't cook them enough they can be really toxic because the lectins so it's not like there aren't examples of this it's it's definitely true that to some degree i think it just gets taken far beyond where the evidence is and you know the way to think about how healthy a food is is not to say does it contain toxins is to say what's the cost benefit analysis on this food and most importantly what are the empirical outcomes that we can see when it when it's directly when its impacts on health are directly studied so you know like this is something that i've kind of focused on in my evaluation of uh some of the ideas that are put forth in the public sphere is that a lot of people with um a lot of people who are coming out with uh let's say unusual ideas in this sphere they really they take a mechanism and they run with it like you know x toxin is really bad like lectins for example gundry lectins can do xyz lectins are in plants therefore we shouldn't eat these types of plants and that's really like a bottom up approach like extrapolating empirical effects on health from mechanism when really i think in a complex field like nutrition it's better to start with the empirical evidence like oh we have this study that suggests that there's actually an effect on health let's see if we can understand the mechanism what are some of the um biochemical changes that occur in people on a carnivore diet i mean the obvious one must be the dyslipidemia right yes so you know there is there's a shift uh toward a ketogenic metabolism because of the fact that it's very low carbohydrate that would be an obvious shift that occurs um there you know i i don't know if i'd use the term dyslipidemia but one of the terms that one of the potential downsides i focused on in the review that is downplayed by many carnivore diet advocates including paul saldino is the change in ldl cholesterol and ldl particle count so and again we don't have great evidence here and this is kind of the crux of our review of the book on red pen reviews is simply that there are a lot of claims made that are not supported by any kind of uh convincing evidence but um we have some evidence so there's this survey study that was done on something like 2000 carnivore dieters um i think david ludwig was involved in that and they just reached out to people in social media groups like their facebook groups and things and they administered this survey and one of the questions was what was your various blood lipid values before and after this diet and you see that there are changes in positive and negative directions triglycerides go down as as you would expect i don't remember what hdl did but it probably went up yeah and then there was a large increase in ldl cholesterol and so that's a concern you know as far as i'm concerned and i think you would agree and paul saladino himself you know i'm not trying to pick on him i don't want to make it personal but he's uh you know been public about some of this stuff so i think it's it's fair to point out to to just repeat what he himself has said but his ldl cholesterol is 533 megs per deciliter and his ldl particle count is also absolutely through the roof and um so it not everyone responds like that like if you look at the survey data i think there was a mean increase of like 30 mix per deciliter in ldl 30 or 40 something like that so i think it depends on the individual i think some people like sean baker's lipids are fine he's another carnivore diet guy last time i saw his lipids look just fine so i think it depends on the individual but some people do experience a large increase in ldl cholesterol and i mean you know more about this than i do but that certainly raises red flags for me in terms of cardiovascular risk over the long run yeah the thing i've never understood is um this is probably true of not just carnivore but ketogenic or anything that that does produce that hyper beta lipoproteinemia it's it almost seems to be worn by some as a badge of honor as opposed to saying well maybe this diet is doing a lot of really good things for me it's improving my insulin sensitivity i feel better i have fewer energy swings but this one thing isn't so good but here's the thing of all the things that could go wrong that's about the most treatable one out there it's very easy to treat elevated apob uh and so that's the part and this is what we do clinically right this is how we treat patients right we have patients who only get better on very very carbohydrate restricted diets but then you know if they develop that that pattern that elevated ldl pattern we have a choice to make which is we abandon the diet or we treat the elevated apob and that's not a failure that's simply using modern medicine to help us achieve the best of both worlds so i think i've always struggled to understand why a person will go on that diet have you know an apob or ldl go from the 50th percentile to north of the 99th percentile and instead of being curious about what the implication is sort of dig their heels in and say clearly this is a good thing and ldl does not cause heart disease i absolutely agree i mean it's it's a dietary ideology it's an ideology that has emerged to defend a certain type of dietary pattern this these kind of ideas emerged from the low-carb community essentially to [Music] defend against the idea that there might be some downside to certain types of low-carb diets and they've been taken to an extreme i think in the carnivore community because that's a particularly uh potent stimulus for increasing ldl so people don't want to believe that there's a downside to the thing they're doing and you know like i kind of get it like people go on this diet they lose weight they feel better some people you know they say their skin cleared up or xyz condition improved like there's all these tangible things they can see that are getting better they don't want to believe that there's an intangible thing that's actually putting them at severe risk because i mean as you know like i say severe risk i just mean cardiovascular disease is a big risk generally like as you know this is the number one killer cardiovascular disease is a huge big deal even if it doesn't kill you it can do really bad things to you physically and cognitively so like it's not a risk you want to be ignoring so i absolutely agree i think it's an irrational part of dietary tribal ideology that is holding people back from experiencing their best health and it's so treatable i said that in the review too i was like you don't even have to stop the diet you can just get it treated or you could modify the diet yeah and and by the way you see the same sort of equally uh stubborn ideology at the exact opposite end of the spectrum where you use you know we see these patients that'll go on these incredibly restrictive plant-based diets and it's usually some combination of micronutrient deficiency and or protein deficiency that's going to be the death of them but there's no deviating from it there's no like i'm going to supplement with protein shakes i'm going to take b vitamins i'm going to do these and again it's the same sort of thing it's like somehow if i acknowledge the fact that i need to supplement with these other things to work around a diet that i otherwise like or that is congruent with a belief system i have around the treatment of animals which i can respect that right if that's if that's your belief system then by all means be true to it but um but yes i find it um [Music] somewhat self-destructive yeah absolutely i think it's very analogous to what we see in certain corners of the vegan diet community they want it to be best for everything it's got to be best for the environment and for ethics and for health and like it's just very hard to swallow that there might be some downsides and for the carnivore diet too you see like they try to justify the environmental aspects of it too like in the carnivore code he talks a lot about regenerative agriculture which you know is is a concept that i think is uh interesting and i think i support it but um it's a certain i would say spin on it that makes it seem particularly favorable and also like there's an underlying assumption that the average carnivore is going to eat nothing but regenerative agriculture beef um which i think is not the case let's talk about one more big topic stefan which you've you've written a lot about god you're i i i don't know if you're sick of it or you're you're still enjoying it but this idea of kind of energy balance carbohydrates and insulin and unifying theories around adiposity now very recently i heard you and kevin hall on a podcast i don't remember what the podcast was called but it was a wonderful discussion because i know you well i know kevin well and anytime i can listen to a podcast with people who i know a lot about and i know most of what they have to say but yet i still pick something up in the discussion it's fantastic and that was that was an example so in it you guys did a pretty good job i thought of really explaining the history of these models um which i think you acknowledged are probably not perfectly named so there's a little bit of historical baggage that goes into the nomenclature and i think anybody who's able to sort of pay attention long enough will realize that there's a lot in common with these models but there are some fundamental differences that are important to understand so maybe we could we could sort of talk a little bit about that and and um and again i think this is not a time to be overly simplistic right i think this is a time for nuance and it is a time for putting the finer point on the similarities and differences of these models so maybe just start by explaining well pick the one you want to start with and let's kind of walk through them yeah so the two models are the carbohydrate insulin model and the um energy balance model and the carbohydrate insulin model i just want to get a little more specific with that because there are different versions of this and so this is the one that has been uh promoted by david ludwig and particularly in a recent review paper that he published with along with some other researchers and uh the energy balance model in this case is being represented by kevin hall but i would say hughes pretty close it has very deep roots and models similar models that go back decades um carbohydrate insulin model and its most recent incarnation is a lot more complex than previous inclination so i'm going to do my best to kind of summarize it and and hit the key points but essentially it's the idea that um there are things in the diet and in the environment that impact insulin signaling and insulin signaling impacts body fatness and then that fattening process of insulin signaling on adiposity then downstream leads to elevated calorie intake and elevated and possibly a decline in metabolic rate so it proposes a reversal of the relationship this is this is one of the key aspects i want to highlight proposes a reversal of the relationship between energy balance and body fatness basically the energy balance phenotype is downstream of that fattening process instead of being upstream and that that really i think is a key difference when we go to the energy balance model the energy balance is upstream of the fattening process so basically we have all these things happening in the environment and physiologically in our bodies those signals are impinging primarily on the brain and that um and and then energy balance is um a result of primarily that brain activity and then that is feeding into adipose tissue so in that context adipose is um body fatness is kind of receiving the excess energy it's not really the driver of this process but when excess energy enters the body it's what mops it up so it's kind of uh that's that's kind of the the difference between those two models so let me say that again just to make sure we've got this right so in the former model in the carbohydrate insulin model the idea is that the the primary cause is the adipose tissue increasing in its fatness right the adipose tissue wants more energy that's driven by the external factors both carbohydrate and otherwise so in a drive to increase the influx of fatty acid into adipose tissue you see a reduction in circulating metabolic fuels which drives an increase in appetite so intake goes up to accommodate the reduction in circulating metabolic fuels which is being caused by a drive towards fatness the conventional model basically says that's happening in reverse it's saying that the input of fuels into the system leads to an increase in circulating metabolic factors that is now driving energy balance into the fat cell is that safe overview yes um you said conventional model though and i think is that do you want it do you want to call that energy is that the energy balance but i i've heard both terms yeah okay um so sorry just uh i think this is worth a moment to clarify so if you look at um david ludwig's paper he contrasts the carbohydrate insulin model against what he calls the energy balance model which is basically calories in calories out so it's like it's not really right none of this is really regulated it's just however many calories you happen to passively eat or how much you decide to exercise and then your your fat tissue is a result of that so the energy balance model in contrast is [Music] acknowledging all this brain regulation of body fat brain regulation of appetite and saying actually body fat is a regulated process however it's body fatness i should say is a regulated variable however it's regulated by the energy intake and expenditure via the brain got it okay yeah so the the conventional model i will say is not a model that really any research any obesity researchers currently um ascribe to at least the obesity researchers who are actually studying the mechanisms of uh body fat regulation yeah and one of the things that i think kevin pointed out on this podcast to go further on that um down that threat is the energy balance model does not consider all calories identical yeah it does not presuppose that they're all identical that's right and in terms of their impact on on body fat correct so not only do they potentially have different thermogenic effects but they also might have different regulatory effects on compensatory appetite right that's right and you know i think where we really see this emerging is in animal models um [Music] and i i don't know how relevant this is for humans but i'm just using it as a general like proof of principle that it can happen you can see in animal models where you can change their diet composition david ludwig has shown this for carbohydrate quality it's been shown for dietary fat as well and you can actually produce animals that will gain fat independent of calorie intake so you can actually clamp them at their former calorie intake and they will nevertheless gain fat so um so they're at least in principle those types of effects are possible yeah i believe rick johnson described an experiment like that on my recent podcast with him which was an iso caloric swap to a very high fructose diet where the animals didn't gain weight but they fueled partitioned differently they got fatter this was over a long time this was over nine months so nine months for a mouse right as an eternity yeah that's a very long time yeah absolutely that has been shown in a number of contexts that that can happen in rodents but they also i think it's worth pointing out that rodents have their energy expenditure is more plastic than ours yeah by the way i want to go back to that because we this is something this will tie into what we're about to talk about but you have a person who weighs 200 pounds person who weighs 160 pounds through the same height 100 the 200 pound person loses 40 pounds they're now 160 pounds the other person's always been 160 pounds on the surface they look identical in fact let's pretend they're siblings but one was obese and he's now post obese the other was never obese let's pretend that that one that lost the 40 pounds has really kind of dialed it in and doesn't yo-yo he manages to stay there it's three years later are they the same person yet no probably not there so rudy libel has done studies where i think they've had people out to a year maybe two years where they have them weight reduced and the starvation response this left independent starvation response he hasn't seen any sign that it goes away so could it maybe be possible could it maybe be possible under some circumstances maybe but um the evidence that i've seen suggests that it is at least not typical um i do think so i want to specify that i think that the set point around which the lipostat regulates can change based on dietary and environmental variables and so for example you know just to give a an example that you'll be familiar with and others probably listening will be familiar with if people go if you take someone on a typical diet and put them on a low carb diet you don't have to tell them to reduce their calorie intake that will occur spontaneously and they will lose loose fat and end up in the typical person comfortably being at a lower weight they're not experiencing the starvation response and you can see this on other diets as well so i think there are things we can do to change the set point however that person that doesn't mean that they are cured so if they went back to their other diet if they just went back to how they used to be eating so they're not maintaining this attempt for weight reduction anymore they generally will go back to where they were so it's not that there's a durable resetting of the set point to like flipping a switch and resetting like restarting your you know computer it's more like the set point has been modified because it's in a different environment and as long as you maintain that change you can maintain the effect but if the change goes away then the effect goes away where do we think is the greatest window of vulnerability for someone just going back to these two hypothetical individuals who and let's just now make it even more let's take the genes out of it let's pretend they're identical twins born in the same household uh clearly they both can they both possess the genetic traits that would allow them in the right environment to become obese um but one of them you know let's just say had an injury in high school that kind of kept him home from playing sports and he he ended up playing more video games and kind of eating more the other one was more active so that explains why when they're now 40 years old one's 40 pounds overweight the other's not are there windows in a person's life when they are more susceptible to that resetting of a set point a higher and higher set point which it sounds to me like it never goes down it's a monotonic crank right i don't really know i honestly don't know i mean i think certainly there is a substantial potential for most people to gain weight at almost any point in life um so i'm not really sure i think i think one and and and by the way let me say that i think there are other people who could probably answer this question better than me there are people who have studied the trajectory of weight gain over the life span so part of the issue here is i'm just not that well versed on this literature but one thing i'll point out that is potentially interesting is there may be an influence of the intrauterine environment so what's going on as you're developing inside the uterus so there is evidence i wouldn't call it strong but there is evidence that women who undergo bariatric surgery for obesity and lose a lot of weight their children are at a lower risk of developing obesity than women of similar weight who did not undergo bariatric surgery and the effect size is large wait a second meaning two women of the same weight have children one of them was is that weight naturally and the other one is weight reduced at that weight secondary to gastric bypass no no so um think about two women with severe obesity uh okay okay yeah yeah one of them has gastric bypass yep okay after that surgery they both have children but starting from different weights obviously because the gastric bypass one is weight reduced okay yes and the children of the woman who had the surgery and had previously lost weight before getting pregnant will have a lower risk of obesity and again i wouldn't call the evidence strong and what if what if she achieved what if she achieved that weight loss without gastric bypass so what if you had two women who were overweight and one of them lost weight through diet and nutrition and then they got pregnant i don't know um i am not aware of data on that i would if you know if you wanted me to guess i would say it would probably be similar um but is gastric bypass does that have you know is that really the same physiologically as um [Music] the physiological situation that you get from diet and weight loss diet and lifestyle see i don't i don't think it is i think i think gastric bypass is a unique situation where provided a person doesn't take in liquid calories it's it's it's quite durable uh the the ruin why um obviously liquid calories can completely disrupt the feedback mechanism there um kind of similar by the way to a glp-1 agonist this actually kind of gets back to i've seen patients who take semiglutid who don't lose weight and the way you can cheat semiglutid is to drink your calories if you if you drink massive amounts of calories again this is anecdotal i don't think i don't know that this has been studied i'm just saying this based on observing a number of patients but um you know if you continue to drink a lot of alcohol if you continue to drink juices and things like that you're you you can sort of bypass some of the the glp1 effect on the brain it would seem that that's my only explanation for why i see that um and and we do see that definitely with with with gastric bypass so who knows about about what that look what that would look like i mean what what advice or what insight comes from this as it pertains to a person who's listening to this and by definition half the people listening to this are probably at a body weight above where they want to be what's the takeaway right in terms of pregnancy no no just in terms of overall weight loss like how how do we get uh you know we're sitting here in this environment that is you know almost deliberately trying to put weight on us we're not going to get any help from our ancestors because the reality of it is our ancestors didn't care if we gained weight quite happy to have us gain weight actually they just want to make sure we don't starve um and so what can they do and more importantly how do they keep it off because as you said most people can lose weight but the keeping it off is really uh it poses a challenge yeah so i think that i'm i'm going to take this as a question about on the individual level which i assume is what you meant so i think that there are a couple of different things to think about um i think that for people who have um for people who have obesity bottom mass index 30 35 i think it's worthwhile to consider medical treatment so something like semaglotide for example the tools that we have now are just way better than what they used to be that's a separate topic we could talk about but somaglite as far as we can tell it's a very safe drug it causes something like 18 weight loss which is much better than the typical effect you're going to see in diet and lifestyle strategies but like diet and lifestyle is something you have to maintain so i think at this point now that the tools are getting better particularly now that the tools are getting better i would recommend seeing an obesity medicine specialist i think for people who are you know experiencing [Music] substantially impaired quality of life or really concern about the health impacts um about you know if we switch the focus to people who might just want to lose a few pounds or who are overweight where they're not in as perhaps not as serious uh situation i think the brain so your appetite and your body fatness are very much regulated by your brain based on inputs that your brain is receiving and so and a lot of that is non-conscious and so the approach that i like to take is to try to give the non-conscious brain signals that are going to be more consistent with your goals signals that are going to tell your brain to regulate things in a more slimming direction and that way you're not relying on heavy exercise of willpower all the time which i don't think is really sustainable or effective for most people you are instead of setting up a scenario where you're you have these non-conscious urges that you're having to fight with your conscious brain you're addressing the non-conscious urges directly so there is no is no fight that's the that's what i prefer and so i think controlling these signals that your brain is receiving is is really important and there are different ways to do that one of them is to control your food environment so the sensory cues in your environment that your brain is exposed to whether there is food in your immediate vicinity how tempting that food is how hard you have to work for it so like if you can just grab it and put it in your mouth that's not as good as if you have to you know walk into a room and then peel an orange before you can eat it um just little effort barriers like that and then um and then with the types of food we're eating there are um there's a wide variation in the number of calories that it takes to feel satisfied at a meal depending on what foods you're eating so typically a typical person sits down and eats food until they feel satisfied and then they stop eating that is the [Music] intuitive typical natural easy way of interacting with food but depending on what's on your plate that point can be reached with vastly different numbers of calories so if you're eating so is the is the approximate sign of satiation more um a gastric distension function in that immediate cessation mode uh that's that's a great question um i don't know so okay that is important i i can say that it's important but if i were to like assign what percentage of the effect is attributable to that i don't know what percentage i would put on it like is that more than 50 percent um i think it's a very complex system the brain is receiving a lot of signals some of them are stomach distension some of them are signals from the small intestine about what the nutrient composition is some of them are simply sensory detector sensory detection of food properties and stimulating your brain knows based on those sensory properties what the nutritional composition of the food is based on prior experience that it has stored so there's a lot of stuff going on that contributes to ultimately that sensation of uh satiety satiation would be the the proper term for it and uh and satisfaction that causes us to end the meal certainly stomach distension is is a biggie yeah so anyway so that relates to calorie density which is an important determinant of the satiating and satiety promoting properties of food so in other words how many calories are there per gram or per volume of this food if you have a food that has more volume per calories it fills up your stomach more it stimulates those stretch receptors more that goes up to your brain stem and that's a signal that opposes further food intake and then uh protein so more protein is more satiating per calorie [Music] palatability the better something tastes the less it fills you up per calorie and i'm actually not sure how to disentangle that from um calorie density not sure how much of like what's the independent variable there and what's the dependent variable or is it sum of both i don't know the answer to that but they're both strongly correlated with uh lower satiety and i've also seen these experiments where people are drinking from a bowl or a cup and it's being refilled constantly versus one where it just kind of runs out i mean what are the differences in how much people consume based on just i mean i noticed this in myself like i'm eating i put a little too much in the bowl but i eat it anyway because it's like oh i got to finish this thing and if i had finished it 10 bites earlier i would have been totally happy again i don't know how much that matters right does that does that type of behavior factor in the long tail here or is that just an acute thing that is sort of irrelevant in terms of you know optimal weight maintenance i think it's very plausible but the problem is that stuff comes from brian wansink and so it pretty much got blown up he was the guy at cornell that kind of did he falsify a bunch of data or something i don't think there is clear evidence that he falsified i think there are at least he hacked a lot of it pretty badly oh yeah really badly and and there are some data where it's not clear where they came from and they're very implausible uh so i i don't i don't know how strong the evidence is that there was actual fabrication i think there may have been some evidence of that um i don't know where that landed but basically there were a bunch of problems and yeah he got blown up so um i would say that anything that has his name on it at this point is pretty suspect yeah and the the soup the refilling soup bowls was one of his classic experiments um and i'm just gonna disclose that i did cite one of his studies in my book so i wasn't immune uh from getting taken in by some of this stuff one of the things i that going back to the sort of the um energy balance model versus the carbohydrate insulin model one of the arguments in favor of the carbohydrates insulin model is other examples of growth that are regulated from the hormones out to the intake of energy and i was thinking about this the other day because i measure my kids i have three kids and every three months each of them gets a little tick on their closet door and i don't know if you have kids or if you've done this but anybody listening to this who measures their kids at regular intervals i don't know why i pick three months but four times a year um the non-linearity of this is unbelievable right they'll go little little jump jump slow down jump like it just it's pretty intense and that growth correlates with how much they seem to eat during that interval period like right now my youngest who's not yet five i think he eats more than the other two combined and i'm probably not being facetious he goes to a preschool or a pre-k where they give them breakfast there he eats a breakfast that he eats two breakfasts at home then he goes there and still eats more than all the other kids i mean the kid's just an eating machine and he's growing commensurate with that i think most people would agree he's not growing because of how much he's eating he's eating that much because of how much he's growing so he's responding to growth hormone and all these other things and and i think that's basically the central thrust of this carbohydrate insulin model right which is whether it be sleep disturbances that increase you know or decrease insulin signaling or foods that stimulate insulin they're driving that hormonal environment that is driving the increase in food intake but i think experimentally what can we say about the differences in these models i i and i guess i think experimentally you have to think about this in terms of animals and humans right it seems to me that the balance of experimental data would suggest the energy balance model is easier to explain is that would you agree with that i think so although i do want to acknowledge uh the fact that they're not mutually exclusive so i think it has not been ruled out that there could be a contribution from that type of a model why is this so important is it so important is it important to understand this um i i i suppose the implications have to come down to how we treat the condition right i think that it is important in the sense that if you understand the mechanism of something it makes it easier to address and you know if you look at the history of obesity drugs weight loss drugs i should say most of them were discovered in entirely haphazard ways like dinitrophenol was a high explosive that was used in world war one and somebody figured out if you take it it makes you lose weight and it does so by increasing your energy expenditures so some people manage to cook themselves and like literally from the inside out and then you look at other drugs and most of them are psychiatric drugs they're just repurposed psychiatric drugs that just happen to cause weight loss some psychiatric drugs cause weight gain some cause weight loss and the ones that cause weight loss we just said hey can we repurpose these can we combine them to accentuate the effect and that that was kind of most of the history of weight loss drugs and now for the first time we have drugs that are safe and effective fda approved i should say we have a drug ouigo v aka cemacletide that is safe and effective and was developed for this purpose based on mechanism from the bottom up so it wasn't just a haphazard discovery so i think we are in a new era now where we are actually designing weight loss drugs based on mechanism and so i think based on an understanding of the biological mechanisms of of regulation and so i think because we're out of the haphazard era and into a more targeted refined era i think that's we're in a place where it becomes really important to understand mechanism and you know in cardiovascular medicine i'm sure you recognize this like there are incredible insights that have been coming out of the genetics that have resulted in therapies like the ptsd inhibitors thank you thank you i always mix the letters up um that's a great example of it where we first understood the biology and then we came out with the therapy and it works awesome and so um i think that's the era we are getting into now with obesity so i think it actually is really important to understand the mechanism i think my prediction is over time these models will have more and more in common i mean one of the arguments against at least the way the carbohydrate insulin model is typically played out is actually given by semiglutid which raises insulin in the short run so one of the things we always you know see when we put patients on this drug is they're going to lose a ton of weight and their insulin levels go up slightly now this tends to resolve over time so for a long enough period of time we tend to see insulin come down but in the short run for about three months we see elevations in insulin and we also know that it's increasing insulin sensitivity so they're getting really the double effect but it's hard to reconcile that with a model that would state insulin must go down for weight to go down for fat to go down yeah i mean i think that model is just not even plausible at this point i think you know if you want to say is it a factor i think that's still in play but to say like this is the determinant i just don't even think that's plausible at this point um and yeah i mean this class of drugs was identified based on its ability to increase glucose stimulated insulin secretion that is what glp1 does it's an incretin hormone and so that was the original purpose and why it was used in type 2 diabetes management because it gives people more insulin around meals when they really need it because you know if you just inject insulin that's a really kind of crude way to manage your blood glucose it's not time specific so glp-1 gave it that much needed time specificity and also had some other beneficial effects and it was only after that that they figured out that it has this big impact on food intake and and body weight so yeah i mean absolutely i agree with that um and yeah there's just there's just a lot of other literature i think you know i i wanna i wanna talk about i wanna like throw the hypothesis of bone though um i think that if you look so if you look at genome-wide association studies on body mass index they're all about the brain largely about the brain if you look at genome-wide association studies on body fat distribution so you're getting rid of the bmi you're controlling for bmi and you're saying where is that fat on the body those have more of an insulin signal so insulin pops up pretty prominently in those and so i think there's still a world and you know the distribution of fat on the body seems very related to insulin signaling the total amount of fat on the body seems more related to energy intake if i remember what we talked about really at the beginning was it's not just regulated by the brain but it's on it's more on the intake side of the equation yeah and i would say you know even to add a little bit of extra nuance on top of that is we're really talking about body mass index so you know if you consider this idea of energy partitioning which the carbohydrate insulin model is all about there could be some of that flying under the radar of body mass index and so i don't think the door is closed to that and the fact that it's showing up in body fat distribution and now you know david ludwig is publishing studies suggesting that there could be uh correlations between baseline insulin secretion and how much what proportion of fat loss is lost as fat versus lean tissue i think you know there's a world in which there could be some energy partitioning effect i just don't think it explains obesity because obesity is not just energy partitioning you have a bigger body you're eating more energy you're burning more energy you have more lean mass more fat that phenotype is not explained by energy partitioning but could there be some subtle energy partitioning phenotype that is operating also maybe so that's kind of like my uh like view of how there could be a way that this has validity yeah it's interesting and you said something earlier about um the more you restrict carbohydrate or the more you restrict fat typically the more weight you're going to lose the sweet spot if you want to gain weight is to have lots of both of them is that how much of that do you think comes down to the hedonic component of how good ice cream tastes the ubiquity of food choices or do you think there's something very unique physiologically going on you know you've probably heard of the potato diet i mean all these diets just sound so stupid but i mean again it's sort of one of these things like if you talk to somebody who just mainlines potatoes all day they lose weight like crazy right yep absolutely and and this has been shown really clearly in animal models which have the advantage of you can get really tight control for a large proportion of the animal's lifespan john speakman published a study that is the best one that's been done in animals where 29 different diets i believe and five different strains of mice they systematically varied the carbohydrate to fat ratio in the diet and they said how does that interact with body fatness and what they saw was if you start with animals that are on a low fat high carbohydrate diet and you start replacing that carb with fat they get fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter until you hit about 60 percent and then you if you keep increasing the fat and decreasing the carbohydrate they get slimmer again and there are studies published mice lose weight on a ketogenic diet just like humans do you put mice on the diet you can put rats on the diet they lose weight so it's really in the middle that the problem is and which is ironic because that's where the standard american diet is if you just walk into the grocery store and just eat without any filtering you will eat that wrong combination of fat and carbohydrate exactly and if you look anywhere in the world where people are rich enough and industrialized enough to eat whatever they want that's generally what you're going to see at least after a couple decades of you know cultural adaptation you're gonna see pretty equal proportions of fat and carbohydrate that's what you see in most parts of the world and so um so why is that well i think there are some hypotheses that can be considered and and let me just be clear here that this is speculative so i don't want to present this as the answer because i don't think we really know but i think this is primarily an empirical observation that we're trying to explain um but some explanations you could say maybe it's a physiological effect so if you're not eating much carbohydrate your body has to work a little bit harder to synthesize glucose for example so there are some physiological ways in which you're kind of increasing the demands a little bit metabolic demands same with very low um fat diets you're slightly increasing metabolic demands you have to synthesize you're going to synthesize more fatty acids and um but i don't know i don't think that's i don't think that's a great explanation because those metabolic demands are very small in speakman's experiments did these were all ad libitum i assume yes so were they just eating were they also significantly eating less at the extremes in terms of total energy intake and were they controlled for protein yes yes i think the answer is yes to both of those if if i'm recalling correctly um and although you know i do want to put a little asterisk on that that sometimes there is not a perfectly tight correlation in rodent studies between energy intake and fat gain so you can get some results where it's not fully explained by that or in some cases not explained at all so um yeah where was i what was i saying lost my train of thought there well i think we're still trying to reconcile why at the extremes you're yeah what's that is it is it all being driven by less intake or is there some increased metabolic cost of living at the extremes yeah so the physiology would be one and then the other would be just the neurobiology and the food intake and i think that's the most satisfying explanation we have right now is that it is simply more appealing to eat food more motivating to eat food that has both carbohydrate and fat i'm not saying i have strong evidence that that's the explanation but that's kind of the only thing i can think of that explains it i mean why else the metabolic cost of being at the extremes should be pretty modest it can't explain effects of hundreds of calories a day which are which is what's observed when you put people on a very low fat or a very low carb diet their energy intake declines by hundreds of calories a day right away automatically and so it's yeah that's the only thing i can think of is that essentially the food has less implicit value to reward regions of the brain because of how our motivation is determined for certain types of food properties the food is intrinsically less motivating and so we eat less of it that's my best guess as to the main reason and it's interesting i mean i think it's not very difficult to take your carbohydrate intake down to five to seven percent like a ketogenic diet will do that and it's a pretty easy diet to adhere to especially today harder ten years ago when there were fewer sort of food choices geared towards it but if i mean i'm not necessarily saying it's a overly pleasant diet but it's not difficult you don't have to put a huge amount of effort to eat five percent of your calories and carbohydrates today i don't even know how one would go about getting only five percent of their calories from fat that that is a much harder thing to do is it not yeah i think it would be very difficult to get that low when you look at um studies that test low fat diets some of the lowest fat diets i've seen were in the kind of ten percent fat range um i mean even foods like you know whole wheat and corn have a fair amount of fat in them not a lot of fat but i don't remember exactly what it is but not far off from 10 just from those foods that we would call starch foods um yeah so i think it is quite challenging to get that low in fat you can do it with um more refined diets like semi-purified diets it's not so hard to do that in rodent studies but to design a diet that someone will actually eat as a human in a you know randomized controlled trial or something at that level of fat intake i think is pretty challenging yeah i think 10 is i mean even 15 is not easy i mean you've you're really working hard to do it and you know i'm not convinced that there are great health benefits to that either um probably better than being in the in the messy middle but it's pretty hard to do so last thing i want to ask you about was red pen reviews so so tell folks a little bit about how long you've been doing that and what's the frequency with which you guys put these reviews out yeah so red pen reviews is a 501c3 nonprofit that publishes the most informative consistent and unbiased reviews of popular nutrition books available and the thing that really makes us unique is that we have developed this semi-quantitative review method structured review method that we apply to each book that yields numerical scores for scientific accuracy reference accuracy and healthfulness and essentially what this does is it allows us to apply the same rigorous method to all books such that you know where it's coming from where the numbers are coming from and you can compare and then apples to apple's way between different books so you could say i want to know the best book on topic x and you can literally compare the scores of two books apples to apples and choose the one that has the highest let's say scientific accuracy and uh okay go ahead i was gonna say how often do you do this is a pretty labor intensive process so how many do you bang out in a year it takes us about 40 to 100 hours per book and um we have we've been operating since 2019 and we have 14 reviews i will say that our pace was quite slow last year due to covid related time challenges so we're on target to have probably six to eight reviews published this year and um i think we have some things going on behind the scenes that could potentially greatly accelerate that pace we're seeking funding how many folks do you have that uh reviewed the books we have a total of i believe eight reviewers right now wow okay so each reviewer might do one a year on average on average yeah but the way it turns out is that some people do the majority of reviews and then other people only rarely do a review and how do you guys select books for review we are trying to maximize our impact on public health knowledge and public health so we really try to pick the books that are most impactful right now so we're looking for books that are selling the most we're looking for books that are having the most social media engagement we're looking for books from authors that are particularly influential so we're really trying to give people information about the things that they are already interested in so what are some of the recent ones that you guys have published which books obviously we talked about the carnivore code is one of them yeah so that's one of the recent ones let's see i'm just going to pull it up redpenreviews.org [Music] the most recent one we did was the volumetrics diet ultimate volumetrics diet by barbara rolls before that we did the carnivore code i was the primary reviewer on that we have a primary reviewer and a peer reviewer before that eat drink and be healthy buy a walter will it before that eat fat get thin by mark hyman so that's a taste of some of the ones that we've been doing and um given that you've been doing this for three years now anything surprise you so far were there any that you went in thinking yeah this seems like it's going to be a pretty good book and you came away thinking no this they really didn't get this right and vice versa where you went into it thinking this is going to be nonsense and you came out thinking actually they've changed my view on something yeah absolutely i think one of the things that has really come into focus um through the course of this process is that credentials are not a reliable correlate of information quality so there are people that have mds and you know like david perlmutter he's a board-certified neurologist and his book grain brain got the lowest scientific accuracy score of any book we've reviewed and i'm not trying to pick on anybody in particular but that's just an example of the credentials not lining up with the scientific accuracy and we've seen that in many cases so it i would say you know probably there is some correlation there so i think credentials they're not completely meaningless but once you get into people who are highly credentialed it's just highly variable some of their books do really well some of their books do really poorly so that's that's been somewhat of a surprise to me i mean like you know we we i think most people who are educated in the sphere know that there's a lot of low quality information in the sphere right but i think you can't help but be shocked sometimes at just how bad the situation is like even people and you know we know like in science there's a replicability crisis so scientists are not infallible there's problems like this even in this peer-reviewed literature but once you get outside of the sphere where there's accountability and you're in the public sphere where there's very little of accountability it's like a free-for-all and many people even those who are well credentialed share information that is very low quality and there's very most people have very little ability to detect it and even you know somebody like me who i consider myself knowledgeable at least in some areas i can get taken in too and maybe i don't i might read a book and it seems compelling i'll tell you the carnivore code it did worse than i expected i as i was reading it i actually there were parts where i was like yeah this is interesting i'm going to look into this is pretty this is kind of making sense to me and it wasn't until i started checking the citations and doing scientific literature searches where i was just like no this is really not the this is not the best interpretation that a root that you know an unbiased person would come to looking at this this body of evidence and so yeah i mean i think um there have been many surprises and most of them were updates in the direction of thinking that the state of popular nutrition books is actually even worse than i thought well it's interesting you know i'm in the process of trying to finish my book and one of the things that is so daunting is the fact checking process and i don't know what what an author relies on because i could certainly never rely on my publisher to fact check my book it's too technical like they they don't have people with the uh knowledge to do the fact check so i have to have analysts who work for me fact check but they have to be analysts who had no help in doing the research for the book because you have to get fresh eyes on it so i think that means my book will come out more accurate than it probably would otherwise and yet that's very difficult i mean that's i mean i just i just know there's going to be something we get wrong right we're just we're going to either you know incorrectly cite something or we're going to have misinterpreted it or something like that and i feel like we're we're in as good a position as almost anybody can be given the size of our team um and yet it's still very daunting there's something about a book that is daunting in the sense that you know from the you and you know this you've written a book from the time you put your last last last edit into a book until it hits the shelves is about eight months something's gonna change in those eight months if so even if it was perfect the day you finished it which i think is impossible eight months later it's not let alone two years later yeah absolutely i agree with that and you know every book's gonna have mistakes but and the process that you described is i guarantee far more rigorous than most books that are being published in the sphere and as you said publishers do not impose a filter on the contents of these books i mean very little of one they just simply do not view it as their job to police the claims of authors so if somebody comes in with an md for example their position is and this is literally what my publisher told me they're like you're the expert we're not experts you know we are not here to check your work and so for me my process was i sent each chapter out to experts in the field and had them look at it does that mean my book has no mistakes absolutely not i have you know i've been cataloging my mistakes on my mistakes page on my website the ones that i know about i think that's i think that's inevitable um and i've sort of accepted the fact that that's going to be the only way i'll sleep at night is just acknowledging five percent of this stuff is going to be wrong let's collectively figure out what it is and let's create a repository where we can put the updates i think that's absolutely the best attitude because not only is that a truth seeking attitude but you are putting yourself in a position where you're not you're not presenting yourself as someone who has to be you know right to be rational you're presenting yourself as someone who's trying to get towards the truth and your audience can help you and help you know all together to get closer to the truth and that's kind of the the attitude that i like to cultivate as well and um yeah you know thinking about one thing i want to mention in this context is that the method that we developed for red pen reviews is available on our website for authors to to see and it is part of the reason why we do that is because we're trying to help authors write better books like there are we do random citation checks that's one aspect of it um we have certain criteria for helpfulness we have certain criteria for scientific accuracy and it can't be gamed like this i don't think our method can be gamed like if you look at our criteria and you write a book that fulfills you know that you think would score well that's going to be a good book from an evidence standpoint i don't think it can be gamed and so like when i think about me and my book which came prior to red pen reviews i would have loved to have this resource and i think if i had had it i i would have written a book with higher evidence quality so you know just like knowing that there's accountability and having a method that kind of helps you turn that into something concrete to improve what you're doing i like to view our organization as not just being you know finger-wagging at people you know who make mistakes but more providing also providing a resource for you know to help the information quality be good from the beginning tell me is the are the reviews available to everyone or only to donors yeah absolutely they are freely available to anyone um we love receiving donations but um access to our resources does not depend on that excellent well stefan this has been super interesting i i always enjoy uh interacting with you and talking about all of these things i think it is kind of amazing how much we still don't know about something that is so ubiquitous and so important but i also get the sense we're kind of converging and i and i do think that these these good faith debates that exist between people like you kevin david ludwig i think they're really good for the field because i think it's forcing people to be sharper in their thinking and ultimately i think getting us closer to theories that are aligning better with experimental evidence i know my thinking on this has changed quite a bit and i certainly find now the balance of the evidence more on the energy balance side of the equation but i constantly enjoy just trying to understand both sides of this and it's uh it's very complicated again suggesting that there's more overlap than we probably appreciate yeah well i appreciate you having me on it was fun to discuss all this stuff yeah thanks stefan thank you [Music]
