## AI Summary

I'll help structure an analysis of this excerpt from The Drive podcast with Stuart McGill. Note that this appears to be only a portion of the full episode, so my analysis will be limited to the content provided.

1. **Executive Summary**:
This segment focuses on the importance of core stability and proper movement patterns for longevity and injury prevention. Dr. McGill shares a powerful story about helping an elderly woman maintain her independence through basic movement instruction. The discussion emphasizes how principles learned from elite athletes can be applied to help the general population, particularly the elderly, maintain functional movement patterns.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Energy leakage in movement patterns can lead to both decreased performance and increased injury risk [00:00:00]
- Proper movement patterns can be taught quickly with the right cues and instruction [00:04:10]
- Core stability is crucial for preventing injury during everyday activities [00:00:00]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Focus on core stability for injury prevention [00:00:00]
- Learn proper movement patterns for basic activities like getting up from seated positions [00:03:19]
- Spread feet apart for better stability during sit-to-stand movements [00:05:04]

4. **Exercise & Movement**:
Specific Techniques:
- Hand placement guidance: "Put your kneecap between your thumb and hands" [00:04:10]
- Anti-shrug shoulder position [00:04:39]
- Hip-hinge movement: "Pull your hands up your thighs by pulling your hips through" [00:04:39]
- Proper squat technique with feet spread and forward lean [00:05:25]

5. **Notable Quotes**:
"I don't care about the performance, I care about the preservation and longevity of my body for whatever number of years I have left." [00:00:00]

"All I did was learn from the best weightlifters in the world, people who know how to move load, learn what the efficiency was and turn it into a hack to change a person's life." [00:06:00]

6. **Follow-up Questions**:
- What specific core stability exercises are most effective for longevity?
- How should movement patterns be modified as we age?
- What are the key indicators of poor movement patterns that people should watch for?
- How can these principles be applied to other daily activities?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] You know, most people listening to this are not going to lament the fact that they didn't run as fast as they could have when they were younger or that they didn't punch or swim with as much, you know, prowess as they could have. Where I think we should all care about this is that it's not just that the energy leakage costs you performance. It clearly does. It's that it predisposes you to injury. And that's where I think we have to bring this back, right? is what you know when I exercise today I don't care about the performance I care about the preservation and longevity of my body for whatever number of years I have left. So this is really where I think stability matters. It's you know what are the exercises I need to be doing? What are the exercises my patient need to be doing? So that as we age and we walk up the flight of stairs or carry something heavy, we don't hurt ourselves because we don't have that core stability that can resist the deformation that's going to allow energy to seep out of the system. >> Well said. a story was coming to mind as you were saying that I'll be giving a lecture or teaching a class and I'm and I and I'll show some data from an elite athlete and there will be therapists and clinicians in the room who say we don't deal with elite athletes, we deal with the elderly or we deal with sick people. And I think what are you thinking? I'm showing you what the human body has the potential to do. And your arrogance won't allow you to learn what is possible. And I'm going to give you a a very emotional I hope I can get through this. A very emotional story to to to show the the arrogance that exists among some of our colleagues.

[00:02:11] Occasionally medical groups, a hospital or whatever will ask, "Would you come out and assess three patients in our auditorium in front of all our medical staff?" I was at this facility. It was in Europe, and they brought out a The first person was a rugby player. Fair enough. And I had 20 minutes and declared what I thought was going on.

[00:02:31] The next one was a woman in her early 70s, clearly distraught. You could look at her posture, her carriage. She was defeated by the world and uh uh she came onto the stage and I said, "Can you tell me your story?" And she she said a little few sentences and then she said, "But the therapist says that I have to leave my home now. When I get off the toilet, I'm a bit unsteady and she's afraid I'm going to fall on the floor. I can't get off the floor by myself and I'm just gonna lay there and no one will discover me. I have to leave my home. She started to cry at this point, Peter. She said, "What? What's going to happen to my cat?" And all this sort of stuff. And I said, "Really?

[00:03:19] Would would someone please bring me out a stool and this will be our simulated toilet?" So an assistant brought in a stool onto the stage. Um I said, "Okay, pretend that's the toilet and the seat." She turned and and had no idea how to move and just sort of plopped and collapsed on the toilet. And then I'm just going to turn this down because I want you to see my lower body kinematics as we're moving here.

[00:03:47] And then uh I said, "Would you get up uh off the chair?" And I can't remember whether she was wearing a skirt or pants. Pants I think it was, but nonetheless, knees together and she just sort of collapsed. And I had to help her. she was going to collapse onto the floor. And so I said, I I I want you to humor me now.

[00:04:10] You're my mirror. And I try when I coach, I try and use minimum words. I said, do this with your hands. Put your kneecap between your thumb and your hands as you slide your hands down. Good. Now, I want you to be a leaning tower. Leaning tower forward and backwards. and play with the curve of your back. Do you have any pain now? She said, "No." And I said, "Watch my shoulders. You're shrugged. I want you to anti- shrug."

[00:04:39] She did that. Perfect. And now I said, "Pull your hands up your thighs by pulling your hips through. Don't lift with your back. Pull your hips through." Pete, she had it done in three repetitions. That was now her pattern. And I said, "Okay, think of what we've just done and sit on the toilet." And I said, "Whoops. Spread your feet apart."

[00:05:04] And there she went, slid her hands down. And now I said, then she put her knees together. And I said, "Now stand up." She was going right back to the incompetent movement that caused her inability and disability before. I said, "Spread your hands apart and pull your heels underneath you. sniff some air.

[00:05:25] Now lean forward and do what you now know how to do. And she did a perfect squat. Do it again. And then by the third repetition, big smile came on her face. This the emotional part. I said, "What's up with you?" She said, "I don't have to leave my home, do I?" Said, "No." Do you know many of those hardbaked surgeons and clinicians started to cry as well? For the first time, they realized all I did was teach her weightlifting 101.

[00:06:00] And remember how this story started with the arrogance of some of our colleagues who say, "I don't want to hear stories about elite athletes. I deal with old people or sick people." And that's why they continue to not have the skill set to help their people. All I did was learn from the best weightlifters in the world, people who know how to move load, learn what the efficiency was and turn it into a hack to change a person's life. Anyway, there that's that's a pretty emotional story and I I I hope we do that quite often. But it's a matter of, you know, I I know you like cars.

[00:06:43] Why does Honda race F1 race cars? Well, they don't anymore, but when they did, and the reason was they learned about automotive technology and the gear shift change in your Honda Civic came from the F1 racetrack. So, that's why we work with elite athletes so I can bring it down. That's that's I I love working with them of course, but this is the they just give it away free to us and yet some of our colleagues are are just so closed off they don't want to hear about elite performance. >> Let let's talk a little bit about first of all that's a that's an absolutely beautiful story and and thank you for sharing that. Um uh you know it's a sadly common story too and and to me I think the saddest part of that story is how many of those patients don't get the chance to sit on a stage with you for 30 minutes and learn that movement. Um, and um, I I I I don't, you know, you've been around long enough that I'm sure you have a better sense of this, but I feel maybe optimistically that we are in a place now where people are starting to appreciate the importance of strength and stability and that we're less afraid of this. you know, there's more discussion of the importance of resistance training and that it's not a it's not a young guy thing to do. It's an everybody thing to do. But given the arc of your career, am am I being just sort of delusional or do you really think that that we're we're in a in a in a in a in a coming of age here?
