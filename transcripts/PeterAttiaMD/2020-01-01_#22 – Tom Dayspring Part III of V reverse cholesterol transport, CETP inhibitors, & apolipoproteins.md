## Description

Original release date: 10/17/18

In this five-part series, Thomas Dayspring, M.D., FACP, FNLA, a world-renowned expert in lipidology, and one of Peter’s most important clinical mentors, shares his wealth of knowledge on the subject of lipids. In Part III, Peter and Tom dig into why “reverse cholesterol transport” is a lot more nuanced than what most of us are taught, lipid transport, apolipoproteins, and more. In addition, this episode highlights the complexity of HDL and a discussion about the CETP inhibitor trials.

We discuss:
-Reverse cholesterol transport [1:40];
-Lipid transportation, apolipoproteins, VLDL, IDL, and LDL particles [11:00];
-Remnant lipoproteins and apoC-III [16:45];
-Particles having sex: lipid exchange [28:00];
-Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) and CETP inhibitors [40:45];
-2006 CETP inhibitor trial: torcetrapib (Pfizer) [54:45];
-2012 CETP inhibitor trial: dalcetrapib (Hoffmann–La Roche) [56:15];
-2017 CETP inhibitor trials: evacetrapib (Eli Lilly) and anacetrapib (Merck) [58:00]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's my analysis of this episode of The Drive with Tom Dayspring:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode focuses on reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), lipid transportation, and HDL function. The discussion delves deep into how the traditional understanding of "good" vs "bad" cholesterol is overly simplistic. Tom Dayspring explains how HDL's role in cholesterol transport is far more complex than previously thought, and discusses the failure of CETP inhibitors as therapeutic agents.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Liver makes only 20% of body cholesterol; peripheral cells make the rest [01:00]
- HDL particles can transfer cholesterol to LDL particles through CETP [29:00]
- 30-60% of cholesterol in LDL particles arrives via HDL particles [41:52]
- VLDL and chylomicrons primarily transport triglycerides and phospholipids, not cholesterol [33:24]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:
Universal Recommendations:
- Focus on ApoB/LDL particle number rather than just HDL levels [54:04]

**7. Biomarkers & Testing**:
Key biomarkers discussed:
- ApoB levels [24:00]
- HDL cholesterol [46:00]
- VLDL cholesterol [23:22]
- ApoC3 [16:48]

**9. Notable Quotes**:
"Stop using the term reverse cholesterol transport - it's idiotic, it's so immensely complex" [46:03]

"What if you want to use those darn adjectives with a patient? What's going to determine what's good or bad cholesterol is what that lipoprotein gonna do with its cholesterol molecule" [31:02]

**10. Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the relationship between red blood cell cholesterol content and FH?
2. How do different dietary interventions affect CETP activity?
3. What are the latest developments in HDL functionality testing?

Would you like me to expand on any particular section?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] [Music] hey everyone welcome to the Peter Atia drive I'm your host Peter Atia the drive is a result of my hunger for optimizing performance health longevity critical thinking along with a few other obsessions along the way I've spent the last several years working with some of the most successful top performing individuals in the world and this podcast is my attempt to synthesize what

[00:00:25] I've learned along the way to help you live a higher quality more fulfilling life if you enjoy this podcast you can find more information on today's episode and other topics at Peter via MD com

[00:00:41] welcome everybody to episode 3 of the week of Dayspring in this episode we talk about reverse cholesterol transport we talk about lipid transportation we talk about a polite proteins and we talk about sea type inhibitors and HDL of all the things we talk about here the thing that I think is the most interesting is the discussion on HDL which I think most people today would agree is far from being understood and is probably far more complicated than LDL biology I would say that of all of the things that

[00:01:16] Tom and I discussed over this 7 hours I learned the most personally in our HDL discussion and our discussion of the C type inhibitors I was very familiar with all of the trials here but Tom brought a level of nuance to this that actually sharpened my understanding of this and for that I am of course eternally grateful so welcome to episode 3 let's define now direct versus indirect RCT all right so if we're talking about the cholesterol it's in lipoproteins so at the end of the day is if you have perfect cholesterol homeostasis and for some reason or some cholesterol excess in your body it's gonna wind up in your artery wall or if you're lucky it's gonna wind up in your stool that would be the preference had knows beyond the certain point we don't want cholesterol we've talked about that so far so now how can the body get rid of cholesterol that's already inside is made by cells the motion joy and everybody thinks the liver makes most of the cholesterol liver me we're not talking about the brain now that's separate of your rest of your cholesterol in your body the liver makes 20% of it the rest is making your peripheral cells so the bulk of your cholesterol is in your body if your peripheral cells are making too much it's got to get out or that cell will die so the cells through even beyond abca1 a flux that we've talked about they can free the fuse out of there is another ABC transporter that can pump cholesterol out and it gets in a lipoprotein or it binds to albumin or binds to a red blood cell and it can be taken elsewhere so classically we were taught that haha the HDL particles are definitely a substrate that a cell can eat flux cholesterol out into especially an empty HDL a PO a 1 the protein itself that's on lipid ated or a real baby HDL particles very small HDL particle is a great cholesterol acceptor and we have membrane transporters that can give them free cholesterol all right so now the

[00:03:28] HDL has cholesterol and what were we thought well of course the HDL just brings it right back to the liver and the liver then will fit and has a need for cholesterol it'll use it up and then it'll put it in your bile it'll go down and go right out your rear end or your liver can actually change it to a bile salt which it sends down to bile and your bowel could be excreted in the stool so in effect that's a way it's major way of getting rid of cholesterol but our ileum doesn't cooperate our ileum you typically reabsorbs about 90 to 95% of the bile salts and reuses them so it's not the best way unless you can make sure that bile soul is being excreted and we have a drug the bile S&C questions that make sure that happens then you would deplete internal cholesterol so uh that's so simple so our vldls and LDLs and column microns bring cholesterol to the tissues and if for some reason is too much cholesterol the HDLs bring it back to the liver and it goes bye-bye well if you're talking to a second grader or physician at one point in our careers that made great sense that's plausible that's perfect that's why HCL's are not delivering cholesterol to the artery wall they're bringing it back to an organ that's gonna get rid of it or use it properly perfect and if the other the vldls kylos and LDLs are bringing cholesterol to the tissues they never called it that but I would say well that's forward cholesterol transport and if the HDL czar bringing it back that's reverse perfect and if we have a great balance between forward and reverse cholesterol transport that's good cholesterol homeostasis you're not gonna get in trouble and then we made the mistake of aha our metrics of these pathways are going to be LDL cholesterol may be total cholesterol or HDL cholesterol and that's where the whole thing falls apart because those metrics have zero to do with describing the complex flux and trafficking of all these pools of cholesterol or so 0 there is no cholesterol measurement in the plasma that tells you anything about movement of that movement and are yourselves building up too much cholesterol or are they not or God you have great reverse cholesterol transport so it made such perfect sense and we were all stupid in medical school we're never gonna contradict the professor or even give us two seconds worth the thought if somebody told us something that the higher your HDL cholesterol you got good rate reverse cholesterol transport because that HDL is gonna take it to the liver at a certain point in my studying of lipid understanding this stuff and I knew God what is it about not everybody with high HDL cholesterol is protected there are people with low

[00:06:11] HDL cholesterol who don't get disease but if what hdls do is reverse cholesterol transport and they're bringing cholesterol back to the liver shouldn't you rate your cholesterol go down why would eat gel cholesterol go up if it was bringing it back to the liver and being internalized there d lipid ad that made no sense to me so I knew there was more to the study and of course guys like Dan Rader who I before and Brian Brewer and John Chapman or HDL experts in this world have figured this out pretty much by now saying oh it's a this lipid transportation system is way more complex than an HDL bringing it back and it knows we give it a different name now so HCl is indeed are capable of bringing cholesterol back to the liver itself there is a receptor that will deliver the cholesterol ester from an HDL that's called the scavenger receptor b1 and SRB one there is a holo particle receptor that can internalize large HDL particles and bring them into the liver but free diffusion can also occur a big HDL can abut against the hepatocyte and cholesterol just diffuses from the HDL membrane into the liver so there are at least three pathways of cholesterol getting back to the liver hey that same thing we now know happens at the intestine also so hdls don't even have to go anywhere near the liver they can go get rid of some cholesterol at the intestine remember that theis pathway trans intestinal cholesterol reflux and now we aren't boggled our minds and our gray papers on this red blood cells carry way more cholesterol than do lipoproteins they're so much bigger now granted the cholesterol is all in your surface but they have a ton of cell membrane surface so there's free cholesterol albumin at least / albumin molecule can attach to 17 molecules of cholesterol so we now know two variable degrees both red blood cells and albumin can just abut against any cell in your body and accept free cholesterol by free diffusion and LDL particle can abut against the cell and accept cholesterol by free diffusion from a cell so now

[00:08:32] LDLs have another way of acquiring colostrum that's interesting this would be a great question for someone like Josh Knowles who's such an expert in FH but has anybody looked at red blood cell cholesterol membrane concentration or even size and FH patients because one hypothesis would be they especially the

[00:08:50] FH patients who have FH as a result LDL receptor deficiencies in some sort you'd think that there'd be more free diffusion of cholesterol from their LDL into their red blood cell yeah and whether anybody's ever looked at that I don't know it might not be the case question I'll be and theoretically free diffusion can occur between any two membrane surfaces so do their red blood cells

[00:09:13] I would imagine at a certain degree it would cool it essentially shell irregularity there might be too much noise but you'd look at the MCV or something like that and you'd see have you increased or decreased the mean corpuscular volume of these things is there anything happened no you're changing certainly the membrane structure if that process is occurring in those people whether that would affect red blood cell functionality remember when you start putting phytosterols into red blood cell membranes you get hemolytic anemias and stuff site Ostrow leimia phytosterols it's part of their pathology because the red blood cells looking for cholesterol to stay healthy not phytosterols no I didn't know that so I didn't realize the big picture of site Australia's red blood cell hemolytic anemias you know so or crazy red blood cell structure Spira sites and things like that you know so it's one way that your early investigators will this person has known

[00:10:09] Fido so what's this red blood cell problem going on this person too so so this is interesting the HDL story is one where the more time goes on the less I know I mean there are a few things in lipid ology that humble me more than my complete and utter buffoonery and ignorant when it comes to understanding high density lipoproteins it's true of all of us and that's why I don't want you reading my 2002 lipid haul oh god I would criticize somebody with spouting that stuff today so only if you read it with that in mind and you would see how things can we use a very specific example to explain this let's let's talk about the first failed CTEPH inhibitor trial which was Pfizer's back in the mid 2000 so let me give the background and then I want you to explain why this may fail before even maybe I just show it explain a little more about the lipid transportations so you know what CTP is yeah so remember

[00:11:06] I talked about the early on view was forward cholesterol transport even though they didn't call and that's the april-b family bringing cholesterol to tissues in the HDL family bringing it back and here's why that's an just such an absurd theory cuz when the intestine pumps out column microns I have a lot of your absorbed cholesterol in it in your liver certainly when it manufactures a vol particle whose primary purpose and everybody please listen to this the vo leo has two purposes one of which is not to deliver cholesterol anywhere the liver is to develop transport triglycerides energy to cells that either store or utilize Andrew fatty acids for energy and to transport phospholipids all right so that's what your VOD Elson chylomicrons dope so they're part of the forward cholesterol transportation system so the liver or the intestine excrete stem and then they're floating around so what do they do they go to adipocytes or they go to muscle cells their triglycerides are extracted and then their phospholipids break off and are utilized by cells so what are you left with when a chylomicron loses surface phospholipids and core triglycerides you're left with a smaller VLDL or a smaller column micron any lipoprotein it goes from a bigger size to a smaller size but it's still within the density of a VOD avocado micron is called a remnant it's a smaller hey if Peter just amputated my right arm now I'd be a remnant of my former self because I'd have one less arm so the V alleles and kylos have lost their core triglycerides and they've lost their core phospholipids men a few proteins and broken off too so now what happens to those remnant vldls and kylos they're virtually instantly cleared by receptors that exist in the liver primarily and what how do those receptors clear these VLDL particles and these column micron particles that have accomplished their mission and delivered triglycerides they bind to either a PO be a 100 that's on the VLDL but LDL receptors won't bind tape will be 48 in the chylomicron but they bind to a PO e and kylos and vldls typically if you're lucky have multiple copies of vldls so as soon as the kylos are vo Leo's deliver your energy deliver your phospholipids they are cleared which is why the chylomicron half-life is minutes and the Veolia half-life is a couple of hours don't ever confuse half-life with plasma residence time that's a little bit longer but it's only a few particles that are persisting beyond those average half-life or so so now any of the vldls that are not totally cleared by the liver keep getting smaller they become smaller remnants but then they change densities to a certain different degree density range so you can't call it a

[00:14:19] VLDL anymore you call it an intermediate density lipoprotein the same thing that's got a half-life of an hour that's also clear cuz ideals have a lot of apoE on it but at the livers they're being cleared there's another enzyme that transforms some of your ideals into a smaller what's an ideal remnant calls well you'd be entering a new specific grab or a density boundary and it would be called the low density lipoprotein so technically you can say yes some v/o

[00:14:52] Leo's do become ideals do become LDLs and in the Oh Leo's will hang around forever until the olio receptor clears in LDL by binding to a PO be the reason kylos vldls and IDL's get cleared so much more quickly than LDL is the a poly content which is a mega ligand for the LDL receptor the LDL receptor is really in April be a poly receptor and there are other a pony receptors too so that's why those particles don't last in just interrupt you for a sec a PO we greatly amplifies the efficacy of that ligand the a poby ligand it just is it's a preferred idea for the eater and LDL receptors are there they're called LDL receptor related receptors so what percent I'm sorry I want to come right back which name but just because I know I'll forget to ask what percentage of LDL particles also Co Express a bowi yeah so if you are lucky enough to have that genetic gift and your LDL happens to contain a name it's half-life is pretty much the same as an ideal they're gone so if they're gone you have enhanced clearance you're a PO be your LDL particle level be much lower you know get heart disease in an average population it's about three to four percent but I guarantee you there are depending on ginger and heard some people that probably have a lot of a pokey on their LDLs and of course I would bet if they were studied that they don't get heart disease you know because it's being cleared all those particles and we'll talk about it later or other able proteins that we can clearance of vldls ideals and even LDLs I'll just mention its name now it's April lipoprotein C 3 you got that on your particles you're gonna have seriously increased plasma residence time of all those things and LDL with a post C 3 on it is intensely more atherogenic than in LDL that only has

[00:16:48] April be 100 on you once told me this was probably a couple months ago we were just shooting the breeze one day and by phone and I remember you saying that if you could add one clinical assay to the Arsenal of lipid ologists it would be an a possi three assay is that still true it would because I think that's gonna be the way we really are gonna smartly identify remnant lipoproteins that are the vldls that are potentially causing trouble most field yells are not troublemakers they're cleared rapidly or the LDLs that are number one analyst as to what's going in your arterial wall a plus c3 is you know peter is over expressing insulin resistance situations so that is a and I have no doubt that one day that would be a cool test unless maybe we can just measure your genetics you the genes that give you a possi 3 except that insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance impact that which would suggest that if you took two people with the same lipid profile at the lipoprotein level but one had higher a possi 3 than the other that person's at higher risk and I think we got enough data now it shows that and to show you

[00:17:59] Pharma believes that there's a major try ongoing now within a possi 3 inhibitor that's coming because it'll be the way to get rid of so yeah oh sorry just for the listener Isis I'm not there's a pharma company in San Diego they're actually based out of San Diego since we're Sam Tameka says but it is is is yeah it's one of these new yeah and they're looking at things so keep your fingers crossed we should come back and talk about that because the NGC 3 and the antisense oligo nucleotide against a polite but protein little a that those are hugely interesting yeah they're gonna probably be great therapeutic avenues for us if we need it so yeah I think there will be utility for measuring this right now before a third-party payors ever gonna pay some lab for doing that it's gonna need a little more proof than the what we have so far and everything but back to our lipid transportation system so please understand and there are just too many people out there who think every VLDL becomes an LDL it's not even close and in fact if you're not insulin resistant and you don't have a however you define a triglyceride issue which I might define as a trig above 130 or so anyway 40% of the april-b particles coming out of your liver or they're not vldls they're LDLs and the vldls that are coming out are not big because they're not carrying extra triglycerides because you don't have them they're just carrying some degree of cholesterol and a little bit of triglycerides to supply the energy you really need and that's why if you are measuring some VLDL metric big vldls occur only in triglyceride rich lipoprotein pathologies by far the most common of which is insulin resistance and clearly because that VLDL would come out and i it's probably got a tree on it it doesn't have a half-life of a few hours it's plasma residence time is much longer there is more conversion of that

[00:20:02] VLDL particle into LDL particles which would be triglyceride rich through some transformation they become the small LDLs which are even less rapidly cleared so you're a poby particle rule number your LDL particle number goes through the roof now yes part of those april-b are the remnants but I've posted enough slides on Twitter and I'm pretty sure it's in Peters package here even when you take these type 2 diabetics with severe and some resistance or insulin resistance just proved by an insulin clamp study there april-b level there particle levels are going up battles go up astronomically and the VLDL may be doubles or triples it goes from 30 to 90 whereas the VLT whole particles go from 1,000 to 3,000 yeah so that's an important distinction so a lot of people will say when your insulin resistant all of that net difference is it that we see because there's no disputing the more insulin resistance you get the more discordant you get between your LDL P and your LDL C and all things equal the

[00:21:07] LDL P is just going up and up and up as you become more insulin resistant so people will say it's all the VLDL furthermore they'll confuse a percentage increase that's relative with an absolute increase so as you point it out if you're you're referring to the garvey paper I think yeah so in that paper you might see VLDL particle number I'm making this up but it let's so someone will see the numbers and decide for themselves but it might go from 30 to 60 yeah 150 a mole per liter and you think well god that's a much bigger relative increase and it is but if anybody's read are lengthy treaty son relative versus absolute risk you you cannot evaluate a relative change without understanding its absolute change and so even though the relative change on the LDL P is smaller it's starting from such a high base that it might add 3 to 400 in animal per liter which might only be a 30 or 40 percent increase but that absolutely dominates the lion's share of the increase not the extra 30 250 an animal per liter you might get on the VLDL this is a really important point if you want to be a lipid geek it is and this is one reason why non HDL cholesterol speak come in vogue because remember non HDL cholesterol we told you you calculated by subtracting HDL cholesterol from total cholesterol but you could really add directly measured

[00:22:27] LDL cholesterol to a viola L cholesterol and that's your cholesterol is not in your HDL particles theoretically potentially after genic cholesterol and hey that's a free calculation too so they use non HDL cholesterol as a marker of remnants okay and there's no doubt some of those vo the L particles would be remnants but we'll get into this later I hope I'll make the case that a lot of those V LDL particles are not written and soon they're not going

[00:22:59] I used to always sit a patient down and the very first time we reviewed a blood test I would say look there's four things we're gonna talk about from a lipid standpoint we got to know your LP little a we have to know your LDL P I'd like to know how many of those are small because it's a proxy for some other stuff and I want to know your VLDL remnant well i can't measure that so i'm going to approximate it with v ldl-c well i don't say that anymore because

[00:23:22] I've come to realize maybe shut it's a very crude crude estimation that's almost useless I wouldn't call it useless because I use the word almost okay yeah and I'll get all my lipid colleagues real mad at me if I start saying that because they and I get into this and a lot of the papers always know Target I mean I still say to patients once your V LDL cholesterol less than 15 milligrams per deciliter impatient you have other ways of knowing whose insulin is is not if that marker is up remnant lipoproteins are part of their pathology but the exact same therapy I'm gonna give you to get rid of the real troublemaker your LDL particles gonna get rid of the remnants too so at the end of the day it's I got a normalize

[00:24:04] April be your LDL particle number and there is significant discordance howland Sneiderman has published it many times as good as non HDL cholesterol meaning better than LDL cholesterol as a metric of a Bobi there's a lot of discordance between april be your LDL particle number and non HDL cholesterol so I understand sir free calculation please and people who really are worried about it you think iris you've got to use particle numbers to make the proper clinical decisions this reminds me I need an excuse to go to Montreal so I can interview Allan if you can get him on a hood gas I'll be your first listener that is nothing comes out of his mouth that you don't want to write down and Allan's not afraid to call a spade a spade so to speak he will just tell you and that's why I love them you know I don't mind Allan telling me I'm an idiot no time you're wrong on that here's way it is it can you learn guys like that or not afraid to put you in that place Allan if you're listening to this why don't you come up with an excuse to come to New York San Diego and and if I do have an excuse to come to

[00:25:14] Montreal I will but let's get back to our limpid transportation system now so we have our theoretical forward delivering particles the april-b particles and i tell you how they transform into one another how they deliver their cholesterol by the way no VLDL are ideal or kylos delivering cholesterol to your peripheral cells they don't need it they're making all they need so let's restate that please for the courts transcription so tell me again what high-lows are doing are not doing what you walked out in the room to do some when I was explaining what kind of I'm just outed me I went to go take a week a minute ago i explicitly went over that the purpose the functional purpose of chylomicrons and VLDL is to deliver energy in a form of triglycerides thetaba sites and Maya sites and phospholipids not to deliver cholesterol to any darn cell in your body so spend your time reading on it that's what they do you could even make the case that if they're not delivering cholesterol why is cholesterol leaving in their particles and it goes back to something what Peter said these particles have to be spherical so when a VLDL or and an anthracite ism starting to lipid eight april-b forty-eight or especially the liver april-b 100 if you put cholesterol in that and we have proteins that do that microsomal triglyceride transfer and other cellular lipid transport proteins by putting cholesterol and the april-b it becomes a spherical particle so all primordial VL deals and chylomicrons are first just very cholesterol rich spherical particles they don't have the triglyceride yeah then when they're spherical particle they can really fill up with their triglycerides so the cholesterol is in there for a structural property to make them spherical particles that they can carry more triglycerides and that's why when they go well they become smaller spherical particles that are triglyceride depleted and they just bring that cholesterol back to the liver or the intestine and they do whatever they do with it so that's why cholesterol is in there they're not bringing cholesterol to my nose or your kidney or anyplace else because those cells need cholesterol no cells will make it or they'll get it by some free diffusion if they really need it or absolutely virtually any cell of it absolutely needed cholesterol because for some reason the synthesis was broken any cell could ultimately up regulate it held the L receptor but most of them don't so because they have no need for the cholesterol that's in an LDL the liver up regulates most your LDL receptors because that's involved clearance of these particles that's where your LDL receptors are heavily expressed but now you do have these particles that have certain half-life's or plasma residence times vldls even for a few hours or LDLs for at least a day in some instances more HDLs for a few days sorry they stagnant particles that never change no guess what they're living breathing particles so i used to have nice animated diagrams that is every second of every minute of every day your particles are having sex with one another they're transferring bodily fluids they exchanged from their core every lipoprotein in your has some degree in its core of triglycerides and cholesterol ester every particle from an HDL to a column I gruntled VLDL ideal and LDL and we actually have a protein it's pretty much carried on hdls it was originally called

[00:29:00] April protein or April lipoprotein D as in thought capital D and in my dirty New Jersey mind think of an HDL particle which carries most of the a PO d you men carry something between their legs that if it got erect it's sticking up and it can penetrate something else so if HCL's are carrying it's a po d and it suddenly sticks up it can penetrate it another particle b it another HDL or an April B particle and that's a phospholipid sort of tunnel let's say it's like a little tunnel that can connect to circulating lipoproteins and therefore the core lipids can exchange and this is HDL to HDL are going to be

[00:29:42] HDL to LDL HDL to HDL in which case it's called a homotypic transfer because it's two like particles exchanging their bodily fluids header or a hetero typic where a PO a particles exchange their core lipids with a po be particles what is hardly known out there is two april-b particles can exchange their lipids VLDL can exchange with its core lipids with an LDL and i'm gonna tell you that's where remnants get a lot of their cholesterol so that would be homotypic exchange of cholesterol and triglycerides between two different april-b containing particles so a lot of it is between HDLs and april-b particles in me why why would we even be given that lipid transfer protein because

[00:30:29] HCL's job is to be a great cholesterol acceptor it is very important indeed lipid ation helping cells e flux the cholesterol they don't want so when an HDL acquires that free cholesterol from a cell what does it do well HDL carries that a ket ensign i talked about it except it's called l cat because it's in a lipoprotein it's terrifies the cholesterol to cholesterol ester goes to the cord a particle the HDL becomes bigger then the HDL transfers its cholesterol ester to let's say an

[00:31:02] April B particle 95% of which are LDL particles so here's where the joke comes in so I know you're all calling the cholesterol in an HDL that's good cholesterol but what do you call that cholesterol molecule ii an HDL transfers it to an LDL does it instantly become bad it's bad now if I looked at it it's still the same exact cholesterol molecule so what if you want to use those darn adjectives with a patient I guess what's going to determine what's good or bad cholesterol is what is that lipoprotein gonna do with its cholesterol molecule if it's an HDL and it's an LDL and it's bringing it back to the liver already intestine or well that's not bad I don't think cuz those organs know how to get rid of cholesterol so I don't know maybe that's a good cholesterol pathway but I don't think you can apply that to the cholesterol molecule itself but follow me here what if that HDL pulled cholesterol out of your cell cuz was over producing too much and he gave it to an LDL and said buddy take off the livers got that LDL receptor it's gonna clear you and an LDL particle raced back to the liver and for some reason there was no LDL receptors that are weren't enough of them there where's that LDL going he might wind his way back into circulation he will because he's not gonna be clear and all of a sudden your good cholesterol is in the macrophage in your arterial wall so spare me the nonce and stop using its observed term has no meeting you're miss educating patients if you tell them it's good cholesterol because they use that because they're measuring HDL cholesterol and a blood is a marker that I'm in good shape or not and trust me virtually all of the early trials that showed low HDL cholesterol was bad news were never ever adjusted for April B your LDL particle counts because I'm gonna tell you right now and that includes Framingham which I alluded to earlier yeah cuz a lot of people like to hang their hat on the fact that

[00:33:04] Framingham because most people forget what Framingham is they throw the term around so let me just spend one minute explaining this Framingham started out as a five geography a five city or five region observational study purely observational of which Framingham was one and I used to know them all it was awful cramming him is only Framingham

[00:33:24] Massachusetts but but the original cohort of that study from NIH was Framingham Puerto Rico San Francisco halle-loo Framingham evolved from that's right then the there was a city group here and and that's where they gathered the information that's where they made the observation so there was a retro a purely retrospective assessment of five cities and I'm blanking on the but I know I think one was Puerto Rico front row Stanford might have been one but anyway the point but the prospective work was then concentrated in Framingham

[00:33:54] Massachusetts but the point is a lot of people like to point out that LDL is irrelevant because the LDL cholesterol which by the way was calculated not measured directly so you've introduced a very not in the first one to use correct it turned out to be less predictive than the ratio not the ratio I'm sorry the absolute level of HDL see and triglyceride and why people like to stop at that and say well look that means LDL doesn't matter what they don't realize is those are two enormous proxies for a poby that's all they are and you virtually all of your insulin resistant patients for getting ascribe disease to take OB its LDL particle mediated because everybody who's not on a drug or a serious diet who had a triglyceride HDL cholesterol axis abnormality has astronomically poby so if you go back for all this cited forever epidemiologic data then low HDL cholesterol is such an important risk factor do me a favor pal adjusted for

[00:34:52] April B or LDL P which was never done and can't be done in those studies now it would disappear as an independent risk factor a low HDL cholesterol well that's certainly the hypothesis I mean I guess the question is does Mesa still have enough blood kicking around to measure that or Framingham Offspring it does Mesa has certainly shown in the discordant people where there's the discordant Swit april-b an LDL cholesterol or NP who have low HDL cholesterol april-b LDL particle is your most important metric so Mesa in Mesa when weird saying this by the way folks we're not talking Mesa

[00:35:28] Arizona we're talking about the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis which is abbreviated Mesa so we'll often you'll often hear people refer to Mesa and Framingham what they're referring to our enormous studies of atherosclerosis that still have bio banks that are available to do these retrospective analyses on prospective lis collected samples yeah Mase is much more contemporary multi-ethnic so it's yeah because of another criticism of

[00:35:55] Framingham is you've taught me a lot about you know middle-class white people and you know the Northeast but what have you told me about you know african-american Hispanic etc all information is always good there's always weaknesses with all information or shortcomings or so but you know we built step wise on it so before you declare make any statements on based on an HDL metric please make sure you have an LDL particle april-b metric in front of you also and pretty much base what you're going to advise the patient on risk and assessment based on so one of the most amazing papers you've ever sent me and this was actually kind of recent I feel like this was a year ago maybe a year and a half ago was a case study of a woman who had a an HDL cholesterol of about a hundred and thirty to a hundred and forty milligrams per deciliter so for the listener you just never see levels of HDL like that unless you work in the lipid community or you're a lipid ologists which means I don't see them because I'm not a lipid ologist I just pretend to be one but you know the average person the average female might walk around with an HDL cholesterol of 60 milligrams per deciliter so this woman is showing up at two and a half times normal and interestingly I don't even know you remember this case study

[00:37:09] Tom but if not I think I remember enough for the details she had very accelerated atherosclerosis she did not by the way to my recollection have particularly elevated LDL cholesterol her LDL cholesterol was probably about a hundred and ten milligrams per deciliter slightly below her HDL cholesterol and of course the question was why did this woman have elevated atherosclerosis when she had normal amounts of quote unquote the bad cholesterol and two and a half to three times normal good cholesterol do you remember this case not per se but and this is a rare genetic thing where this cholesterol trafficking pattern is disrupted in certain ways something's wrong with that pathway because that HDL should be getting rid of its cholesterol and should be bringing ball back to some place so this person would have to have incredibly massive HDL particles that are carrying way more cholesterol particles per HDL particle than it should be and it turns out and they're not being cleared as much as issue so this is going to turn out to be cholesterol rich HDL particles that don't have a protein it's very integral with clearing age hills and say bowie again so if you don't have a bowie on your HDL s they might become very cholesterol richer HDL cholesterol through the roof those are incredibly dysfunctional HDLs and part of their dysfunction is they're probably carrying the wrong type of phospholipids and are not carrying the type of protective proteins that an HDL should be carrying because when you have a surface area it's that's big the proteins that should be binding to it no longer binds because it's not they're looking for the molecules they're supposed to covalently bind to and they can't find it or so so that's the circumstance of a very dysfunction and and I remember the context which was a really good friend of mine from med school sent me some a friend of a friend's blood and the numbers were like that and I remember reaching out to you saying this is odd

[00:39:11] Tom what do you make of this you sent me the case study there's really nothing to do to treat these people except lower a PO B right you just have to chase it's sort of like what do we do for LP little a nowadays you chase every other identifiable cardiovascular risk factor interesting no nobody would do it to her but there is a product that induces a receptor in the liver that pulls cholesterol out of HDL particles it's a was I call pro buccal I don't know if it's even still available by prescription it induces the scavenger reset there drastically lowers HDL but it's a powerful antioxidant and there were some early art area graphic studies that suggested this is good arteries at least on an arterial imaging looked better so say saw our Milan and sorry just to be clear the reason why I mean again there's a 217 ways to be fooled by an angiogram it's about his crude a way to assess this process anything that said if you believe that this is improving you believe it's basically increasing the throughput of

[00:40:10] HDL to deal if today yeah so the theory would be AHA there's this is the case where hey remember I espouse the theory before that if rate shells are really delivering cholesterol back to the liver should an HDL cholesterol be going down well here's a drug that depletes HDL cholesterol and at least Artaria graphically people look better we now have identified a gene that regulates the functioning of the scavenger receptor so if you have an inactivity of that scavenger receptor you have very big HDL particles high HDL cholesterol and coronary this is this a nice transition so let's summarize that this is again overly simplistic this is a zeroth-order analysis so we're just gonna put our fourth-grade hats on which is acceptable for limited periods of time if you have low hdl-c you cannot infer if it's low because you are failing to quote unquote pick up cholesterol or because you're delivering it quickly conversely or similarly I should say if you have high HDL C it is not clear if it is high because you pick up a lot which in theory would be quote unquote good or because you're deficient at dropping it off which would be quote unquote bad and therein lies perhaps one of the most interesting or certainly top-five interesting drug stories which are these C type inhibitors again I'm just gonna do a because I just want to finish this whole so I told you HDL has this bode but a PO D is better known as cholesterol ester transfer protein it really ought to be called cholesterol ester triglyceride transfer protein C

[00:41:52] ETP so we're going to talk about a C teppan hit or in a moment because it's gonna stop that process the lipoproteins can't exchange the particles anymore now wait a minute if you're following me so far an HDL which is pulling cholesterol out of cells it's really good at that is then transferring a lot of that cholesterol to LDLs here's something that's gonna shock you in an average person anywhere from thirty to sixty percent of the cholesterol in that LDL particle arrived via an HDL particle so if that LDL particle will accept that cholesterol from an HDL and race it back to the liver thank you LDL it's like the HDL was a quarterback it passed it to the tight end who ran it across the goal line who gets the credit the quarterback or the tight end or both of them so in the lipid transportation system they work harmoniously together if everything works including the lipid transfer proteins we're not going to talk about it today but God also gave us lipid inhibitory transfer proteins Apryl lipoprotein FA PO c1 so everything is tightly regulated in our homeostatic system but we'll leave that from you this is the master's class on lipid that will be the whatever whatever falls apart master so it's always more complicated so now just to finish up the definitions of our reverse cholesterol transport old days HDL back to the liver nowadays it's HDL it's cholesterol from wherever if things go right it could bring it back to either the liver or the small intestine or an adrenal gland or an ovary or at Estes so that's gonna be called direct because the HDL is doing it and we're saying he's the primary factor here because he does pull cholesterol out of the cells but we now also know that HDL can give its cholesterol to an LDL to a VLDL to a chylomicron to an IDL since most of them are LDLs it's giving most of it to an

[00:44:02] LDL and they can bring that cholesterol they're gonna be clear that the liver if you have the proper number of LDL receptors Hey so if an HDL give its cholesterol to an April B particle it brings it back to the liver that is called indirect reverse cholesterol transport we're still debating can an LDL bring it back to the small intestine also for a while that was yes then it was probably not now it's back to it probably yes again but if an LDL brings it back to the liver for sure any intestine then that's indirect cholesterol reverse cholesterol transport if you still need the reverse adjective put in there or so but part of that pathway is the it's not deliver it's the intestine the trans intestinal cholesterol Li flux so if you want to talk about tall reverse cholesterol transport I would rather just talk about lipid transport it's every particle is part of the system so but if you want to stick with reverse cholesterol transport total RCT is the sum of indirect plus direct and both direct and indirect involve the liver and the intestine and a serum HDL cholesterol tells you not about that process yeah we may or may not have time to get into this but yesterday over dinner we talked about the futility or the challenges maybe it's a better way of saying it to be a little more optimistic but the challenge is in coming up with HDL functional assays because that's you know once you get deep enough into this topic as we're getting now you very quickly start to realize that to measure HDL cholesterol or even HDL particle number is so crude in terms of providing an insight into its functional status that you know the best we can do today is we measure HDL cholesterol HDL particle number and HDL particles size and we try to triangulate just as we used to when we could look at

[00:46:03] LP little a mass and LP little a cholesterol we could sort of triangulate if we were in the zone but that's still not the answer I mean that just doesn't tell us how well these things function we just need more specific biomarkers nowadays to take it to the next level and the types of therapies that are coming along and I I think that's even import knowledge to know when you're going to prescribe a specific nutritional therapy also that all these things come into play you know so very important to understand stuff but I hope you can see how this world has change and we ought to stop using even the term reverse cholesterol transport it's idiotic it's so immensely complex you don't know what you're talking about and you have no biomarker that you can evaluate that on the given patient and the functionality these particles like I do they really participate in these pathways or not are determined in large part by their phospholipid content in the proteins that are on these surfaces apart from just the a po d we talked about and with HD OS just briefly I think there is a probably hundreds of

[00:47:06] HDL subpopulations HDL scarying immense number of proteins way more than LDLs or VLDL zipper can but they all can carry one or two proteins they can't carry 200 proteins that have been identified it's coming from HDLs so it's probably the protein signature of an HDL or even the phospholipid make up the lipid dome of an HDL we have just like I you know I love fire departments fire departments have hulking ladder trucks they have pumper trucks they have hazmat trucks they got a variety of rescue vehicles nowadays they got ambulances rescue trucks and they don't all show up at every fire the dispatch sends the trucks that are needed to specific types of fires well your HDL subpopulations show up where they're needed and they know where they're needed because the cells that need them recognize the proteins or the phospholipids that are on their surface and pull them in so I don't know when it's gonna come down to lipid ohmic or proteomic analysis of these particles

[00:48:07] I think that maybe will take us to the next level wouldn't hold your breath on anytime soon alright so let's go back to this idea of because I want to start talking a little bit about some drugs but rather than start chronologically which I want to do after we get to the to this question but just because while we're on

[00:48:25] HDL there are really two drugs that have been discussed as ways to quote-unquote raise HDL one being niacin which we'll come to later on but the other being these CTEPH inhibitors which are relatively recent it was 2006 when the first CTEPH trial or at least when the first data became available and they weren't promising so first of all why would inhibition of see tip been thought to be an optimal strategy and two why do you think it didn't turn out that way because we don't know what who do each tiel's in especially using metrics to analyze them and the story starts a lot longer than that in Italy that little section up on northeastern Italy where a PO a one

[00:49:10] Milano was discovered and these were people who had HDL cholesterol levels of 5 and 10 and yet how longevity and how could that possibly because Framingham has taught us low HDL cholesterol you're out of here and yet here's where people will learn jeopardy and it turns out they had a very functional a poll a wand that really did the flux system very quickly or had other properties that didn't matter how much cholesterol was in the HDL the HDL was unbelievably fun you know anything about there a PO B's I think even if they have high a poppy they don't get I don't know they're high-functioning a PO age so I got a papal B matters because some of them probably would and you know although they're on that Mediterranean died and so so maybe they don't have that their junk parts so I can't answer that so that led Pharma to I let's just invent eight or synthesize a PO a one or a truncated a PO a one and commercialize that will at least for people how to q

[00:50:14] Carney syndromes will infuse that into Matilda lipid ate their plaque and home-free every single trial failed including a very recent trial so there's one where they got a especially protective type of HDL but they couldn't reproduce it whatever it is so that failed so but you know there were people in the past that Peter talked about he gave a case where a woman had very high

[00:50:37] HDL cholesterol but had coronary atherosclerosis but there is a bunch of people out there with very high HDL cholesterol who don't have car I'm gonna theorize in retrospect maybe a Poe he's got something to do with that but I don't know that cuz that would enhance their clearing but what is one of the genetic conditions that would give you high HDL cholesterol

[00:50:57] I remember I just taught you what April D is CT t PC tip it takes the cholesterol out of your HDL and gives it to an April B particle so theoretically that would lower your HDL cholesterol but if I inhibited C tip your HDL would get to keep all its cholesterol what would go through the roof your HDL cholesterol and a genetic model was at least some people with certain CET P variants had very high HDL cholesterol and they didn't seem to get much heart disease although what I'm confused by

[00:51:26] Tom is that in 2000 I want to say 11 ish didn't a Mendelian randomization look at this and conclude and this was long after these drugs were in the pipeline but didn't the mr suggests that those people were not better off nature paper and will polish ETP any investigative drugs long before the Mendelian randomization absolutely yeah yeah so they didn't have that data that

[00:51:53] Mendelian randomization shows not necessarily so that with high HDL cholesterol you're protected whereas nowadays most of the data would show it's not yeah yeah my recollection is that the mr came out in 2010 2011 and it basically validated what had at the time been seen in two trials which was Wow inhibit see tap things don't get better well yes so I think Mendelian randomization had they had that that at first they would have never seen drugs and which is why they did chase pcsk9 inhibitors cuz the genetic model told miss can't fail unless there's a downside to the drug that's what I don't know about and that's always a problem with a drug that's gonna change a gene it may do good to a marker and do bad to some other marker you're not smart enough to know about I can't wait so we're gonna talk about GCSE paper so let's inhibit CD TPD HCL's get to keep all their cholesterol HDL cholesterol goes through the roof that's good epidemiologically right there on first principles it doesn't even make sense in light of what you just told us no but they didn't know that then either remember this whole HDL story has evolved to wait so that so that's interesting I don't think I understood that and so I should give them more credit are you saying that it absolutely was not known no there was theories on it guys like

[00:53:07] Dan Raider was always talking about it but you don't know how much you're interrupting the system with that and everything no you know they're so heavenly focused on basic lipid biomarkers like LDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol it's the same denies and story how could it not work it raises HDL cholesterol turns out nice and doesn't work if you want to take legitimate trials to show it works and is there a price for using nice and even if you don't believe the legitimate trials so that's another story which will probably get it will definitely get in the back this is one area where your peers will argue with you some mom many will not other than all rights I've tried everything else nothing else's work let me look I'm a guy who took a nice in myself for a bunch of years so before I knew what I knew now and it didn't unfortunately work for me anyway so this CET P it's gonna raise HDL cholesterol but how much it raises it really depends on the potency of the CET

[00:54:04] P inhibitor and there are different degrees of CET P inhibition we have weak inhibitors and we have super-strong inhibitors the first one that came out Pfizer had developed the drug that inhibited and thought it was going to be a multi-billion dollar drug because it lower raise HDL cholesterol Pfizer and many other companies already proved lowering april-b LDL cholesterol works really works well imagine if we can take those people with residual risk because their age low HDL cholesterol is still low and we could raise their HDL cholesterol that niacin angiographic trial would really support doing that okay so they said let's inhibit CET P and raise HDL cholesterol so Pfizer went to market many people were buying at stock in its infancy thought they'd make a zillion dollars I remember where I was standing the data moment those results were announced and it's interesting because I was not at all a lipid guy but at the time I was working at McKinsey

[00:55:02] O's in San Francisco it was on a September day a beautiful September day in San Francisco 2006 and I took it as a fait accompli that this would work and Pfizer stock was going to skyrocket look we all knew the companyís Parian who developed that and we knew their guys we'd heard them lecture many times many the top everybody was banking on that voices I mean you never know in a clinical trial but it looked like a slider really did and I remember whenever I found out I forget to weather that tape it was late at night and I think the internet was even and I saw a little thing it was like 11:30 at night

[00:55:41] I don't even know why I saw it that Pfizer terminates tour cetra patrasche yeah well in fairness you were actually seeing it in real time I saw it the next morning so okay there is no Twitter then I could call up every lipid I'll just I know I emailed a few close buddies look at what I just saw and so they stopped the trial not because it was harming people and as it turns out it looks like that drug / had some other properties that screwed up certain electrolytes and other hormonal levels that okay no one there so we raising HDL cholesterol if it's going to bring a downside to the table goodbye so far I lost a lot of money in there but that didn't stop research on the drug yeah as they develop these other toxicities that maybe were specifically related to that CC Thep inhibitor let's develop better see tips inhibitors and go with them so they did they came up with a very weak one called dal cetra peb who made that it wasn't

[00:56:44] Merck there's someone in between I keep forgetting yeah anyway okay so I was certainly if it consulting with them back to and then two other companies again it was Merck and Lilly had super potent CTP inhibitors but they did all the tests and it didn't have this other toxicity with electrolytes and renin-angiotensin levels and things like that so maybe this would work and of course the stronger your C type inhibition the more you would raise HDL cholesterol so now set your peb raised it 20 to 30 percent whereas the stronger ones raised it eighty a hundred percent H no cholesterol so to douse a trip babe they enrolled the Q Kearney syndrome a humongous population and we're doing a randomized trial and after a few years they didn't see any downside telling anybody or there was no sabari already knowing those are very expensive trials so to be encounter said to shoot a trial forget about it so yeah I think that if I think that those trials combined with the EMR have put an end to this this approach to lipid modulation they did and the two other companies though said well that's a weak tzitzit inhibitor we're potent so we're going to continue our trials are well on their way to so with an asset repair boniva cetera Pibb the remaining things they did um and sooner or later lily just bailed on their trial more futility they weren't gonna take it out but Merck continued their trial so Lily what a potent Eva set your Pibb was seeing not only drastic raisings in HDL cholesterol but LDL cholesterol but you know pcsk9 inhibitors are starting to appear but in nobody's gonna ever prescribe this drug based on what it does to LDL cholesterol and we're not so convinced that raising

[00:58:44] HDL cholesterol matters anymore so they banned in the early this thing it was some futility so they bailed on their trial to people think they should have some people wish they would have continued that trial but Merck did continue and Merck did hit its end point that it did reduce coronary events it did drastically raise HDL cholesterol but it dramatically lowered a poby also so the dairy came to be what a see tip inhibitor does to the metric HDL cholesterol has nothing to do with anything but if it can lower April B it works but and may the trial was it worked but they're not gonna bring it to market because it in stays in a human body for years and I just for afraid of that they have no idea what might show up especially when there's no upside yeah we got other things that will give you that type of April be lowering that seemed to be safe and been around so

[00:59:36] Merck is not going to commercialize that product even though it has a successful trial so if you want to definitively say c-type inhibition doesn't reduce a source um well it did but at what price and and what benefit and we just can do it with it still seems to crude is the point like it's not entirely clear why one of those drugs is working and why one is not because the inhibition of see tip is it's interrupting a transfer but it doesn't actually tell you what happens after the transfer and that becomes doesn't tell you even know some of the primitive HDL function studies they did not only didn't look like they were screwing up the HDL but there's immense numbers of HDL function you don't know what you're doing and if that protein is going to stay in your body forever what other consequences might there be long term screwing up of other biological systems or Sun so it couldn't risk that yeah well kudos to Merck cuz I don't I think the FDA would have approved it don't you not with the tissue that fear and even if they thought they could get it by their lawyers probably told them well mercury you know it's funny amount of people don't remember what happened at

[01:00:51] Merck with Vioxx sure the failure of the black box warning and I actually I got to tell you that that to me is one example of an overreaction to late versus an appropriate reaction sooner so I you know not that I'm a farmer guy and know much about Pharma but Vioxx was an amazing drug I mean ten times better than celebrex ever was for the listener who's wondering what we're talking about celebrex and Vioxx were the first two versions of these things called selective cox-2 inhibitors which were potent and much more selective anti-inflammatory drugs so for people with you know orthopedic issues joint pain things like that but they don't have some of the drawbacks you have with using just non selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase where such as Advil or

[01:01:31] Aleve or things like that anyway to make a long story short it was about 2001 when they saw a small subset of patients and turned out those I think that we're hypertensive we're having higher risk of MI taking Vioxx drug got immediately act I think it was the best anti-inflammatory Cox inhibitor ever out there and in reality I think what emerged after the fact was hey the guys at Merck sort of knew this earlier on there there was data that suggested there was something going on and instead they should have partitioned it and said hey maybe there's a subset of patients in whom we don't let this drug be taken because I think a lot of patients got deprived of an amazing drug on the basis of a few so anyway my guess is mercs highly sensitive to sure today's medical legal world that stuff comes back to yeah I want those companies one person goes south and it's a zillion dollar lawsuit so it is very very tough and look goes back to my young days where we couldn't do anything for MI but suppress ventricular arrhythmias with any number of great those things were the most pcs disappeared yeah you know and so today yeah you gotta be careful you can find all of this information and more at
