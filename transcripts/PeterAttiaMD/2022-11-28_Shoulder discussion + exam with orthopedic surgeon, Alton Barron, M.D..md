## AI Summary

Here's my detailed analysis of the episode:

**1. Executive Summary**:
This episode features Dr. Alton Barron discussing shoulder anatomy, pathology, and treatments. The conversation covers detailed anatomical explanations, common injuries, surgical procedures, and treatment approaches. Dr. Barron provides extensive insights into rotator cuff injuries, labral tears, AC joint separations, and shoulder replacements, while emphasizing the importance of clinical examination over purely radiological findings.

**2. Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- The shoulder joint is a balance between mobility and stability, unlike the hip joint which has more inherent stability [00:01:35]
- Four muscles make up the rotator cuff: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor [01:05:37]
- The labrum functions like a suction cup, providing stability to the shoulder joint [00:12:25]
- Asymptomatic rotator cuff tears are present in approximately 50% of people over 60 [00:33:01]
- Type 1, 2, and 3 AC joint separations have different treatment approaches based on displacement [01:54:31]

**3. Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- Early intervention for shoulder injuries in athletes to prevent progression [01:45:14]
- Consider conservative treatment before surgery when appropriate [01:25:55]
- Regular physical therapy for maintaining shoulder mobility [01:03:04]

Context-specific recommendations:
- Overhead athletes need special consideration for shoulder injuries [01:38:58]
- Different approaches needed for traumatic vs. degenerative tears [00:38:21]

**4. Exercise & Movement**:
- Careful consideration needed for overhead lifting activities [01:45:14]
- Swimming is generally safe after shoulder replacement [02:18:21]
- Avoid heavy bench press after shoulder replacement [02:17:45]

**5. Notable Quotes**:
"The single most important thing that you will learn is when to operate and when not to operate" [01:51:50]

**6. Follow-up Questions**:
1. What is the role of genetics in shoulder joint stability?
2. How do different sports affect long-term shoulder health?
3. What are the latest developments in biological treatments for shoulder injuries?

## Transcript

[00:00:00] whatever way you think makes the most sense Alton let's assume the audience doesn't know the names of any of the bones let alone what they look like doesn't know the vasculature the musculature the innervation what would be a reasonable way and and we I know you and I spoke we were going to do this with models in the end you thought you could probably do an easier job sketching for folks so maybe let's have you okay explain SL sketch that be great and we're we're prepared for that we have some diagrams in it so

[00:00:29] I'm going to take it off the visual and and draw some quick pictures and this is what I do frankly for all my patients um I don't like the models because well they're just they're just models so I'm not saying I'm a great artist but if we just look at just the glenoid that's the socket that's the golf tea if you will and then you add a humeral head to it and that is the humeral head this portion to the right of the dotted line is is what's covered by cartilage so that's the nice smooth Teflon cartilage and this space and so just to orient folks what you're looking at is head on to a person if you're looking straight at them this is the right humoral head yeah and that little space we're going to talk about the glenoid fossa is that flat end of part of the scapula which is a real complex looking triangular bone with a big Ridge on it and it the collar bone attaches to it and all that crazy stuff but the the the the the high LEL

[00:01:35] Point here is in the hip you have the acetabulum which creates a true socket for a big ball and um here the the heavy lifting really is done by soft tissue not bones right you've got a joint that's completely contained like that in the hip joint versus a shallow one that just can slip and slide all over the place so you you've uh pointed out it's a great it's the best way to describe the shoulder joint being a delicate balance of of mobility and stability and it's very easy to get out of whack because it is biomechanically so complicated so I'm going to add a few more things here but this space that we see between here is not a space it's the it's the space radiographically when you're looking that's occupied by the cartilage so you have a thick nice layer of cartilage on both sides I've left a little Gap just to be able to see it but it's the articular cartilage effectively there so there's a layer of nice thick cartilage there that and when we have arthritis of course that gets worn down chipped away and begins to um to fissure and and then actually develop full thickness loss to the point where then at some point it's not really functioning very well and it's very painful so if we have this basic bony cartilage structure here it's just it would just fall off if if it were just left there let's say you had a a um well if you had no ligaments no uh what we're going to call the laum which is some additional struct stabilizing structures or if we had um if we have the muscle tendon units that supply that that support it so I'm going to draw and a few more of that of those and while you're doing that we'll just remind people that ligaments and tendons are not the same uh tendons are the connective tissue that connects muscle to Bone ligaments are connective tissue that connect bone to bone um is laam Con considered a a ligament or is it kind of considered its own entity it's kind of its own entity yeah it's a it's a it's it has a a transition zone between fibrous tissue to oous bony tissue so it's a fiber oous structure and I liken it to um to calamari that's the best uh and and it's rubbery just like that and it and that's the best analogy that people seem to get so i' I've drawn on two of the four rotator cuff muscles here this is the one up above and this is the one in front and this is the big muscle that allows us to reach behind our back and pull our hand away away from our back and this is also the one that helps us along with the pectoralis in front to pull things together like doing flies and so forth the superspinatus is the primary muscle that initiates elevation of the shoulder so it's very very important it also so what we see here is this Zone in from here and about through here is where the muscle transitions into tendon yeah and then it becomes pure tendon and it just so happens that this tendon the superspinatus tendon which is so commonly torn is actually um there's some physiologic downsides to its location where it can be rung out it doesn't have a great blood supply the key is it gets let me put here where those two arrows are is essentially where the tendon tears most of the time and those two and that is the the part that's attaches to the Bone it gets blood supply from that bone it gets blood supply it gets nutrients it gets growth factors so our goal and this is jumping ahead a little bit our goal is to get that reattached to that bone so it can get all of those growth factors and that new healing back and it absolutely can heal back but there are certain limit ations to that so so let's there's two other muscles right so we've got the supinatus and the subscapularis there there's two other muscles that make up the rotator cuff I think everyone's heard of the rotator cuff yes and yet it's probably not obvious to people that it's it's really four muscles that are doing this what are the other two so the other two are the infraspinatus and the teres minor and if you you can kind of superimpose them over the subscapularis but they're on the back side of the joint and very important they are the external rotators it's they give us our backhand in tennis they give us a a lot of stability for the shoulder itself and especially whether you're playing golf or lifting weights they're a dynamic stabilizer they're very important doing bench press push-ups all sorts of activities like that archery archery yes very important um so so when a person quote unquote tears their rotator cuff that can be a very heterogeneous diagnosis I mean technically that diagnosis would apply to a tear in any of those four muscles which could be in the muscle could be at the junction between the muscle and the tendon and could it also be just a complete separation of the tendon from the oio structure of the bone yes so um and that's that's critical to identify what that is and you can somewhat predict it based on the age of the person and their physiology um and the mechanism of of of the trauma so we have and we do broadly C classify these into degenerative tears and traumatic tears so younger people it's rare to see a young person really under the age of 40 to uh to tear their rotator cuff it's pretty proportionately rare but it happens and it happens traumatically one of the um I had a a young fellow who worked as a merchant Marine years ago and he was doing something with the anchor and the massive chain and his glove got caught in that and it basically it it almost ripped his arm off right but he was he was okay except that he had torn traumatically as a as a young 20 I think he was 26 or so it ripped off three of his four muscles and it just you know they had to be repaired but he was okay but it it's it's that rare dramatic uh circumstance that leads to traumatic tears and young people and someone that young where's the weak link does it tear at the muscle itself or does it tear more at the tendon that's a great question uh that's a great question because the younger you are the stronger that linkage of the tendon to the Bone so you often pull off some bone oh my God and so um in the case of you know a skiers thumb just a common injury in the hand from skiers the younger you are the more likely it is to pull off with a piece of bone and and that's actually great because bone heals to

[00:09:03] Bone itself much better than tendon to Bone if you can get away with that there are fractures that occur that involve this area there's and I'll draw a picture here draw a squiggly line to represent a fracture and I'll show it coming off uh and that's a that's a common fracture so right here what I've drawn is this chunk of bone coming off right here that's the greater tuberosity it's a prominence of the bone that the two the biggest portion of the rotator cuff attaches the supinatus and the infraspinatus that you referenced that pulls off and so I would rather have that than a big I would rather pull that off and have a good quality repair of that than have my the two two tendons rep that and tell me the type of athlete or person that presents with the the fracture that you've depicted yeah so these are generally that isolated greater tuberosity is generally a fractured dislocation so you have a pretty violent injury you're rock climbing you fall off you maybe you hit it directly your arm is wrenched back or you have let's say a football player who who has a traumatic dislocation they're hidden just the right way mechanically and it shears that off and then um so it's it's often most often associated with the dislocation as well the dislocation goes back but the but the two dislocation meaning a sublation of the shoulder yeah yeah and and let's explain to folks what that is how that happens I I didn't realize that we could use the word dislocation and sublation interchangeably well technically we don't technically a subluxation is an incomplete dislocation it's the shoulder coming out uhuh it pops back in easily got it so dislocation is usually it comes out and it needs to be put back in most often unless it's recurrent the more dislocations one has uh or subluxations the more stretchy and compliant the tissues become sort of like mine yes and so then it can kind of slip and slide back in and out uh with with regularity let me draw a different picture yeah what I've done here is taken the the humeral head away so we're just looking at the socket and we're looking at it on F okay so if you're looking at me you took my humorous away and now you are looking directly at the socket of this gleno humeral yes faucet yep perfect so yes and so this the central circle the front of the person is to the front that's anterior if we speak about that and posterior is to the back yes Superior is up above inferior is down below so the classic um oh and so importantly around the outside that second circle is the the outline of the labram so from here to here is the laum and that's a rubbery calamari like structure I love that I love that explanation I mean it it it's sort of you get some bad calari that's really chewy that's kind of what I haven't chewed on labor myself but it's what it

[00:12:25] I imagine it would be yeah behaving and it's very strong it's very strong and what it does it has an amazing you were talking about the evolution when we became bipeds it's super cool because it effectively developed as a way to decrease the depth of the socket not by very much but it truly works like a suction cup y if you take a nonarthritic cadaver specimen and dissect away all of the muscle all the ligaments and you stick it on the humeral head on the laum it'll sit there it's amazing yeah it's crazy it's fascinating but just like a thermometer on a window if you lift get your fingerna and lift it up but break it seal it falls away well that's what happens here so we get a lot of static stability in our shoulder from this this

[00:13:21] Superior inferior anterior and posterior labor and just to be clear Alton in a non-pathologic state when you have that you know that young person who has yet to be you know experiencing any trauma of the shoulder um is that a is that a contained space of fluid that is between those two cartilagenous surfaces of the glenoid fossa the humeral head fully contained because usually to have a suction you want there has to be a fluid that's sort of contains it or air that's incompressible which is technically fluid but I assume there is an aquous fluid that's normally in there absolutely yeah you have a nice viscous joint fluid in all of our joints like that that's a great question and yes you couldn't have that suction as soon as you poke a hole in that you lose that that so when a person has a subluxation um it doesn't necessarily uh tear the laum does it correct and that's another huge point that will it factors into our treatment recommendations and mechanisms of injury if you are a young woman playing soccer generally young young women have looser joints women in general have looser joints which is part of phys or difference in physiology but and actually because of the weird nature of the shoulders there are men as well who have super loose shoulders at Baseline born that way but in general if you think of someone who whether male or female who has super loose joints then they can sublux out in and out without tearing anything they just ride up over that because it's just Loosey Goosey so the tighter the shoulder is the more you have have to lose what happens to the fluid when they sublux nothing because they have just a more stay okay aive it's the ligaments the ligaments are stretchy and they and they're bigger it's more like a balloon that you've keep blowing up repeatedly so but if you have someone who has basically a pretty stable joint not Loosey Goosey and then they sublux the only way you can do that is either tearing the ligaments but usually you also tear the labram and what I mean by tearing the laum is you separate the laum the inner

[00:15:32] Arc from its hard bony cartilagenous perfectly fused attachment very strong it takes a massive Force to to dislocate the shoulder it actually does or perfect mechanics and so if you if you have the classic um you're reaching up to get a a rebound and someone grabs your arm um and worked it backwards that's a leverage an unnatural leverage that the makes the head tend to go out this direction anteriorly inferiorly like this so the head is going to go down this way yes yeah it just it just leverages it out and that's also a vulnerability based on where the muscles attach right yes yes very much so and we'll get to that as this the dynamic stabilizers but man this this laborum is tough but it tears off this is the classic location where you tear the laum there okay and it takes either a small tear that then is repetitively increased in size just from aggressive but repetitive use or it takes a one-time significant dislocation the attachments of the four rotator cuffs are basically behind above like it's it's basically like you got a big one there kind of at 9:00 right that's a great question you ask perfect questions that

[00:17:03] I forget to cover so these are kind of the cross-sections of the muscles that are just outside so these Encompass and in in and enshroud the the joint and this is the cross-sectional muscle bellies and this is where they and then as they as you come further out toward the head which is out here they taper down and form the tendons yeah yeah and that's so important because no shoulder can be stable alone just by these static stabilizer the labrum and the ligaments and the ligaments kind of lie in between the labram and the rotator cuff in here so the when you're referring to a

[00:17:45] SLAP tear you know obviously slap stands for Superior labal anterior posterior yes exactly and that is up here that is the super and that's a an odd injury that we um um the first person that really taught this well to us was a fell named Steve Snyder in in Norland California and he really kind of categorized these and started identifying these as really actually clinically relevant entities not for everybody but certainly for younger very athletic people uh overhead athletes weightlifters people doing

[00:18:21] CrossFit people doing um all manner of um AG more aggressive uh Sports and and so unlike an if you have a tear here and you're active you're going to keep red dislocating at least subluxating that was me correct I was kind of all the way around but big big anterior uh inferior right so I don't know what your first injury was I mean maybe so we we've talked about this I believe it was a subluxation in boxing when I was probably 17 um it's so there's two injuries I remember having in high school I can't remember which one was first you might have a sense one was doing absurdly heavy military press I think that was the second one truthfully I think the first subluxation was boxing yeah and just bad timing pun Hard Punch thrown guy gets out of the way probably smacked my arm on the way and out it came and I believe that would have been followed up 6 months later I'm doing very heavy weight for me overhead and I just remember boom it just popped out and down yeah and then from that point on it was a vicious cycle of

[00:19:35] NeverEnding sux with each couple of years having a really bad one another really bad one I had was in a open water swim race I was you know we're swimming Freestyle right so I'm in the reach phase with right arm in front and the swimmer in front of me kicked down on that arm which is not I mean that's a bit of force but not absurd just the down kick of that arm took me out yeah um so it's so funny I mean you are describing so many great I'm sorry you had suffered from them all but but so many great and differing types of mechanisms that happen I agree with you that probably was the boxing I've seen a lot of those The Recoil and especially if you don't hit something your your body is anticipating and it's tightened up and it is ready for contact and it doesn't have the contact it's no different than you know you there's an extra step in front of you that you don't know about and you step and you go whoa and then you feel like it shutters your whole body it's the same concept your body unconsciously knows what it it needs to do and so you probably did have a postor sulex I mean I will say and you know this and this was why it was so important for you is you had a tear going all the way from posture all the way around to there so you had about a 20 you know 40° tear and that's you don't get that from one injury it's almost impossible um so I basically became looser and looser over time and then it just now had too much laxity it could basically move in any direction exactly and you were you were compensating well for most of the time because you're you're very fit you're doing all the right upper body specifically shoulder strengthening exercises so you are using your Dynamic stabilizers to compensate for the loss of the stat St stability and that's a critical critical problem and it fits too with your weightlifting so yeah you had you had a tear you were weightlifting you were fine but what happens is if you're going kind of maxing out and you're doing it repetitively the the dynamic stabilizers fatigue and I see this the one of the most common scenarios is the young um more often female than male but both swimmers right so they're competing and they have a little bit of they need the stability especially if they're doing uh fly and and and backstroke they really need that and they acquire all this laxity in their shoulder and they're so strong dynamically that they're they're fine and it gives them that extra pull that extra inch or two but when they fatigue but they start out fine on a

[00:22:19] Friday if they have a you know a weekend long match and they have eight events in three days um the first two days they're fine maybe they have a little pain at the end of the second day by the third day they're fatigued and so then they start subluxing then they get all this secondary inflammation and pain and that's when the the damage occurs and they have to sit out and then we have to rest strengthen rehab sometimes even tighten up the capsule when they get so loose now one of the things I I we're going to you know talk about here is of course the physical exam on this because the other thing we haven't talked about on this diagram is that little pesky biceps head yes and and that tendon um boy if anybody who's experienced tendonosis there uh I mean that's that can be incredibly painful and I think to an average person it's not entirely clear where that pain is coming from if they feel pain here right right that's a great point and so yes the biceps which is a a weird structure and it's absolute part of that weird Evolution that we have the biceps is one muscle in our arm but but it's two tendons at the at the origin which in the shoulder one of the tendons is so starts down here single single point of attachment in in the in the forearm actually crosses the joint as one muscle and then kind of splits into two bellies with exactly and it has the long head which is the one that so often gets inflamed and you're absolutely right it can be quite painful

[00:23:52] I mean and it can just affect everyday life with that and the second tendon peels off over here and it goes outside the joint and attaches to a bony prominence in that weird scapula that you talked about which is such a weird looking bone um and it attaches there that never tears it literally never tears uh so but people often do tear the the other this biceps and it can be from wear and tear it can be acute traumatically but it leads to a classic

[00:24:22] Popeye muscle kind of half their muscle is is balled up and looks weird it's not really that much of a functional consequence usually it stops hurting when it ruptures and if I'm not mistaken I mean this has been um u in the orthopedic sort of uh anecdotes for a long time was um the great quarterback um from Denver um John Elway John Elway he was having shoulder pain and was even thinking about retiring as far as I know his ruptured pain went away and then he won another Super Two Super Bowls after that so yeah so it's not a it's a structure that's not necessary but it's but and there's a lot of argument in

[00:25:03] Orthopedics and I don't need to go into it about how important it really is but the fact is it is anchored right up here at the superior laum so when you tear that Superior laum that biceps does funky things it becomes unstable and it and it gets more inflamed often and then that you get all that secondary pain so some people I'm not one of them some people who fix a lot of these will automatically just snip that biceps and and and reattach it in the front so it's not no longer a pain generator so that's the tendis yes that's the tendis but I don't do I do that only when I see tearing splitting something structurally wrong with the biceps I know that I can get a good repair as any any good surgeon can a good repair of the superior labor and once that's stable the biceps is fine again it's not it's no longer symptomatic and I knock going wood but I haven't had to go back and tedes anyone who I had just repaired and left it intact as long as I got a good um Superior laboral repair so because we've got the beautiful Anatomy here let's go a little deeper into this because I feel like the torn labram is to the MRI with the disc herniation is to the shoulder what the discernation is to the back right you know we tell our patients I almost wish when I give you an M for another reason I could ask the radiologist not to show me your spine in other words you take somebody having no spine issues and you stick him in the spanner there's nothing that bugs me more than having to sit there and go through all of these asymptomatic herniations which mean nothing and and I suspect the shoulder with its lab Ral teir has to be the same yes you you absolutely spoton and it is such a point of frustration the Radiologists are doing their job of course they're just reading the problem is that most of us walking around have especially for my age um uh have plenty of positive findings but they're asymptomatic I mean

[00:27:03] I've never had a spine or originated um you know symptom and so that's you're it's a very double-edged sword to get those MRIs same thing in the laum the laum will naturally degenerate just by using it so will the cartilage and look every we know there's a genetic predisposition to arthritis and by arthritis I mean not just inflammation of the joint but a a true loss of the cartilage integrity and that's kind of those two terms are used interchangeably by different people in different subspecialties but for our purposes as an orthopedic surgeon it's when the joint is degenerating and the cartilage surfaces are no longer P pristine just like you're chipping the paint on your car and does that occur uh preferentially on the humeral head or in the glenoid fausa or is it basically one of those things where the second you get one chip it's going to start happening on both sides yeah that's a great question too you know it's we don't have a good natural history of that we know that I mean I've operated on done total shoulders on people who had no cartilage left on their humoral head it was perfectly round and smooth there was no card it was just a bony just pure soft I mean pure hard Ivory type bone with no cartilage on it whereas the glenoid still had cartilage on it now that's a case where where to your point the loss on the humoris was smooth enough and gradual enough to where it didn't dig in and and sort of eat away at the GL the socket doesn't matter you still have to um to um replace the socket but we do for our younger athletic people who have a humoral head that's been damaged and they have a big chunk maybe a quarter size maybe a 50 cent piece size of cartilage full cartilage loss that's not great because that man that just keeps sloughing off cartilage they keep getting inflamed they're on the young side you don't want to do a shoulder replacement on them so we will do just a humeral head resurfacing they have get a nice new smooth uh metal head but we leave the C the the glenoid intact and and they have good cartilage there so it's it's metal on natural cartilage yeah what kind of metal is that by the way that's it's Cal chromium alloy just like the hips yeah yeah and and the nice thing about those is if you can get five years I have some people that have been had those in 10 years and they're fine and they're they're keep they're act they can be much more aggressive with their activities and if it ever if it ever does wear down the the glenoid side then you just go back in and revise it and put a a plastic cup for the glenoid yeah so let's now talk about when you look at the MRI finding and what you're looking for in the MRI and then how you're looking to contrast that with what you see on the physical exam and in a moment I'll have you examine me so you can and we'll do this for all of the pathology we talk about so that we can get a sense of this because I remember the very first time I saw you um after having sent many patients to you it was probably a year before I had my surgery I said look you know Alton I know I've got this laam it's been torn to shreds for years um I really don't want to have surgery unless

[00:30:26] I need to you examine me and said yeah you're not ready yet um so yeah walk through how you start to test the surrounding structures to elicit sort of feedback on the laum right so I will preface that by saying I'm so glad you brought that up because we one should never make their clinical especially surgical decision making on just an MRI and and i' I've written a couple of book chapters on that included an a Very very complete examination of the shoulder the basic exam the provocative Maneuvers and so forth and one of the things I've always stated I've never done this study I've always wanted to but I believe that a good history and that involves the mechanics of injury and the mechanics of use whether you're you're shooting a bow and arrow whether you're driving a race car whether you're playing basketball whether you're just lifting weights a combination of the mechanism but also their symptoms when they have have them and then their examination and

[00:31:30] I think if you do those compulsively and well you will be 95% accurate on so I remember one of the things that had changed because for me remember archery never the day before I'm having surgery I'm out there taking a 100 shots that was never the issue but in the months leading up to surgery I couldn't serve a volleyball with my daughter I couldn't shoot one basket like we you know play could I could not do that right and could pull a 75lb bow back yeah doesn't make sense it doesn't and it's just the mechanics of each individual and that's where the MRI does come in I use MRIs more to corroborate I would say and I I don't think I'm I'm maybe I'm a little more into sort of the the concept of making an accurate diagnosis before the

[00:32:18] MRI kind of the old school yeah yeah to kind of prove a point but um but I I always use it to corroborate because there are things that can be there in especially even just the difference between a partial thickness rotator cuff hair and a full thickness or a full thickness small and a full thickness large and and those are variable based again on the patient's activity some we know from good studies done with ultrasound MRI that walking down the street the um half the people age 60 have rotator cuff tears half the people over 60 torn have an asymptomatic torn rot cuff yeah unb be big but it can be

[00:33:01] I've seen I mean I don't doubt it just based on what we see of herniations in the sepine and the elpine um and that and that's where to your point it comes in it's so important that yes we don't want something we don't want to ignore something that can get much worse and make their treatment or recovery much more difficult but at the same time we need to be more circumspect about who we're operating and who we're not operating on are there ever situ ation where I'll give you an example right so I mean I'm asking I'm going to ask this question obviously in the shoulder but um if a patient came in and had a totally asymptomatic aornic aneurysm of 6 cm everybody agrees you would operate because the mortality of a rupture is enormous and frankly you don't want to wait till somebody's symptomatic that can be lethal so there are certainly indications where we operate on asymptomatic things are there any such indications in the shoulder oh that's a that's a great um great question I would say in general no unless you have obviously a tumor yeah not including oncology just the standard gar variety um structural injuries that can occur there are very few except if you've had someone who had well I'll give you a good example that's very personal to me my dad who he passed away at 95 we were swimming in Lake

[00:34:24] Travis when he was 94 and a half really vigorous mentally fit physically fit and but he did end up having pancreatic cancer and that's what killed him at 95 great life no no complaints with anybody but at 86 being com a guy who could still do pull-ups who was still swimming in the lake who did this guy's my hero all his own yard work everything and he was running to get out of the way the sprinkler did a banana peel that had a a dislocation of his shoulder ripped off two and a half of his four tendons and remember one of them never tears so almost his complete functional rotator cuff he was planning to come up to New

[00:35:05] York to visit and we did a little uh FaceTime and he he couldn't lift his arm it was like this and I and he's 86 but healthy never took a medication so forth so I said um Dad you need to come up early um we're going to need to fix this so we'll get an MRI come up here and um so my partner and I fixed him and

[00:35:25] Regional anesthesia he they didn't even give him much sedation he was like talking to us during the surgery got a good six anchor repair he had great tissue to the point that you've you've just helped so many of us understand but got a good solid repair at 95 and 94 you couldn't tell he ever had a tear he healed it back he was he went back to doing and what would have been the

[00:35:50] Natural History because I think a lot of doctors might have left him alone what would how would he have evolved thank you that's that was the point if I he would have been miserable for the next nine years of his life because he couldn't lift his arm it might not even have been that painful but he wouldn't have been able to do everything he wanted to do that kept him so V so in other words pain is not a pain shouldn't be the only symptom we look for we have to look for function no and and so what

[00:36:13] I would tell someone who came in let's say someone had a bad traumatic a motor vehicle accident and they tore their rotator cuff at badly and there were 60 65 U would I tell them you absolutely have to have it repared no but I would also tell them look if you don't repair this those muscles have lost their muscle tendon connection so they're going to atrophy and later if you I know you're not painful now but if you want to still do the things you're doing in the way you do them before this accident they need to have them repaired so this is effectively the discussion you had with one of the patients I sent you six months ago who tore a rotator cuff playing tennis many years ago and basically once this patient stop playing tennis they had no more pain yes so today they do yoga and pilates with no pain but they can never pick up a racket again they sent the person to you and that's basically what you said was you don't have to have this fixed but you will see a continued dimunition of your function as you age right exactly and the second uh caveat which I'll tell them is is you know you may start having symptoms in six months even doing those other things and if you do come back don't don't ignore them if you start having symptoms when you've been asymptomatic something has changed anatomically physiologically or something let's reassess it's not a you know it's not a a it's a dynamic State over a long period of time and so you know you need to be flexible in that and as a clinician certainly so when a patient typically comes in basically you know they're just saying doc my shoulder hurts yeah so um again on the exam absent even an MRI we're going to show people how you can just based on what where I'm weak or strong and what hurts you probably have a pretty good sense of this person has an intact cuff versus they don't yes this person has a laboral instability versus they don't this may actually just be bicep tendon injury versus not what else is on your differential diagnosis in the exam you don't have the MRI yet the guy's just says he's got shoulder pain this great

[00:38:21] I'm going to draw another picture Okay so I've drawn this shoulder again I've added on I've added on a couple of things I've added on the clavicle the collar bone and I've and and I've added on this other structure up here which is the Bony structure if you tap on the top of your shoulder that's the Bony roof of the shoulder that's the acroman and yet another part of that super weird CL uh scapula okay so the The Joint that when you hear about someone separating their shoulder it's this joint right here which is the acromioclavicular joint joint and that is um just a it it only rotates about 20° it's just a the way I like in this especially being in Texas you can talk about it because there a lot of car lovers and you know about it as a major car lover driver is it effectively is a m mcferson strut on uh on a car so it it's a stabilizer bar if you don't have those and there are people that are born without um collar bones without collar bones they can bring their should completely together right here in the center just like this it's it's kind of super cool um but it it holds those out so that's why you know it's the one most commonly injured in cyclists who who who wipe out because they fracture here because they they land on the outside of their shoulder but the AC joint the acromial cicular joint is what happens when people separate their shoulders which is also from dislocation different from dislocation that's usually from a force coming down from the top so we're pitched forward we land on the point of our shoulder and it jams it down and we can talk about that later it's super interesting but this AC chromian again is the Bony roof and under that roof is where the rotator cuff Glides and let me draw this so I've just drawn arrows back and forth arrows here so as the head rotates back and forth around the rotator cuff is attached here and it goes back and forth here so it's rubbing or or moving underneath this any any place in our body that there's two structures an uh anatomically in the limbs that move differentially with one another there's usually a Bersa that forms in between and so that Bersa is here I'll draw it in green that Bersa lives right in there and so it's just a thin filmy structure that can thicken up and become very inflamed and become btis and that's very painful so that's a common common otherwi the purpose of that is to allow these things to Glide past each other frictionless yes perfect yes exactly and then some of us are born with an extra kind of downs sloping of that AC chromian or a bone spur or we acquire it from repetitive athletic use there are multiple reasons if you have a big though bird beak coming down and pointing into that you can imagine if this is running back and forth there it's irritating the Bersa creating btis and it's also frictionally rubbing against the rotator cuff tendon and you can get buril sided upper part rotator cuff tears from that alone I know because I had one I had a big spur like that in my shoulder and so to be clear the spur occurred because you were genetically predisposed to it based on the shape of the Bersa yes that's really great that you said that you know you should have been orthopedic surgeon so you can have a type one one a type two or a type three of chromian type one is totally flat that's the majority of people type two the second most common and type three is about I I don't remember the exact numbers but certainly it's not rare like 30% of people and that's the one that really predisposed you if but only if you're an overhead athlete or lifting weights overhead or doing all sorts of you know aggressive things if you're sedentary actuary who doesn't exercise then um you'll never have a problem because you're just not repetitively loading it enough to wear down or cause a tear this is so so interesting because you know you'll often hear people talk about um you know well I can do so and so and

[00:42:43] I've never had an issue therefore it's okay right so if you're if you have the top AC chromian there you can probably get away with a lot more overhead activity and you might look at somebody who's in category three who every time they do excessive overhead ity gets injured and you might be saying well there's something wrong with you the reality of it is it would be interesting if we sort of knew these things in advance and we could maybe modify and temper our activity around our genetics effectively absolutely it's a super cool concept I've always thought about that that that stuff the predisposition and

[00:43:12] I'm not talking about a genetic pred predisposition to arthritis I'm you're talking about mechanics the mechanics and anatomy and you're absolutely right it's so important I'll give you another example of it I know just from having MRI for other reasons I have a very congenitally narrow sepine so I just don't have any wiggle room and as a result of that I take my sort of tech neck protocol very seriously yes you know I also know that

[00:43:46] I already have two small herniations now luckily they aren't doing anything to me but I know that nobody's going to go in and remove one without doing the other which means they'd fuse me out of the gate right so you know I think knowing that is very helpful because what it tells me to do is you're going to do a lot of sort of rehabilitative exercises even before having the injury yes and you know I actually think it's very fortunate that I'm no longer a surgeon yeah because I think a lot of my colleagues from surgery have ended up having neck surgery oh yes because you're in this position all the time um so yeah I do I think this is a very interesting idea i' never thought about it in the orthopedic context in the joint context that is yeah and and um you know the other thing I thought of when you said that is that when you have a but this has been studied in the spine a little bit right so if you have a congenitally narrow a stenotic spine and you're playing football you're way more at risk for catastrophic spinal cord blun BL cord in so if you've had that's why when we were I was team doctor for for almost 15 years at at a college up in in New York and you know you everybody doesn't screen these guys but if you have your first Stinger then you need to be need to be uh screened and see if you are and if you are then you have a very serious discussion about what you're subjecting your neck to there are a lot of lot of sports to play and you don't necessarily have to be you know butting heads at High Velocity you know so um so that's exactly true there but you're right it hasn't been done in the shoulder and yeah it'd be a simple easy screen and say oh you know I mean well especially I think when you take about when you talk about kids who have lots of athletic potential and they're 11 years old and you know maybe there is a decision to be made are you going to be a pitcher you going to be a tennis player you going to be a basketball player you're going to play lacrosse you're going to swim if you knew you'd have a longer shelf life in one over the other would that at least weigh into the decision-making process that's fascinating I love the way your mind works because yes there are plenty of multiport athletes who have ability and and and you could do an assessment for instance if you are yeah if you're a if you have super loose joints then you're going to need to pick the ones that um you can keep dynamically stabilized but are not going to be subjected directly to un unnecessary forces unary forces yeah it's great concept so I'm guessing

[00:46:19] Alton you drew this to expand our understanding of the anatomy to then appreciate the shoulder pain that somebody shows up with yes so all these things that I've drawn on here can be pain generators and another one which is exactly to the point we are talking about is this this right here the AC joint almost everybody through wear and tear middle age and

[00:46:42] Beyond has arthritis in the AC joint Y and like we were talking about in the neck it's almost always asymptomatic but it can be symptomatic if it's so just to be clear the little red structure you've drawn on there that ligament that is connecting the clav to the AC chromian um there there's no fluid within that space tiny amount tiny amount any place there's cartilage there's a tiny amount of fluid but there's very little but it can expand and it can and so if it's arthritic you can get more fluid if you have you know young weightlifters like you were um can I'll draw it here can develop in the end of the clavicle from that repetitive butt mut doing heavy bench and other types of activities can develop davical osteolysis that repetitive jamming or bruising of the bone and cartilage causes the cartilage to disintegrate and the bone to lose its integrity and it starts to kind of get very soft and it gets very inflamed as soon as you start breaking up cartilage the all the macrofagos from our body come in there and you get a big inflammatory response you get a lot of extra fluid and a lot of pain so from a chronic perspective are you going to see that more in somebody doing bench press or military press or which direction both but you'll also get it I don't do these I don't recommend my patients do them but the the people do heavy lat raises that just jams up that it's just so much leverage on that that joint and if you are to do it I recall you you're sort of more in favor of if you're going to do it thumbs are up not down yeah yeah and not directly lateral more more in the in the natural plane of the of the SC exactly exactly that minimizes stresses the other thing about it is that joint you can imagine it's like you you're understanding the biomechanics you lie directly on your your the point of your shoulder and it jams that against so they have a lot of pain there that pain comes right down the front kind of follows the bicep so you have to differentiate that between the two then you look at an x-ray without an MRI or and you see these spurs that are down there well those Spurs aren't ever going to tear the rotator cuff because that's that tendon is out there it never gets that far but it rubs you we see it as an indentation in the muscle so you know every time you're working out you know you hypertrophy your muscles and so if you have that constantly rubbing there and then you hypertrophy around it it's a truth so that's an athlete who complains that when they're lifting it hurts more exactly exactly and that's a crystal clear when they're when they're relaxed they haven't been exercising they have Rock Solid strength if you get them after if you get them up into positions or if they've been working out you test them they'll actually be weak not because they're truly weak but because their brain is is saying no I'm not going to give you that it it's going to hurt me it's going to hurt my body so

[00:49:31] I'm not going to give you enough electrical current to give you a full strength there wow you know this reminds me when I was in medical school once I decided I was going to go into surgery I read a book and I wish I could remember the name of it but it was a book written by a general surgeon who had long since passed away but the entire book was based on diagnosing appendicitis and you know this was this guy wrote cope C's append cope early diagnosis append and I thought this was the most fascinating thing in the world you had this old school Old School general surgeon who said you know this before anyone's using a CT but he was like this is 100% a clinical diagnosis and you wouldn't nobody today training would ever dream you could waste an entire book yeah to diagnose something that by the way incredibly prevalent it's the single most prevalent condition in general surgery when you just shove everybody in the scanner and get the answer today but the reality of it is this this makes me think of cop's appendicitis a this is more complicated and two I don't think there'll ever be a substitute for the Nuance of the exam and the the history both the history of the injury and the history of what causes pain yeah y it's fascinating I love that and we're GNA come up with

[00:50:45] Baron's you know well the the guy that that was my cope uh was our uh professor of Cardiology at T land he was super old when he was teaching ing us he was in his 80s at that time that's not super old but back then it was um and he had had he had had um uh he had had um thyroid cancer so he he spoke in in a very hushed tone his name was see Thorp

[00:51:11] Ray and he was a cardiologist he could diagnose he could tell you exactly what was wrong with which valve just by listening to with his testic cope with his hand sometimes he just put his ear up there and exact he could tell by the nature of the subtle variations in the heart murmurs what the dinos was I just yeah I I this is a little off topic but

[00:51:35] I do sort of lament the fact that that's a dying art um and look you you know the reality of it is I'm sure that today with Ekko and stuff we're better and he was probably such an outlier that most people could never rise to that level just like most people could have never attained the clinical Acumen of of cope but it is a little bit sad to think that you know we can't have both right it would be you have to think it would be great to have both um so it's interesting to think that in Orthopedics it might be one of those Specialties where this judgment of the exam is still really really relevant right that's right I mean obviously you get pinpoint diagnoses with the various tests um and in Orthopedics there's plenty of things you find that aren't symptomatic but still thinking back to I do lament that as well about the loss of the clinical

[00:52:32] Acumen uh that that comes with all the Advanced Imaging and but I think that if you knew if you have both um it we don't and I don't say this self-servingly in the sense of I want to keep doing what I do as long as I can because I love it but we our patients need us to be able to still diagnose listen to them hear what they're saying because I mean I don't know anything about general surgery but there's got to be things that come up positive that you don't necessarily have to have surgery on right absolutely and so you want to still be hearing and perhaps examining but certainly hearing the patient's story and knowing what's really going on to determine whether they need surgical or non-surgical care or what kind of care they need I feel like that was something that was if you were paying attention in residency I think that was a very important message I think when you start residency you're just so preoccupied with mastering the technical side of things I mean there's so much to learn it's it's it's like learning to master an instrument and learn a new language at the same time and you've only got five years to do it but I definitely remember the wisdom that was sort of spoken down to us which is the single most important thing that you will learn is when to operate and when not to operate that's true that's true and and you know I don't know how long that takes yeah um my guess is it's well after you finish your residency but unfortunately and I I don't want to go down this Rabbit Hole too much but unfortunately there's and there's some people who don't learn that some people don't learn it or ignore it yeah and there are plenty of people who will operate on any MRI uh whether it's

[00:54:15] Orthopedics or probably general surgery um I don't know whether it's we had one surgeon who uh the joke was if you you uh rubbed beta dine on the wall he would operate on the wall just just don't don't don't let beta dine near the wall because he'll start cutting it yeah yeah that's true and that's that's a perfect uh way to say it without being too pejorative um and yeah and there are economic incentives there are even and these are a version of economic incentive but there is even incentives in big institutions where it's an RV RB yeah rvu concept where you're going to do more because that's how you get your promotion and so forth and it makes it I have to just suppress that information because it makes me too cynical and sad but it's actually happens and I'm sure you did um when you were doing surgery and I certainly do now I see patients that walk in with their MRI all the time and say I'm scheduled for this uh surgery in my shoulder or my elbow and um I'm scheduled for this but just my friend said I should just come get one more opinion and I sayl I'm looking at you I examine them I do everything I go through and I say look I wasn't there at the time of your examination so I can't speak for what that person saw and what their their statement is but today based on your MRI your history and your physical exam which I've done I will not operate on you and and if your friend said you should come to me because I have decent operative skills that's I'm sorry but I

[00:55:54] I I won't I can't in good conscious operate on you maybe someday but not now and I feel like I've sent you patients where that's been the patients that have come from out of the country and it's been hey I know that this surgeon is saying so I just want Alton to have a second look yeah and you know and that's but I've never met a patient who didn't appreciate that by the way I mean sometimes it creates more confusion right but and I say that I say look I'm sorry if this confuse you I'm sorry if this is complicating your your trajectory of what you you're planning for but that's just the truth and yeah the thing you always have to remember as a patient um and I and I I think of this myself is once you commit to doing something it's the inertia to do it is huge right and you can always just say look there's an asymmetry in this decision to not have surgery doesn't remove any options you get to have surgery again later if it was the right thing to do yes once you have surgery it's not that you can't have surgery again but the operative field never looks the same a second time that's a very good point and so you you want to keep in mind the asymmetry of a pause yeah that's very true very true all right so let's go back to our shoulder pain patient I think one thing we've established so far is a patient that has shoulder pain can have so many things going on their AC joint can be the problem they could have brotis they could have a rotator cuff injury they could have a labral injury they could have bicep tendon inflammation and let's just leave it at that they could have arthritis we've got all of these things that are going now arthritis would usually be accompanied by one of these other things that predisposed it okay so we're going to go through an exam yeah and you're going to basically run me through these are the things you do and this is what you look to see on the MRI to basically correlate your findings and give you a a set of confidence as you go into the operating room you named the bulk of them I want to add two things to that before we do our exam and uh one of them I've drawn just kind of a red Arc down there and what I'm showing there is The

[00:58:09] Capsule that's the best place to see the capsule when you're looking at an MRI because it's thicker there and it's more distinct there's not other structures obscuring it normally if you have a super loose joint you can have a very capacious capsule like that that allows it to flop down and even sublux or dislocate when it's very high and tight and thick there that can be representative of something called adhesive capsulitis and the reason I say that is because that's so so common one and two it can conflate all sorts of diagnosis and the frozen shoulder ad is the is the layman term for adhesive capsulitis we don't know why this happens we it's super common I see probably two or three new cases every week in my office it's that common but it's multifactorial it's worse like many things are if you have diabetes but it's but you don't get it with more frequency if you have diabetes but it is and it's a full spectrum and there's a lot of misinformation about it because the original old literature said that oh all of these just get better with time well they don't all we know they don't all and and some of even a subset of them in my practice about only one out of five actually ever need surgery and we never do that at the at the beginning and it's just a simple little 30 minute release of the capsule and and reduction in the inflammation and then they they're so happy um but that's that's the exception most 80% do not need any surgery they need some way to control inflammation they need really good physical therapy and a home program and some te for mostly Mobility yes for Mobility that's why I'm saying that is because you can get a stiff shoulder if you have impingement if you have a big bone spur because your brain says I'm not going to let you move it there and then it just gradually stiffens up that's a secondary stiffness or adhesive capsulitis it's not the weird primary adhesive capsulitis that could happen to you or me just suddenly and it just happens it's a spontaneous intense inflammation in the lining inner lining if you take a little camera and stick it in there and just look you see it's beat red normally everything when you're in arthroscopy everything's kind of offwhite yeah and but in the case of it's just beat red and it's crazy and we and people have done all sorts of of laboratory tests biopsies evaluations have happened over a long period of time um I mentioned to you there's a a colleague of Mine in

[01:00:59] Northern California that wants to talk to you because you're so smart in this about frozen shoulder because that maybe things some of the things you've said um might overlap with that biochemically yeah so I was going to say what are the I mean do these respond to nids or is this a part of the body that doesn't have enough of a vascular Supply in the capsule that you don't get enough penetration it has a rich vascular

[01:01:23] Supply but I think in this case I I give inets when people want them and they're afraid of an injection but I think you because it's that inner lining and it's so robust I mean if you look at it microscopically it's just these angry red fronds and and I think it's just not strong enough so I like to put a small dose of cortisone into the joint one time I I always inject from the back okay for two reasons one this part is more richly supplied by the brachial plexus so it's more sensitive and two people kind of see you coming at them with a needle so I always go in the back okay and I never use an ultrasound that's a whole another thing that a lot of clinicians use the ultrasound just to see but you can feel where you're going you just get it in there and what's super cool about this is people come in with a lot of stiffness and a lot of pain and then you inject them and put Lo local anesthetic as well in there they're free in 10 seconds oh my gosh they walk out they're saying oh my gosh it's amazing they might they still probably need Physical Therapy but the fact that they got such dramatic relief with such a simple treatment is is so so do you recommend that a patient with frozen shoulder air on the side of earlier intervention with a cortisone shot to to then allow them to do more rehab sooner or do you say I don't want to do cortisone shot till you've done three months or rehab it's it's purely based again on their exam well and their exam and their history how long they've had it and how acutely symptomatic it is when I'm examining them if I can stretch them and they start kind of saying oh that hurts a little bit at the end but they've got decent motion they're tight then go back and do go do pt go a good

[01:03:04] PT who will really stretch you out you don't need anything you don't even need insets but if you if I can't get them to move and they're just they're screaming you're not they're not going to get anywhere in PT because it's going to hurt you much to do it so I'll inject them then send them to PT and I always see them back at about six weeks most of them are dramatically better but not all of them very rarely they need a second shot and then um and then some of them are just recalcitrant and they just stay stiff and then uh then I'll do the little procedure on them um you said there was one other thing you wanted to mention yeah what was that um oh yes a big source of neck pain which you and I have discussed uh multiple times is referred pain from the spine from the neck and so we'll include that in our exam because it's so important because you at least have to rule that out well especially because someone comes in with shoulder pain and I see that you know I take care of a lot of professional musicians and their their necks are doing all sorts of crazy things from all the violinist in the philarmonic OR Etc just all types of uh musical instruments that cause that lead to having to maintain these certain postures that sometimes are very counterproductive to their overall muscular skeletal Health but they'll come in with shoulder pain going down their arm maybe even down to their hand and they'll have already gotten a shoulder MRI and they're 55 and they have four findings on their MRI but it's not coming from their shoulder it's coming from their neck and so we have to make sure and differentiate that and because the worst thing I could do the worst thing I could do to them is have them take time off from music to fix what does need to be fixed in their shoulder and then it's and they still have pain and they still have the pain and in that situation is there something you see on exam that makes you think we better go at your neck first with the

[01:04:56] MRI because the symptoms fit as something I'm expecting to see and then you look and you see well I do see that so now that's yes exactly so that is so important so intrinsic shoulder pathology whether it's a rotator cuff whether it's impingement whether it's arthritis almost never does the pain radiate down below the elbow whereas neck origin whether it's pinch nerves at you know any the lower cervical spine where it's more common to have pathology almost always goes down below the elbow and into the hand now a low the one Oddball is C7 and

[01:05:37] I learned this not that long ago from some really great cervical spine surgeons um is that if you have a deep posterior pain under your scapula yes that can be C7 uh and that's right where it goes and so I've had two musicians whom you know recently uh both with that diagnosis yeah it's funny the only time

[01:06:00] I've ever had a complaint of a neck issue what turned out to be a neck issue was not didn't present as neck pain so I and this was several years ago now again in the back of my mind I've always known I'm susceptible I'm susceptible I'm susceptible and I woke up one morning and my left trap felt like it was in spasm interesting and I kind of ignored it I was like oh I I slept wrong you know whatever this is super uncomfortable you know the next day it was still in spasm I just sort of ignored it I might have taken some you know Nets and this went on for like two weeks and maybe not two weeks might have gone a week at that point and at this point I'm thinking I've never had a muscle that's this tense for this long um and in about that time very abruptly

[01:06:52] I started to notice a loss of tricep strength wow and yes you know I noticed it in the gym because and it was subtle at first because I was doing you know Skull Crushers where you have two dumbbells so now the right arm can't compensate for the left because using two dumbbells and all of a sudden I couldn't move the weight with this arm so I that's weird I can move it this way so I and then it got to the and then it progressed so rapidly that within about two days I couldn't pull my bow back because this arm couldn't support here yeah so at that point I was kind of freaking out I'm now down to you know only being able to do a couple pounds so

[01:07:28] I know hey once you have those motor symptoms but here's the thing zero pain yeah not a lick of pain no no no numbness tingling no paresthesia anywhere no my neck doesn't feel a thing I just have this trap on fire make a long story short you know I see a person uh who who says look you know we could operate on you but unfortunately this is a surgeon who shares your ethos and and she said look um let's rehab the heck out of this I think if you want we could do an injection I wasn't excited about it because it was an anterior injection and

[01:08:05] I said no way I'd rather do prazone and traction yes and so we did prazone traction and sure enough within three months the strength was back it's never returned but that was a real wakeup call to me that H I had a cervical symptom that didn't present with any neck pain yeah that's great that's a great story so instructive and you're absolutely spoton I mean and and yeah I mean I see when I see especially the musicians as long as you don't have now you did have some so you were you were absolutely right getting it more deeply studied to make sure because you had triceps but if you have no weakness but it maybe you do have a little tingling or something but

[01:08:43] I know I just know it's coming from the neck I won't Lurch in and get um MRIs of the neck X-rays and mrri in the neck I'll often just give them uh a one very low dose of prazone and it usually goes away I mean it's it's and then they they don't have to worry about it and they don't have to get go down the rapbit hole of worry and and anxiety about that so as we were talking about a minute ago about uh the shoulder I think that with a good history interactive history and certain questions and a good physical exam I can be about 95% accurate in making a diagnosis without an MRI without a CT scan without even x-rays and so I think that conserves resources and also it just gets the information because those little tidbits are what are critical including to knowing what's going to make you the best whether it's going to be an injection PT surgery maybe Etc so the first thing I look at is you know it's nice that you're fit so

[01:09:43] I can see any true abnormalities I can look for atrophy I can look for asymmetry somebody who's had a should separated shoulder will have a big bump on one side yours are equal um I can look at the PEC and see you know some of the nerve problems we talked about the parid Turner for instance the mixed braal plexopathy I'll see someone with a very indented um pectoralis I had a patient the other day who's a rock and roll guitarist and he was lifting weights and and ruptured his pectoralis tendon and so I could look and see right away he had bruising down the arm not the chest wall that means he tore the tendon from the bone here instead of of the muscle tendon unit here which a lot of weightlifters would will tear but I could also see gross asymmetry so those are the kind of things you're looking for and I also even care about the sloping of the shoulders because that can potentially be posturally if it's an an issue with posture and so forth okay so looking at U your shoulder I see nothing a asymmetric I I just then so

[01:10:49] I'm looking at the asymmetry I haven't checked motion yet I'm just going to palpate so I can palpate the AC joint and see that those are tender or non- Tender I can palpate the front of the shoulder now this area is always tender it's where the brachial plexus is passing through so this is one of the most tender areas in the shoulder so I don't press too hard and I'm I'm kind of looking for asymmetry not pressing hard

[01:11:11] I want to look at the PEC I want to look at the folds of the PEC and see if there's any asymmetry there I want to look at the Contour of the deltoid and then I want to palpate back here your a chromium the roof the Bony roof of the shoulder and I want to palp that and see if there's any tenderness along that perimeter because the whole deltoid originates all around there so you can tear especially weightlifters especially very active athletes can tear a little portion of that origin ends up healing but it can be very much of a nuisance for six or eight weeks and then I look at the upper trapezius right I want to see if there's any asymmetry if you've had neck surgery and had an injury to that nerve then you can get atrophy there and it'll be very asymmetric and then I want to look in the back back want to look and and palpate people who are working out a lot or or texting a lot and have bad posture or bad ergonomics and get a lot of strain here in the romboid minor the romboid major and the levator up here and so those are the things I'm looking at so I don't see any abnormalities here but if I did that would help with the diagnosis then we want to look at range of motion so I'm going to ask you just lift your arm straight up in the air so you have great motion and I'm looking for any subtle asymmetry sometimes times an arm will be maybe just that far that last bit that I push it up you go ooh that hurts that means your shoulder's a little stiff why is it well we'll get to that but that's your forward elevation yours is nice and fluid and equal then we look at external rotation you have beautiful external rotation that's about 75 degre everybody varies I only go out about 50° it's fine now if you're a thrower you're going to have let's say you're a left-handed thrower you're going to acquire external rotation to get more of that lot we talked about that angular velocity so this arm would come out externally more in a thrower in a left-handed thrower whereas if I come up here and measure internal rotation that would be decreased that's that's you've acquired that from a lifetime of throwing so that's what we look for and that's normal variation based on your activity pattern okay so we we've done that then

[01:13:18] I look we've done external rotation we've done a modification of internal rotation which is here in full ab abduction seeing how far you internally rotate locking that up trying not to rotate the scapula too much because that's a we know that a lot of people with stiff shoulders can compensate you were talking about that before with all that scapular thoracic motion okay the other way to measure that is just having you reach behind your back but that's often more painful and it's easy to deduce if you have a frozen shoulder let's say you're you have a frozen shoulder on this side it was going to look completely normal to look at you have pain you have stiffness you can't do all the things you want to do and I look here and I see that this one's 70 and I look here and it goes only goes to 30 and it starts to hurt when I do that that's that adhesive capsulitis in there that's blocking motion abduction which is this movement here so we always test abduction and I see this mistake made you can abduct way up but all that's all secondary to not all but a lot of it's from your scapula thoracic so I hold your scapula down I know it's there and I see how far your glenohumeral your shoulder joint proper can come up you come up perfectly to 90° so that's a really important distinction if you have frozen shoulder it's going to be stuff if you have a chronic rotator cuff it's going to be stiff and so those are the kind of things that we start to put together so we've tested range of motion now let's test strength so we're isolating the rotator cuff and then we can also check the deltoid so there's two components to shoulder motion primarily that's the deltoid which gives us so much flexion extension and abduction but we also have the rotator cuff which we had talked about before so here in neutral with your elbows at your side push out to the outside super strong now someone who has a big rotator cuff tiar that's going to go it's just going to give way and then we know that something significant is going on now we do internal rotation push in now that you can see how your pecs fired internal rotation is a composite of both the PEC pulling across very strong and compensating for maybe a rotator cuff problem the subscapularis in the front so we can't really test the subscapularis that way so we had to do it a different way put your hands on your abdomen this way push your elbow out against me that is all subscap that is all subscap so if you have a little even partial tear that's going to hurt if you have a complete subscap off this elbow will when you do that maneuver will fall back it'll just fall away you literally can't maintain that position so that's a nice good way okay we did AB we did external rotation we did internal rotation now we isolate the superspinatus that that that elevator of the shoulder that's so important and so here we push straight up hard and your rock solid and that isolates the supinatus then but your deltoid is a little part of that so that's how we can then check okay let's check the anterior deltoid push against me here and I'm just resisting so I can stabilize it okay then push back against me so that you've got a great posterior deltoid anterior deltoid and now the lateral deltoid push straight out that's a composite of the deltoid we can see that firing but also the superspinatus because that initiates abduction so so we've got good we've checked now the the for the shoulder we've checked the strength range of motion and palpation and look for any asymmetry now we're going to do some provocation we have to do provocative Maneuvers to get to more pinpoint diagnosis so in the case of a rotator cuff tear we can check strength there it's not really a provocation but if you if I abject you here and then externally rotate from there that's all rotator cuff and if that's weak as it is then you likely have a rotator cuff tear it can be the supinatus it can also be the infraspinatus and so that's one then if

[01:17:19] I'm I'm up in this position and I just Ro just relax and I rotate you down and I here crepitus in there that would indicate btis if I cause pain there that's the impingement sign and that would imply that you're bringing the head up and rotating it and irritating that inflamed Bersa that's impingement where you might have a Spur that's that now A variation on that theme is when we come straight ahead elbows fully up like this keeping yeah up up high and then push up against me that is your biceps that isolates the long head of the biceps that we talked about because the short head never comes into play it never tears and never gets irritated so that tests the long head of the biceps up there now we will cross over in one way we'll cross over into the elbow is by checking your other biceps which is the distal biceps and we we kind of we know that that can be if you have a normal distal biceps and a very inflamed long head in your shoulder this will hurt this is the speeds where you're turning your palm up go ahead superate see that really fires your biceps there good strong and I can I you're you're being kind I can I cannot break you and you can break me so we test that that would hurt and you'd give way if you had and you but you'd say it doesn't hurt here it hurts here so it's tugging on that bicep so that's a good good indicator for that then we want to look at uh your laum that's a common tearing uh thing that that entity that can manifest so the superior lb we have a good provocative maneuver for that it's called the active compression test and we call it the slap test which stands for Superior laum anterior posterior we it's a funky weird position you're across the body thumb way down and then you push up against that and that is

[01:19:11] Rock Solid now if you had a super Superior laboral tear one that maneuver would just hurt but it then it would just give away it would just fall away and you know firsthand about that um okay so that's the superior laum now if we're we're looking for the anterior posterior labor and we won't do that because we don't have a I would normally lie you down and then shuck your shoulder back and forth but I can get approximate with that if you were sitting I can stabilize your shoulder and scapula by grabbing that and then I can push anterior or posterior someone who's very loose I can move them excessively posterior or anterior and then I can even pull down on your arm and feel that head go whoop whoop with if you have that big capacious capsule where it's inferiorly translatable then

[01:19:59] I can easily feel that from this position and I'll feel it just open up and go down so so those are really the core parts of the the straight the the almost full shoulder exam and you can that's going to be about 95% corroborative and accurate based on what you've been telling me in terms of your history why you have shoulder pain all right Alton so so now we have a sense of how complicated and nuanced the exam is assis ofg

[01:20:31] Treat start with the operation I had so a laboral repair and um is the approach significantly different whether it's a slap versus a complete tear like mine I assume it's just the number of ports or how does it yeah it's it's um it's just a little more uh technically right to do and you need a few more little and do most of these now as I was talking about the technology earlier that we can do these percutaneously so we don't need five big big I mean these are only a centimeter and a half the biggest ones are only about a centimeter centimeter and a half but the others um they can be percutaneous tiny little holes that we use little canulas through and then put the drill through and so forth so so that's um that's right it's it's more just adding a little time you know it takes 10 minutes to do each anchor sort of thing and so you just add on and you needed a bunch um but um it's also like the first thing if I recall that exam under anesthesia is crucial right yes oh

[01:21:29] I'm glad you mentioned that yes so even with a good exam remember that a dynamic exam you've got your your brain has been dealing with this problem for a long time you're naturally well not naturally you work but but you're muscular you have good muscle tones so if I'm examin you I probably can't sublux your shoulder I mean you have to kind I have to kind of jump up on top of it to do it um the rare case is somebody who's had such longstanding instability that their body is no longer responding to it w and usually I can get one or two subluxations but then they they tense up but I can usually get one or two so that's one uh subset but so yes so the great thing about an exam under anesthesia is once you're in your position where you're going to have the surgery you've got a a regional block where your arm is super numb and you're sedated so that you're relaxed and you can't control anything and then I can just it's as if your muscles aren't really there I mean they have a little effect on it but mainly I'm testing the static stabilizers in your case I could take it pretty far out back and weigh I could completely dislocate your shoulder out front so and that wasn't still hurts for me to watch that video yeah right it's super cool um and so then you know then that tells me okay I need to be careful when I'm looking on the inside I need to assess not just the labor which

[01:22:54] I know is torn I need to in the case of the anterior you've been like the balloon you're blowing up repeatedly you've been also stretching out your capsule you're still compensating well less well and less well with the muscles but you are compensating so if that is stretched down in the front I need to know that in addition to just repairing the laborum itself I need to gather up some of the this capsule which has become too capacious and and do what we call a cap solape which is to gather and tighten that up too MH and that's kind of a judgment call when you've done a lot of them you kind of know how much to gather you don't want to gather too much because then it tightens them up too much um to that point and this is a caveat about an not well yeah unnecessary surgery had a lovely violinist professional violinist who I treated her whole family they're all violinist and she had uh been up in

[01:23:52] Vermont um farther enough away to where when she had a frozen shoulder or shoulder pain she got an MRI saw saw a sports Doctor Who Saw and again she's 60 at that time 62 63 and had some degenerative labal tearing well he said she needed to have a repair of that which and is she presented with what pain just pain a little stiffness okay so just read the

[01:24:23] MRI it's said laboral tearing didn't really have anything else so said you need a repair of your laum did a repair of the laum she came to me about 6 months later in tear had not been playing for six months had the stiffest shoulder I think I've ever seen basically didn't move so he tighten the hell out of the capsule right and did a a labor repair that in a 62-year-old who's not an athlete would never be necessary it's just un sort of un universally true and um so I had to go in and scoper it was really hard because it was so tight had to just bit by bit release everything that had been done and release the capsule that was all you know crunched up and and tightened up even had to take some of the sutures out um to free up her shoulder do you have a sense of what her initial injury was even caused by I mean do you think it was just capsular I think she just had classic Frozen Should so someone that should have had PT plus or minus at most a single ection to reduce the inflammation has the exact opposite they get a complete tightening of the capsule and and and there's a school of thought in Orthopedics that says we just don't like repairing labrums and doing capsule repairs in older people because it you that's the outcome you get yes and that's completely valid it's completely valid people don't I remember some people that I spoke with who said wow you know at your age Peter you're basically 50 you're having a laboral repair are you crazy um of course in in my case I think

[01:25:55] I don't I haven't lost any Mobility which is kind of remarkable no and in fact you you and I discussed that some right yeah that was one of my biggest fears yeah and uh so one has to pay extra attention to that for me um and if we want to be specific about your case as just a case example I don't think we had a choice because you your subluxation you're so active your subluxation with all the different activities we you already had some arthritis you were already wearing down some cartilage I mean it's it's going to be it's either that or the inevitability of having a shoulder replacement in another 10 years right yeah I I mean I think when I saw the little bit of arthritis there I kind of wished I'd done it sooner sure um knowing what I know today I almost wish I had more pain yeah you know sooner because I I really had a ton of pain 10 or 15 years ago but with a lot of good tissue work and a lot of

[01:26:54] I kind of got out of it and I made some modifications like there were certain things I just decided I couldn't do um but but but I think that's interesting so okay but another component to that is especially now people are so much younger mainly because they're all rucking now no um but um they people are so much younger physiologically in better condition and we know that from whether it's cancer treatments and everything else and the advancements of science that a 50-year-old now that would have applied to that data that we have you know 20 years ago ising so I base it on I mean you're you were kind of an outlier yeah you base it on biological age chronological age and even look there are some people that have I'll I'll scope them they I'll say look I don't have any other way than looking and seeing what's there and in some cases they have better cartilage than what the

[01:27:48] MRI is indicating or the and then I can go ahead and do a repair and some of them are I've done a couple I mean maybe I shouldn't say this on air I've done a couple of like 58y olds 60 year olds but their joint was pristine I mean it looked as good as a 25-year-old they just had a discreet yeah laboral tar no to me look this is what I this is to me an extension of what I think of as

[01:28:10] Precision medicine which is we use evidence-based medicine which is incredibly heterogeneous to make populationbased assertions and general broad recommendations but But ultimately the only patient that really matters for most doctors is the one right in front of thema and therefore you have to be able to make evidence informed decisions based on the appropriate physiology that you see and it's also a conversation it's a conversation with that patient not a unilateral decision it's it's okay what do you want to do what do you know about this here's what I know about this here's what I'm seeing with you and we need to say here are the possibilities and what do you want to do so how often when you go in for and and let's just I guess just explain to people so the biggest Port puts the camera and do you have how many and then you have like a few working ports obviously yeah so typically typically since more of the pathology is superior and anterior although you had some in in the back you if you're working in the Superior in the front you go in through the back with the camera so you just have a good panoramic view of everything we have two different kinds of angled lenses so we can see Corners if we need to usually don't need them for most things but um then I can see the superior lab I can see the biceps you know in in general surgery we insulate with carbon dioxide right so you're shooting carbon dioxide to blow everything up I assume you're using saline to do the same thing so you're you're making that capsule bigger and that's a good point so I don't use I mean I've done a lot of these I don't use high pressure some people use around 50 millimeters Mercury pressure I use 35 and that means less postoperative pain presumbly less it's less yes distension distension of the whole shoulder and so forth so um that's what I do um and and you can still put in little um retractors kind of pull tissue out of the way and so forth that's just a technique I actually that's more of an extension of what I do in the elow um because there's a lot more Peril uh because of the nerves so close yeah but um but in so then usually need two working portals in the front which are just canulas that are just basically canals to get in with instruments that are long enough to fit through the U through the and do the work and then in the case of for instance a superior laum we use a percutaneous right through the top just underneath the kind of right here actually where that Arrow red arrow is going and that just gets you to the superior lab room so that's a little percutaneous you make a tiny little hole uh in the rotator cuff kind of muscle tendon Junction it just spreads the fibers apart so it doesn't do any damage to that and then uh You' got a perfect

[01:30:53] Bird's eyee uh direction for the drilling and putting in those few anchors in the top and then that's that's really it and explain how that works so you drill a little hole in the glenoid fausa uh what's the diameter of that hole Yeah so it it depends on what kind of anchor you're doing usually roughly not more than 3 millimet and now we're down to 1.8 okay even three seems big three seems big but you that's what you fit the the plastic or the um absorbable anchor in and that you just kind of tap in with the Mallet all of them you tap in with the Mallet and you're drilling into the bone you're drilling around here kind of this angle here and you have to get the angle right it's a very three-dimensional but you put them in so that you're drilling into hard bone and then the anchor inserts through that and um so they're not circumferential no they're just straight in correct we used if we did them open we used to do them even with drill holes and a suture going through circumfer so what holds the anchor in is it just the pressure you're putting an anchor in that is bigger than the hole and so like a nail yes exactly and or a t not not a screw they not screwed um there there were historically some that we screw in but not anymore and now the the ones that are purely U basically braided polyester those go in as a as just a the suture goes in and then as you carefully pull it back out the way their design they ball up and it creates those I mean they're super strong you can lift the shoulder off the table so it's super cool to use those wow that's so interesting so you have a lot of confidence in the Integrity that repair yes yes I know that if I tug on it multiple times it's not going to come out and um I mean it would take a fully traumatic Force to do that yeah so before you do this I assume you do an exam of the cuff while you're in there absolutely so you go through and do a survey of the joint you look at the cartilage surfaces from the nooks and crannies cartilage surface you look at the rotator cuff inserting on the bone from inside out and you can see that being smooth if it's frayed if it's notably frayed you can probe it and you can see oh that you know actually has a also and I occasionally see that because they're athletes a small almost full thickness tear then I may put a stitch or two in that to fix that uh you look at the biceps you can pull kind of the biceps into the joint and see a pretty good segment of it and see if it's inflamed torn U something abnormal there and and you can see the tendon of the bicep really well to see obviously is it frayed yes yeah so how much damage do you need to see to do the tendones not not a lot I I if I see a combination of of a modest amount of fraying and a lot of inflammation around it and when I pull it in the joint that extends further out then I'll t and it's interesting I think for people to understand how much your eyes are helpful here right as you said when you look at these images and we'll we'll link to some images in the show notes of what these pictures look like like well we can include my pictures and just other pictures we'll find online it is just a very plain you know benol sort of gray white normal thing and to think that inflammation just shows up is like wow that's really red yeah yeah exactly and for me some people don't like to waste the time but I get a little uh electric Coty wand and I paint the internal and get rid of all that pink because it's inflammatory it hurts that's part of one of the big pain generators so I just do that automatically now theoretically if you fix everything that's going to go away anyway but it helps them I think early posttop uh a recent patient I had U I did a um pretty significant repair on and he after five days said I haven't had any pain what's going on just did you do anything to my shoulder so I said yeah I did repair it but yeah but I think part of it is just getting rid of that inflammation and so forth okay so now contrast that with the pure rotator cuff repair right so um let's do two examples let's talk about a patient who um what is the most common athletes tear which one is it going did we say it's going to be subscapularis or supinatus well so it it depends it depends on if it was if they're an overhead athlete an overhead athlete then it's going to be supinatus almost always okay and sometimes it can be the infraspinatus all right so if a guy just has a straight up supraspinatus tear you don't even need to enter the capsule necessarily depending on how close it is no you do because you want to first of all you you want to make sure that you're not missing anything which is common in the athletes there's a couple of interesting variation I'm going to draw some pictures okay so um here I've drawn uh three sequential axillary views which are a bird's eye view looking straight down on the top of your shoulder if I were sitting on top looking straight down so we got the glenoid the socket here toward the head and we've got the ball out here toward the outside where the deltoid lives and then you I've drawn the this is the superspinatus I've drawn in here on the top in the back as we talked about before that's the infraspinatus and then in the front is the subscapularis so these are the and those are the three the Terry's minor which is the fourth muscle of the rotator cuff it's not really a relevant player in the pathology very true yeah it almost never tears okay um this is actually really a cool way to look at it it's not normal that we usually look at them from front and back but the bird's eye view is what allows you to see how the subscapularis and the infraspinatus are stabilizing the front and the back while the supinatus is coming in over the top yes yes is the supinatus that wide relatively speaking yeah it's pretty wide maybe maybe more more about here here it is uh let I drew it a little wide there okay that's interesting again in in anatomic diagrams because you're looking at it from the front it looks like a tiny little muscle yes but it's broad it has three dimensionality and that's about three roughly three three and a half centimeters of width going front to back yeah wow okay great and so um there's three different views the most common one is the middle one and that's because that's anterior the biceps is here that's an anterior Superior tear that's the one that the overhead athletes get a lot non-throwing athletes but tennis players um volleyball players um and weightlifters um and that is is one of the critical zones where it can get rung out and not have good blood supply and that's where they tear that's where I had my little tears um on both shoulders but that's the garden variety one that's also the one that can be caused by the the the spur pushing down on it and and

[01:37:45] I've drawn a little a little um Arc because that's kind of they'll tear off and then they'll form a little Arc of smooth tissue and you you freshen that up freshen up the bone and then put the sutures in that Leading Edge of the tendon and put it back just like you'd put a tarp with a tent steak back in and that's how you repair it you get it back to the good bony bed and you get that good biologic healing and that's a small tear that I've drawn there and they can be bigger and bigger if you can imagine and more chronic now the one down below shows the subscapularis in the front and that is the one that can tear in young people or older people uh based on mechanism so if you have a linebacker who has he's going forward at full velocity to make and then somebody is knocked into him and shoots him across he's got his arms out there ready to go and he gets eccentrically loaded into external rotation like that that's how you can tear the subscapularis the other way is people falling downstairs and grabbing the banister and wrenching back that way that's the common it's commonly torn with e stretch got it an abnormal weird stretch where they're

[01:38:58] Contracting and then it's just torqued on it now this upper one is very interesting because we were talking about throwing athletes so when you the throwing athletes baseball players and football players they externally rotate dramatically that's how they get their extra angular velocity to really get that that that zip on the ball so they they acquire external rotation starting at a young age age they so their arms are very asymmetric their shoulders one side will externally rotate to 90 the other one will go back another 45 degrees and that's how they get that whip one of the consequences of that in a subset of them is that as this rotates and follows this area around that area the rotator cuff which is at the junction of the infraspinatus and the suus ab buts up against the hard bony rim of the glenoid they get an internal impingement ultimately get small partial thickness or even full thickness tears there so we have to be super cautious with those we have to repair those but you have to be really careful because if they lose 10 or 15 degrees of extra orentation they lose they lose so where does the Tommy John fit into this yeah so that's the elbow that's the elbow but it does no is maybe that was just intuitive because since you are a good orthopedic surgeon is actually it fits in because a lot of people add torque on their elbow because they have shoulder pathology I see so they transfer they gain the external yeah yeah yeah so that's why they end up if they have a little weakness or something going on on their shoulder they will overthrow with their forearm and their flexor pronator

[01:40:40] Mass they'll overthrow with the torque and then they'll tear their medial cladal ligament of their elbow it's crazy but true and vice versa if they have a weak if they have a partially torn U medoc clater ligament that hasn't yet been identified they can overthrow with their shoulder to compensate to get more angular velocity on that because they can't U muster it through the elbow and so yeah so uh how many years ago would it have been the case that a torn rotator cuff was the end of a pitcher's career or a quarterback's career at the professional level great question I would say easily uh not more than 20 years ago probably even not uh 15 years ago probably 15 and today that's not the case no no no what has been the advance that has changed because I can't think of anything that could be possibly more stressful I mean to me throwing a baseball seems even more stressful than throwing a football because you do it more times in the game abut so what has changed that has has made what's changed his earlier diagnosis if people now at certainly at the at the the division one Collegiate level and the professional level there's any pain is evaluate kind of over evaluated but that can be good for them I mean it's you know used a lot of resources but it it identifies these very early so that's one way so you get to them earlier so in other words quarterback pitcher says H you know what it's starting to hurt a little bit you see a very small tear in the cuff you're saying it's better to go in and repair that than let it become a bigger tear yes and no it depends you you'd certainly watch carefully right and you correlate the symptoms with and that's why you know you shut sometimes it's not the tear it's just some inflammation that's related to it if you can cool that down the tear is not biomechanically significant yet so but there I've said this to many people I have full thickness tears in people that are minimally symptomatic and partial thickness tears that are very symptomatic it kind of depends on what you're doing and I think one thing that's kind of missing from this picture in the um Subs and the infraspinatus is how long they are so we're looking at the top but these muscles cover the scapula totally So when you say a full thickness tear you know I want to make sure people understand the size of the tear yes so when I say full thickness I mean like when we were looking on that other view uh let me draw that again oh actually I just go back to the previous so when I've drawn the supinatus tendon that perpendicular distance through there is the thickness the full thickness and it's it varies depending on the size of the the patient but um but it could be across the entire 4 cenm it could be a whole 4 cenm by half a centimeter yes so you could have but when we talk typically about when we speak typically about full thickness we mean the the depth of it this way so that you can have a partial thickness tear that's maybe half the tendon there or full thickness now if you have half the tendon torn you've lost enough biomechanics that if you're a high level throwing athlete no way Y no way um so whereas a partial thickness teir off the tendon yes could easily be ignored correct exactly so um so then and when we talk about the yes those muscle bellies are huge now the reason I you joged my my thinking about that is you can have if you especially if you have these guys who are so strong like the football players and so forth sometimes they have that wrenching injury they don't rip the tendon off the bone but they interstitially tear at the muscular tendous Junction and they have that and they have a tremendous amount of Edema weakness pain but that will heal that will heal without any intervention just some tincture of time and some anti-inflammatory and just time to heal what role do stem cells or PRP play in any of this certainly anecdotally there are a lot of people saying look um you know stem cells aren't going to replace a laam they're not you know they're not going to work there but you have a tear in the muscle stem cells can be valuable now

[01:45:14] I'm not really aware of rcts that have looked at this but I also haven't scoured the literature on the rotator cuff data are there people running clinical trials on on um on on stem cells in that indication so I think so I don't know that literature as well as maybe I should but it's I tend to you know I go to all the meetings and I I stay fairly AB breast there is a obviously a lot of activity going on but there's a lot of terribly designed y studies all around that are being used to justify using whether PRP or stem cells so one has to be careful to to extrapolate it to your individual practice um and there's a lot of money involved in it too I mean I have patients routinely that fly to various places including Germany including and

[01:46:03] I'm not pillaring I'm not by any means because that they exist everywhere I just happened to know a couple that just got back and they pay a lot of money to get stem cells injected for things that we've been talking about and there's no data I'm not talking about the muscular tenderness that's different I want to talk about that but I mean let's say just a guard variety small rotator cuff tear there is no data ever there are some a few anecdotal reports where people sayl there was a tear there on that MRI I injected PRP and it's healed it's gone I don't know what to make of those they're just one-offs well also do we know what the natural history of that injury would have been without the PRP do we know we don't so we don't have enough of a series to say if you took a thousand people that had that tear and you did nothing and came back and surveyed them two years later this many you wouldn't see the tear again do we not know that corre we don't know that okay and and I have um one of my best scientific things that I can relate that it goes down to the Elbow but I think it's important for this part of the conversation is I was speaking right before covid at the aossm the American

[01:47:11] Association of sports medicine these are nonsurgical general medicine doctors who do sports medicine and they're great they're really knowledgeable they do tons of studies and I was speaking uh I was waiting to speak and the two papers presented before me were backtack really well done large numbers over a thousand patients double blind randomized studies comparing for tennis elbow okay tennis elbow lateral epicondilitis comparing cortisone PRP and um

[01:47:46] Placebo and the placebo and the PRP were the same and the cortisone was much more effective these were back-to-back studies different institutions and and it was informative for me because I I've I've read the literature our literature is replete with studies that say oh well you know it you know PRP really helps and I see patients all the time that have had PRP injections based on my current knowledge of the literature for rotator cuff repairs for um um for tendent ruptures for lateral epicondilitis certainly for you know

[01:48:24] Tommy John's and medial

[01:48:53] it's you know a couple hundred dollars for a shot right uh typically the um I mean in my office uh it's that's one of the reasons I don't use it is $1,000 and it's not necessarily covered and people charge a lot more some people charge $2,500 for a PRP injection so until look I'm not saying that it doesn't someday PRP the concept is great is you know it has growth factors it's it's our own yep bodily you know fluids and so it's perfect ly reasonable but it hasn't yet borne out to be a

[01:49:27] GameChanger now if you take someone who's the highest level athlete and they have btis sure Jon PRP in there some stem cells whatever maybe it'll be better who knows there's not really good data on it but there's no downside to doing it the only downside sometimes I see many more flare reactions from PRP injected in tennis Elbo where people are really painful for a couple of weeks and they end up coming to me for either cortis they say I don't want another one of those I don't want another one of those and that's just anecdotal for me I don't have a I don't have a comparative study yeah I I I I and I probably need to spend more time in the literature but

[01:50:05] I really the few times I've kind of looked with some interest usually on at the request of a patient who's kind of going through this um I just haven't found data that are convincing enough even though again mechanistically there's a high plausibility and um but I think the problem is we don't have that Natural History this is this is the problem is there's lots of anecdotes that say this injury was present stem cells were injected the injury is gone radiographically yes the problem is we don't have the contrapositive case we don't uh the best natural history study we have on and this has nothing to do with treatment this is asymptomatic rotator cuff tears um is came out of Wu one of my best friends in Orthopedics kenam maguchi was the lead on that article they looked at ultrasounds which was great because they're non-invasive non-costly and very effective if you have a good ultrasonographer yeah and they looked at the natural history of these asym asymptomatic tears and they found that they obviously documented the percentage of of of asymptomatic tears in the general population but they looked at them longitudinally and they never repaired on their own they at very best a subset of them stayed the same the larger the tear the more likely it was to become even larger with time and become symptomatic and become symptomatic a subset of those became symptomatic yes so and that's it was really well done it got a lot of press so none got better spont spontaneously correct okay so that so that would suggest that if people are saying hey here's my MRI pre and post stem cells and it got better that that would at least suggest that in that individual it might have worked if you had enough and they were done with the same as you know

[01:51:50] MRIs vary significantly from from machine to machine so they would have to be very well controlled yeah you showed if you showed me even 20 patients done by someone that I know is legitimate and they did that and showed comparative MRIs that even 10 out of 20 showed healing reconstitution man I'd be in yeah well I hope that stud is being done

[01:52:15] I I suspect that there were a number of obstacles to it if it's not being done again it's always possible it's being done I'm just unaware of it yeah um but one of them would be you'd have to standardize the process of generating the stem cell one of the challenges of doing a clinical trial is everybody has to get the same drug yes and if the drug differs it it becomes problematic do do you know how standardized the procedure is for capturing and processing stem cells yes non it is that's part differ between the different companies that bring the machines in it differs between the individual clinicians and so forth so yes that's one of the things that my colleagues and I discuss quite a lot is they they're it's not it can be apples and oranges um couple other injuries I want to talk about in the shoulder before we move to the Elbow so the AC separation uh when does it require a repair when does it just get left alone and you're stuck looking with a little bit of deformation yeah that's great uh that's a great question because they're so common the injuries so let me draw a picture okay so we have here a just we've removed the the glenohumeral joint and we just have the AC joint this is the clavicle coming across these are the two stabilizers of the clavicle one is that's the coracoid process and these are the corico clavicular ligaments and we're just looking at that and on which is why it looks like a little nub in circle but of course it runs th it's a thumb that sticks out from that yet another weird part of that scapula it's got to be the weirdest looking bone in the body right and so and then we secondarily we have the acromio ular joint that we were talking about and those are the ligaments that are circumferential around the chromic cicular joint so if you fall hard off your bike um and you sprain your AC joint we call that a type one you sprain your AC joint you stretch a little bit and injure these ligaments and maybe even stretch those a tiny bited but it doesn't look any different on x-ray and that is a great one those can hurt and those can damage the cartilage a little bit and you can get a grade one that persists in being painful but generally they don't they go away um

[01:54:31] I did this recently on some slime out in Dripping Springs riding a a bike out there and just low water crossing just went out like like it was on ice and um and it I that's exactly what I had and it hurt for six weeks and then it was gone it's complet normal um but it was sorry that diagnosis by the way was just pressing right on it that's how you know it well I know it because by pressing right on it it hurt like heck but it didn't bot it didn't move up and down and I could lift my shoulder and I wouldn't I could feel it not moving okay so one of the things that we that that are biomechanically interesting we talked to the residents about when we're teaching is it's not that the clavicle pulls up it's that the shoulder Falls away these is the primary suspension one of the primary suspenders of the shoulder are these two ligamentous structures I see so if you tear them the shoulder kind of Falls away so that's why we treat it by wearing a sling and get that weight of that heavy weight of the arm off now down here we have I have a shadow drawn here's the a here's the clavicle we have one AC chromian which it's sitting up about 30% or so that's where you've clearly torn the AC ligaments and you've partially torn Maybe completely torn but it just didn't distort it too much where you have you know you have a complete tear but it's only up about 30% that's a grade two grade two and that th almost all those can be treated non-operatively occasionally those will again like the ones they can hurt persist you might have to do something later but they're basically stable and and when you treat it non-operatively is the treatment that it will return to its position with elevation some times but usually not usually it stays a little elevated a little proud but people don't really care it's very barely asymmetric okay then you get here where you have a complete it's completely up and we measure that by the distance between the coracoid and the the U clavico I've drawn it here to just Express that that difference there in the height and that is that core cicular distance if it's here if it's up to 30% widening inre inrease in that space then that's the the grade two if it's 100% or more then that's a grade three if it gets up to 100% yep even those there was a good study done a long time uh probably 20 years ago for NFL athletes who had sustained these and the prevailing wisdom for the doctors who were treating the NFL teams was that um most of the type 3es did not need treatment surgical treatment but a subset of them did go on to needing it later now in reality when they're up that high and people want to get back sooner we have met better reconstructive techniques now and so you can kind of get back on the bike and you know if you're a professional cyclist if you fix them you get back on the bike in three or four weeks sort of things so so it's a there there's a gray Zone but the type 3es are that transition now if they are the other four is more than 100% cap yes and and uh and then sometimes it can be trapped behind the scapula and all sorts of other things but the the threes are The Sweet Spot the vast majority of the operative ones are in the three category and I saw a guy the other day and I kind of presented both options to him he's a he's a athlete he's a weightlifter but he's but he's he was I think late 40s and I just gave him the options I said look one of the things you might consider and this applies to a lot I want to do is I said look yeah we can fix this we can fix it tomorrow or next week um but you could also wait and see how you feel in 3 or 4 weeks I can do the same repair in 3 or 4 weeks yeah you don't lose anything you don't lose anything by waiting in that in that realm now you do if you wait three months or six months because you you don't have the same biology going on um and so and he ended up not wanting it because he felt great um and so how far out was he from the injury he was he was four weeks when he started the pain was already gone almost already gone he saw the trajectory being so good that he decided that he wanted to wait and only issue that he's going to struggle with now is the the the asymmetry aesthetically the asymmetry and yes it won't have a functional impairment generally not except if you're doing certain types like if you're heavy flies heavy bench even people who rest you know do the um I don't do squats squatted but you know heavy yeah yeah yeah but a but a high neck high back squat yeah highb Squat and and and those could I I presume that could irritate them and and be problematic so so there is sub and so the repair here is done how yeah so this is where I differ from some a lot of people just get in and get out quickly and they will let me draw it here so if you have it fairly fresh and you have good ligamentous tissue in here then we do what's called a dog bone which is basically two titanium grommets and this heavy polyester suture we drill through everything drill through the clavicle drill through the the uh corid and then pass it's just kind of using some little tricks uh pass the suture up through pull everything down have your assistant pull it down you tie that over and it is Rock Solid Rock Solid and it and they really do well interesting so in other words you you sort of you don't do it by going back to the acroman process right right you go you get the anat you get the you line up the an ligaments to be in continuity again and then they can heal and is that a biodegradable polymer no so that'll stay forever and um so yeah and it's super strong and so you can really I mean you don't you don't let somebody go in a week but but you can depending on what their sport is you can let them get back at maybe three or four weeks certainly six weeks six weeks this thing is pretty strong where you can do most things before we leave the clavicle I only ask about this because I just had a patient that went through it um when the clavicle and the uh media stum separate

[02:00:49] I assume that's not as common no it is not it's way less common but it's it's it can be very problematic I'm going to draw a great picture I think that because you know while you're drawing that I'll explain the situation this was a patient who um God I'm trying to remember what the what caused the injury

[02:01:10] I I wonder if it was a fall a high fall um it might have even been off a horse or something it's possible um but what surprised me me was the patient who was in New York basically called that morning to say look I just saw two surgeons at HSS and they said I need to have surgery right away um and you know I guess it's interesting right there are some things in orthopedic surgery that are um are are in need for an emergent case uh and this turned out to be one it's possible yes yeah this is a a um lordotic view basically of the manubrium sternum which is our breastplate there and our where we can follow our clavicle across to that and we can feel the little Nubs right there at the base we can feel those sternal cicular joints yeah exactly so you can see it's even worse than the shoulder it's a very shallow joint so if you take a hard blow laterally hockey players get slammed up against the glass it's a common more common injury in that the football players the quarterbacks that get tackled by these 300 Pounders and their shoulders are wedged together like that and just so happens that that's what the injury not to this extent but the injury that Quinn yers the quarterback for UT suffer was knocked out in the Alabama game he's now back so he obviously didn't have this full dislocation but that's what can happen in weird circumstances and you that's what you were talking about the mechanics can be that and it happens a little more commonly in kids but it can if the the fall is just right and the mechanics are just right it will open this up tear everything and then displace it behind the manubrium and that's where the the major you know cored artery jugular ve jugular vein lives and that can be a huge huge life-threatening not not life well it could be for sure yeah so we have to be careful with those um but this one where it sublux is out the front those are also a problem you can see that they they there's nothing there's no way it's going to fall back into place there so either they stay out they stabilize and people just don't do that much um to irritate them or they have to be reconstructed and I've had to go in and reconstruct these where I take a a Tenon from the forearm and make a figure of eight across the and basically rebuild those ligaments to hold it back in place and why do you do that as opposed to doing an anchor or something like that yeah it's just stronger you need you need some extra collagen there so what is it about the insult laterally that will determine a separation here versus here these are two weak points at each end of the clavicle much more frequently you're right much more fre frequently here well much more frequently there but that's usually a top down that's usually pitching forward and landing and having it be that way but what happens more commonly than the SC joint the stern clavicular joint is just a clavical fracture which are ubiquitous and that just fractures somewhere you know over there Y and then we fix them some and we don't fix others but and those heal uh but the joint that a weird little joint is very important it's not common but it's not rare so let's talk briefly about a total shoulder replacement I think a lot of people are pretty familiar with a total knee replacement total hip replacement um to me the hip replacement has been one of the Modern Marvels of orthopedic surgery in the last 30 years when I think back to when I was in medical school that was a brutal procedure and today these patients getting total hip replacements I mean they're laughing at everybody else they do them outpatient yeah I mean they outpatient procedure I still don't I have to save that for another discussion I don't understand how that procedure is so easy today yeah um first off what is the indication for the total shoulder replacement uh and then secondly let's talk briefly about you know what is actually being replaced and um what that recovery is like and what limitations exist after the fact that's great um it is a um also an outpatient procedure unless you have comorbidities I do most of these

[02:05:47] Alti and I can even use a smaller picture now because the types of implants we're using now have evolved significantly okay all right so when you've worn down the cartilage completely either on one or both of the surfaces then um that's incompatible with with good function usually because of pain and you ask what is the primary indication it's pain I don't care I see patients all the time who come in who have the ugliest x-rays you've ever seen to your point about the cervical spine which is so important they have no pain and they can do whatever they want to do as you know that the scapula scapula thoracic motion can give us a lot of functions so they're fine and I just occasionally they'll say Hey you know

[02:06:36] I'm going on a trip where I want to be able to play golf for three weeks or two weeks with my you know family may could you give me an injection sure give them a quarter sunshot and they rock on they get three months four months of relief and then they keep going so it's only the very active people who need to be able to do certain things and age is not a factor my oldest patient who I I did shoulder Replacements on quite a long time ago was the um she was 97 and she was spry and healthy walked the streets of Manhattan up and down she actually still worked at 97 I won't say where because I might give it away she was the oldest and longest standing employee of a of a of a famous and she um and after I did that I did them back to back and I'd see her on the street walking down 57th Street and she'd say hey Doc I'm doing great and she was 97 98 99 I lost that point wow so and it would totally changed her life because she couldn't use her arms because they were hurting so much so age is not a factor to your and just to be clear was her arthritis the result of likely a laboral repair that never like what caused so much degeneration in her some people just get it it's no different than you oh so it's not constant subluxations necessarily that are NE at all these you know some people just have I one of my attendings when I was in either med school residen he said yeah it's like a paint job you can have a paint job that's a Mercedes or you have a paint job that's a Ford

[02:08:13] Pinto and I'm not saying anything derogatory to Pinos uh but you know the the the quality of the paint job can what you're born with and um so that's the main thing and that's the main source of garden variety osteoarthritis of the shoulder and then there are the athletes who are separate categories based on what you're wear and tear yeah okay so um and the youngest you've ever done this on the youngest I've ever done a a replacement a full replacement almosts 55 okay yeah I don't I I I'm usually will do a workaround I saw a guy um about 15 years ago who came to me he had he had pretty you could see it visually but it wasn't terrible and he said he was been booked for a replacement I said look you're a little young and he was he was about 48 and I said you're too young for me I I wouldn't I think we should at least give something else a shot I said what I would probably do even though the data is not great it's one of the few things

[02:09:09] I do that I know but I tell them at the outset that you have about a 50% chance of getting better and that's just a scope cleanout we know they have arthritis they don't have instability and just try to clean him out and buy him some more time kick this can as far down the road as possible about 15 years later he came back to me showing me shoulder motion was fine he hadn't his x-rays hadn't Advanced and he came for something else wow so that was an example of what I you know try to do but you can't always affect that but that was just an anecdotal and it's worth doing it's such a minimal operation right no recovery so um and often times if people have body out or osteoarthritis they um they don't they don't need both sides done they're happy with one side they have good one that they can reach over or something like that but an example of sort of a very active to our point about physiology and biologic age and so forth a really wonderful athletic woman who was an avid sailing she sailed in Ras raced U still at the age of about 75 she was still going racing all the time time pulling lanyards Etc and she said I can't do this anymore I just can't do it and I want to keep doing it can I keep doing that and I said sure So I replaced both of her shoulders and how much she separate those two operations by she was about four months apart okay yeah it was kind of more she said I'm going to give up a year of the sailing then I want to get back to it so um you could do them a little closer together if you want um and she uh she's still sailing she's still sa so so let's go over the anatomy here of the replacement obviously there two pieces to it right there's the the humoral side and the glenoid side yeah so um what uh well you know what let me I'm going to draw another picture real fast that will show what a arthritic shoulder looks like and then that'll help yeah I'll dra it small so in the little picture uh to the left I've drawn an arthritic shoulder not well but I've drawn it to make a point so it kind of the head kind of flattens out you have no space in there at all you get a bone spur down here you get some spurring around the perimeter of the glenoid and all of that conspires to greatly diminish the motion of the shoulder and and cause pain so they get two there's two reasons they come dysfunction because they can't do what they desperately want to do whether it's recreational or work sometimes and number two pain uh either one of those is a solid indication for it when the radiographic findings are there and if we do that then what we do is is go go in and now we do these through incision that big you know it's just a very small anterior incision anterior incision and take down part or all or part or most of the subscapularis the tendon in the front we have to have a window in now we can work through the interval the space between the suus and the subscapularis but only if it's a more limited replacement and but anyway you take some of that off you have a window there you have retractors in and you use an oscillating saw and just take that arthritic head off of there like that and all the bone spurs then um with that space that that creates you use another retractor push the head the the shaft and what's left of the shaft what's left of the shaft away and then you get in and work on the glenoid and you ream that down to where it's all smooth get the bone spurs out of the perimeter and then put in this little um high density polyethylene that ultra high molecular weight po exactly very durable I me they do wear out so it's the same thing that's the tibial Plateau exactly exactly the same it's great and then these have little pegs you drill holes you maybe uh usually cement those in just a little bit uh some are press fit but usually cement it in a little bit just that part and it just it it's a perfect nice new Teflon surface for then this Cobalt chromium or whatever uh alloy it is uh for the head and you the you know the bone has a central core and you clean that out get it fixed and this is pressfit we don't cement these anymore unless people have really bad bone or it's Vision just press fit it into that canellis bone and uh and it's super solid the rotator cuff is kept intact the rotator cuff is still intact on top you're working around that reattach the subscapularis in front given if you're going to transect the subscapularis what is the least traumatic place to do it completely within the muscle I'm assuming yeah no no actually on the tendon where it inserts oh you have to because you're reattaching it yeah yeah that makes and uh we leave a sleeve so we can suture tendon to tendon but then we also put this heavy suture into bone so you've got bone reinforcement and you've got tendon attendant healing you also by doing that you maintain the normal length so you get so the only thing I mean this is an oversimplification but the biggest thing this person is missing is a laam yes yeah and they don't really need it um so what stabilizes this joint the fact that it's arthritic it's already stabilized itself unless it's a a weird dislocating joint you which is a different entity and you have to address that differently for the garden variety one they've already kind of stiffened up all the tissues even the so what does their capsule look like when you go in typically thick it's super thick super thick we resect some of it even it's so thick okay it's kind of space occupying almost and and what is this person's in in in a good case yeah what is the limitation on this person a year out from surgery yeah really nothing except heavy weights like I don't want people doing bench press I don't want them doing the you know Iron Cross type things and they're usually not I had one patient can they throw a ball yeah yeah they can throw a ball not they can play catch I'm saying they play catch with their grandkids they can play catch with their grandkids for sure uh they can play tennis they can they can play tennis yeah they can play tennis play golf they shoot a basketball yeah can they swim yes oh yeah oh yeah that's one of the big the big ones people love swimming you know later in life it's such good General exercise and they can swim until they're 100 and um and you can absolutely oh yeah you can swim till the cow's come home here yeah yeah so this is just another one of those game-changing operations right yeah but it's a it's different than the hips and the knees the hips and the knees allow people to live in the world
