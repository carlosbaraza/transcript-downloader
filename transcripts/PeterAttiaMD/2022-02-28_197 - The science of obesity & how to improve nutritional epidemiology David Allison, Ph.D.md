David Allison is an award-winning scientific writer who has been at the forefront of obesity research for the last 20 years. Currently the Dean of the Indiana University School of Public Health, he has also authored many publications on statistical and research methodology and how to improve research rigor and integrity. David’s focus on evidence and data brings forth an interesting discussion of what we know (and don’t know) about the science of obesity. He provides an insightful and unemotional explanation of the potential impact of nutritional epidemiology in public health while also explaining its many pitfalls and limitations. He offers his take on the path forward in addressing the obesity epidemic, and he closes with a lucid explanation for the evident lack of credibility in science and the steps we can take to change that.

[00:00:02] hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast i'm your host peter etia

[00:00:09] hey david great to see you today my pleasure as always peter good to see you been a while since we've seen each other in person i feel like it's probably been i don't know three or four years right easily easily we've spent many an hour on zoom together in the last couple of years but it's been a while since we've been in the same state in the same building in the same room at the same time um now you're no stranger to this podcast in the sense that i feel like you probably listened to podcasts before anybody in fact i think you and near barzillai must hold the record for being the first people to listen to a podcast because you know they come out on mondays and it's barely the early part of the morning and usually you and near are the first two to send me an email with your thoughts so um i know you're a fan and it's it's an it's great to have you on i've been wanting to do this for some time well thank you i really admire the podcast and i admire neil barzillai so to know i'm in league with him is is pretty cool so um you know you're you're one of the most interesting people i know and i always love just spending time with you and talking with you about subjects and um i think one of the things i've always admired about you is um you're you're known for being in a field such as obesity which tends to attract a lot of dogmatic thinking um and yet you tend to approach this field with uh a distant you know sort of lack of emotion right you just come at it very sort of intellectually and i i guess i realize as i'm saying that it speaks disparagingly of people in the field of obesity which is not really what i'm trying to say but um i think for many people the field of obesity is a loaded field scientifically even let alone sort of politically and all the other things that go with it so i've always assumed that that's because your background is slightly different than maybe some of the people who came to obesity through physiology so tell us a little bit about your background what did you study what did you do your phd and that sort of thing sure you know i sometimes will have people say you know why why are you like this or why did you do this why did you choose that and the truth is even as a scientist often say you know following my my friend don rubin who i admire a lot we may be able to figure out what the causal effect of x is but we may not be able to assess whether x cause y so i don't really know why it turned out the way i turned out but even as a kid i was always the kid asking questions sometimes that would interest people sometimes that would annoy people and that's true today but i was one saying are you sure how do you know where did that come from what makes you think that's true and then of course my kids fed it back to me as they were growing up and heard me say it and when i would say to them don't do that you'll get hurt they'd say what's your evidence for that dad so you know i went to college and i started out knowing i wanted to be a psychologist but what that meant to me at the time was hitchcock films right i was going to interpret people's dreams and i would figure out what the meaning of the clock and the dream was or something like that and then the person would be cured and it would be a great movie and then as i got to college i started to think about well what's the evidence for these things and that sort of opens up this whole can of worms about asking about evidence i became more and more cognitive behaviorally oriented still thought i wanted to be a clinician got to graduate school and i asked a professor at one point as we're being trained in graduate school phd program to administer iq tests and we're learning these different theories of intelligence some people think there's one factor some people think three one person thought 144 and i said who's right and the professor says well they bring their different evidence to bear and they argue i said well what's the evidence he said these factor analyses i don't really know what that is what's a factor now so she says well you have to go go study multivariate statistics if you want to understand that so i don't like to take anybody's word for anything so i went and studied multivariate statistics and became more and more involved with statistical analysis to the point where eventually later in my career people started thinking i was a statistician and i stopped fighting it i said okay the american statistical association thinks so and the university thinks so and the nih and nsf think so i think so too and so that's great so i sort of became by evolution a statistician having been trained as a psychologist but i think all of that comes down to evidence and all of it thinking that people are no different than anything else body fat is no different than any other variable and that still has to obey the same laws of probability and physics and mathematics and so on that we apply to anything else and i think we often forget that you know people talk and so folks who study people think about the words that people say whereas if you're studying atoms and molecules you don't think about the words they say you just apply scientific methods the same person who would never question a diabetologist on what the beta cell of a pancreas is doing unless they themselves are a diabetologist studying the beta cells of the pancreas will say to an obesity researcher well this is how obesity works and it's this aspect of food or that aspect of culture or that aspect of child rearing based only on the fact that they were children or had children and had some experience and so to me it's just taking a step back and just treating as my old boss in biostatistics used to say whether it's x's and y's they're just variables and applying the same laws of thinking to all those systems so when was it either post phd or during phd that you were drawn to obesity in particular as a clinical field you know i actually start as an undergraduate and so uh it was is i think was a sophomore and i took a class at vassar college and i should say that all my remarks today just reflect my own opinions i'm not speaking for indiana university or vassar college or anybody else just myself and i took a class at vassar college on human emotion and motivation and we studied the theories of stanley schachter who at the time was a professor of psychology at columbia university he's since deceased an amazing brilliant man who wrote a book called emotion obesity and crime and he talked about the connections among these and how the distinction between our cognitive state and our physiologic arousal state might lead us to certain kinds of behaviors including for in the case of some people eating more calories than they might otherwise eat and his experiments were so creative i just loved it and he would put like a clock on the wall and he would have the clock move a little faster that but not perceptibly faster and then he would bring some students in and give them some work to do under some ruse and then the clock would say for some of the students at 11 am that it was noon and he'd say by the way i have a big a big tray of roast beef sandwiches out here so you know whenever you're hungry for lunch just let me know and you can have some sandwiches and for some people the clock wouldn't say it was noon until 1 pm and for some people would say it was noon at noon and he'd say who would be following the clock and who would be following the actual time and obese or overweight persons were more likely to follow the clock and this became the external theory and then it couldn't always work out they'd have another experiment say well it only holds up under this circumstance and it was incredibly creative how he'd keep looping through and so i just got hooked on it and then we had left to write lots and lots of papers at faster college i got a great education in writing and thinking there not so many tests lots of papers and so when i would take physiologic psychology i would write about the physiologic psychology of obesity and when i took behavioral psychology or behavioral to developmental i'd write about developmental aspects of obesity and i loved the fact that you not only could but in my opinion had to look at obesity from so many of those different angles that no one thing was going to do it everybody's got their pet thing this this nutrient is toxic it's this food marketing practice it's this cultural practice it's exercise it's not exercise i think there are many factors involved and i enjoyed studying it and still do from many angles now this is happening in the late 80s correct when you're in school right finishing your phd mid to late 80s right and um at the time what was the um both political and medical view of obesity was it the i don't think it was the same issue it was today was it what obesity rates weren't particularly high in the 80s or were they i don't i don't really recall they weren't as high as they are now and there was there had been steady increases if you go back and look at data from at least the 1700s forward there have been relatively steady increases in obesity rates in westernized industrialized countries since then but there seemed to be this wake up moment in the late night in the early 90s with the nhanes iii and so at that point we didn't have the nhanes which is the national health and nutrition examination survey which annually does today a survey of a representative sample of americans with measured heights and weights that's how we track obesity levels at that point it was only done every few years and so there was this big gap in years between nhanes two and then haines three so in haines two it happened i think in the early eighties uh or mid eighties and obesity rates were climbing but not dramatically and so obesity was an issue but it wasn't on top of everybody's mind especially for kids pharmaceuticals were still seen as the realm of charlatans at that point if you were a doc and you proposed uh proported the use of obesity medications you were called a diet doc and that was like a very bad stigma there weren't many good medications available surgery was still looked at as a very peculiar thing for very extreme cases and even many medical professionals disdained it um and then something happened in the very early 1990s which is dan haynes day that needs three data came out and what you saw was this big jump in obesity levels and that got everybody's attention and words like epidemic started to be used especially around childhood and the public health policy and environmental perspective came in and things started to shift in the mid 90s and that was when you had people like kelly brownell probably one of the most forceful voices at the time who was a sort of old school university of pennsylvania colleague of tom wadden devotee a student of mickey stunkard of this of the cognitive behavioral individual clinical treatment approach to obesity suddenly starting to say maybe we've got it wrong maybe it's this environment i don't know if kelly coined the term toxic environment but he certainly he either coined it or popularized it and people started to think about prevention and children and the overall environment the political economic social food marketing environment we lived in and it all started to take off and ideas from the cigarette world the same public health people who had been battling cigarette companies and tobacco for decades many of they and their tools came in and said we know how to deal with things that are environmental social political problems and it began to be seen as an environmental social political problem and in some way a lot was gained because we got a lot more funding for it we lot more attention a lot more efforts a lot more research but in some ways it was lost in the early 90s when i kind of grew up in the field i grew up in the first federally funded obesity research center which is the new york obesity research center for a long time the only one and by gosh if if as a young postdoc i were to say something that didn't quite jibe with physiology or genetics or anatomy or clinical medicine there was a physiologist and a geneticist and an anatomist and a medical doctor who would say uh-uh and they knew all they knew each other they knew the arguments they knew the literature for the last 20 years then the public health people came in fresh without kind of knowing so much so on the one hand it launched things up a lot which was great but on the other hand back to what you were saying earlier about the dilution of the of the rigor of the field intellectually it became a lot more of opinion a lot more of advocacy in the absence of rigorous evidence showing what worked just saying this seems like it ought to work so david prior to nhanes three um and prior to kelly and others saying hey we should look for something else what was believed to be the uh environmental or otherwise trigger for obesity in other words what was viewed as the cause yeah i don't know that there was a single cause i mean clearly what some people today call the energy balance model which we can go back to and ask whether that really is even a model in some realistic sense um i think was then and still is today by most people in the field accept it as valid but maybe not as a model maybe as a description of what occurs yeah i was going to say that's sort of a tautology and doesn't really tell us anything it's it's implied and obvious and not explanatory right i think i think not explanatory is maybe the best way of describing it in some sense uh the analogy i would use to that is i think the energy balance statement i won't say model say the energy balance statement is as long as you accept the laws of thermodynamics unequivocally correct in the same sense as if you accept euclidean geometry the statements about the relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse of a triangle are unequivocally correct but if i say to you i have a triangle of this size with legs of length a and b and i proportionately imagine another triangle that has legs greater than length a and b it doesn't cause the hypotenuse to be bigger it means the hypotenuse is bigger and if i say i imagine one with a bigger hypotenuse it doesn't cause the legs to be bigger it means the legs are bigger and any question about whether the legs cause the hypotenuse or the hypotenuse cause the legs is nonsense they don't cause each other they're inherent in the definition of triangle just as inherent in the definition of energy uh is the law of conservation and it just says delta energy stores minus equals delta energy n minus delta energy out it's just a statement um so what's the belief though that this was behavioral uh prior to nhanes three was the belief that well if a person is overweight or obese they are they're just eating more than they're expending because of a choice i think there was it's almost hard to answer that because i think the thinking was and still remains so sloppy that people don't even distinguish among things well i was just invited to a panel literally today that i'm going to be on in a few months where somebody said we're going to contrast for obesity the relative influence of biology versus behavior as though we could behave without biology i mean i don't know about you but i'm not a disembodied soul and if you're a disembodied soul maybe but for the rest of us who you know are in the material world you behave with a body and it it's got to obey the same laws of physics and so on that any other body has to behave so i think there's a lot of sloppy thinking um but i think if you really drill down and you got to smart people who understood they would say of course their genetic component any rancher could have told you a hundred or more years ago that there's a genetic but we can selectively breed animals for being thinner or fatter that shows you there's a genetic component there are many other things that show you that that's probably the strongest prime of facial evidence you can selectively breed animals to be fatter or leaner prima facie evidence but by the way is the concordance of identical twins separated at birth i've always found that to be one of the most interesting ways to assess everything from you know autism to schizophrenia like it's really a beautiful natural experiment but i don't know what the concordance is with respect to obesity and identical twins separated do you yeah there are a lot of different ways to to quantify that and we've written a couple of papers on it but i think the easiest way is just the pearson product moment correlation coefficient the ordinary correlation coefficient of bmi of twin to twin and it turns out that for monozygotic or identical twins separated at or near it lie after birth they uh it's nearly the same magnitude as it is for twins reared together which is about 0.9 ish various varies from study to study so it's very similar and so it's probably now of course you can argue well that also takes could it take them to contribute an environment maybe some epigenetic things but bottom line is whatever those things are they're not um they're not just the child rearing of the home it looks like for many traits including obesity the child rearing of the home does have an influence but it's not a huge influence that's an incredible degree of concordance it sure is when was that realized when were those studies first done well it's interesting because you can go back to quite some period of time to find the hints of those studies and often when you look at science it's often that we at some level we kind of knew something the information was sort of there but there was this moment where a key figure had to come in and both see it and say it with a degree of crispness that wasn't there before as i said so lots of people could have seen the ranching data in the mouse data and family did in 1923 davenport who you know he's kind of looked at now probably as a racist you know from the past but at the time davenport published under the carnegie foundation these these studies of concordance of families and you could have seen the genetic component in his 1923 data but it was albert j mickey stunkard who was someone i had the great privilege of knowing and a wonderful wonderful man and mickey did the first major high quality twin and adoption studies and he did what he was great at he got on a plane and he went around the world and he met bright young interesting people and he said you have resources and you have ideas and you have data and you're smart can i work with you can we work on this together and he got tork sorensen and other people to start working on twin studies with the great nordic data sweden denmark and so on and adoption studies and it was the twin and adoption studies coming out of sweden and denmark that i think really nailed it that finally in new england journal of medicine with mickey stunkard behind it with clear writing with high quality data people said we got it there's a big genetic component and this was approximately what year david this would have been 83-ish plus or minus a couple so again trying to bring this back to kind of the clinical side of things so if by the early 80s it's or it should be patently clear that genetics are playing an important role it would be at least a decade before people would say well pharmacologic therapy might make sense here just as for example if somebody is genetically more likely to have hypothyroidism right a very relatively straightforward endocrinology uh or endocrine system to understand we wouldn't really think twice about replacing or uh you know abgregating thyroid hormone as necessary so where was that disconnect where it's the early 80s and we realized there's a very strong genetic component to this we probably have some medical tools that we could use but it still seems like that wasn't being done so what what was being done were was it just a case of counseling people to eat less and exercise more it was mostly developing the tools that would help people reduce energy intake and i think today that's still most of what we do so even surgery and drugs mostly but not only help people reduce energy intake we know that reducing energy intake works it's just really hard to do and telling people to do it and saying i'll try to do it is not all that effective and so all these things were tools and we use the tools of behavior therapy starting in i would say really the 60s is probably where the the formal behavioral stuff really kicked in with i think was stewart um and and the behavioral thinking about obesity and then it continued to get better and better all the way through present still continues to get better and better but my sense is that you know we've been asymptotic for a long time that is we're getting incrementally better not meaningfully better with many of the behavioral cognitive things what happened then in the early 90s is and i remember because i was a postdoc at the new york obesity research center at the time is a few people started to really kick in with pharmaceuticals and they started to come out of this idea that you're a diet doc and it's a bad thing and fenfen which now we know was dangerous and is gone at least one of the fans in fenfen um that came up and that caught people's attention tell folks a little bit about fenfen many people listening probably won't be familiar with what it is how it worked and what the unfortunate consequence it was in a small but non-trivial subset of people so fenfan was is an a nickname for two drugs used in combination phentermine and fenfloramine phentermine is a drug that was and still is approved by the fda for the treatment of obesity though it's never been approved for long term so it goes back a long way it's it's a catecholaminergic agonist it's a relatively safe drug though not a no drug is perfectly safe and it's modestly effective fenfluramine is a selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitor which i think originally was used for depression and people realize sometimes those drugs those ssris cause weight loss somebody realized you could put those two together and seem to get better results so that became a big craze and there were many unscrupulous medical providers who did provide that in ways they shouldn't have but there were many scrupulous medical providers who used it carefully and thoughtfully and it did seem to have much better benefit than other people had predicted before that and so suddenly pharmaceutical treatment was no longer the realm of drive-through pill mills and charlatans and diet docs and rainbow pills and so on it was starting to be credible you had people like george bray who's still around today and working on obesity jumping on board and starting to really think through all the the cornucopia of pharmaceuticals we knew about and which ones might be useful others weighing in and then a very smart young person whose name i no longer recall but who was a pathologist not an obesity researcher as far as i know at the mayo clinic started noticing some people coming through as cadavers and she was being asked to do autopsies and did autopsies and started noticing a peculiar valvulopathy that she didn't see very often and she started seeing a little run of cases and then noticed that all of these cases had been on fenvent and reported it and then many many other people started to investigate it and very quickly people realized in fact this did produce a certain valvulopathy and further investigation made it clear it was the fenfloramine component not the phentermine component that did that so the fenfloramine was withdrawn phentermine is still used today but i think what was terrible of course is that one of the many drugs in the history of obesity that hurt people but what was good about it is that it really started getting people thinking more about obesity as a serious medical disorder that merited serious attention from credible physicians incredible scientists working at the molecular pharmaceutical and uh physiologic level and how much of fenfen's mechanism was understood i mean i mean obviously at the superficial level it was but in terms of its direct action was the belief that one component was simply increasing energy expenditure while the other was reducing appetite i don't think it was quite that simple and i don't think with any of these things we ever fully know the components this is where you know far more than i but i mean even in the case of statins which we think so highly of and used so well you know whether they really have their beneficial effects by reducing ldl cholesterol which is sort of the initial thought or through other mechanisms i think is even being debated now i think we we suspected and still would believe that they reduced appetite and therefore helped people control their food intake better that the two things did it through slightly different uh mechanisms one being more serotonergic one being more adrenergic they may have also had effects on energy expenditure albeit probably modest ones and that was probably more the phentermine than the phenfloramine in terms of the mechanism for the valvulopathy i'll have to leave that to you that's that's out of my realm and when was friend fun told was that the mid to late 90s i think it was the late 90s but i don't remember the exact day probably 97 ish somewhere around there what about the gastric bypass and other surgical approaches now we have sleeves uh roo and y all sorts of different approaches to it but um when did that sort of go from being presumably incredibly fringe to you know quite frankly where we are today where this is something that will be covered by an insurance company if the bmi is high enough i don't know that there was a single moment but i i so i think there's been a sort of a relatively steady march but i do think there was one key step that was kind of a step function in the credibility of it and that was the swedish obese subject study uh as from uh laura schiostrum in sweden and surgery had been around for a while um interestingly even among physicians and scientists it was very controversial and still is some people think it's barbaric some people think it's abhorrent again i think you just have to take the data as it is say you can you might say wouldn't it be better if we had a world where no one needed surgery where our solution to obesity was not let children start to gain weight and then when they become massively obese adults give them surgery and rearrange their internal anatomy and say yeah probably would be better but that's not the world we live in we live in this world and in this world that's the most effective life-saving life-changing treatment we have and it's a good one and so what happened is many physicians would battle among each other i remember john crawl who since passed on a very good surgeon one of another physician colleague chastising him over dinner at a conference and saying when you're done with a patient dr carl they will never eat normally again and he said no when i'm done they will never eat abnormally again so there were these real vitriolic battles i think what happened is the surgeries of course got better and better and better as everything else people learned how to do things better mortality rates went way down efficacy went up but what lars schostrom did is he said i want to look at whether this prolongs life and i remember him telling me many decades ago that his senior mentor per bjorn torp who was known for fat cell theories and and the the apple versus pear idea whereas originally jean vogg was apple versus pear from the from france in the 1950s but then in the 80s really 70s and 80s bjorn torp was one of the big people who picked it up bjorn torp laughed at his mentoring he says lars everybody knows this everybody knows that surgery will cause weight loss and help people live longer there's no point in doing the study and lars said you may be right that it does but we have to do the study because everybody doesn't accept and believe that hasn't been shown and we i think we know over and over again you've got to do the experiment as john hunter famously said to edward jenner when jenner says i think and he's thinking about the first vaccine and hunter comes back and says why think do the experiment you've got to do the experiment and show it so seoulstream didn't do a pure experiment it's not a randomized trial but it's a controlled trial and the the irb at the time didn't think it was ethical to randomly assign people to the surgery or not so if they're willing to get surgery he would find a closely matched control and give them usual care and then what he showed well more than a decade later in the new england journal of medicine is that the surgery reduced mortality rate it reduced obesity very powerful effects clearly a life-saving and a beneficially life-changing treatment i think that was probably the big jump and then since then many other trials some randomized have been done showing positive benefits on many things including longevity do you recall what the risk reduction was in all cause mortality in that study i don't recall in that study per se but when you look across studies it varies quite a bit from study to study there's a lot of heterogeneity but it's it's usually well on the order of a 50 reduction sometimes a little bit more and maybe getting two in the weeds on this but does that how does that change when you do and do not correct for the presence of type 2 diabetes at the outset in other words i would imagine that that's a combination of people who had and did not have type 2 diabetes and do you have a sense of what the differences are amongst those those two cohorts your your premise is correct that it is among people who do and don't have type 2 diabetes but no i don't know if the top of my head i share your intuition that it's probably stronger among people who do and we we need to also look at um many different factors so for example in the swedish obese subject study and i'm not sure this would hold up at all one of the things that was very puzzling and surprising at least to me was that although diabetes really came down and stayed down very well even if weight came back up a little which it did on average hypertension came down very well but did not stay down very well it would come back up and why that is is it damage to the endothelial elasticity that's not really repairable and so you get a short-term effect of negative energy balance that's not sustained i don't know but it it goes back to that john hunter thing you've got to do the experiment and so we we can't make our priority assumptions about the effects of treatments we've got to do the experimental look at the effects of treatment it's interesting that hypertension would return and yet mortality would still improve which suggests that perhaps the benefits of improved insulin sensitivity which do persevere play a greater role in mortality than body weight which does not surprise me but also hypertension which is somewhat surprising given how causally related hypertension is atherosclerosis well it may not be a greater role as much as an additional role right so it could be that if you got the hypertension down you'd get an even bigger reduction so when did this idea of kind of an obesity paradox which i know you've written about when did that start to become observed i think the that phrase obesity paradox has never been really crisply defined and whether it really is something that's a paradoxes not clear people use it to mean at least two different things one thing is that there's this so-called u-shaped curve more accurately concave upward there's a bathtub shaped curve if you imagine a cartesian or xy plot in which the y or ordinate is mortality rate or some function of it and the x is bmi or relative body weight or something so one is that it is u-shaped that it's not monotonic increasing and so people at the very thin end also die earlier than people in the middle just as people at the very heavy end die earlier than people in the middle the duchess of windsor has supposedly said you can never be too rich or too thin and she may have been right on the rich part i don't know haven't gotten there yet but apparently not on the too thin part now we can argue whether it's causal and there are lots of arguments about whether it's causal but that's one thing it's the idea that thinner people than sort of intermediate levels of bmi also die earlier that's one part the other part is that even though obesity is associated with increased mortality rate or decreased longevity that when you look at people who are sick or injured they often live the longest so somebody comes in with kidney failure or someone comes in after a major injury or a major infection they're in the hospital it's often the heaviest people that live longer and that started to be talked about 10 15 years ago maybe it's very difficult to disentangle cause and effect we can observe lots of associations but it's just hard to know what to make of all of these associations and what's causal there's so many as the philosophers say the data are the hypotheses are underdetermined by the data there are multiple hypotheses that are consistent with the data that's why the randomized experiment allows us to do things that otherwise we can't do it sort of eliminates more competing hypotheses so i don't think we know what's causal yet we've thrown out a model uh a man named doug childress and childers and i was a postdoc was a good mathematician working with me in which we said what if obesity makes it more likely that you get a major illness or injury so it's not good for your health in that sense age of course also makes it more likely that you get a major illness or injury but once you get a major illness or injury being heavier more obese may reduce your risk of dying from it and an analogy i use is this suppose you and i are sort of going for a hike on the edge of the grand canyon and we go to some outfitter who's setting us up and he says you know to you you're about 10 years younger than me i think and he says to you um you have a choice i can give you this fat suit you can wear has lots of padding on it if you fall off the cliff it makes it much more likely you'll survive but it makes you a little clumsy so it makes you more likely to fall off the cliff you might say i've got good balance and good eyesight and i'm young and strong and no comes to me and i say i'm not quite as young and strong maybe i don't know comes to me somebody 10 years older than me that person says i'm really struggling with my eyesight or balance or strength i'll take the fat suit right and so whether the fat suit is good for you may depend upon your probability of falling to begin with and under that mathematical model we can show in fact that the point of bmi the nader of that bathtub shape concave upward curve should keep moving to the right as you age which is exactly what it does so we can we we have a model that's consistent with the data but the data don't prove our model there are other models that would be consistent with it let's give people an idea of what those numbers look like so just for someone listening to this maybe i'm not even watching it can be hard to imagine what we're talking about right but a u-shaped curve that at its at its nader is giving you the optimal bmi this would be the lowest mortality and what you're saying is rather than just plot one of these curves for everybody let's plot them by decade so what does the u-shaped curve look like for people in their 20s in their 30s 40s 50s 60s up to their 90s and what you're saying is if your hypothesis is correct one place you would expect to see that is that these curves would not only not look the same by decade but they would move rightward meaning the nader is getting to a heavier and heavier bmi can you give me a sense of how much movement there is by decade yeah in fact i'm gonna i'm going to smooth over things so the story i'm about to tell you is not perfectly true but it's sort of a roughly true and it sort of conveys the sort of nice element of this the average american might gain about a pound a year for an average height american about six or so pounds might be a bmi unit right if you gained about six pounds you might gain about a bmi unit and so that might mean that over six years you'd be about one bmi unit heavier and that's not too far off from how the nader moves it's almost as though your weight is increasing to keep you on at the nader which is an interesting speculation and um if you looked at people who are maybe 20 years old that nader might not be too far from 20 in some populations uh an astute reader of the epidemiologic literature who's listening now might appropriately be saying hey wait a minute now allison needs to make distinctions and by age race and sex he's doing age he's not doing race and sex and other factors and they'd be right we can come back to that if you wish but putting that aside for the moment very loosely speaking you might say that nader might be far down near 20 when you're 20. and by the time you're 80 it's not to 80 but by the time you're 80 it might be well above 30. might be in the low 30s where that that nader is which is we generally say 30 is the beginning of obesity and and for those who are not used to bmis i used to sort of lay it out like this the supermodel kate moss at least from a few decades ago when she was the top model had a bmi i think in 16 to 17 range we say that about 18.5 is sort of the beginning of normal weight we think less than that is underweight my bmi right now is probably 21ish bill clinton's you know at the height of his presidency since last week was probably 27 28 we say 30 is where obesity begins and a secretory sumo wrestler top class sumo wrestler about 43 44. so that gives you a sense of what those bmis are and so it's really 30 32 where you see people 70 80 and above having that lowest uh mortality rate is there a risk that we're looking at confounders here i don't know if this would be a confounder it wouldn't seem like it would be a confounder in this year meaning in this this time and place we're in but would it be a confounder for affluence for example as as it may have been hundreds of years ago um you know other things like that um and the other thing about bmi is you know when you look at other data that look at body composition do we see the same thing hold up so you can have a bmi of 30 and not even though you're obese by bmi no one would look at you and say you're obese you might have a body fat of 15 which is pretty low um and be you know incredibly muscular for example so how how do we reconcile one the potential confounders of that type of an analysis with sort of this other in this this other next layer of granularity in the data that look at adiposity versus lean mass let's start with the confounding question now let's get to the body composition course the confounding question is a nightmare this is the challenge of observational research in general and there's no simple solutions to it other than in my opinion trying to triangulate on the answer with multiple studies right what we really want is the pure randomized experiment in humans in large samples with perfect compliance for many years and we want to randomly assign people to be obese who are not obese obviously we can't do that so what do we do well we look at observational epidemiology we look at randomized trials where we have people lose weight we look at non-randomized trials like show strums with surgery we look at mouse studies you know we look at all these different things we try to just put the puzzle together as best we can but there's absolutely a lot of possibility for confounding cigarette smoking was one of the early ones very famous paper by joanne manson and colleagues published in new england journal excuse me in jama pointing out that the quote right way according to them to analyze bmi and mortality data was you must exclude ever smokers you only look at never smokers otherwise you may have confounding by smoking smoking makes you thinner smoking kills you earlier you got to take care of that you've got to throw out the subjects who die early because subjects who die early may have been sick sickness makes you thinner sickness makes you die earlier there's a confounder we've since proved mathematically that that's not a good thing to do um but for a long time it was believed is that even true david on the low end because that does strike me as one of the most obvious explanations for the uptick in mortality at very low bmis is all of the you know the liver disease the kidney disease the types of chronic diseases that actually do lead to muscle wasting and things like that are you also including them in your analysis so yes we are what we showed is not that that confounding doesn't occur that confounding absolutely can occur or we we agree that it can occur we speculate we think it's likely what we've shown is that throwing out subjects who die early in the analysis doesn't help or doesn't reliably help it was very interesting back to sort of the discussion of you know the field when i when i went to analyze my first bmi mortality data set i had no training in this so i get a data set and i'm about to try it i don't know what i'm doing so i call up my friends and i say i read this paper in german it says you have to eliminate the early deaths but i'm how do i do that do i how do i pick how many years to do you know exactly how does this work and it was interesting because when i would call the epidemiologists and i would say how does this work and then i'd say by the way is there a reference that explains and proves that this works they'd say no it's obvious that it works i said well it's just it's not obvious to me and they said well maybe you're not smart enough to be an epidemiologist oh okay you know those words were actually uttered uh jokingly but yeah then then i would call my friends with statisticians and i would say you know there's this paper and says you have to eliminate the early deaths they would laugh at me like what that's the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard we don't just throw out data and think it makes things better you've got to have a model that that you know you fit things to so we then got a small grant from the cdc and we looked at mathematical proofs computer simulations and meta-analyses and the mathematical proofs showed it not only didn't have to help reduce the confounding it could make it worse simulation showed the same thing in realistic data scenarios and then the meta-analyses show that on average didn't make much difference at all so throwing out the subjects who die early basically just reduces your power in most practical situations then they would say you've got to not control for the intermediary variables like the diabetes and hypertension that's probably true we i think i would agree with that later in subsequent paper in 1995 in new england journal of medicine that same group said you've got to throw out the subjects who have more weight variability right all the things they said in 1987 weren't enough to flatten out that left end of the u-shaped curve so they said throw out the subjects who die excuse me who have a lot of weight fluctuation and that didn't completely get rid of it but got rid of most of it that's the bigger one but what it means is unclear catherine fleigle has written very well on this and talked about these different things and how much you're throwing away and pointing out to yes these are the patterns we observe but what they mean causally is unclear so that's the whole confounding issue the bottom line is it's likely that there's confounding by cigarette smoking and socioeconomic status and stigma that's one of the big things right how much does obesity kill you because it stigmatizes you and it creates some stress it could be and that may be by the way why the the bmi associated with the lowest mortality has been increasing over calendar time it's not just with age of individuals but if you compare data collected in the 1970s data collected in the 1990s obesity doesn't from an association point of view look quite as bad in the 1990s as it did in the 1970s and that's true in denmark and that's true in the u.s and it's true in meta-analysis although again not for every age race sex group why is that and maybe it's stigma maybe it's that if you were you know if you think about you watch like the three stooges those old tv shows and and there was curly and he was often you know mocked as the fat guy right by today's standards he's not that big and so what stigmatized changes over time as different bmis become normative and so it may be that that's partially accounting for it so there's lots of potential confounding going on there but there's lots of other possible explanations so bottom line we don't know and the real important question then is what's the effect of intervention this goes back to my friend and someone i really idolize in the field one of the clearest thinkers don rubin statistician at harvard talks you know the reuben causal model and he's always asking what's the intervention if you say does this cause that what do you mean compared to what it's always got to be compared to what right and so if you say weight loss is going to increase longevity that's the question well how are you going to achieve that what are you going to do to get that well then if it's surgery then what's the effect of surgery it's a glp-1 agonist what's the effect of a glp-1 agonist etc so that i think is the key question and i think what we're starting to see is some of those things do prolong life surgery sglt2 inhibitors glp1 agonist and so forth now to your other question about body composition many people like to point out that bmi is a measure of mass divided by stature it was developed by adolf kate lay who was a belgian astronomer epidemiologist statistician mathematician back in the 19th century brilliant guy um we actually named a professorship after him and i held that title i was very grateful for that opportunity back when i was at the university of alabama at birmingham before i came to iu and caitlyn made it you would think that bmi that is or rather the mass of a three-dimensional object ought to increase in proportion to the cube of a linear dimension and if in fact we were spheres of uniform density that would be true but i don't know about you i'm not a sphere of uniform density so it turns out not to work that way exactly turns out that empirically it works closer to the square for adult humans kate lay realized that and so he said take mass or weight over stature squared the square of stature that's then it was called kate lays index now we call it bmi it was sort of rediscovered in the 60s or 70s by ansel keys and term bmi body mass index and every few years some smart person likes to come along says it should be cubed yeah we get it we we knew that like a couple hundred years ago and we worked that out then they say and it doesn't really take into account body composition we say we we know that and they say the nba center would have a bmi greater than 30 and yet look how strong and fit that nba center is we go right if the nba center comes to your clinical practice don't measure his bmi and diagnose him with obesity on that and what physician in his or her right mind would do such a thing so clearly we get that bmi is a useful tool for epidemiologic research and some simple physiologic research and some simple clinical trials it's not a perfect clinical tool for the average person it works okay now do we have to be worried about different ethnicities obviously the two that come to mind would be asian and east asians because you know again i think most people are kind of familiar with this idea of skinny fat right so you have someone of east asian descent whose bmi is 26 which by all intents sounds just wonderful but they have metabolic syndrome right there's nothing about this person that's healthy right every metric across the board tons of visceral fat um very little muscle mass etc and that's a different phenotype right that's a slightly different phenotype than perhaps the model was built on so do how much is the metric that we use for bmi you know 20 to 25 being perfect 25 to 30 being overweight 30 to whatever it is 40 being obese and then morbidly obese kicks in at some point i'm sure um is that validated on other ethnicities as well yes and no so so with a few exceptions the idea that there is a curve and that it's a generally concave up curve yes although again there are exceptions um but the shape of that curve is not the same in every age race and sex group it does seem that the right side the part where you're getting too high in bmi and risk is going up seems to occur a lot earlier among people of middle eastern and east asian descent and so that's a very simple model you know it's just sort of says oh it's all a curve for everybody a slightly more complicated model says well we know some of the other factors that come in like how much of your fat is subcutaneous versus how much is visceral and it's just that that group has more visceral fat than that group for any given body mass index and therefore it adjusts the curves and there's probably some truth to that but it's probably even more than that so for example a lot of these statements we hear and this goes back to way back when i said way at vassar college i loved the complexity of it that you had to look at from obesity from so many different angles and that's still true the narratives we have about obesity including about ethnicity obesity are grossly oversimplified so we often hear obesity selectively a disease of the poor and uneducated that often in this country it stated minority status leads to less income less education which in turn leads to poorer access to health care poorer habits poorer living environments which leads to poorer health and reduced longevity and there's probably some truth to that but it's not one-to-one it's not simple so for example when we hear that there's this inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and obesity which we hear over and over again first shown by mickey stunkard again in the in the 1950s in the midtown manhattan project that's true in white women it's reliably true in adult white women when you go outside the group of adult white women not always true if you go to african american women virtually no association between socioeconomic status and obesity when you go to african-american men and you look at their obesity levels they're very similar to the obesity levels of european american men white american men but if you look at african-american women's obesity levels and you compare it to european or white american women much higher if you bring hispanic americans in both men and women have higher levels of obesity than do american men and women so now you you have an ethnicity difference but not a gender by ethnicity difference whereas an african-american you have a gender by ethnicity difference when you look at mortality the african-american curves follow similarly but not identically to the european american curves but in our research we can't find an association between bmi and longevity in hispanic americans well just say that again that's pretty interesting and that's across all bmis we've been unable to find it now you know the data sets we have are not perfect the follow-ups may not be long enough the sample sizes may not be big enough you know you can always question things uh i don't say it's causal i'm just saying this is what we observed a few years ago when we got every data set that was publicly available that we could get our hands on that involved hispanic americans and bmi and longevity and we analyzed them all together with common methods as carefully and thoroughly as we could we could not find an association between bmi elevated bmi mortality as someone who sits on the opposite end of the spectrum right where i don't at all concern myself with public health i don't i'm not trying to make grand observations about what's happening in society across ethnicities or anything like that i'm i really just have the luxury of looking at one person at a time and trying to make a determination about the best course of action um you know my view of bmi is generally quite negative right it's that it's the it's the maybe the least bad tool available to get massive data sets and make broad assessments of what's happening at the population level but to your point earlier at the individual level it offers very little insight relative to other tools um you know when we have patients do dexa scans uh i tell them that you know we're going to get four important pieces of information out of this but one of them's really the least important to me which is your subcutaneous fat that's the first thing people want to look at when they have a dexa scan they want to see what's their percentage of body fat and they say but there's three things that are much more important to us right one is your visceral fat one is your bone mineral density and one is your appendicular lean mass index so how much muscle mass do you actually have and we'll look at your subcutaneous fat but the reality of it is that doesn't really seem to matter because a that seems to be incredibly genetic right body habitus in that regard uh very genetic and relatively uncoupled from metabolic health so the the vat the visceral adipose tissue seems to be much more tightly correlated to what we see when we look at more sophisticated biomarkers of insulin sensitivity and metabolic health you know any evidence of liver fat all these other things tend to track much more closely with that so i mean i guess my view on this is that i'm i'm glad that i get to look at these other metrics because i don't have i have the luxury that a statistician or an epidemiologist doesn't have right which is when you do things at the individual level you have much more data and you can be much more nuanced in your appreciation for things but i can't help but wonder if at the population level something better than bmi will come along one day uh for which there will be enough data to actually do what's out there and again this example with the hispanic subset that's just that's mind-boggling to me and it really speaks to i think the futility of that measurement in other populations that is one plausible interpretation and i don't think we're far away from these better tools so for example uh we published some work years ago on the idea of using 3d photography where you know just take a picture of somebody from a couple of angles you know this came out of work experience way back at the new york obesity research center where steve heimsfield who was my mentor would study professional basketball players they would bring the teams in from new york to him and he would he was the king of body composition and he would study them and in talking with some of the technicians there who did this every day measured people's body composition every day they would say i can look at a person and tell you how much fat they have and i'll be very accurate they were good at it i said well if you can do with your eye why can't my camera do it so we got an nih grant with olivia fuzzo and i and steve heimsfield to look at this publish the paper on since then many others have done it i think amazon may be working on this or already have something out on this so i think we'll we'll get to the point where we have 3d photography right so that's that's um archimedes principle right eureka i found it the crown goes under the water he knows how much gold is in it because he knows how much water it's displaced uh so if you can weigh it and you can measure it's some if you can measure something's weight and volume you know it's density if you know a little about human anatomy you can figure out from density body fat that's archimedes principle that's what we can do with the camera so we have that we have dexa we have plethismography we have isotope dilution techniques all of these can start to be used more on mass on and on and so i think these these will be coming and we'll do better with that but i also think there's this idea of fit for purpose you know if you were to say to me you know is your is my vehicle that i drive is this you know precision enough for the indy 500 no i mean they need better vehicles but i'm not in the indy 500 i'm just driving five miles to and from work every day um it's fine and so i think it's fit for purpose if you say to me tell me how many what proportion of that country has obesity bmi is probably perfectly reasonable um if you say i just want to know on average what's the approximate correlation between obesity level and whether you play golf or not that's probably okay but if you want to say i want to help this individual patient as pes especially at the sort of you know the the kind of artisan level that you go at then you need the better tools well the other thing that comes back to your friend reuben is you're still limited in the what to do you know the the now what question right so if you say well we're going to take our tool of bmi extrapolation and we're going to look at the state of indiana and we can pretty accurately probably pop plot out the histogram of exactly what the bmi is by age and by demographic and all those things it's the so what question well what do we do with that information what's the implication of this are people in indiana more or less healthy than people in kentucky and are they more or less healthy than the average american and more importantly are they more or less average than the average per more or less healthy than the average person on this planet and what can we do to improve their health even if we don't want to compare them to anybody other than an absolute standard and say could everybody become healthier could we extend the life of the average person in the state of indiana by three years what would the intervention need to be and that obviously becomes a much more complicated problem but it's a more germane question right it's and it's not a fanciful question it's a question that we literally are asking and so this becomes tough because when i talk to people even physicians even highly educated scholars there's this bifurcation there's the data and those who look at the data and if they really know the data and they're really honest they say we agree surgery works pharmaceuticals work individualized or group based clinical treatment with behavioral cognitive techniques works somewhat for some period of time meal replacement formulas work somewhat for some period of time but all the public health stuff we've tried now if you really are honest and you really scrape away the obfuscated data there's virtually no evidence thus far that any of those community school public health things for obesity work doesn't mean that we won't get them someday but right now they don't so when people come and say what do we do about the state of indiana and i get this question a lot i see what's your goal is your goal to expose people to ideas so that there's some really smart kid right the next marie curie the next einstein the next george washington carver is there in that classroom and maybe the thing you do to try to reduce obesity has no effect on obesity but that kid is thinking about it for the next 15 years and then when they become an adult they go i got an idea and suddenly someone smarter than we are or with new knowledge cracks it is that your goal then it's consciousness raising okay fine is your goal to say to communities we know you're suffering and we know this is concerning and we want you to know we care and we're trying we're not really going to necessarily reduce obesity levels but we want to know you care but we want you to know we care and you want farmers markets in the school parking lot you want vending machines changed you want running tracks built in your neighborhood we'll build running tracks and so on and we'll feel better about we're caring for each other fair but it's probably not going to affect obesity given what we know right now or do you say i actually want to have less people suffering with and from obesity i want obesity levels in some definable countable number of people to go down and i want the health to improve i'd say as you know it's not going to win you any feel-good awards but surgery pharmaceuticals and to some extent individualized treatment or you know cognitive behavioral group-based treatment including things like meal replacements and so those are ways to go you could take if the state of indiana handed me 10 million dollars and said make a difference i would not go build farmer's markets in school yards i would say it'll only be a small number of people but let's give bariatric surgery to a subset of people and those subset of people will likely live longer on average what's the best explanation for why weight loss is not particularly difficult but weight loss maintained is incredibly difficult there's probably no single explanation and i think that question of why is a tough one do we mean evolutionarily why that is what happened in evolution that got us to be what we are today that leads to that or is it biochemically and otherwise why there's one of the mechanisms involved and i don't from either point of view i don't know all the answers um from the evolutionary point of view for a long time the meme was it's the thrifty gene hypothesis from james neal right so the idea is that animals in general and including and especially humans throughout evolutionary history were on the brink of starvation so anything you could do to preserve energy you did and anything you did that when given the opportunity to get more energy eat as much as you can while you can and then you get into this modern environment where there's for practical purposes for most of us unlimited consumable energy you over consume i think that's simplistic for many many reasons first of all as the lawyers say objection it assumes facts not in evidence that is it's not at all clear that humans have been on the brink of starvation throughout history in fact robert fogel who won the nobel prize for looking at these old data going back to at least the 1700s of british naval recruits and other places you see bmi sort of on average they're going up over the centuries but there's a little fluctuation as things get better and worse in places second thing is how does this account for pregnancy right now maybe now the latest data from john speakman and colleagues in science with all the double labeled water about three months ago maybe suggest that during pregnancy women's energy intakes don't need to go up that much but they still go up and so if humans have been reproducing for millennia where did all that extra energy come from if we were on the brink of starvation all the time and then the last thing i'll say is anybody who ever goes fishing knows that the idea that every animal is hungry all the time and is going to gripe grab every bite of food you throw in front of it is never been fishing you can you can see that beautiful bass sitting in the clear water in front of you and you can dangle your worm or kili or whatever it is you've got and sometimes the fish just looks at you so it's not at all clear that this is the case some animals do get obese when given unlimited food some don't both within and across species there's lots of differences so that's that john speakman came along and he said i'm not sure i'm buying this whole idea he said i think it's freedom from predation back in history we will pray then there was a certain point where we learned to use tools and hunt together and we stopped being prey and we started being predators and when we switched from being prey to predators then we didn't need to hide in our burrows and eat the limit the least we could because every time you came out of your burrow you were potentially exposed to a predator we could sort of walk around and eat kind of ad-lib and in that case the genes that were being selected for that gave us satiety mechanisms that kept our weight down no longer were being selected for it wasn't that nature was selecting four genes that made us fatter it just wasn't selecting for genes that kept us thin and that and then what happens is called drift you know mutations happen and things just drift so he calls it the drifty hypothesis and it's really less it's less about the thinness the thinness was really a consequence of what the genes were probably selecting for which presumably was lower appetite or something like that right probably and i think these things it's not one there's not one factor right we see this for example in the evolution of um sexual reproduction which is it's called the queen of questions in biology right nobody can really figure out why do we have sexual reproduction when asexual reproduction seems so much more efficient from a genetic fitness point of view and people have proposed different hypotheses for it and no one seems to work mathematically and what it may be is that it's only by putting them all together that it mathematically works and it's just an inelegant solution you see similar things in physics where maybe you know these beautiful simple mathematical things may not hold up you may just have to have ugly composite theories say a bit more about that that's interesting i've never heard the argument for i don't i don't actually know much about asexual reproduction i don't spend much time thinking about plants or other uh life forms that that do it but what's the argument for why we would be better off with asexual reproduction well think about something like daphnia which is a species that can produce both sexually and asexually there are many species like this all the way up through some vertebrates and if a if an organism reproduces itself asexually just sort of makes a copy of itself think about what it's done is it's reproduced all of its genes and so from the the dave from the dawkins the richard dawkins point of view um the selfish gene those genes all got their way those genes all won they got copied and genes that are good at getting copied will get copied again in the future right so you have more of those that's how evolution works whereas if you reproduce sexually you get another partner and of course this assumes other this invites other questions like why are there only two sexes and why in fact have sexes at all you could exchange dna without having sexes right bacteria do it through conjugation but we'll put that aside for the moment say there are two sexes male and female they come together they mix up their genetic material the offspring has roughly 50 percent of the genetic material of one parent and 50 of the other and now you you only copied yourself one half and so you didn't win as much as if you copied yourself entirely so why would you ever switch to sexual reproduction it's very inefficient from a genetic fitness point of view now you can hypothesize things the most compelling hypothesis i've heard to me is the so-called red queen hypothesis which is from alice in the looking glass where the red queen is running with alice and alice at one point says we don't seem to be getting anywhere and the red queen says oh in this world you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in place and alice says oh my world we run and we actually get somewhere and so the red queen hypothesis is the idea that you you keep running as fast as you can just to stay steady what does that mean is well as you're living a long time as a human there are these microbes in you and they're evolving much more rapidly because they have a much more shorter generation time and as they evolve they start to get good at getting past your defenses and your locks they start developing keys to your locks and you want to reset the locks the way you reset the locks is by getting a partner and mixing up your dna with them so the idea that it's a way of keeping up with the jones is where the joneses are the bacteria the microbes in your body that's that's super elegant right because if you think about it if it was all asexual we'd have a population of identical people i mean we would for all intents and purposes it'd be interesting to do the math on what it would look like but you might only have a few hundred thousand gene pools as opposed to much less diversity much less diversity so so from a species point of view if you believed in group selection right then you say all right it's good for the species but then the the smart evolutionary biologists come along and say yeah but that's group selection it doesn't make sense selection occurs at the individual or gene level you've got to explain how it makes sense for that individual how it enhances their fitness or their genes fitness so you say okay well if only half the genes get reproduced then it's got to be double the fitness level to break even and that doesn't seem like it really holds up so what people have said is you know what if you take a handful of things which i can't explain them all right now it's mueller's ratchet and there's this and that and you take all of these things and you put them together then maybe the math works but it's very inelegant it's not one nice little theory and it's probably the same thing with people and evolution so there was neil with the thrifty gene that is you need to be selected to get food when you can there's probably some truth to that maybe not everybody's dying of starvation but if you're not getting enough food you may not be big enough to win the battle for mates in a poliginous physical combat mating system and so that may that may select for wanting to eat more you may not be think of the frish hypothesis you get too thin as a woman you stop menstruating so it may be that it's not that you die of starvation but that your reproductive fitness goes down on the other hand the predation the freedom for predation idea that john speakman puts out is also legitimate and there are yet others gary beauchamp from monell chemical census center has talked about the idea of the safety of food is it possible that if you're back in time and you're not eating out of a refrigerator in a modern safe food supply like we have you know we love to insult our food supply it's probably the safest food supply in history every time you eat something you're exposing yourself potentially to microbes and toxins not just predators and if you eat less you're less exposure so there's again there's an optimization problem but as you now have a safer food supply you can relax that constraint a little bit you can even think about it socially if if i were in a species where i'm just out on my own all right if i'm uh you know species that just eats eucalyptus leaves or something it doesn't depend on anything else then maybe i can eat the last eucalyptus leaf but if i'm a species that very much depends upon cooperative living right if i am so hungry all the time that i'm willing to try to kill you for the last bite of chicken and you're willing to try to kill me for the last bite of chicken that's a bad situation especially for me because you're a little bigger than me and did more martial arts you know so so that's not good for fitness it might be good to have satiety mechanisms just so we can preserve some social order so after you and i each eat a little chicken we can actually work together on building tools and engines and steam engines and airplanes and so on this is super fascinating i i could go down this path forever i think we'll come back to this next time we have dinner because having this discussion over a meal would make it even better let's march on to the uh the topic of nutritional epidemiology we've we've talked a little bit about epidemiology obviously epidemiology is married very closely with statistics without statistics you can't really do epidemiology but it's a field that i think even the casual listener of this podcast will understand has its limitations if by no other means then they've heard me rail on it many times so um i don't think we need to define it i think people understand the nature of it but let's talk a little bit about your um [Music] your your views of it because i think you i wouldn't say you're in either camp right there's a camp of people that would say there is absolutely nothing wrong with epidemiology nutritional epidemiology it is a masterful tool that provides exceptional insights without which we would be lost the other end of the spectrum i'll acknowledge i'm a little closer to the other end of that spectrum there are people who say this is a tool that has probably reached its peak of utility um and the epidemiologists should probably focus on other problems outside of nutrition now [Music] you're probably more in the middle of those but i'd like to hear you talk a little bit about the book ends and and how where you settle out and why more importantly i appreciate the opportunity to comment on this it's a topic that i feel really does need more more um courageous addressing and i think that you have characterized it well they're at one end the people i would call the abolitionists um your i agree you're you're close uh our mutual friend gary taubes has said uh at some point we need to recognize that nutrition epidemiology is a dead signs um i'm sorry that was john ionides yes another mutual friend who said uh nutrition epidemiology is a dead science and it's time to bury the corpse gary taubes has been very critical nina t cults you many others have pointed out that perhaps this is just a worthless waste of time and misleading at the other end there are a number of people they they tend to be concentrated in boston it seems yeah there's nothing there's there's a little school out east there i forget the name of it it's in cambridge is it yeah okay anyway yeah i think i've heard it yeah i think i've heard of it and uh there are other places that believe this but it's probably strongest in boston um that sort of seem to be the defenders of the status quo that say nutrition epidemiology is imperfect as all tools are but it is still a very valuable tool there's nothing seriously wrong with it those who criticize it are naive and i i look at this i'm naive and ignorant and i look at a quotation like that and i think really you're telling me that gary taubes and johnny and edis are naive and ignorant if you want to tell me you don't agree with them that's fine now even ignorant come now not really so we know that there's something wrong there when we look at the evidence it's very clear that many findings from nutrition epidemiology have not held up once we've done randomized controlled trials now some people will say no you're wrong and i've had arguments with people from boston about this and they said you're wrong if you look at these meta-analyses it looks like non-randomized studies on average give very similar findings to randomized studies but often they're citing non-randomized intervention studies not non-randomized observational studies and they're often not citing nutrition studies they're citing pharmaceutical or other medical treatment so those are very different situations when you look at the nutrition epi it's not clear to me that these things hold up very well when they are studying in fact it seems to be more the norm that they don't if you look at other things going on as john einedy's probably better than anybody else has done but many of us have done and you start to peel the hood open on these and you really look you see a lot of things that look like obfuscation exaggeration sweeping under the rug of measurement error and so on so we've got huge issues with confounding we've got huge measurement problems and so i think many people including me say no the status quo is not okay it's not just minor fine tuning we need reformation but we also need to use these tools well this field is not going to go away whether you want it to or not so my feeling is reformation is essential the status quo is completely unacceptable but abolition is neither realistic nor desirable and i want to cite one paper we did which i think makes an interesting point this paper you know i often you know end reading the the observational epidemiology nutrition study in which the author correctly and honestly points out that it's an observational study as association not cause not necessarily showing causation and then says but how could i be wrong well it could be that this measurement error creates this problem they say but i used a validated food frequency questionnaire so it's really okay could be confounding due to socioeconomic status but all of my subjects had the same profession so it's really okay as though the nurse who works in a poor school in rural indiana has the same socioeconomic status as the nurse who is the married to a billionaire of course not um they say we control for we only never smokers and so on and so on so really it was okay they dismiss the idea that it's not really causation and i got this idea once and i said you know what they're saying is if i measured everything well and i controlled for food intake and i controlled for diet composition and housing and socioeconomic status and genetic background then it would be okay so i said you know you could never do this study in humans but i realized i've done this in mice and we had a mouse study where we randomly assigned mice to eat different amounts of calories or food energy but all in the same diet so composition was fixed the mice had no choice there were no restaurants there was no grub hub there was no doordash we gave the mice the same food they all ate the same thing no self-report they're all genetically identical in probability because they're you know inbred isagenix strain all c57 black 6j mice they're all in the same housing conditions there's no smoking etc and then we take these mice and we randomly assign them to low calorie medium calorie high calorie effectively or ad lib ad libidum and what we find is the more calories we assign them to be allowed to eat the shorter they live no big surprise there this has been shown a thousand times in the literature by ray walford and and you know rick weinrich and and others over the decades but then we take the ed lebedum group and within that some choose to eat more than others and within that group now we have an observational epidemiologic study and we correlate amount chosen to be eaten with longevity and those mice that choose to eat more live longer so the association in the observational component is exactly opposite to the causal effect in the experimental component and what people say to me is well david it's confounding what you're seeing probably almost certainly is that the mice that are the strongest and healthiest have the biggest appetites they eat more and what you're seeing is confounding by general health to which i say right that's the point the point is even in a study an observational study that is more pristine that anybody will ever be able to do a human study which there's no smoking no restaurants everybody eats the same thing there's no measurement error you know it's they're all genetically identical in probability we can't get the observational study to reproduce the causal effect and that suggests to me why reform is so needed and we talk about different kinds of observational studies what i would love to never hear again is the pure isle analogy of there's no randomized controlled trials with parachute jumping right you know what i'm talking about that comes up every now and then and there's a wonderful book called random easters like you know fashionistas randomistas by andrew lay and he says actually there are randomized controlled trials of parachute jumping so first of all it's just not true but beyond the fact that i think i already approved that you got to be in the army i think yeah um so you know the the interesting thing there is that this is used often as an excuse to say okay i can't do the pure perfect pristine randomized controlled trial so therefore you have to accept any old observational study and i think the answer is no no we don't we may have to accept that we're going to draw some inferences from something other than the pure classic pristine randomized control trial but in between that and any old observational epidemiologic study there's a lot of space and what we're saying is we need to get to this space here so co-twin controls right you hinted at that earlier all right how about we take your identical twin we randomly assign you to one and the twin to the other or if we can't randomly sign say oh peter you exercise a lot your twin brother doesn't exercise but you have the same genotype okay that's a tight control or how about things in which we intervene even if it's not randomly intervened as opposed to just observe so we say okay in this town we're going to build a restaurant in that town we're not going to build the restaurant it's still an intervention study even if it's not a randomized study that's the realm of brian elbelle for example looks at food deserts and things to see you know we built a grocery store where there was a few food desert we're told that food deserts were the problem and doesn't look like things got better when we built the grocery store that's a much stronger design than just asking people how far away do you live from a grocery store yeah no i look i think that's very eloquent and the um that mouse study is remarkable by the way i remember when that came out that that that needs to be a sunday email on on to my group so let's let's remember that um i would highlight two things that that well one thing that you've already alluded to and one that you haven't but i would just add it to my side of the ledger on why i struggle so much with the legitimacy of epidemiology anything that relies on a food frequency questionnaire i simply can't take seriously for the fact that at least with every patient i've ever come in contact with to try to accurately assess what they eat based on a food frequency questionnaire would be a fool's errand it's simply it's it's simply unrelated to what they eat full stop the second issue i have with nutritional epidemiology comes down to the hazard ratios that very commonly show up and lead to grand statements when you see hazard ratios like 1.16 and we talk about this like we have demonstrated the causal relationship between bacon and cancer i mean what what would the actual fathers of epidemiology be saying in their graves if they were looking at these strength of association um and so i'm not necessarily saying there should be no epidemiology but boy there needs to be a referendum on how the media is taught how to interact with such studies on um [Music] you know how we scrutinize some of the methodologies behind these things because again you know checking a food frequency questionnaire once in an eight-year study it just doesn't mean anything it really it means less than nothing actually and yet it's amazing that could be the basis of an observation so anyway i you're gonna it's it's hard for me to say something good about epidemiology well i i on the measurement issue which is often i think incorrectly perceived by some people as the key issue and say well yeah we admit the measurement of food intake is a big problem but other than that everything's fine and no even when the measurement is near perfect as in my mouse study it's still not fine um you don't have to go back to the fathers of epidemiology or wait for the fathers of epidemiology you can go back to at least confucius who says to know what you know and to know what you do not know that is true knowledge and so this idea that we have to be honest with ourselves and each other about what we know and don't know and how we know it and don't know it is clear and i think that's part of that reform we need a greater level of honesty sameen vizier just had a paper in one of the peer-reviewed journals looking at or writing about epistemic humility and saying you know when you get to the discussion section of a paper and you consider that the hypothesis that you made which now seems to be supported by your data and you say but i might be wrong and then you just systematically go through with the greatest effort and art to show how you're not wrong how you can dismiss all the competing explanations so that's not an honest epistemic humility an honest epistemic humility would be to say i really might be wrong and here's all the ways i might be wrong that i and others should test going forward michael strevins in his book the knowledge machine does a beautiful composition decomposition construction deconstruction of this and talks about the idea of communities doing this and so that we need that that sort of constructive battle but it needs to be an honest battle right we can't engage the battle shouldn't be ad hominem the battle shouldn't be undercutting each other by you know who you are and who you work for and what your beliefs are needs to be a battle about the data it calls out the iron rule of evidence and so if i say peter your theory that x causes y could be mistaken because your measurement of x is not valid you need to come back and say i hear you what if i measure x this way that's a that's a legitimate thing let's do it and see if we can rule it out and then we can go back and forth and well maybe the measurement of y is not right i think we need to be more honest about that i don't think the nutrition epidemiology field is being quite has been quite honest about the limits of its measurement but so of the attackers not i've been careful about saying i think measurements of energy intake and expenditure from self-report methods are so bad that they shouldn't even be used that is it's not enough to say well it's not perfect it's so bad you can't even be guaranteed to get the directional effect so don't even use it better to not do the study at all but on the other hand if you said to me i want to know if people eat vegetarian or not or eat kosher or not or eat after midnight or not i don't know maybe people do report those accurately maybe they don't i honestly don't know um i think we have to ask for for what purpose you mentioned very briefly catherine flagel um earlier she also wrote a very famous paper about the obesity wars uh give folks a bit of an idea about that i i thought very excellent paper yeah catherine fleigle's been a colleague that i from whom i've had great respect for many many years and she's very very bright and very capable and very careful and i've learned a lot from her actually and she published a paper uh in i think it was 2005 that really got people's attention and it was interesting in the way it was a meta-analysis and combined pooling analysis showed a few things what was interesting to me is what people harped on particularly the media was that bmis in the overweight range were actually not strongly associated and consistently associated with increased mortality rate in some cases were associated with lower mortality rate the media went crazy with this as though it were new finding just as every few years they write the new finding that bmi is mass and not fat the new finding that there's a genetic component to obesity that we knew from decades ago the media went crazy with this the people that are the defenders of you can never be too rich or too thin went crazy and attacked her and the the bizarreness of it was wasn't new i mean it was a meta-analysis how could it have been new we all knew these data um you can go back to linus pauling right the double nobel laureate has a paper in the 1950s on bmi and life expectancy and he has got a bathtub shaped curve there so this is not new at all but somehow it was seen as new it was in jama the newspapers went crazy the people who were defending it went crazy and they started attacking her very vociferously um one investigator called it a worthless pile of rubbish and to me these are very inappropriate who were the most vocal critics some people in boston seem to be interesting among the most most vocal critics so that was kind of a very interesting thing and but as i said it was all on old news anybody been reading the literature for decades but i already knew this what was actually new and to me far more intriguing but got much less attention was that the nader was moving over time that was we talked about earlier that in 1990 it wasn't the same as 1970. that is to me very intriguing we actually had have an active nih grant built on that uh trying to figure out what's going on with it but anyway they attacked her and these statements you know it was rubbish and that she didn't know what she was talking about that there was nobody with a medical background and these are all ad hominem things first of all it's not clear there was no one with the medical background on the paper and even if it was clear who cares you know the data are the data whether you have an md or you don't have an md it's the data that matter when i frequently say in science three things matter the data the methods used to collect the data which give them their probative value and the logic which connects the data and the methods to conclusions everything else is not science now if you want to look at other things as ways of helping you make a pragmatic decision that's fine right so if i say oh i trust peter and he's a smart guy and i know he studies a lot and he tells me i should eat this that's maybe a very pragmatic way of making decision but it's not science right the science is the data the methods and the logic connecting the data to conclusions not whether i trust you or not and so all these ad hominem things were said they attacked her it was very very vociferous very inappropriate um but there are many other people who have been attacked you know i've been attacked i know lots of other people have been attacked for their their beliefs when nina t cults had an editorial i think in lancet talking about some elements of nutrition and fat carbohydrate many people wrote in tried to get it retracted this is a sort of regular occurrence now when brad johnson published on red meat roughly two years ago big meta-analysis showing that the association between red meat consumption and negative health outcomes was not strong and compelling as you know in his words um again vigorously attacked people tried to get it retracted before it was published which thankfully didn't work instead of just engaging with the data the methods and the logic and it's it's it's terrible this happens it doesn't only happen in obesity and nutrition but it happens a lot in obesity nutrition yeah but that's what i'm gonna say it does seem to happen disproportionately in this field why is that i think it has to do with the everyday experience right so back to my example from early in our discussion about the the beta cell of the pancreas right if if you are at a cocktail party in your neighborhood and you say to somebody well i study diabetes and here's what i think about the beta cell of the pancreas and how this might work unless that person also studies it they're not going to challenge you right they probably don't know what the beta cell of the pancreas is they don't have strong feelings about it they don't see it every day so on all of us eat every day or almost all of us eat almost every day food is culture it's family it's love it's economy it's commerce it's political beliefs it's philosophical belief it's ethical beliefs about whether you're a vegetarian or not it's the sustainability of the environment it's so connected to so many emotional things and we all have that everyday experience and we have to make decisions every day each of us decides what to eat what to feed our kids right whether wear a seatbelt or not all these things we make these decisions and then we may want to justify them we may need to believe they're good we may mistake our experience for expertise and that's why i think when you get into any fields where people have everyday experience whether it's human sexuality whether it's relationships whether it's child rearing tv watching book reading music eating these are things people have very strong feelings about and often will opine about often quite aggressively in the absence of data it is not only obesity statements about violence and media statements about um you know how to best teach mathematics to children people have very strong feelings they're often quite in contrast to what the data show so is there a path forward here because it doesn't feel like there's from a nutritional standpoint i mean i think we've you've already touched on a few of them but we've we've already seen some pretty exciting pharmacologic things come along i think semi-glutid um the this study that we we've talked about before on this podcast really kind of a remarkable drug it's certainly the most impressive thing that i've seen clinically for obesity but so so the point being we're making great progress there we talk about surgical treatments um 25 years ago when i was in medical school i remember the first gastric bypass i ever saw done as a medical student watching you know a surgical uh rotation and this was an open this was done before they were doing them laparoscopically it was done as an open uh ruin y gastric bypass on a 400 pound man who would die 40 days later in the hospital of sepsis he never got out of the hospital he had an anastomotic leak that was a very dangerous operation 25 years ago today that operation is done almost without exception laparoscopically it is an incredibly safe procedure and it has also remarkable efficacy so on this surgical front on this pharmacological front we have made amazing progress we haven't made progress on the nutritional front are we going to not clear you know a new york times reporter called me a few years ago and this was in response there was an article about president i think was president taft who was very obese and somebody had found some letters between him and his physician talking about diet and it was almost you could have picked those letters up and said this was between a president and his or her physician today and they would make equal sense and the reporter said to me this is a very bright science nutrition journalist said to me david why have we made so little progress why have we not been able to find the diet that reliably causes sustained weight loss and i said your question is premised on the idea that there is a diet that reliably causes sustained weight loss why should we believe that that's true so that's an important thing to think about i think one of the things that is perhaps a misperception and maybe a very problematic one in our field around nutrition and weight loss or food intake and weight loss is that there is a good diet with respect to weight loss particularly such that for most if not all people if you just ate the right way you wouldn't have to count your calories you wouldn't have to be uncomfortable and hungry you wouldn't have to feel deprived and yet you would maintain a good healthy weight i know of no reason to believe that's true um i know lots of people who argue is it diet a or diet b right so this one thinks it's low carb and this one thinks it's high or low fat and this one thinks it's don't eat at night and this one thinks it's you know whatever it is uh eat paleo you know etc i'm just maybe the null hypothesis is you know doesn't matter that much there isn't such a diet for for many people now for some people they do maintain a normal healthy desirable weight without trying to restrict their energy but maybe for others it's just not the case i think the paths forward are manifold and i think in some cases we are on the good path and in some cases we are wandering in the drunkards walk we're on the good path i think on surgery and pharmaceuticals clearly a long way to go but they've gotten much better i'd love to see more funding for those for good research and i think we need we are on a good path but i think we need to get on a much better path about as a society making those available to people right if you have cancer we're willing to treat you if you have obesity maybe not right so if you're rich you can pay for that if you're not rich what do you do so i'd love to see more access to care and i think we're on a better path but we need to be on a better path still i think we're on a good path on stigma a long way to go but i think as a society we've woken up to say stigmatizing obese people is not okay do you think the pendulum's gone too far i i read something this might have been a joke but i literally read that um adele was actually shamed for losing weight i don't know if that's true but if it was it would certainly suggest that the pendulum has gone a little too far the other direction i would certainly say that that's ridiculous i don't know if she was or wasn't but if she was that's ridiculous um to me the take home message is shaming people about their body habitus is not good in either direction it's not a directional thing right it's just shaming people about their body habitus is not okay and you know sometimes the counter argument is but it's good for them because it'll help them want to lose weight and sometimes the argument made against the shaming is empiricals well the evidence shows that people who experience a lot of weight shaming gain more weight and then the causal thing is thrown in and then people say therefore you shouldn't do it like you mean if shaming didn't cause weight gain it would be okay to be immoral and cruel to others no i mean if you replace things like sex and race in that sentence you're like no it's not okay to shame and denigrate people because of their sex race age body habitus regardless of whether it causes weight loss or weight gain period it's a moral issue it's not an empirical issue and i think that's we have a long way to go but i think we're making progress people go yeah i guess i guess we can generalize this idea that you shouldn't denigrate people because of age-race sex maybe you shouldn't denigrate them for other characteristics that are not you know moral failings i think that on the basic science we're making progress we could make better progress if we tightened up the rigor of our science we could make better progress if we had more funding and many groups including the national academy of sciences and i'm on a strategic council to increase the rigor of science all of science not just obesity nutrition but we're making progress we know so much more about genes and physiology and metabolism and cells with respect to obesity and nutrition than we knew 20 30 40 years ago the one area where as far as i can tell we are not making progress and i don't think we are yet on a good path i don't think we're on a path at all is the sort of public health community school-based community-based policy-based approach i think we are continuing to look for our keys under the lamp posts because that's where the light is as opposed to where the keys might be i think we are continuing to ignore the data and keep saying the same old hackneyed suggestions that people have been trying for decades and that when you really look at the data have been at best not been shown to work and at worst been shown to not work and i think there are some people who are patently obfuscating those data i think the cluster randomized trials we see in the childhood obesity literature you know bring to mind the phrase that rhymes with cluster muck and it just this is cluster muck this is distorted evidence this is science gone wrong in the worst sense i think we've got to clean that up we've got to clean up the quality of the science we do and start treating this like science just as much as the science of quarks or tires on automobiles or beta cells of pancreases and treat it like real science and take it just as seriously can you tell folks briefly what the cluster randomization problem is sure so a cluster randomized trial is a trial in which instead of randomizing the individual unit of observation might be let's say a child in a school who you either assigned to the treatment group maybe it's exercise or the control group no special exercise you assign the entire an entire intact unit such as a classroom or a school or a neighborhood or a family there's nothing wrong with that as long as you have theoretically at least two clusters assigned to each condition so you have some ability to estimate a variance although frankly with only two you have so little power and robustness it's for practical purposes that would be invalid but theoretically it's valid but then you must analyze the data to take into account both what's called the clustering and the nesting the clustering is that you have people grouped and that grouping leads to more similar individuals right so imagine that we did a trial and the trial was you and your brother randomly assigned to eat low carb and me and my brother randomly scient high carb and at the end we see a difference by an ordinary t-test and you say well hold on a second was that really the effect of diet or was that the etia brothers are different than the allison brothers well you have to take that into account so that's you need more than one cluster right so if you get the etia brothers and the jones brothers and the alice and brothers and the smith brothers now in theory you can do it but now you can't treat us like we're eight different people right what you really have is four different clusters four different sib ships four different sets of brothers you've got to take that into account you have less degrees of freedom people don't do that reliably and they don't do it correctly often and that leads to many papers being wrong we've written countless letters to editors about this i think we've probably had at least three or four cluster randomized trials retracted as a result of letters we've written where people have had to come back and just say the results don't hold up but until until this has changed we have people out there who understandably say but i read these papers suggesting that this works gardening in schools makes kids thinner no that's not what the results showed but that's what the paper says and until we become more rigorous and more honest we're not on a path so if i were to ask you now to speculate outside of known things if you had to guess and if you presuppose that there is an intervention or a set of interventions that could improve public health outcomes what would your guesses be what would you guess to test general education not nutrition education general education there is provocative data i don't want to say definitive data there are provocative data strongly suggesting that general education especially for girls and women leads to lower bmis lesser rates of obesity and lesser diabetes than less education so there are some studies in europe of policies where someone puts in a policy and it effectively gives a cohort of people more education and then you see in that cohort less obesity especially among women there's a famous study by the raimees who were a husband and wife investigative team who actually worked at uab when i first got there and they started the study decades ago at unc and it was sort of head start on steroids it was they called it the abc adarian or a beccadarian study and they gave these kids the super head start program and it was mostly just general education there may have been a little nutrition education but mostly just general education wasn't a weight loss study wasn't intended to be 30 years later they followed them up there's a paper in science on this guess what the women have less obesity the moving to opportunity study funded by the department of housing and urban development took families who lived in so-called poor neighborhoods and they gave them either randomly assigned them either to control but they basically got nothing or to housing vouchers but the housing vouchers required that they moved to less poor neighborhoods and what they then found years later in follow-up again published in science and new england journal of medicine is that there was less obesity and diabetes in those assigned to move to the less poor neighborhoods and given the financial wherewithal to do so so i could go on but these are things that suggest to me that education general education may help and i think that may speak to this whole socio-economic thing we started that way earlier what is it about higher socioeconomic status that at least in some groups not all but at least in white women seems to be associated with less obesity and i don't know what the causal mechanisms are but that might be my best so somebody said to me you're going to be the king for a year and you've got the federal budget and you can take this big chunk of money and you can make an impact in obesity and diabetes i would say i'm going to divide it into four pots one pot is going to be surgery and it's going to be both providing it and continue to study it the next one is going to be pharmaceuticals both providing it continuing to study it third part is going to be some general education maybe general well-being safety security starting in early childhood to see whether that alone is enough and it may be really reducing disparities back to confucius confucius said we are not so concerned with an absence of wealth we are concerned with a disparity of wealth and so it may be that reducing disparities is really important and then the fourth part would be basic research and i'd like to say let's look at analytics and let's look at microchimerism and all the things that you talk about so often your podcast that that a but against both metabolism and obesity and nutrition but also the fundamental uh fundamental senescence so i'd love to say can we use microchimerism to restore people to younger metabolic states can we use analytics to do that that would be my fourth bucket those basic science questions now a moment ago you touched briefly on the national academy of science engineering and medicine you were on a panel that looked at the question of reproducibility in science correct this was two years ago i think now the consensus i believe was that there was not a crisis but but we shouldn't we shouldn't let our guards down am i sort of paraphrasing that correctly close uh the phrase that that uh harvey feinberg who is the chair of it i don't know if is his phrase but you know he started using and we followed is no crisis but no cause for complacency and the idea of no cause for complacency or no complacency is we must make things better the no crisis is a tricky one depends what you mean by crisis and some people say if you look at dictionary definitions of crisis the idea is that it's a system about to collapse so you know you need to go to the icu if you don't get intervention you're going to die you're in crisis there's no evidence that science is in crisis there's no evidence that science is about to die or it doesn't work anymore not at all another way is to say things are getting much much worse rapidly there's also no clear evidence for that there might be some things that are getting worse but on average there's a lot of evidence that things are getting better my own belief is science is better and more rigorous than it's ever been in history and so in that sense no i still don't think there's a crisis but there's a third way which is i think the spark for many social movements if you think about what often happens as a social movement is you have a group of people that for example are often often it's around oppression and they're oppressed and they're sufficiently oppressed that people are unwilling to make too much noise and the status quo is only very slowly and grudgingly moved and then at some point people feel a little bit more confident and a little less oppressed and they start to speak and people say this state of affairs is not acceptable anymore and if you were to say in that later point in time but it's much better than it was in the earlier time someone might say it may be much better but we ain't taking it anymore right things may be much better than they used to be things in 2021 are probably much better for many situations than they were in 1921 and much better than they were in 1821 but there comes a point we say you know this lead in gasoline or this lead paint lead in our paint or this way in which we use heating or these kinds of lack of catalytic converters on cars or this way in which we burn up fossil fuel or this way in which we treat different age race sex groups it's just not okay anymore yes it may be better than it was years ago the world has spoken we won't take it anymore i think that's where we are sciencing yes science is probably better than it's ever been but we also see all the flaws and it must get better and that's why marsha mcnutt the president of the national academy of sciences instantiated this new strategic council on trust and integrity and rigor and science and very generously appointed me as one of the three co-chairs marcia franz cordova who's the director emeritus of the national science foundation and i have the three co-chairs and are working on trying to see what you know we as the academies can do to try to help a little bit and many other organizations are also trying to help on this how much of the crisis in science uh well i guess we're just deciding we're not going to use the word crisis how much of the situation in science is intrinsic is within science itself and how much of it is a result of the public inclusive of the media's interface with science i think it's both i think science is hard uh michael strevin's book which i mentioned earlier the knowledge machine does a wonderful treatise on that and i think we have to recognize that but i think we have to make the distinction between normative errors and non-normative errors and let's take an example of each so a few hundred years ago galileo is under house arrest the pope has said you know bad writing about copernicus stay locked up in your house but we will kill you and from his house galileo directs an experiment or not really an experiment a study and he has two colleagues go out to two tops of mounds or hills or mountains far apart each holding a lantern with shutters and a a synchronized watch or timepiece and he says to them at a predetermined moment you guys open your shutters and you record when you see the other guy's light and we'll figure out whether light travels instantaneously or not right is there some delay until the light gets to you and they conclude that it's instantaneous they can't discern any time now we know today of course that that's wrong ole romer probably is the first person who convincingly shows it's wrong when he shows that a moon comes around at a time different than his mentor dominique cassini predicted but at the time that's the answer they get with their instrumentation they couldn't have done better i would call that a normative era i would not mock galileo i don't think galileo did anything wrong i think we look at him as brilliant my god great question great worry of working on it but things move along similarly when line is pauling says dna is a triple helix right before watson and crick come out it's a double helix um he didn't have good x-ray crystallography date he's working at the edge norma tavera then there are other things very famous non-normative error is people working out the thighs the size of the thymus gland of children they worked it out from cadavers in the early 20th century guess what people don't become cadavers at random poorer people tend to become cadavers poor children tend to be undernourished under nourished children tend to have smaller thymus clans so when physicians started seeing children richer children coming in dying of sudden infant death syndrome and they examined them it's a big thymus gland well it was actually normal thymus gland because their norms were from undernourished kids so let's irradiate these kids with big thymus glands and prevent sudden infant death syndrome and probably cause lots of cases of thyroid cancer because the thyroid and the thymus are very close to each other so that's an example of a non-normative error because even a hundred years ago any epidemiologist or statistician could have told you that is bad sampling and bad inference from bad sampling we need to make that distinction between normative and non-normative errors and a lot of the errors that we have in nutrition epidemiology today i don't think can be called normative errors anymore i think we have to say that was non-normative the misanalysis of the cluster randomized trials these are not normative any statistician knows how to do it people are either obfuscating or they're just woefully ignorant and not using professional statisticians when they need to people using food frequency questionnaires to draw causal inferences about some of these things we've discussed these are not normative errors people should know better then there's the stuff about the sort of more general public about believing things and how we how we promote our ideas and here's where i think i think at root is us in the scientific community that have to take responsibility for it but it branches out beyond us i think we need to be prepared to lose some battles in order to win the intellectual war and what i mean by that is we need to be prepared to not use all the rhetorical tools at our disposal at any one point in time to convince somebody that x is true even when we're really worked up and think it's important we believe x is true we think it's important that others believe x is true right because we want them to eat what we think is good we want them to eat more broccoli and less ice cream we want them to take their vaccine wear their mask wear their seat belt stop smoking we may be right about all those things right maybe people should eat more broccoli and less ice cream and where their seat belt getting vaccinated and wear their mask and seat belt but if we use rhetorical devices such as if you and i are debating and i attack you on ad hominem grounds or i exaggerate the strength of my evidence or i don't honestly say that i've shown an association and not causation then in fact i may win that battle that day on convincing people to eat broccoli instead of ice cream but i've lost the battle in helping people think through what good evidence is and elevating our level of dialogue and i think if we can get to the point where just as today we changed our dialogue we think about the things people would say think about what a late night comedian would have said 30 years ago in making jokes about wives and husbands and race and sex that would never be considered acceptable today we are able to change societal norms about dialogue can we elevate our societal norms of dialogue on epistemologic and empirical issues so that we can get people to you don't have to be a genius to say oh you're telling me you have a treatment for x was there a study was the study in humans was it a randomized study was it a study of the actual outcome you're making a claim about was it a study that was long enough for this to be a meaningful outcome was there a statistically significant result was the result big enough to matter was the dose a dose i might realistically take those are not all that difficult questions to train ourselves and each other to just reliably ask and if we just reliably ask those and reliably and honestly answer them you would go a long way yeah it's interesting i mean it's impossible to have this discussion without thinking about covet because kovit has been such a um polarizing scientific uh phenomenon in a way that i've i've become quite frustrated in watching it right i've and i'm trying to maintain a distance from it and ask myself the question is the reason that the head of the cdc makes assertions about masks or vaccines or mandates because she doesn't think that the people to whom she's speaking are intelligent enough to appreciate nuance or is it because she doesn't actually appreciate the nuance herself you know and this gets to exactly the point you made a moment ago which is the high ground is being lost right i think the public's faith in science in the institution of science is eroding dramatically and i think covet has accelerated that in a way that i wouldn't have predicted i remember having a discussion with a friend in march of 2020 and i very very naively said to him i think that what we're about to see with respect to the speed with which medications and vaccines are going to be developed is going to elevate the consciousness of science in the public's eye i think the public is going to look back in a year and say wow science is great you know just as in the 1960s the best and the brightest kids went into engineering because they were inspired by the space race i stupidly thought this might be the end of every smart kid becoming an investment banker and instead we might just see more kids enrolling in science how silly of me to not envision what was coming which was a world in which well-meaning public health officials simply failed to communicate the nuance of science and lost so much credibility yeah kovit has been unique and and i think you know one of the things i was saying to to my wife recently is i hope i live at least another 20 years for many reasons but one of the reasons is that i really want to see what the historians say about the period of roughly 2016 to a year or two from now when hopefully we are somewhat out of this pandemic i can see it in the present i want to see it in the 2020 hindsight let me let me say two things about your points one is about motivations and the other is about trust the motivations issue i think is an interesting one you know i was having a conversation with a colleague many years ago and i was ranting about university accountants and how they're they're you know they drive me crazy with little things and this friend of mine said to me says think about you and your science he says you're so fastidious about it you're so passionate about it you're so committed to it one iota of bending the truth is not okay for you he says the accountant feels that way about the way the accounting is done and that's their domain different people have their different domains and if i were to say to you you know peter what are you professionally or you might say anything or what are you just more general you might say you might tell my father you might say i'm a physician i i'm a healer you might say i'm a scientist i might say a few other things when i came to iu i was at a big retreat and a friend of mine was there and we started going around and introducing ourselves and i was sort of the new kid on the block and i said you know my name is david allison and i'm a scientist and i study blah blah blah and he said you know the first thing you said you're like you're the new deanier and the first thing you said is i'm a scientist you didn't say i'm the dean of the school of public health he says that shows how you think of yourself if i were to say if you were to say to me in your professional role what's the one thing you must never compromise truth what's my one sacred duty pursue and communicate truth to the best of my ability but if you said to some other people in my field who are equally good people maybe better people who knows and you said to them what's your one uncompromisable duty some of them would say help people make their health better or enact justice can't say they're wrong that's their value and i think that's what comes out a lot in public health there are true believers who think they know the right answer they think eating this is better than eating that many cases they're probably right they think not smoking is better than smoking i agree i think they're right and given those premises they say whatever it takes to convince people to eat a and not b to wear their seatbelt to not smoke i'm willing to say it that's my sacred duties make me better i think that's part of the problem of what's our identity who's speaking and i think we need to be clear when we are speaking as scientists then we must not compromise truth and i think when we're speaking as advocates that's fine just say you're an advocate say i'm not being a scientist right now i'm just telling you what i want you to do and i'm going to say whatever i need to say to convince you i think that's important the other thing i want to pick up is this trust idea i hear a lot especially from people within science and academia especially from people who are somewhat on the left but not only on the left side of the political spectrum who say trust in science is really weighed down in the last few years and i'm not sure that's true in fact i don't think it is true it depends what you mean by science if what you mean is science as a process of developing and finding knowledge i know of no evidence that it's down and the the results of the pew uh charitable trust in their surveys for example suggest that it's not if what you mean by science is trust in individual elements of the scientific community then i'm not sure it's down either but it's spread around so some people think fauci is trustworthy and some people think gwyneth paltrow is trust worthy some people think david allison is and some people think peter ortiz and some people think we're corrupt and ignorant and confused and terrible um and i think that the challenge is that there are people who cannot distinguish between the the statements of a tony fauci and the extent to which they are or are not backed by evidence and the statements of ajani and nedes and this extent to which they are not back versus the statements of a gwyneth paltrow or somebody else and i think that's the challenge it's not that people don't trust science they don't know which voice to trust as a communicator of the science and therefore they don't trust individual elements of the canon of science and we see that very strongly in nutrition there's a nice summary on the pew charitable trust website now indicating that trust in science is high trust in dietitians is high trust in medical doctors who talk about nutrition in treating their patients is high but trust in nutrition scientists compared to dietitians and medical doctors who talk about nutrition and compared to other scientists is low so in nutrition we have met the enemy and it is us we have shot ourselves in the credibility foot with our obfuscation and our exaggeration and our hype and i think that pocket of trust is gone even though trust and science overall is not down david this was this was a fantastic discussion you are always so lucid in the way that you can talk about an idea including this very one i think this this this point that we're ending on is is really really spot on and i think that this the difference between science and advocacy can't be overstated um and i think it would be amazing if people myself included all of us had the self-awareness to speak and know which hat we were wearing i mean that think about the problems that could be solved if one you allowed people to wear both hats but they always had to have a hat on you you couldn't you couldn't you know blind the listener from which hat you're wearing and if you were wearing your scientist hat you would be delivering the nuanced hard truth as messy as it might be as unclear as it might be with no regard for how a person feels when they hear it and what action they may or may not take as a result of it and of course if you're really just in the business of saying i want to change your behavior because i think it's in your best interest i'm going to put the different hat on i like this idea we i think there's something here we can come up with a two-hat system and everybody gets to own two hats you know every one of us in our lives have to deal with this we're both fathers as fathers you face this all the time sometimes your kid says to you can i do this and you say no and they could say why well because i think you might get hurt or it's a bad idea or something bad might happen or you won't get that good thing and they say do you know are you sure and they have a counter argument everyone said i don't know and i'm not sure i have no randomized controlled trial that climbing that tree is too dangerous i'm just telling you i don't think it's a good idea but i have no i have no need to pretend that i did a scientific experiment i'm your dad and that tree looks dangerous to me and i'm telling you to get down from it right now and then there are other times i'm acting as a scientist and i say this is what would constitute adequate evidence and this is what we know just like confucius said know what you know and know what you don't know brilliant thank you david it's been a pleasure sitting here with you today thank you my friend great to see you peter thank you for listening to this week's episode
