## Description

Original release date: 6/1/20

Ned David is the co-founder of Unity Biotechnology, a company developing senolytic medicines—molecules that target and destroy senescent cells in the human body. In this episode, Ned explains the science of cellular senescence and how it impacts the aging process. Ned discusses how senolytics may delay, prevent, treat, or even reverse age-related diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disease. As a serial entrepreneur, Ned also provides advice on how to transform a simple idea into the creation of a company.

We discuss:
-Defining longevity and the principles of aging [2:50];
-The control knobs of aging and how we can turn them [15:10];
-Role of cellular senescence in aging and cancer [27:00];
-History of senescence in scientific study [40:30];
-The cellular senescence paradox [46:00];
-Developing medicines that target cellular senescence [52:15];
-Ned’s lessons on risk analysis in business [1:05:15];
-The search for a molecule that could eliminate senescent cells [1:15:15];
-Senescent cell elimination example in osteoarthritic knees [1:30:30];
-Extending lifespan by removing senescent cells [1:45:00];
-Senolytic molecule example in macular degeneration reversal [1:52:30];
-The future of senescent cell targeting [1:58:30];
-The role of cellular senescence and metabolic syndrome [2:01:30];
-The role of cellular senescence and brain health [2:03:30]
-How building the company Kythera prepared Ned for his grander project of creating Unity Biotechnology [2:05:45];
-Advice for someone considering an entrepreneurial career path versus an academic career path [2:08:50]; and
-More.

## AI Summary

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the episode:

1. **Executive Summary**:
This episode features Ned David, co-founder of Unity Biotechnology, discussing cellular senescence and its role in aging. The conversation explores how senescent cells accumulate with age and contribute to various age-related diseases. David explains Unity's approach to developing drugs that can selectively eliminate senescent cells (senolytic therapy) and their promising results in treating osteoarthritis. The discussion covers both the scientific foundations and the practical applications of this technology in treating age-related diseases.

2. **Key Medical/Scientific Points**:
- Senescent cells make up approximately 1-2% of cells in aged tissues [00:29:23]
- Elimination of senescent cells in mice led to 30% longer lifespan [01:50:30]
- Senescent cells accumulate at sites of osteoarthritis and contribute to pain [01:21:36]
- Three types of cells become senescent in atherosclerotic plaques: endothelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts [01:46:22]
- Senescent cells secrete inflammatory factors (SASP) that affect surrounding tissue [01:40:15]

3. **Health Optimization Tips**:

Universal Recommendations:
- No specific universal recommendations were provided

Context-specific recommendations:
- Potential treatment for osteoarthritis through senolytic therapy [01:35:02]
- Possible applications for age-related macular degeneration [01:55:42]

4. **Supplements & Medications**:
- Unity's senolytic drug showed pain reduction in osteoarthritis patients within two weeks [01:40:15]
- BCL-2 inhibitors being developed for eye conditions [01:56:54]
- MDM2-p53 interaction inhibitors discussed as potential senolytics [01:26:20]

5. **Exercise & Movement**:
No specific exercise protocols were discussed.

6. **Nutrition & Diet**:
No specific dietary recommendations were discussed.

7. **Biomarkers & Testing**:
- Pain scales (NRS) used in clinical trials [01:35:02]
- MRI and X-ray monitoring of joint structure in Phase 2 trials [01:40:33]

8. **References & Resources**:
- Leonard Hayflick's work on cellular senescence (1961) [00:43:26]
- Judy Campisi's research on senescence markers (1995) [00:44:39]
- Nature Medicine paper (2017) mentioned regarding osteoarthritis [01:25:41]

9. **Notable Quotes**:
"Aging is not a rigid thing... it's this flexible malleable thing" [00:08:35]

10. **Follow-up Questions**:
- Long-term effects of senolytic therapy on joint structure
- Potential applications in preventing age-related diseases
- Safety profile of repeated treatments
- Role of senescent cells in other age-related conditions
