## Transcript

[00:00:00] the Human Genome Project was completed early 2000s and with the human genome having been sequenced and then also with DNA sequencing technology becoming cheaper and faster um scientists were able to start to sequence many many more genomes and so they can start to make comparisons between healthy individuals and also people who are affected by specific diseases to see what's different between their genomes and by doing that comparison they can identify the differences that may be causal for disease and so you know to date um based on genetic analysis researchers have probably identified more than 5,000 genetic mutations that have a direct positive Ro in disease and so these are called genetic diseases they are usually um you know affecting a small population of individuals they're not they're not as common as things like cancer or diabetes or or these um what people call comp complex or or complicated diseases but but nevertheless um these are the ones where we know the exact genetic cause and so the tantalizing idea is then if you know the mutation in the genome we're not just going and fix it and so that's where gen editing comes in hey everyone welcome to the drive podcast I'm your host Peter AA

[00:01:32] hey fun thank you so much for detouring your your trip and coming through Austin I've been really looking forward to sitting down with you for uh frankly about a year um so this is a topic that I don't think there's anybody who's heard this podcast who hasn't heard the term crisper um but I think very few people can actually explain it um and explain what a powerful tool it is but I do think that before we get there it would be really helpful to kind of understand a little more about your journey on one hand and then the Journey of Gan editing kind of as a as a parallel but let let's start with with with yours um you and I overlapped a little bit because I mean not temporally but you were at Stanford and you uh were you a postto in Carl desero slab well first of all thank you for having me be on this P podcast I've listened to a podcast uh on and off uh especially when

[00:02:24] I'm um you know running around or or exercising and it's always I learn a lot from listening to the podcast awesome thank you for having me here um so back to Stanford um I was there as a graduate student uh I was in the lab of researcher uh named Carl daero and I was there for five years that's right you did your PhD there with Carl okay now as you know Carl was and I were classmates

[00:02:48] Carl's been on this podcast um and so maybe folks who either didn't listen to that podcast or who did but have forgotten give us a kind of a quick uh summary of the type of work that you and Carl did when I was working with car dierra uh we developed a technology called optogenetics and it's a way of studying uh brain cells in in the brain um how they are connected together and how they mediate a memory mediate different types of physiological function the way it works is that we took a gene uh from a green algae and this is a gene that senses light and converts it into U electrical current in the cell so we can put this Gene from the green algae right into the brain cells in the mouse and we can shine blue light or yellow light uh and control the brain activity in this mice so for example if you wanted to study uh sleep you can put this gene into different groups of cells in the brain and stimulate them and you can find out which ones of these are controlling wakefulness or which one are causing the mouth to become more sleepy uh so if you do this systemat ially one by one from one type of cell to another type of cell you can gradually start to put together a picture of how the brain is wir together and then also what are the different components that govern all sorts of behaviors uh from you know sleeping and wakefulness to thirst and hunger to memory and even to motivation and happiness um so it was really fun to be at Stanford and working with Carl yeah and and to me the thing that always stood out about the technique was just the resolution right it was you know I don't know what a great analogy would be but it was sort of you know resolution at the level of the word rather than the page if you were thinking about a book for example right uh what is incredible about these um ELO proteins is that they are very very fast so you can control uh the way the the brain cells are able to signal to each other at the action potential level so Action potentials are these individual signals that they're basically like the the phms of of the speech that one neuron speaks with another neuron and uh and you can control it at every single phon name level and and that is um pretty cool and since we're going to be talking a lot about Gene editing what was the technique that you guys used to insert those algal genes into the brains the way that you would put a gene uh into the brain uh is usually by using a virus um so this is uh a virus that that exists in nature but we have engineered it by removing everything that is pathogenic about the virus and then replacing those pathogenic genes with the gene that we're trying to put into the brain so in this case it's the gene from the green algae and by injecting the virus into a brain area that you want to study uh the virus will infect all the cells in that region and then make those cells begin to produce this

[00:05:54] ELO protein so once once the neuron starts to carry this ELO protein it becomes comes light sensitive so you can turn blue light on it and then be able to stimulate it yeah amazing um what year did you finish your PhD in 2009 okay and then you went to MIT or you went to the broad then then I went to Harvard I was there for about a year okay and then I went to MIT and bro uh right after that okay and then your attention there sort of turned you you you obviously worked some on optogenetics but what else did you sort of pivot into so uh as I as I was working on optogenetics and and especially toward the end of graduate school I began to realize that one of the biggest bottlenecks facing optogenetics is our ability to insert uh the ELO gene into specific places in the genome and and the reason for that is because in order for us to study different types of brain cells we need to have very precise targeting of different types of brain cells brain cells are not just one type neurons is not a single type there are probably you know hundreds of different types of brain cells the way that they're defined is based on their molecular property so each brain cell even though they all share the same genome they have different sets of genes that are turn on so that's that's why you know U brain cells that control pain sensation versus brain cells that are involved in

[00:07:23] Parkinson's disease are different so the way that you would Target one or another type of brain cell is by figuring out what are the molecular signatures of that cell so if you know that Gene a is turned out in that brain cell and not in another type of brain cell then you can insert this ELO gene into the region that's controlling G A that way it will only get turned on in in neuron uh you know that the first type of neuron and the way to insert this gene into that precise place in the genome require Gene editing and it was really hard to do at the time and so I thought maybe if I wanted to get optogenetics to become even more powerful and useful uh we need to make Gene editing more easy to use uh so by the time I I went to Harvard I began to focus more on trying to figure out how do you um more easily U be able to modify the genome yeah so this is to me where the story gets so interesting because you stumble across a problem that you're trying to solve because of your passion you've already alluded to why this is so difficult and I guess maybe just go back and explain something so that the listener understands why was it easy to do what you did in Carl's lab relatively speaking right where you're putting an entire gene into presumably an adov virus and letting the adov virus infect the neurons and stick a whole Gene in why is that a different problem than the one you just described that you started to solve at Harvard make sure everybody understands that distinction the work that I was doing when I was a graduate student with car diero is that we were we're simply trying to insert the gene into brain cells and when we did that we weren't as meaning you don't get to care where it goes specifically um we can get it into the rough area in the brain but there are many different types of cells there Y and so we weren't as precise in our ability to to Target those cells and we also developed some tricks to be able to get it into a specific type of cell but that was only limited to mice because we can genetically modify mice and uh and and it will take a long time it will take you know a year or two years to be able to make those um mice available uh to engineer them uh but it wasn't generally applicable and so especially if you think about how to uh turn optogenetics into a therapeutic to using the human um we certainly couldn't go and and use those transgenic

[00:09:58] Technologies to make it work in in the human brain uh so so this was a major major problem okay so let's keep that story on the side for a moment and let's tell in parallel another story a story that started long before um you were even in college right when you were when you were a young kid right um and it stems from an observation um that grew out of a discovery in sequences that existed in bacterial DNA a certain type of repeating structure they had all these interesting characteristics um so let's go back to the ' 80s and tell a little bit of that story and it's all obviously

[00:10:37] I wouldn't be going through this if it wasn't going to quickly converge with your life uh and change the direction of your life but let's go back to the 80s sure um I was born in the 80s y um but um what was really uh interesting that you're pointing out is that back in the 80s uh there was a group of Japanese researchers who were just looking at DNA sequences of bacteria and they were looking at um eoli and what they found is that within some of the genomes the

[00:11:05] DNA sequences of these bacteria there are these regions that are very repetitive so just repeat over and over and over again normally um genome sequences are not repetitive um because they incode genes and different genes uh but here you they found that there are these repeat sequences that are um that are all grouped together so they're clustered and they are not tendon repeat so it's not repeat one next to each other but they're interspaced by a short fixed length Gap and so it's basically a b a c a d a e a g um and so it just continues to uh repeat itself but in this regularly spaced pattern and when they first found it they had no idea what was what the sequence was all about and there's something else about those repeating segments that was quite interesting as well right which is in each Direction whichever way you read them they were the same right so they're called paland drums um no DNA is double stranded so there's a top Strand and there's a double strand there's a bottom

[00:12:15] Strand and so this is why uh they're they look like a double helix so they twist and and turn and uh what is interesting is that when when you read these repeat sequences from the top and you read in the reverse way on the bottom and they're almost the same so so they a palum so you had these palindromic clustered repeats that were in spaced and if you say that in the right way you get a few letters c r i s p r right crisper so the name crisper that term was actually coined nearly 40 years ago right is so crisper is really a brilliant acronym um and uh and so c r i p stands for exactly how these repeats look clustered regularly interspaced short palad dromic repeat so crisper it's it's really brilliant and it's very catchy but but this name wasn't the name that was given to these repeats um back in the 80s um in fact it had many different names did that name not come along until the 90s it didn't come until the early 2000s oh really okay I thought okay so before Francesco mojito he was came up with that name but I think that 2000s yeah now if my reading of the history is accurate understandably scientists in the 80s and 90s focused on the repeating segments obviously any good scientist I think would look at that and realize this is a very interesting observation how do we figure out what it is but the focus was on the repeating segments what you described as the a in the a b a c a d when did and I believe it was Francesco who was the first to observe that actually what's interesting is not the repeating segments it's the seemingly uninteresting segments in between them that are different exactly um so you know these these chrisopher repeats um they have this um conserved a uh sequence and this a of course you know repeats many many times is the most obvious thing and and usually when we are looking at things we we look for things that have the strongest signal so we have 203 repeats of the same sequence you know that's the strongest signal there is but it turns out that is not an interesting part the interesting part is actually the non-re repeating sequences that's interspaced between uh pairs of these repeats so Francis for Francisco

[00:14:53] Mika he's a Spanish researcher uh he's been looking at bacteria and and looking at at uh uh s weird sequences for for a long time and uh what he did um back in the early 2000s is that he took these NP sequences and he just you know searched against viruses uh in the in the bacterial world and u a few of them he found matched virus sequences and so that was really a breakthrough U because it started to highlight that maybe these non-re repeating sequences are foreign to the bacteria they came from somewhere else and somehow bacteria acquired them into this repeat pattern um and and that really started to to launch um the chrisopher revolution because that observation and that inference allowed people to start to realize that maybe this has something to do with how bacteria and the viruses are interacting with each other yeah what's interesting when you again look at that story is that when he tried to publish that finding it was rejected by virtually every uh significant Journal out there they viewed this as either incorrect uninteresting whatever uh it was ultimately published although I don't recall the name of the journal that first published that finding but it was you know many rungs below nature science

[00:16:15] Etc right the irony of science sometimes so um you know maybe folks we can remind them just how the human immune system works because just like bacteria we are ALS encountering viruses all the time uh viruses do nothing good for us just as they do nothing good for bacteria right you know we we we have a pretty negative relationship with viruses all they want to do is use us as host to replicate their their uh their genomic material and in the process they tend to make us sick so obviously when a virus infects a bacteria it's just using its genetic

[00:16:50] Machin to Machinery to replicate and it's going to kill the bacteria so as you said the bacteria needs a tool to fight back now we do it through the ation of antibodies um but how did this story continue to unfold what were the bacteria doing or what more to the point what did um what did Francesco realize was happening with this artifact Left

[00:17:14] Behind of viral DNA in the early days of chrisper research uh there were actually several different converging uh lines of work um so you know there's uh Francisco moika who's looking at uh these rep sequences within within the bacterial genome but then there were also other researchers who began to zero in on a group of genes so these are things that are telling the bacteria to make certain types of protein there are these certain genes that are right next to the repeats and it took a while for people to begin to associate the genes and the repeat to to be know together as as one uh single system but um the people who are studying the genes realize that these genes were carrying uh nucleases so nucleases are proteins that usually go and cut up either DNA or RNA and so they initially thought that maybe these genes were involved in DNA repair so for example Eugene kunan uh who is a really brilliant bioinformatician he's been studying these genes and and he um you know really started to zero in on on what biologically these genes may be doing but the linkage with these repeats uh took a little while longer to to get

[00:18:31] Associated but it was really when um you know the discovery that there are these viral sequences in the repeats and that there are these genes that are associated with the repeat that are involved in um say you know DNA cleavage that started to really um put together a framework for for thinking that maybe this is a system where these re these um surv viral sequence are working together with the DNA cleaving proteins to go and recognize viral sequences and try to cleave a virus sequences and we can put some names on these things so that people can start to see where the thing is going so you talked about these genes that were you know near but you know sort of at a distance from both the palindromic repeats and the inner spaced uh segments that we now realize were copies of viral

[00:19:28] DNA and as you said they coded for proteins or enzymes called nucleases which cut DNA and similarly we know we have helicases right so you have certain enzymes that can unwind the DNA so that they can go in and cut and these were referred to as crisper Associated proteins correct which is abbreviated as

[00:19:50] Cass so was Cass one and cast 2 the first that were identified in that regard um that's exactly right so so these genes that are right next to the crisper repeats uh they are called cast proteins although um they probably underwent many many different renaming um uh you know over the course of you know two decades but eventually um the the community researchers who were studying crisper proteins and crisper

[00:20:17] RNA uh they came together and and started to uh really curate these different genes and so cast one cast 2 cast 3 cast 4 Etc uh these are things that are kind of numbered based on part in part uh the order that they were discovered um so the most popular protein um is or or the most widely used protein now is called cast n and and this is one of the cast proteins that are found among array of many many different crisper proteins um and and so yeah so so these cast proteins work with the crisper RNA and crisal RNA refers to these repeats which are uh encoded in

[00:20:58] DNA but they are made by bacteria into RNA and those RNA are called crisper RNA and they don't incode protein and they simply are a short uh guide sequence that directs the the cast protein to find the target uh virus sequence and uh so so cast protein crisper RNA they together form a complex that go and provide a defense function for the bacteria and whereas our defense against a virus is going to be making an antibody Andor activating another type of immune cell with an antigen receptor on it called a te- cell the defense of the bacteria is simply to cut the genetic material of the virus to kill the virus obviously a much more directed approach um let's walk through two scenarios first infection reinfection and explain the difference between how the bacteria defends itself with special attention to the use of the crisper system and the C9 enzyme sure so so first of all first infection now out of the gate you're you're an ecoli I'm a bacteria phase you've never seen me before I come along I've I've just injected my viral DNA into you right so so crisper is an Adaptive immune system so it means this system can evolve with the bacteria to be able to accommodate many many virus infections so so when the virus which is called a bacterial Fage first infects the bacteria it will inject its genetic information into the bacteria the virus is usually very powerful and very potent it will probably wipe out most of the bacterial population but for a very small number of cells maybe one out of a million um the crisper system will successfully recognize a piece of the

[00:22:56] DNA of that virus and begin to insert it into this repeat area uh in in the crisper um system and how long a piece is that typically how many nucleotides in that piece it's usually 30 letters long okay and that is enough uh for the bacteria to uniquely recognize the virus so so anyway so during the first infection um you know most bacteria die very very small number of them begin to acquire a snippet of the genetic information of this virus and it inserts it into the crisper system so those bacteria that survived have now acquired immunity against these viruses and in the process of surviving what do they have to rapidly do to fend off that first viral infection well so the bacteria has many different defense systems in addition to crisper so in fact uh crisper is not the first line of defense there are other things that are also very powerful uh Technologies now they called restriction endonucleases these are proteins or enzymes that bacteria use uh they don't adapt so they don't evolve but they recognize fixed letter sequences and sometimes these will get these will always get activated first and and try to fend off the virus but if it doesn't then there are a host of other uh defense systems and uh one of these will eventually work but unfortunately for the bacteria population um these things don't come in quick enough and that's why most of the cells die but the few where these things were able to keep of the virus that's what allows the crisper systems to begin to acquire uh the genetic information so now let's talk about that subsequent infection so we've obviously through a very darwinian mechanism selected a subset of the eoli in this case that indeed are able to not just survive with their first and second line defense against the bacteria phase but now they've also developed the memory so to speak the way we would use the term right so now it's a month later uhhuh the same phage comes along infects you inserts its genetic material but now you actually have interspersed between your crisper repeats you actually have the 30 nucleotides that match a sequence within that virus so now how do you spring into action to resist this infection exactly so after first infection uh in a way the bacteria has been vaccinated against this virus so the second time when this virus comes around it will inject its genetic information into the bacteria Bia but now the bacteria in the crisper repeat area has a signature of this virus so the repeat area will get turned on and it will start to make crisper RNA that carry a 30 base paralon or 20 based parong guide that's able to recognize um the in the incoming virus so the cast protein will bind to these Crystal RNA they will go and try to search along all the DNA sequences in the bacteria when it finds a match in the virus's DNA it will activate the nucleuses and will cut the DNA and approximately how many base pairs are in viral DNA depends on the virus they can be uh small maybe 10,000 letters or they can be long 100,000 or even even longer yeah which again just for context so people understand we have about three billion right so we're still talking about tiny tiny tiny amounts of

[00:26:26] DNA and by the way does it differ if it's an RNA virus versus a DNA virus is the process identical uh it's very similar okay so the reinfection tends to be a they they tend to make pretty quick work because now once the V once the bacteria is able to make the cast protein which it can make really quickly it makes the in between the crisper segment it makes the uh the RNA segment to guide it and match it and really that's that's kind of a crisper RNA plus a truncated sort of other version of an

[00:27:02] RNA that holds the RNA in the cast protein correct and like we guess we call that whole thing the guide RNA how quickly can that c 9 enzyme holding the guide RNA how quickly in actual time does it does it go through the entire sequence of viral DNA until it finds its place to land and cleave that process probably pretty fast I don't know exactly how how quick it is uh but also is important to recognize that in a single bacteria there are many many copies of the cast n uh along with the guide RNA and so that means once the virus comes in there are many many cop copies of cast n that are simultaneously in parallel searching against the virus

[00:27:46] DNA to see whether or not there's a match and this is why the system is so powerful because it's able to you know very quickly in a parallel of fashion find the match and then inactivate the virus within minute within minutes yeah and there's something else that is pretty unique about where those cuts take place when we when we bring in the uh the viral memory it always begins with three particular nucleotides what's the significance of that right so um what is what you're talking about is uh is what crisper scientists call Pam sequence P or protospacer Json m just a Jaron um what is significant about that is that it it is a sequence that is only found in the bacterial viruses genome but not in the bacteria's genome so so when the bacteria acquires a piece of the viruses sequence and sticks it into its own genome one question is couldn't the crisper system go and recognize the virus's own genome now the bacteria yeah sorry the bacteria's genome and able to cut couldn't this thing it's sort of like couldn't you couldn't you turn the weapon on yourself and and cut your own DNA and kill yourself exactly yeah yeah so how does it avoid this self-targeting or autoimmunity against itself and and this is where the Pam sequence comes in the

[00:29:17] Pam sequence is in the viral genome is right next to the sequence that is acquired into the crisper system but it itself is not acquired into the V into the bacterial genome yeah and so what you see in the bacterial genomes crisper repeat is just the recognition sequence but no pen yeah and so cast requires the pen to activate recognition and cleavage and so without the pen um it doesn't cleave itself but is still able to

[00:29:46] Target a virus so Fang does this bring us more or less up to speed with the state-ofthe-art when you turned your attention to how can I create a finer resolution for Gene editing for my optogenetics problem is this about where the state-ofthe-art was yeah so um I started to uh work at MIT and the BR Institute uh in 2011 and so when I first started um I went to a a scientific U presentation and they were talking about crisper uh and they mentioned that uh

[00:30:19] Crispers are nucleases um because I was thinking about nucleuses and Gene editing at the time when I heard that word it just kind of um got me uh interested and so I went down to Wikipedia and looked at what chrisopher is and and Francis moika and S Mo and Roda baru they had just published the very early uh studies on the cast n system back then it was still called cast 5 it was only later on renamed to be cast n but but there was all these papers that if you read them there aren't too many of them you can piece together the information and you can get a sense that this is RNA guided DNA targeting and cleaving enzyme and U and at the time there were other uh Gene editing systems that were being worked on by researchers in the field something called Zing finger nucleas or or Talon uh and and these are systems that use proteins to recognize DNA but not using

[00:31:18] RNA to recognize DNA so maybe let's talk a little bit about both of those because they were the state-of-the-art up until 15 years ago and um I want to understand both how they work and why they may not have been sufficient for your application in other words why why were you looking for something Beyond two techniques that already existed sure so when I first became interested in gene editing um in the you know uh sort of late 2000s um there were people already developing Gene editing Technologies in fact um there were multiple iterations of technologies that that came around uh there's something called Mega nucleas was just very very early and then uh what got me excited was a

[00:32:00] New York Times article I think it was 2008 or 2009 uh it talked about um a system called Zin finger nucleus uh there's a company uh in in uh California U that's called Sango biosciences and they were already developing zinc finger nucleuses for gene therapy to be able to go and edit DNA and treat disease but

[00:32:23] Zin finger was a really uh challenging system for scientists to adapt and use because it required very sophisticated protein engineering U the way it works is that um zinc fingers are are protein domains they're just one glob of protein each finger each zinc finger can recogniz three letters of DNA and they occur in nature so you can find them in naturally occurring DNA binding proteins called transcription factors and they allow transcription factors to go and recognize different genes in the genome to modulate their activity either turn them on or turn them off or change how much they are expressing the cell but how do you get specificity when you are only recognizing three nucleotides the probability of three those three nucleotides showing up seems pretty likely across the genome right right exactly so so Nature has solved this problem by forming zinc finger arrays so they tether multiple fingers together uh and all of them have to hit their target of three nucle correct that's right so if you have an array of three fingers they recognize as nine letters if you have array of six fingers then that's 18 letters so in a complicated genome like our genome with three billion letters 18 would give us uniqueness so 18 can't allow you to find or Define just a single position and that's because four to the power of 18 is a big enough number it's bigger than 3 billion yeah okay so um let's now now talk about the talons why first of all what is that technique and why was that not necessarily going to serve your purpose right so so the challenge with Z finger is that you have to engineer the fingers to recognize different combinations three letters and you have to make sure that when you tether them together to make a Zing finger array they can recognize what you intend to recognize in that multiple 3 fashion that turned out to be really cumbersome and usually it doesn't work very well so then um this other system that you mentioned called transcription activator like effector t uh nucleus will developed uh so these systems came also from bacteria uh they came from uh a specific pathogenic bacteria called zamonas or resi so it lives on Rice plants and it's a major rice pathogen the way these proteins work is that they're injected by the bacteria that's trying to colonize the plant into the pl cell and once it gets inside it homes into the Genome of the pl cell finds a gene and then starts to turn it on when it turns it on it allows the bacteria to it allows the plant to become more susceptible to the bacterial colonization and so allows the bacteria to be able to more successfully uh survive on this host uh plant so it's it's a it's a major pathogenic system but what is really cool about Talons or tails is that they recognize DNA in a in a sort of a very programmable fashion these proteins they have repeat domains just like Zing fingers that form a array but individual domains recognize single

[00:35:45] DNA letters and so you can find these tail proteins in the bacteria that have 12 or 16 or even 20 different repeats and so they can recognize is long stretches of you know 12 or or 16 or 18 or 20 uh DNA letters in the pl genom PL genum is also large they are sometimes you know two three times the size of AR genum so recognizing long sequences is important for achieving uh precision and so so that that was the tail system so what is really cool is that uh AA bonus uh who who is a researcher in Germany and also Adam banov who is a researcher in uh Iowa at I will state at the time they discover that there's a specific code for how these tail proteins recognize DNA it turns out that within each one of these repeats there are two amino acid letters that correspond with a specific DNA letter that it that it binds to and so if you take any tail protein and you just dial in different combinations of these two amino acids in each one of the domain you can specify what DNA uh this tail protein is able to recognize so it turned out to be much more easy to use than Zing fingers so were you satisfied with that or I mean obviously you weren't you were you were you were sitting there looking up

[00:37:11] Wikipedia for what crisper is when you heard about it so something must have said to you hey this is as good as the talons are and as much as they're an improvement over zinc fingers they're still not good enough why was that why were they not good enough so so so Zing fingers were really hard to use and and um you know when I tried to engineer it it was very hard very difficult almost impossible for for just a single researcher to get something that would recognize the DNA sequence that you're trying to get it to recognize so it's very hard to use uh talents on the other hand were easier um but the repetitive nature of these proteins made it quite cumbersome to engineer new proteins to recognize the sequence you're trying to edit so for example if you wanted to be able to modify um a specific Gene it would it could take you um maybe several weeks or even a couple months to be able to successfully make one of these uh tail proteins and when you do that usually it works but not always and and sometimes it's not very effective is that because it's so difficult to predict the folding structure of the protein even if you know its sequence like what why what why would it take that long it's long because because from a technical perspective these sequences are just very hard to work with they are very prone to because they're very similar to each other they're PR to rec combination so in order to get a tail to work you have to in a very precise way put every domain in the correct order because you're trying to recognize AG

[00:38:47] GTC you have to put it together in ag GTC you can't have AC GT it just wouldn't work so to put repetitive sequences together together and light them up in exactly the order you want um that is really challenging to do okay it's it's possible but it's very challenging so it's very interesting I mean I think it's worth just sort of taking a step back right I mean if if most people can sort of remember what they were thinking 10 years ago you know 12 15 years ago and you know look the the human genome was sequenced uh nearly 25 years ago and the promise of gene therapy mhm um was sort of hailed as right around the corner and yet here we are a decade more than a decade after the sequencing of the human genome and it doesn't appear that gene therapy through Gene editing was any closer than it really was from a practical standpoint a decade earlier I think that's a bit of a disconnect for people

[00:39:48] I think most people who necessarily aren't in a lab would be surprised to understand that simply knowing what the sequence of genes are I mean a we've talked about this a lot in the podcast we still have no idea what most of these genes do anyway uh we have no idea why there are coding segments and the majority of the DNA is non-coding segments and yet some of these non-coding segments are where mutations exist that result in disease I mean all this stuff's still a bit of a mystery um but here you're sort of getting at the central or maybe the most important or jugular question which is if a person has a disease like cystic fibrosis or CLE cell anemia where we really know in unambiguous terms where on the DNA uh where where in the gene this this lies where in the DNA we know what the substitution is we know which C was turned into a g or a T and all we need to be able to do is go in there and fix it that was something we couldn't do 10 years ago MH I I think for many people that's quite surprising m M um and I know that that's not the problem you were trying to solve but it's obviously the world you are you know you've created um so so let's let's talk about the the steps down that that road so you you figure this thing you figure out what crisper is you bring yourself up to the state of our discussion today what's the next thing the next thing in terms of crisper yeah the next thing that you're starting to now pursue I mean how are you now going about solving your problem for your good cuz I'm guessing at this point you're still sort of like at what point do you realize you're working on a problem that has a far bigger application than just solving your problem I think pretty quickly U since I started to work on Gene editing um because um you know the human genome um was know the Human Genome Project was completed early 2000s and with the human genome having been sequenced and then also with

[00:41:52] DNA sequencing technology becoming cheaper and faster um scientists were able to start to sequence many many more genomes and so they can start to make comparisons between healthy individuals and also people who are affected by specific diseases to see what's different between their genomes and by doing that comparison they can identify the differences that may be causal for disease and so you know to date um based on genetic analysis researchers have probably identified more than 5,000 uh genetic mutations that have a direct causitive role in disease and so these are called genetic diseases they are usually um you know affecting a small population of individuals they're not they're not as common as things like cancer or diabetes or or these um what people call comp complex or or complicated diseases but but nevertheless um these are the ones where we know the exact genetic cause and so the the tantalizing idea is then if you know the mutation in the genome we're not just going and fix it and so that's where gen editing comes in and uh and and people have since the very beginning been trying to realize this idea uh they were trying to work on it using Mega nucleases they were trying to solve this using Zing finger nucleases uh they were certainly trying to use it uh use Talons to also uh treat diseases this way but the challenge is that they weren't very efficient and it was also difficult to apply them uh to be able to treat the disease uh with sufficient amount of efficacy when chrisper came along um especially with cast 9 uh it was much easier uh to be able to uh design strategies to to addit DNA and uh and and and that made it much more um feasible for many many groups to to really start to work on this idea so at this were you finished with your post talk and now starting your own lab yeah

[00:43:58] I had just started my lab uh at MIT okay so you've got how many phds in your lab I probably had uh maybe you know 10 PhD students okay and a couple of posts to boot yeah and these people have all come to you presumably because they're interested in optogenetics yeah they were interested in different things okay um yeah um so at what point do you come back into the lab and say I'm going to hit pause on the optogenetics problem I'm going to kind of go down this crisper path for a while I think when I when I first started my lab um I was already uh sort of focused on the gene editing problem and so when students came to me even though they came to me wanting to work on abog genetics um I I had to convince them that there's this other problem that is also interesting and uh maybe we can try to work together and make a difference there um and so I I started to try to tell them about chrisper tell them about um Gene editing and all the potential applications all right so keep keep going down the story now so it's it's the early 2010s what are the next steps that you take to uh develop this technology so when I started the work so when I first started my lab um I was uh working on talents and then and then very quickly I had learned about uh crisper and then I started to also um sort of get crisper uh projects going on uh going in the lab and um and we worked on both systems for a while at the same time uh we pretty quickly realized that talents uh were difficult to use because of of the the cumbersome nature of how to make them and then because of that um the promise of crisper was much more apparent so maybe I'll give another analogy um so we now have a mobile phone and on a phone there are many different apps U apps that help you book trips apps that helps you send messages to your friends and family uh apps that allow you to take photos um you have a phone and a phone can do everything uh you just load the app onto it with talents or Z fingers the diff the analogy would be you have to build a different device for each one of these functions so for each you need a different phone for each different Hardware y yeah so for every

[00:46:21] Gene you're trying to Target you have to build a brand new protein to be able to Target that Gene and that is very cumbersome and and and not very effective process with crisper the promise is that crisper is like the smartphone you can load software onto it to recognize different genes and the software is the crisper RNA these rnas are very easy to to chemically synthesize and you can uh

[00:46:48] Define the gene by reading off the sequence of the gene which is already completed through the Human Genome Project so all of that was just you know a step function uh improved over the zinc finger and talent technology um so so anyway so so so we realize that if we can make crisper work um not only in a bacteria but but put it into a human cell and get it to recognize things um genes in the human cell and then we can have a much more powerful and much more democratized Gene editing system so what was the Breakthrough or set of breakthroughs that led to the uh utility of this and did it start with let's just silence a gene first I mean let's figure out how to go in and with Precision bombing silence one gene was that the first problem before the let's actually take a strand of Novel

[00:47:48] DNA and put it in right so uh crisper is a natural nucleus so in bacteria it uses the guide RNA to recogniz the virus DNA and then once he recognizes it it will cleave the virus DNA so make a double stranded DNA Break um and and so that's what we're trying to um so make happen in the human cell uh we try to program cast n um with a guide RNA to can to go and recognize a specific Gene in the human genome and then be able to cut it which is valuable I mean there are certain cases where overexpression of a gene is pathologic and if we silence a gene we fix disease exactly and so um so uh there were um a lot of studies done on how uh breaks in the DNA would get uh repaired so Maria Jason uh Jim Haber they had studied U maybe a couple decades before that um how DNA repairs would will get processed and so what they found is that when you make a cut in the DNA so when you make a break it will activate repair processes in our cell so in fact our DNA get DNA breaks all the time and we have a robust process to be able to fix them to and prevent mutations so so anyway so what

[00:49:06] Maria Jason and Jim Haber found is that if you make a cut in the DNA that cut will activate one of two different repair processes the first rep repair process will glue the DNA together usually correctly but in a very very small number of instances it will introduce a mistake mhm and that mistake WIll inactivate the gene so will no longer make the protein product that is supposed to make and this is very useful if you wanted to inactivate Something in the cell uh sometimes there there are mutations that are delerious and if you can inactivate that delerious mutation then you can make the cell healthy again and so that was a very powerful method the second repair process is called homology directed repair HDR and this relies on a template DNA that carries the sequence that you're trying to repair with and so if you make a cut and you also provide a template DNA then the repair process will copy whatever that's on a template into the DNA break site and this is a more powerful way to be able to change the DNA sequence in in a design fashion is there a risk when you cut the DNA and it repairs that it repairs in a manner that remains pathologic even if it's distinct from the path that was already there it is possible um but but the probability is much much lower okay yeah what about kind of the Holy Grail which is to literally edit a new Gene to to put something in that didn't exist um what was required to take that leap yeah so um so you know there are different ways that you may want to change the DNA sequence you may want to inactivate something you may want to delee something and you may want to insert something so to do each one of these you need to have um uh a Machinery that will allow you to uh do that so the Holy

[00:51:08] Grail would be to be able to insert a gene into anywhere you want uh precisely and also very efficiently and and to date that ability is still not quite there yet uh we're still working on and many other groups are working on developing Technologies to make that happen uh with high enough efficiency uh we can do it now with very low level maybe less than a perc or maybe just single digit percent uh but for a big

[00:51:39] Gene that we're trying to put in uh we we don't have a good way to do that yet okay so currently is it possible to snip DNA anywhere you want with the current technology yeah with chrisper with C9 we can we can pretty much Target throughout the G know and it make Cuts so what diseases are currently amenable to that type of gene therapy and we'll put aside the regulatory stuff which we can talk about but if we were dealing if we pretended that humans were laboratory animals um where we could do an experiment and actually do this what what are some of the diseases that we could directly affect in that manner so um so there are a lot of genetic diseases where there is a mutation that is pathogenic ere expression well in this case overexpression if you want to deactivate it but some would be underexpressed of course yeah so so these are genes that are usually important for the body U but there's a mutation in it um and uh and that makes the the resulting protein uh the mutant protein um delerious for for for the patient and so so if you can inactivate these genes uh then then you can you can treat disease so for example there are diseases in the liver where there are certain proteins that cause uh osis um and and that can lead to serious problems and so by using crisper you can go in and cleave these genes inactivate them so that they no longer produce this toxic Gene product uh Huntington is another example uh where there are mutations that are occurring in the gene that makes the the Gene delerious and um and so if you can go and try to inactivate these delerious mutations it may be possible to to treat the disease is it generally the case that autosomal dominant diseases are an overexpression problem or an expression of something harmful problem whereas recessive diseases are uh the opposite where you tend to not be producing enough or something of that is that is that a overly simplistic but I think that yeah

[00:53:43] I think that's a good U good explanation so many people are probably familiar with Huntington because it is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases imaginable perhaps second only to luk er's disease or ALS um but unlike ALS where we don't really know the ideology we clearly know the ideology of

[00:54:02] Huntington's disease which is a gene right it's a genetic disease it's an autosomal dominant gene and um you know sadly it doesn't present until later in life so many times uh individuals will pass this gene on prior to the symptoms being manifest and therefore they go on to suffer the fate of this disease having already passed it on right um so what what can tell us a little bit about

[00:54:28] Huntington's disease and why it may or may not be amenable to this type of treatment so Huntington's disease is caused by um by mutations in a gene called Huntington and this is a gene that's expressing the brain and um and in in mutated form this Gene uh occs an expansion of repeat sequences within the

[00:54:49] Gene and um and the longer the repeat is the more delerious it is for the patient and so the idea would be to try to uh shorten these repeats uh or or maybe if you can reduce the amount of repeated sequence uh of the RNA that's expressed you could also uh get get a cell to be healthier the challenges are the repeats happen within the coding region of the gene so the region that is important for making the protein sequence so in order to uh make the resulting edit um successful you have to do it very precisely you cannot delete um you have to delete exactly um know three letters at a time from from the repeat sequence otherwise you would shift the frame and the gene remind me has how many um how many base pairs uh the gene has thousands of base pairs okay so it's a huge Gene yeah so and and these repeats can also be you know several hundred or maybe a thousand repeats long and so you want to be able to delete them very precisely um so so that is one challenge uh the other challenge is to be able to deliver the gene editing machineries into the brain and get to enough cells and uh and there are some virus based technologies that are are you know coming along um but but still we don't have U probably the the most suitable uh method yet so let's talk about delivery a little bit how do you do this so we you know we now have this idea hopefully people kind of um can wrap their head around this somewhat challenging idea of what crisper is and maybe we can again just sort of summarize it right you have a crisper vehicle right would be a C9 protein um and you also have a guide RNA that is made up of both the piece that you actually want to put in wrapped around another sort of um Tracer piece that holds it firmly in the uh C9 protein that C9 protein by the way does it require its own heila case to open the no it can do it itself beautiful so it's a it's a oneman shop that runs up the the host DNA opening it and waiting to find its match and it waits and waits and waits and then it Finds Its match holds the strands of DNA at the cast 9 and then clip CHR and obviously if you then put in something can so how do you actually deliver the cast 9 protein to an individual right so so that that is really the Big Challenge uh so right now there are clinical applications of crisper uh for treating different diseases uh disease in the blood like

[00:57:38] CYO cell disease or diseases in the liver uh diseases in the eye and and many other places and so depending on where you're are trying to uh deliver crisper into um there are different technologies that people use so let's take the yeah maybe the simplest might be in the blood okay so um tell people what CLE cell anemia is and why it's amenable to this type of therapy right so CLE cell anemia is caused by a mutation that causes the dread blood cell to sickle so they form a sickle form and so they they're not able to uh sort of um you know property function and sometimes they can Aggregate and then this can cause occlusion in the blood vessel and can cause serious problems and um and so these red blood cells are made by U progen or stem cells in the body um that produce these repa cells and so one idea for treating and it's a simple mutation it's a simple it's a single it's a single point mutation that changes one amino acid and that one amino acid based on one base pair change I can't remember what it is it's an alanine to a glycine or something it's it's quite trivial um is what leads to all of this bad this

[00:58:50] Downstream bad Badness you talk about um but now if you so current treatment for these patients is blood transfusions right I mean it's a it's a it's an awful disease and these patients experience unbearable pain um as an aside some might ask why does this disease exist why didn't Darwin get rid of this well it turns out there's an advantage to having the trait for malaria right so it turns out that if you have one copy of the sickle Gene and the other one is normal you have normal looking red blood cells you don't get the disease but you get protection as you said from malaria so that would keep this propagating particularly in a malaria Rich area like Africa this is why it's much more prevalent in a black population than a white population because it offered some benefit but if you have two copies of the gene you get the sickling those are not the people that are passing on their genes historically they would have perished before reproduction and and also just perished in in a great deal of pain but nevertheless here we are today so okay you have to be able to go into into the bone marrow to make this change because there's no point in doing this if you have to do this every week you want to do it one and done right once that's right yeah so well one of the promises of Gene editing is that it can provide a single treatment that is a cure for the disease and so in the case of CLE cell what uh what happens is that uh the doctor will mobilize the stem cells the bone marrow cells from the patient get them to come out and be able to harvest these bone marrow cells and they don't necessarily do this with a marrow aspirate they do it by giving them medications that cause them to secrete more progenitor cells into the plasma that's right this is the current um s practice in the medical field okay and so they will they will get the patient uh Harvest their bone marrow cells and these cells are going to be U sort of modified in the laboratory uh where uh researchers will take the the RNA the the messenger RNA for c n so this will allow the cell to produce the cine protein and they will also take the guide RNA maybe just tell folks really quickly sorry to interrupt to fun but um maybe just explain really quickly for people the relationship of do EA DNA RNA messenger RNA protein it's the central dogma but that way when you say what you're about to say they'll know why it works yeah so so there are different ways to get a protein to the cell um and and the way that uh proteins are made in the cell is that they're encoded in DNA and the DNA has to be transcribed into messenger RNA and that RNA is then translated by the ribosome into the protein and so if you can put into a cell either the DNA the gene for castai or the messager RNA for C9 or the protein for cast U the cell will eventually have C9 because if you put in the D DNA the cell will start to make mRNA based on it and the r mRNA will get translated into the protein or if you put in mRNA then but how do you put it in the DNA isn't that the whole problem that we're trying to solve right so there are different ways to put these things in um so for DNA you can um just use a virus you can use a virus or you can uh if you're working with cells in the petri dish you can directly uh electroporate uh the DNA into the cell and this is done by Zing the cell with the electrical current it will rupture the membrane when the membrane ruptures things can leak in so if you have DNA that's outside the cell when the cell membrane ruptures the DNA that's outside the cell will flow into the inside the cell and get into the cell and uh and this is actually how people uh treat CLE cell disease except they're not putting

[01:02:40] DNA into the cell they're putting mRNA so they incubate um these boneo stem cells that have the CLE cell mutation in a bath of mRNA for cast n and the guide RNA and the guide r R separate these okay separate and it's amazing that once those cells acquire both the MRNA for cast 9 and the MRNA that is corresponding to the guide it will it will translate into a cast 9 protein it doesn't translate guide RNA into a protein it just stays there and they find each other that's correct and they

[01:03:21] I mean again it's it is so remarkable to me that by ology it's so remarkable to me that anything Works in this universe but that's that's up there as one of those things that kind of just amazes me this is this is really the the result of the biotechnology uh re re Revolution the molecular biology um you know the uh discoveries that have really under sort of paved the the the biotechnology

[01:03:46] Revolution and now what is the efficiency of that process so once you go ahead and put those two bits of very different RNA ofone marrow cells this can be efficient okay um so in the in the laboratory or or in these petri dish settings uh this can be you know approaching 100% okay so now within a very short period of time you have cut out and also reinserted the C it's just a single it's a single base pair so what are they doing what's the exact thing you're asking C 9 to do here actually for cyle cell the treatment that has recently been approved at the end of last year is actually different okay um and and the the way the treatment works is that uh for Cle cell patients it's been found that for some individuals who have the CLE cell mutation um if they also carry another mutation or or if they somehow is able to express the fetal version of hemoglobin mhm then their C cell symptoms are much much less and so for treating CLE cell patients with Gene editing the therapy actually goes and modifies a different

[01:05:11] Gene um sort of modulates his expression to then allow the feto hemoglobin Gene to turn on and why is that an easier solution than simply changing the one amino acid that's broken in the first place because the way it works is that it simply makes a cut um and it doesn't require that's right I see so we're still at the point where in vitro we're still better off with a cleavage just a straight cut of the DNA than even a single base pair switch to fix one amino acid that's that ladder is a harder problem the ladder is a harder problem but there's also very good progress on that front okay so for example David Le uh developed a methodology yeah also yeah he's a colleague of mine and he developed a technology called base editing and base editing allows you to use cast 9 you you get rid of the DNA cleaving activity of cast 9 and so so it simply goes and binds the DNA so you use it as kind of a guidance system to direct a different enzyme called the dmas to be able to go and and chemically modify a single base it's amazing to me fun that that is easier than what we just wish we could do which is change that c to a g take out the C make it a

[01:06:40] GH and that will give me the amino acid I want like the fact that we're chemically having to modify it with a deaminase um what do you think is necessary to take this next cuz we've already had as described at a big step function from where we were 10 years ago right what's going to be required for the next step function for the science fiction to start yeah so I think this really goes back to the division of genetic medicine uh genetic medicine is very powerful uh crisper is as part of it but it is really a two component system there is the medicine the the medicine itself and then there's also the delivery technology so you need to have the right uh vehicle for delivery and the right payload to be able to treat the disease in the right cell so and we're limited more on the delivery than pay delery so so the payload technology has come a long way you know we now have mRNA we have cast 9 we have base editing we have

[01:07:45] Prime editing we have a lot of different types of uh editing technology and even epigenetic editing um but the bottleneck is how do we put these really powerful payloads into the right cells in the right tissue in the body say those again what were our tools cast 9 base pair editing yeah we have we have cast n we have base editing we have Prime editing we have different recombinases we have uh epigenetic modifiers uh that also are based on cast 9 uh we have mRNA we have sna we have a lot of different things that can modulate uh and modify cells yeah we I want to I want to should come back and talk about the Epi uh genetic modification using cast 9 um so it's it's it's not a payload problem it's a delivery problem right yeah um and and it's also a biological problem right because many diseases will not be amendable to this so you know I'm sure everybody thinks well Peter we've heard you say that cancer is a genetic disease does that mean that once we solve the delivery problem we solve cancer why is that not necessarily true um and that that is because cancer is caused by many different uh risk um mutations in the cell and so it it's it's difficult to treat cancer by correcting the mutation um because you really have to be able to correct at a very very high efficiency if you have a few cells a few cancer cells that have not been corrected those cells will continue to divide and replicate and form tumors and even metastasize and so so that that is really challenging but but people are using gene editing uh in the cancer therapeutic context what they're doing is that they are using gene editing to engineer immune cells so that the immune cells are more potent at recognizing and killing cancer cells and this is part of what's called immunotherapy everybody's talking about

[01:09:52] AI um does AI enable this any better on either side on the payload side or on the delivery side AI is very powerful for protein engineering um in the in the past few years there's been amazing breakthrough uh in the use of AI for predicting protein structures um you know each protein is uh is made of a unique sequence of amino acids and the unique sequence allows the protein to fold into a specific shape and and one of the Holy Grail problems for a long time has been how do you take just the letters of a protein and predict what the shape of the protein looks like and uh and and this is something that many many scientists um have worked on for a long time but hasn't been able to come up with a good solution um but it was really in 2020 21 um the the use of AI um by by this uh group called Deep Mind uh that was able to come up with a solution called alphao 2 MH and alphao 2 is a AI based system that has learned from all the structures of proteins that scientists have experimentally determined and when they solved um those structures there's a huge database of them and they were able to use AI to look at all of them and learn from that that large database to then come up with a prediction system called Alpha 2 yeah

[01:11:22] I mean it's it's amazing to me maybe maybe just explain to people again um so let's pick a pick your favorite protein how how many amino acids are in it in the primary sequence we can pick pick the the green floresent protein from jellyfish maybe 300 amino acids 300 it's a relatively small protein yeah okay so um it has a primary structure which is like what are the actual amino acids correct it has a secondary structure which is like well when does it actually form a helix when does it form a sheet it has a tertiary structure which is kind of like how it starts to bend and then it has this quinary structure which is how the whole thing fits together in complicated three-dimensional folds exactly what you said a moment ago is if a scientist wants to make a protein and they know what it needs to look like they kind of know what the quatron structure is I got to get this protein I got to design a molecule that fits in that receptor right it's almost a trial and error problem to go from the primary sequence to that right you're saying that we AI is really good at doing this thing where it knows the relationship between primary sequence and final quatron structure is that just literally linear regression at a level we've never understood it because humans can't do it but is it basically just solving the world's most complicated linear regression problem I think at the very fundamental level that that is what what is happening um um but but you know the human brain we can process so much data um uh you know very effectively but will

[01:13:02] AI uh you can uh you you can have these massive neural networks that that can really process this let's go back to animal models for a moment um you touched briefly on the idea of a transgenic Mouse and again people who have listened to this podcast for years are no stranger to the transgenic Mouse so many amazing breakthroughs in science have come through through these and and frankly just through genetic understanding of Of Mice making changes to a mouse Gene you know we recently had

[01:13:32] Dina dual on the podcast we talked about clotho to me one of the most interesting proteins out there and of course we learned the story of how clotho came about and it be you know silencing a gene found this thing overexpress the gene found this thing okay how does crisper enable that today has it changed the ability of people working on totally other problems to get there quicker using laboratory animals right so you know trans Mouse technology really revolutionize biology um and and when the transgenic

[01:14:08] Mouse technology was developed um the way it worked is that you would start with stem cells for mice you would modify these stem cells and then you put the stem cells back into a embryo and then you transplant the embryo into a a mouse that the embryo can develop into a full um develop into fetus and then be born as a new mouse that is a very long process and then once the mouse is born usually that Mouse does not have 100% of that uh genetic modification so the mouse is called a mosaic and then you have to take that Mouse and breathe the mouse again with another mouse and hoping that um that the Mosaic part is the one that gets expressed and transed basically try to concentrate the Mosaic portion of it exactly yeah so when you use this methodology um it can take probably a year or maybe even longer uh to be able to generate a specific transend Mouse so it used to take a long time to do this um but but now with crisper technology uh what people can do is they can directly inject the Gen editing cast n guide RNA into a embryo into a single cell embryo and then modify there uh so again this is so brilliant because we can't do this in humans of course I mean we could but that's a whole ethical discussion we shouldn't talk about but we can directly do this so we can make a transgenic Mouse in one go exactly so the mouse gestation period is 21 days so after 21 days you have a transend mouse

[01:15:44] I mean what has this done to the field of of biomedical research it has accelerated biomedical research dramatically so imagine yourself as a graduate student and usually a PhD will take 5 years if it takes you years and a lot of that time is the rote work of transfecting mice and waiting for yeah yeah so if you have to wait two years to get a mouse so that you can begin your experiment that is a long time so now with crisper or Gene editing you can get a mouse in you know two three months so let's play devil's advocate for a moment when you did your PhD you had to slog through the oldfashioned way mhm were there hidden benefits of that in other words that it give you more time to read more time to be curious more time to fail do you again it's a tangential discussion but do you worry that with this remarkable Precision Tool that budding scientists are missing out on an experience that you and your entire generation and everyone before you had or do you think that that's a relatively small price to pay for the pace of development I I I'm not too concerned about it um I think um if we accelerate the accumulation knowledge the acquisition data I think that would really help science move a lot faster um

[01:17:03] I think you know in in the future uh especially with higher throughput Technologies crisper DNA sequencing and many other things together we're going to be accumulating new data for biology at an exponential pace and we're not only going to be relying on our own ability to analyze data but we're going to have ai to help us um you know these large systems that can draw much much larger uh regression analysis and and with that I think biology Discovery and and disease um sort of treatment development will really accelerate uh I think that's a really exciting future now we've talked a lot about cast 9 um but you've also specifically done quite a lot with another protein another crisper Associated protein called C 13 what's the difference and uh how does this potentially impact future work sure crisper is uh a bacterial immune system and there are many many different types of crisper and so in nature um bacteria are invaded by DNA viruses by RNA viruses all sorts of different viruses cast n protects bacteria against DNA viruses but then there also needs to be a crisper system that protects against

[01:18:22] RNA viruses so cast 13 is the the RNA analog of C9 it uses a guide RNA to recognize the RNA virus and then cleave the RNA genome and what is really interesting about C 13 is that um unlike C 9 it not only cleaves the recognized RNA but once it recognizes piece of RNA it also turns on almost a suicidal function it goes and Cleaves any other

[01:18:51] RNA that's in the bacterial cell and so in the infection cycle uh you can think of this as a altruistic um sort of uh uh system where um when a when when the CER te recognizes um my my my cell has been infected by RNA virus I'm going to shut myself down kill the cell and save the population so hang on why is that the case um if we so so why does the cell not choose to do that with the D DNA virus are RNA viruses necessarily more lethal to bacteria RNA is usually more abundant and so usually there are many many once once the RNA gets produced there are many copies and so it's difficult to to shut down every single copy of RNA whereas with DNA there's usually just one copy of DNA so if you can shut it down so when a DNA virus infects a bacteria right so again let's just talk about a very specific bacteria phase latches on the outside of coli it's going to shoot in a piece of DNA right we've already talked at length about how that works and the role cast 9 plays in that when a different bacteria phase comes along you're saying it inserts a lot of RNA no um so just the

[01:20:12] RNA replicates much quicker replicates quicker okay so it inserts a small amount of RNA but remind me why a small amount of RNA will be Amplified much quicker than a small amount of DNA is it because it's one step left it's already made the Machinery to go in front of the Translating ribosome exactly because DNA has to go to RNA to make protein makes sense that go back to make the so you're saying cast 13 also has a suicide feature and this suicide feature um is actually quite useful for developing Diagnostics

[01:20:46] Technologies and so uh especially you know during covid we we use C 13 to develop a way to uh to detect Corona virus RNA and uh and then it sort of provided a way to to have a a simple and Rapid uh detection method so say more about that was that really the first application uh on large scale one of the first applications yeah and how would that have been done before and what was the speed and accuracy of it being done in that way right so uh so so the most widespread method for Diagnostics is using PCR yes so it checks for the nuclear acid sequence but PCR is a laboratory based test it requires a machine called a PCR machine uh which is you know complicated to run and you have to be in a laboratory environment to to go through the test uh what CER team provided is something that's more similar to antigen test uh where you can run it uh at a point of care or or even potentially at home um and uh and it was simply uh required to take a swab uh to have the sample you mix the sample into a buffer um and then and then certin would react in that buffer to be able to detect the virus sequence then you load it onto a paper strip it will run and then um you see whether or not a band shows up okay when we think now about Gene editing going forward and again we've already established that the payload is not the problem it's the targeting and the delivery what are the relative advantages and disadvantages of C 9 versus C 13 and are there other Cass or crisper Associated proteins out there that might even be better than both of them sure so um so cast 9 and cast 13 both have therapeutic applications but one of the challenge is that they are large proteins cast n is uh 1,300 amino acids long and certin are usually around a thousand Mino acids long so they're fairly large proteins and how long was cast 99 uh 1300 Amo acids okay and so in order to get cast 9 uh into into a cell you have to be able to fit cast n and the guide RNA into your delivery system and uh and if you're using viral vectors to deliver uh they are usually very

[01:23:14] Compact and and you can barely fit C9 in so then um the nice thing is what if you have something that's smaller and so we and also many other groups have worked on trying to discover new proteins that are more compact um and and more uh sort easily packageable and uh and and there are some out there but sometimes and usually they're not as specific or not as active as casai and so there are tradeoffs uh to using some of those systems and uh and and we working on engineering them and and and there's a lot of good progress turning the turning those systems into uh specific and uh comfortably active systems as cast so what would be if if if you could wave a magic wand how big a cast protein would you tolerate such that your cast Protein

[01:24:08] Plus your guide RNA would easily fit into your delivery vehicle would you want to be half that size and be 500 amino acids do you need to be smaller than that if you could shrink it down to 1,000 base pairs so 300 amino acids that that would be ideal but but I think that's that is challenging to do yeah and let's maybe make sure I understand why right you're saying look at the end of the day I Need A protein that has the structural Integrity to hold the guide RNA in place right make its way down into the nucleus open up the DNA so it's basically two enzymes it's a helicase and a nucleus a nuclease and it has to be able to march along the

[01:24:48] DNA recognize while holding you know it's just again it's a mechanical problem if you really stop to think about it just on the smallest level and then hold cut boom insert eventually and you're saying at some point we just abut the limits of physics like I need a certain amount of amino acids to make that structure but you it sounds to me like you're saying um you don't believe that that exists in protein in exists in nature you're not out there looking for a 300 amino acid Cass protein anymore you're now G to say let's use AI to help us build one well there are there are uh natural forms of uh proteins that are small and and are like Cas okay in fact um uh in in in one of our projects trying to look for a small cast n uh we thought let's look at the evolutionary origin of where Cai came from and by tracing the The evolutionary history of casai we found that there is a very large family protein called iscb um that is um

[01:25:54] The ancestral form of cine ISB is a very small protein it's only about 450 mes uh so it's about a third of the size of casai and it does exactly what casai does it's got a hilas activity it's got nucleus domains and it also works with the RNA guide to recognize and cleave DNA but what is different between iscb and C 9 is that the guide RNA for iscb is much much larger so you Peter and you got a paypa exactly and uh and and RNA is not as stable not as robust uh is more prone to degradation yeah you don't want to go any bigger on guide RNA right yeah so you you need the Best of Both Worlds you need uh a cast Associated protein that is small and you want to be able to keep the guide RNA small small right that that's the Holy Grail okay and is it your prediction that that will have to be developed synthetically um I think through engineering um so it's not clear that U such a compact system has been developed by Nature um but but we can start from

[01:27:06] Nature's cast n or iscb as a scaffold and then begin to engineer so so what kind of race is on for that because I can't even fathom the commercial value of that if there was a new protein called the you know C alpha or you know C Omega whatever the synthetic version that was small enough to now easily deliver payload this is a trillion dooll product a lot of people are working on it um I think it's certainly going to be very very useful is the Lion Share of this work being done in universities or is it being done inside of Biotech companies is it it's in both places now yeah is this one of the biggest races going on in crisper biology today I'm not sure this is the biggest race I mean there are there are a lot of other capabilities that we want to realize okay for example how do you insert large genes into the genome precisely and efficiently um I think that is is you know just as important of a problem um cast n even though it's large um we can deliver it um to some cells already and and uh so there's already in Vivo or only in vitro inv Vivo what what cells can be delivered in Vivo using cast 9 currently so liver okay yeah liver is a place where we can use lipid nanop particles to deliver cast n and guide AR into you know the covid vaccine is made using mRNA and lipid nanop particle and and so it's a very similar approach where you formulate uh these uh lipids with the Cai mRNA guide RNA and what is it about the liver that makes it amenable to a lipid nanop particle lipid um there's a lot of lipid recycling happening in the liver and so when we have a lipid and a particle uh they they get Bound by these recycling proteins and they get taken up interesting and this is does it matter the manner in which it's given intravenous intramuscular does it do all lipid nanop particles end up there provided they're not ingested orally and presumably digested a lot of it goes to liver yeah yeah because liver also you know it's one of the areas in our body that filter out all the toxins yeah and uh so so everything gets trapped there so in other words if you were thinking about one of the rare born diseases of metabolism these are the really rare diseases where children are born without you know a particular enzyme that allows them to either metabolize a certain protein or glucose even for that matter um do we think that we're we're on the cusp of being able to use I I don't want to suggest that cast 9 is primitive but in the context of our discussion we've realized it has some limitations but do we think that the crisper cast 9 system is already good enough and sufficient to cure some of those diseases for some of them potentially uh it will depend on the mutation whether or not we can use cast N9 or base editing or prime editing to be able to fix the you have to figure out the payload problem right and yeah yep okay but if it's in the liver and and and it can be addressed by targeting hpat sides in the liver uh then the delivery problem is already uh sort of addressable okay what are what about genetic diseases of the eye that's also a place that's easy to reach and you don't require systemic Administration what are the genetic conditions of the eye that might be amendable to this treatment as it stands today yeah there are different eye diseases um that are affected by uh single G mutations uh for example um LCA 10 is one of the ey diseases that uh there's already been a clinic uh crisper uh uh strategy being developed for uh the way that these diseases in the eye are treated is by designing uh cast n and a guide RNA to be able to uh sort of knock out the gene that is causing uh degenerative conditions in the eye and then using a viral Vector to deliver the castai gene uh and also the guide RNA intraocularly uh into into the patient and um and so once the virus gets into the cells in the eye they will make has n they'll make the guide RNA and then and then uh and that will carry out the modification so in that sense it's a bit of the old meets the new right you're taking the oldest trick in the book that was the original original gene therapy vehicle the virus and you're combining it with a far smarter payload which is C9 and guard guide RNA right how how are those where are those where do these stand in clinical trials right now both the liver and the eye which would obviously be the you know Leading Edge of this yeah so so the I is the first place where um uh in the US a gene therapy was developed and approved and so this is a drug called luxtera and luxtera uh puts a gene into to the eye to be able to treat a disease called LCA 2 and um and uh and and so basically the virus uh provides a gene that is uh Missing in the in the cells in the eye and that is able to allow uh the patients to regain some life sensitivity and so that was the first gene therapy and these are patients that are completely blind without it that's right and then how how much light sensitivity do they get once this Gene is inserted they get some so that they can kind of move around in a room with large obstacles wow yeah and and this is all done just through a single injection in the eye a single injection wow what are other ocular targets so LCA 10 is another one U that is uh that was being developed by editas medicine and uh in the way this disease uh is sort of uh um sort of developed is that there is a mutation that causes degeneration uh in the eye and the idea is to use C9 uh use the same viral Vector system to deliver into the eye and have C9 inactivate this uh this mutant Gene so that it can uh slow down or stop degeneration so lca2 you have to put an active Gene in that was missing right LCA was it 9 or 12 10 you have to deactivate a gene correct that's right okay and how where is that in clinical trials what phase is that in so it went through phase one two okay uh I think there was there was some what was the efficacy in phase two there was some efficacy um in what's the phenotype of this patient without gene therapy is it total blindness as well also blindness or or deteriorating

[01:33:36] Vision so blind by what age um probably 30s okay wow and and then what did the phase two find how much eyesight were they able to restore uh they found that there's some improving Vision um but but but I think it wasn't as robust as they had H for okay um why do you think that is why do you think that these therapies are not fully restoring Vision in the case of uh the the LCA 2 is it because by the time you treat these people the neuroplasticity part of it has lost its window of development in other words is the problem that if you treat these people late in life the part of the brain that receives the visual signal isn't developed or is it literally that we're just not fixing it's in the Rea um you know the retina doesn't regenerate and so you have to be able to um to deal with if it's already degenerating you have to deal with what is what is left in the Rea and so what you can restore is really capped by whatever that's already left there and uh and and plus there's also inefficiencies in the

[01:34:47] Delivery Systems you're not restoring 100% of the cells uh and then if you're layering on Gene editing on top of it which also has some sort of less than 100% efficiency when you multiply that all together uh that's why you're not getting um s full restoration so what would have to be true to fully restore

[01:35:09] Vision in those patients what what set of things would have to be true therapeutically I think it's going be very hard to fly restore Vision um if uh so if you really want to fully restore Vision you probably have to regenerate uh the retina uh so you have to replenish cells that are missing could that be done epigenetically what do we know about the epig Genome of the retina in the adult versus the infant and and is do we do we know that if we could simultaneously or even in two treatments right correct the genetic defect but then return the epig genome to the milu of embryo genis or early life could that fix the problem that could potentially work although this is not my expertise so I don't know um of the processes involved there U but if you can recapitulate development in the eye uh and and allow cells to sort of redevelop the retina uh as it was developing during development um then potentially uh you can you can regenerate the eye on the side of the liver what has been the success rate of um of the C9 delivery system there or the lipid nanoparticle delivering the cine payload to be more exact the liver is quite quite robust uh you can probably get 80 90% uh in the liver and that's sufficient to correct certainly any underexpression right right right um in the liver there's also a interesting development where um SST are trying to Target a gene called pcsk9 to be able to treat uh cardiovascular disease and the idea there is so they're going to use a lipid nanoparticle to put into you're going to put in a new pcsk9 Gene that's inactive or you're just going to deliver a vehicle that paralyzes pcsk9 yeah the strategy is to paralyze pcsk9 so that you can inactive AP pcsk9 and then reduce chestal any idea how much a treatment like that would cost um I don't know I I think um initially maybe tens of thousand dollars well I mean to be honest that would be really cheap because the drug that inhibits pcsk9 inhibitor and there are three of them out there right you know these are when they came out they were $155,000 a year drugs now they're $6,000 a year drugs um and yeah so call it $10,000 a year as the current drug cost so you're saying that maybe $50,000 or oh it might be that much more okay again still relatively inexpensive compared to to to the whole thing to a lifetime of therapy um but are they trying I mean is there any particular reason it costs that much if you actually just look at the drug and don't try to bake in the cost of the last 10 years of developing it in other words if a company to if a company today came along and said I'm interested in developing a drug that one andone treats pcsk9 and lowers LDL cholesterol indefinitely how much would it actually cost to make that drug under GMP conditions at scale yeah I don't know the exact exact cost of good um but it it's probably much lower than that um but um in order to get to that uh we need to get the processes developed and and so I think over time we we're definitely going to be able to uh get down uh the cost um you know Mr Large

[01:38:51] Scale mRNA production large formulation of nanop particles I think those are the processes that that people are making really good progress on so what is driving the cost right now what is making it expensive today I think there are a lot of factors um including development cost and also the fact that these drugs is is the first time uh developing these modalities of drugs and so the manufacturing processes are need to get developed um and um and and what specifically is it is it that we're now

[01:39:29] I mean presumably we're just making synthetic cast 9 and cast 13 all day long right and in the laboratory at laboratory scale I see but commercially not right okay well I mean so you make your own cast 9 and cast 13 in your lab we do okay yeah we do you can Al you can also buy it from commercial companies but scale is usually for laboratory use uh if you think about a mouse is 10 G a human can be you know 40 kilog so so that that's you know thousand times larger uh in in body weight so you need a thousand times more material um and and I think it's developing the process to scale that to that level to be able to treat human beings and that is where the the expensive process is is there any um foundational roadblock to doing this or is it simply just more like you know if we think about again like a is there a Mo's law aspect to this where it's just going to get significantly cheaper over time in the same way that uh transistors just get significantly cheaper over time um I'm not an expert on this U but but I think there there will definitely be uh efficiencies from scale um enatic processes for making these rnas uh is getting much better um

[01:40:50] Purity is is improving uh so all those things I think uh they will compound and and that will result in significant cost reduction how much do you uh follow slay attention to um sort of the the regulation of Gene editing um I know that gosh sometime in the last six seven years there was a very controversial case in China with a scientist who had it seemed somewhat nefariously from my reading of the story um uh edited the embryos of kids to render them on the surface this sounds like a great idea but rendered them um immune to HIV and I believe one of their parents was HIV positive this was an IVF case but it turned out that there was an enormous amount of backlash from the scientific and medical community because

[01:41:50] I guess one he did it without the full consent the commun and also the Bel that you actually didn't the risk of transmission of HIV was quite low to the child in the first place can you say more about that case in particular and then also what the current state of um of of the of genetic uh manipulation is from a sort of ethical legal standpoint right so so this was back in 2018 um there um so so so there was a there was a couple uh who wanted to have children uh the father was HIV positive and so they wanted to make sure that their uh children uh are not hi are not infected by HIV and um and so so scientists um uh made a mutation uh in the embryos um that is a gene in called called ccr5 and uh and and this A ccr5 mutation is an actually occurring mutation in the human population single digit % of individuals carry this mutation and uh and these individuals are naturally immune to HIV infection because they don't have the Magic Johnson mutation right they don't have this specific protein on the surface to allow HIV to bind and enter the cell um and so the scientist edited the embryo uh human embryo um to remove this PC uh this ccr5 uh Gene but it turned out that that edit wasn't complete um like earlier we talking about mosaicism uh so the result of his edit was actually two girls who were mosaics uh for the ccr5 mutation and so anyway so the editing happened and the embryos were um were implanted in the mother and carried to term and so two baby girls were born um and uh and when the genetics of these baby girls were analyzed it um it turned out that they were highly Mosaic uh suggesting that editing wasn't very efficient and the edit was done at how many cells in theory was it one I don't know exactly how many cells but very early on post post feralization but to have guaranteed no mosaicism would this edit would you need to do this edit at a single cell and then proliferate only that cell and discard the rest of the blasti sites right that that in theory that's the way to do it and do we know what this person did uh I don't know exactly uh how much of the technical details were released okay so these girls are born Mosaic but what's their phenotype with respect to CCR five so they are so so some of their immune cells have ccr5 and some don't uh so so that means that they can be infected by

[01:44:42] HIV uh for those cells that are CCF positive but it probably means that they'll never die of AIDS because they will always maintain a population of tea cells that are not susceptible uh meaning they'll never get they they could be HIV infected but they'll never have a t- cell level that falls so low that they're maybe yeah yeah their CD4 count gets below whatever the threshold is for

[01:45:06] AIDS right okay but the world really responded harshly to this correct correct that's right okay so what was the what was the Fallout for this scientist so the the reason that there was a huge back Clash is because there really wasn't any there was no medical need to do this correct yeah that's right it's not justified yeah um and uh and so so um so so scientific and Al also medical community U Were were really um sort of um uh they they everyone vo their concern about this ethical issue that that just occurred and uh and I think the scientist was put under house arrest um for a while and uh and and this incident also uh really motivated much more um sort of ethical uh discussions around gen editing there was ethical discussion before but but it really sort of focused the issue and uh there were multiple working groups that were established uh multinational working groups uh between the different national emies uh us China

[01:46:14] UK uh as well as um the wo had uh several working groups um and uh and I think in the US there is legal regulation um that prevents germ line modification uh but uh but it's certainly not the case uh internationally and so what do you think is being worked on outside of the US in places where there's no regulation with respect to germline mutation so for example are people trying to basically say look we're going to get rid of apoe4 isopor and make it apoe3 or two isopor I mean what is the extent or ambition of people are we going to delete LPA genes so that there's no LP little a phenotype I mean you could make a case that a lot of these things would unidirectionally improve human health um what what are people working on and then let's talk a little bit about the ethics yeah I I don't know what is happening internationally because um there there isn't you know people are not publicizing uh their work but I think what is known is that there is international consensus that we don't want to do these types of embryo uh germine editing um right now even for things where it really matters so the apoe4 and the LPA don't you know you don't have to do that but what about

[01:47:41] Huntington what about inborn eras of metabolism where children are going to probably die during infancy cystic fibrosis things for which we have no viable treatments right is the international consensus still that this type of Gene editing will not be pursued I think there's a lot of discussion going on so so it's certainly not a settled issue U but what I think scientists have all come to terms with is that the technology still needs much more validation and development U before is ready for application uh in this germine editing setting uh the efficiency the specificity both need to be um optimized further um in order for for there to be any chance of um a a germine therapy having um the pred the intended effect yeah and how much of that do you think is the main reason for the hesitation here versus the slippery slope argument which says yes of course those applications are absolutely worth pursuing but if we do that how far far are we from doing apoe4 which may be a little bit gray and then what about I you know identifying genes that are frankly not remotely related to lifespan or medical necessity but instead relate to kind of the stuff that people talk about in science fiction hey this is a gene that might make my kid a little bit taller this is a gene that relates to intelligence or some other physical characteristic that is completely relevant to their health I mean how which of is it more about this is dangerous we don't know how to do it or even if we figure this out we don't want to open up a Pandora's Box I think this is very much the debate that's happening right now um you know there are patient groups who are advocates for using this uh using gene editing in a germline setting to treat disease assuming the technology is safe and efficacious then then you know we should we should do it because it will alleviate suffering uh so there is that argument there are also people arguing the slippery slope argument which is if we allow for X and

[01:50:01] Y then eventually we're going to be um you know getting into Uncharted territories with designer babies and so forth so that is very much the debate that's happening um and I think while that debate is happening uh I think it's important to recognize that science is also progressing other fronts uh there are likely uh Advan es in science that will achieve the same uh outcome without having to edit the genes and so all those things I think are a competition with each other in the ethical debate and uh and and that's why this is such a complicated issue you're one of three or four people on the planet who not only know more about this technology but have been personally responsible for it um as such I can't imagine you get to sit quiet quietly during these debates um even though you're not an ethicist or a philosopher I'm sure people want to understand what you think so how do you think about this not from a technical standpoint which we'll continue to talk about in a minute but from an ethical standpoint right where do you think the line should be drawn um in what we as uh a scientific or medical community permit with respect to Gene editing in The Germ line um you which is obviously the area where we're I guess we should have made that point a little more clear at the outset we're talking about making an edit that will persist in perpetuity yeah I've thought about this issue a lot and um I I think the the things that are are very easy to to agree on um is that if there is a obvious and uh an important medical benefit U so especially for imor errors and metabolis

[01:51:52] ISM or other non-tic mutations if the technology is there I I think is you know it's something that that is definitely doable and and I think it's okay to to um to improve the lives of those patients is that is that a mainstream view or do you think that there is still a lot in the establishment who have not come around to that yet because of this slippery slope argument there are certainly people who have not come around to that okay um and I think when making decisions like that when making a medical decis decision like that it's also important to consider what other alternative methods uh there may be yeah uh for example pre-implantation genetic testing is another method where um you might be able to screen out embryos that that that have those mutation which for

[01:52:39] IVF we certainly can obviously for IVF all of those diseases can be checked right um right so then it gets to maybe a more complicated question which is is there a role for genetic engineering within um well within in utero for example yeah um or is that just so technically challenging that it's much easier to focus on just the IVF side of things so certainly on the disease treatment monogenic geneity disorder IVF

[01:53:12] I think that that is probably the most likely application um further down the road um there are some obst obstacles to solve one with really understand biology enough so if you wanted to make your kid you know 30 IQ points smarter nobody knows how to do that really know how to do that and so the biology needs to catch up yeah but I do think that as Society continues to develop if the science is there and the technology is also there I think people will opt to um to do that uh and of course you consider whether or not there are other sorry meaning let's just assume and by the way I think this is personally you know F my view is I think these problems are way harder than people think I think these polygenic nuanced traits like intelligence athletic performance resilience happiness all of those things

[01:54:11] I think are infinitely more complicated than we believe and probably just as environmental as they are genetic so even if you give somebody the right genetic template if they're not in the right environmental uh surrounding they won't necessarily even develop the way you hope absolutely and you you you might give somebody 30 more IQ points it doesn't translate to a person being demonstrably more intelligent if they aren't in the right environment um so that that's my prediction is that that stuff is way way way harder and the biology yeah is complicated it's it's it's it's more but it's more complicated than anybody on the that that any lay person is thinking about and and also another thing is um you know biology has a lot of compensation right you might make some mutations that make the person smarter but that could also increase cancer risk right or or or impair athletic capability yeah U or or you know make a person live shorter um you know those are those complicated trade-offs are things that I think people maybe don't fully appreciate yeah for me it's it's I don't know I I think there's a reason I'm not an ethicist because I tend to think about things quite things seem much more obvious to me sometimes which means I'm probably not a nuanced enough thinker on these on these regards but you know when it comes to a disease that's going to kill you with no other treatment it seems like a no-brainer right genetic uh editing and and genetic engineering um should absolutely be considered a part of the equation at the other end of the spectrum when it things when we're talking about things that are truly

[01:55:57] Superfluous uh like intelligence height athletic performance eye color any sort of trait those seem clearly like a horrible reason not for the um ethical reasons like well what does that say about disparity I forget all that it's the reasons you just said we have no idea how complicated the system is if you're going to take a huge risk uh there has to be a huge payoff and the asymmetry of that strikes me as too much and then there's the gray area and and and I guess on the gray area I do feel a bit nuanced right which is should we just get rid of LPA genes well maybe but then to your point we have anti sensolo nucleotide Inhibitors that are just around the corner that effectively will get rid of LP little a they shut the gene off so why would we risk trying to iate this from the population when we can just give you a drug that does the same thing with fewer side effects and less permanence right right exactly or or you can do it not in the germ line but but just in the somatic cells yeah um and that that could also be beneficial and then there's yet the other area which is look at something like autism autism is genetic disease despite what many people will have you believe um but the the heritability of autism is so high that we we know it's um largely a genetic disease but very polygenic very subject to other things and you know do we really want to get rid of it I don't know maybe I mean certainly when you see a child that's devastated by autism who's nonverbal um you know who's harming themselves it would be a very logical thing to say but when you start to move further from that end of the spectrum towards the end of the SP where people are quite functional with autism you might say well I don't know it actually comes with right some some benefits as well and and do we want to create a homogeneous society where everybody is the same this to me is a bit this to me the of sophistication yeah yeah right whether it be mood because that diversity is important yeah um you know for for the human race as a whole that diversity is is you know what what will will allow the human race to be resilient in the long run so I want to talk a little bit about kind of your your story going back so you you grew up in China you came to the middle of the country right where did you grow up yeah

[01:58:36] I grew up in Iowa so I moved to De Mo Iowa when I was 11 years old what brought your parents here uh my mother came to the US first uh she was a exchange scholar uh in computer science and um and she she had a chance to visit uh one of the school schools in Iowa and she saw that the educational system in

[01:58:56] Iowa was much more Hands-On as opposed to Jo memorization and uh and because of that uh she thought I would maybe benefit more from that type of instruction so she decided to uh to uh stay in the US and and uh and immigrate here and when did you start to become aware of your uh your your your intellectual abilities for lack of a better term I mean was it was there a was it just was school always so easy for you were you sort of breezing through high school acing every test put in front of you or or what what was it like I I don't think

[01:59:34] I'm all that smart um I think um I I I've always been interested in science I've always been very curious um so I think I've just always kind of followed my my curiosity uh to do something that that is enjoyable and fun um I think um uh what what is really interesting is I um I didn't like biology at all uh you preferred physics and chemistry and maths math it was more logical um predict um things that I can understand and build a mental model for and then be able to predict things biology was very much J memorization uh so when I first moved to

[02:00:15] Iowa um in seven seventh grade there was life science in middle school and uh I remember it was really about memorizing trees and dissecting frogs and identifying anatomical Parts uh it wasn't so much sort of um based on logic yep it was during seventh grade um that I attended a Saturday enrichment class uh it was on molecular biology um I didn't know what molecular uh what what what what biology had to do with molecular things so I went to it and in that class that's when I started to learn about the advances in Modern

[02:00:53] Biology uh the teacher was very passionate he taught us about DNA RNA protein essential Dogma uh but he also uh had us do fun experiments like um extracting DNA from strawberries and putting a antibiotic resistance resistance gene into a bacteria so that it can survive on osin and uh he also at the same time showed us this I call it a documentary but it's actually a

[02:01:21] Hollywood movie called Jurassic Park um because think if you if you put yourself uh in my shoes at a time where you're learning all these molecular biology fundamentals jeans splicing all that and then watching Jurassic Park to see all those theories being so tangibly there to make a dinosaur um you know the movie really felt like a documentary but but it was also just so spiring and exciting and um cuz that's about when Jurassic

[02:01:56] Park came out would have been the mid90s yes which is when you were in middle school yeah it was 94 90 yeah and uh so anyway so I saw that and I I became really interested in learning more about molecular biology we also learned about gene therapy in the promise of using uh molecular biology to build rational design medicine uh so so that really captivated my imagination the teacher was amazing his name is Ed pelkington and uh he um was he only the teacher of the enrichment class or did he also have a regular class and he taught in high school or middle school um he was a consultant for the school uh and he was working with kids who are interest in science and technology but he remembered um that both myself and also a few other students were really captivated by molecular biology and so by the time I started 10th grade uh he came to us and he said uh there's this really cool opportunity that you guys may want to take advantage of uh the Ia Methodist

[02:03:00] Medical Center had just opened the gene therapy lab and they have a volunteer program at the hospital and maybe you can you guys can apply and specify that you wanted to volunteer in the gene therapy lab and maybe you get to go there so we applied U me and three other kids and uh and we got admitted to the gene therapy lab um and they taught us how to do experiments uh as you remember the very first experiment I did where the scientist had me put the gene for a jellyfish protein called Green flin protein This Is A protein that makes jellyfish glow and I and uh and I put this gene into a human cancer cell and uh just using an adov virus using just lipid we we wrapped it up with with with a bit of fat and then and then it got absorbed by the cell and um and so I did that the afternoon uh the day before and then the following day I went to the lab and the scientist took me into this dark microscope room where there's there was a beam of blue light coming out of the microscope we put the petri dish with the cells on it and he told me to look into the eyepiece and and I saw a field of green cells that were fresy that had taken up this it looked alien um to me and you were in 10th Grade I was in 10th Grade and and that moment just made me um you know feel so inspired about what we were doing and and this idea that we can use our knowledge to then start to engineer rationally new medicine um and and that from that moment on I thought um science is really cool and I want to uh do more uh experimental science do you ever just reflect on the direction your life took in response to something is seemingly arbitrary as where your parents chose to move your good fortune to be in that enrichment class and then your good fortune to have a very special teacher who not only did this incredible work with you but then stayed as a mentor got you to apply to this program as a sophomore in high school I mean like you know you've I'm I'm sure you've heard the arguments for the remarkable set of circumstances that allowed Bill Gates and Paul Allen to be in the right place at the right time from the right high school that had a computer lab that um took these people who were you know naturally quite brilliant but more importantly put them in an environment where they could sort of Leap Frog ahead of the time I mean do you see a parallel there I think I have been very fortunate um and I think there are a couple of things that I I've over time have developed more and more um gratefulness and appreciation for um number one I think is uh um the importance of teachers um I've been very fortunate that throughout my life I've been um just you know met with many um teachers who care about their students and teacher who really um want to find as many opportunities as possible uh to help their students develop they really care about nurturing the Next Generation and I think having that and having experienced that uh was was really uh a great Fortune of mine the second I think is is really about America I think having been able to immigrate to the US and to go through the American education system um where there's really um a mirror based system where uh you can you can work hard and and be able to um learn and and uh and develop and and uh um have opportunities uh have access opportunities uh I I think that that is uh really special about about America so

[02:06:56] I think education and and having a system where it nurtures um people who want to develop and work hard I think has been really my my great Fortune do you think that had you grown up in China it would have been different not because obviously people in China don't go on to do amazing things it also produces great scientists but you know just again speaking to the randomness of this beautiful situation with this amazing teacher and this program and all of the things that followed do you do you think you could have still stumbled onto the direction you you would have maybe even in a different field I guess what I'm getting at is you're very modest but but obviously you're you're you're very special in what you've done um I I wonder if you think you you would have done great things regardless or do you think that no sometimes you you have to be in the right place at the time I think timing I think fate is important um I think you know there were there was a lot of opportunity in China too um you know China from the 1980s all the way to to now uh has you know developed um you know exponentially um but I don't know where I would have ended up um there were a lot more people in China um things were competitive um and uh and and the education system is different um

[02:08:20] I tend to I like to Tinker with things and in China it's much more memorization based um so so I don't know um but uh but I'm very grateful for having had all of the teachers and opportunities uh here what did you study at Harvard for your undergrad uh I Majed in chemistry and physics and you did that obviously knowing you were interested in genetics but did you feel that you wanted um a greater grounding in the physical sciences because of your ultimate

[02:08:50] Ambitions or why why did you choose that as opposed to you know biology or molecular biology exactly um I I wanted to I I knew I wanted to study biology and and engineer biological systems but I felt that biology was developing so rapidly and new information was uh occuring on a sort of weekly basis with new papers and and uh new cities um that uh it's probably more beneficial if I st something that's that's not going to change uh very much uh from the time that I enrolled in college to the time I graduate uh and so chemistry and physics were much more established fields and it provided a scientific Foundation that I think has been very tremendously helpful uh as I continue to work in biology um and at the same time I I did work outside of um uh classes in a biological lab where I was U you know practicing biological experiments and reading the latest literature um and I thought that was a nice combination and when you selected Stanford for your PhD did you do so because of Carl or was there another reason and then you ultimately after a year or so of classwork found your way into Carl's lab um Carl hasn't started at Stanford yet okay um and so when I was choosing um when I was growing up uh especially after moving to

[02:10:17] Iowa uh I read about people like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and um and uh all the you know internet uh Revolution uh that was happening uh and so I had a special uh feeling about Silicon Valley um I was very intrigued by it and so when I applied The Graduate School I thought uh Stanford and being in silon

[02:10:40] Valley would be a really good place to be um and so I I I made the decision that way how did you then make the decision to go back to the east coast for your for your postto uh back to back to Harvard MIT area as opposed to stay in the Silicon Valley um and pursue your passions there in closer approximation to Industry although of course everybody realizes Boston would clearly be not too far behind the

[02:11:08] Silicon Valley for Biotech Industry um I think at the time it was probably the most interesting opportunity um so i' I've I I should mention that Carl dieras is a phenomenal Mentor uh I've learned a tremendous amount from him not only about doing science but also how to just be a good contributing U member of the scientific

[02:11:31] Community um with sharing of information reents and and and transfer of knowledge to as many people as possible uh and he was also a great mentor where he just gave me opportunity to to try things um so during graduate school um for many months I was working on a biofuel project in Carl's lab um because what year was this this was 2007 2008 okay uh so it was energy crisis oil crisis and the biofuel was was an important thing that's what Alex aravin and I were working at at the exact same time right 2008 and uh and and so around that time

[02:12:09] I thought this was a interesting problem so so I explor that in Carl's lab and uh we thought maybe we could even go and raise venture capital and if we had something um uh working out well but it turned out that um around 2008 the financial crisis also hit and so um a lot of those opportunities at that moment seem to have just vanished um but at that same time I was contacted by someone from the harvor society fellows and uh and they said um we we liked your work as a graduate student uh would you be interested in coming to the S Society fellows and uh and just uh you know explore science uh here um so I I so I thought that was interesting uh they said we'll um give you um a stipan and uh you're not expected to do anything uh specific you can just come and hang out and uh and and think about interesting things uh so so I applied and um and and went there uh and that that's where I started to explore the gene editing um technology so you're you know barely 40 years old um you're one of the most prominent scienti s in your field um do you are you optimistic about the state of science are you um and and I'll point out two things that are negative that you don't need to comment on um because I don't want to put you in hot water but but just sort of there's been a clear attack on meritocracy in the

[02:13:40] United States so a lot of the opportunities that that served you well might not have served you well today they might not have been available to you today for various reasons including your race MH and similarly um I think despite all of the remarkable scientific advances during covid there was also a loss of public faith in science during covid where some of the lines between science and advocacy got blurred greatly um in addition to a whole bunch of other things so in other words I guess what I'm saying is there are a lot of things today that don't look as promising as they did maybe 10 years ago Visa um the field um and and just sort of the the of the art despite those things do you remain as optimistic as ever or do you have concerns I am an optimist I think that's the only way to be because if you're not optimistic then then there's only downside uh when you are like that uh but I am optimistic about science I I'm so excited about all the rapid advances that are happening um knowledge about biology about the human body physiology is accumulating at very rapid pace every week there are interesting exciting discoveries are being reported and our Technologies for studying biological systems are also accelerating with you know sequencing technology development to protein uh

[02:15:06] Mass spectrometry to Gene editing uh to new microscopy um that is allowing us to collect new and more Rich data uh cheaper and faster and then there's AI um with the Advan of AI and larger Computing um platforms uh we can analyze and learn and and build models around those data um that are much more much more powerful and much more uh predict predictive and generative than ever before and that combined with future advances in robotics where we can have automation of experimentation and maybe building a Clos loop system where Ai and and with human intervention can design and iterate our experiments uh rapidly I think it's going to accelerate science and medicine and human health uh beyond our imagination so I think that's really exciting um at the same time I think we need to continue to motivate people's interest in science um we we need to make sure that the best talent are going into science do you worry that we've lost the focus on stem that I mean obviously people talk about the Heyday of science right during the 1960s when kids growing up Saw the space program saw the Cold

[02:16:33] War the best and the brightest wanted to do science they wanted to do engineering um do you do you feel that slipping away and if so what do you think is necessary to bring it back how do we get the absolute best people into stem I think we can do more for sure um I think we need to get kids more excited about science um and I think we need to um we we need an education system to to support um kids who are curious and and uh who have special interests in the science and technical things and and to give them opportunities like the ones that I had to to Really explore those

[02:17:19] Curiosities and interests um when they're young um they are optimistic and they have energy and if we can nurture that and help them maintain that Curiosity and energy I think that's how we get the best people to continue in science yeah I I couldn't agree with you more um and this is not an investment that pays off in a year right you've got to be doing this today and then you'll get your payoff in a decade and two decades right um and sometimes those Investments are really hard for society to make because it's hard to say I got to pay money now for something and I don't get paid back for 10 or 20 years right those are hard things to accept but um I hope that people listening to this podcast appreciate certainly in your case what an enormous value it was for that investment um you know in many ways it's a great story of lots of things it's a story about immigration it's a story about Science Education it's a story about curiosity uh it's a story about the American dream so anyway I'm really glad we finally got a chance to sit down it was absolutely worth the wait um and uh I'm excited to follow your uh undoubted the continued success over the coming decades thank you so much for having me here today [Music]
